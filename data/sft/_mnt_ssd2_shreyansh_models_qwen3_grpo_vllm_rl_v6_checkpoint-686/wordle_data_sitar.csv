- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.
   - O, E are not in the word.

   - R is not in position 1 (confirmed earlier and now again).
   - A is not in position 2.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y.
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - S cannot be in position 3 or 4.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S exactly once each (since duplicates weren’t indicated).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no O, E, P, Y).
- Meets the positional constraints above.

A good candidate is “SARIN”:
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (but earlier feedback says A is not in position 2) – oops, that violates the constraint.

Next candidate: “SANTI” – but I is not ruled out, but let’s check constraints:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- A in position 2 (no, A cannot be in 2).

Candidate: “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N.
- Contains R, A, but not S – violates requirement.

Candidate: “STARS”:
- S, T, A, R, S – has S twice, but we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in position 4 is disallowed. And A in 3 is ok, but R in 2 is disallowed.

Candidate: “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H.
- Contains R, A, S.
- Positions:
  - C (new letter, ok).
  - R in 2 – disallowed (from both guesses).

- S, C, R, A, N.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 (ok).
  - C (new, ok).
  - R in 3 (ok, not 1 or 2).
  - A in 4 (ok, not 1 or 2).
  - N (new, ok).
- Contains S, R, A as required.

This seems valid and tests new letters C and N while placing R, A, S in allowed positions.

Letters in the word but not yet positioned:

Letters not in the word:

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 5.
We must place R somewhere in 2 or 5 (since 3 is disallowed for R), and we need two more letters that are not in the excluded set.

Possible remaining letters (excluding O, E, P, Y, C, N and using only once each since duplicates not indicated):
Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.
Common vowels: I, U (since A is already placed, and E, O are out).

We need two more letters plus R. Let’s try to pick common ones.

We have positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, S, but not O or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A, R, S (and possibly adds another common consonant or vowel).
2. Avoids O and E.
3. Places A, R, S in new positions to test their correct spots.

A good candidate is “RASPY”:
- R in position 1 (was in position 2 before, so new spot).
- A in position 2 (was in position 1 before, so new spot).
- S in position 3 (was in position 4 before, so new spot).
- Adds P and Y, which are common consonants and a possible ending vowel.

This should help determine the correct positions of A, R, S and test P/Y.

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.
   - O, E are not in the word.

2. RASPY → R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is not in position 1 (confirmed earlier and now again).
   - A is not in position 2.
   - S is not in position 3.
   - P, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y.
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - S cannot be in position 3 or 4.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S exactly once each (since duplicates weren’t indicated).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no O, E, P, Y).
- Meets the positional constraints above.

A good candidate is “SARIN”:
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (but earlier feedback says A is not in position 2) – oops, that violates the constraint.

Next candidate: “SANTI” – but I is not ruled out, but let’s check constraints:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- A in position 2 (no, A cannot be in 2).

Candidate: “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N.
- Contains R, A, but not S – violates requirement.

Candidate: “STARS”:
- S, T, A, R, S – has S twice, but we don’t know if S appears twice. Also S in position 4 is disallowed. And A in 3 is ok, but R in 2 is disallowed.

Candidate: “CRASH”:
- C, R, A, S, H.
- Contains R, A, S.
- Positions:
  - C (new letter, ok).
  - R in 2 – disallowed (from both guesses).
  
Candidate: “SCRAN”:
- S, C, R, A, N.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 (ok).
  - C (new, ok).
  - R in 3 (ok, not 1 or 2).
  - A in 4 (ok, not 1 or 2).
  - N (new, ok).
- Contains S, R, A as required.
- No O, E, P, Y.

This seems valid and tests new letters C and N while placing R, A, S in allowed positions.

So my next guess is “SCRAN”.

Let's parse the new feedback on STAIR:

S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3 (we already know it's correct in position 4, so this is consistent).  
I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4 (position 4 is A, so this is fine).  
R(✓) – R is correct in position 5.

So the word pattern is now:
1: S
2: ?
3: ?
4: A
5: R

Letters we know must appear somewhere:
- T (not in position 2)
- I (not in position 4)

Letters already used: S, A, R.

Letters excluded so far: O, E, P, Y, C, N.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the remaining pool. The remaining letters (excluding the excluded ones and the ones already placed) are:
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus T and I which we know are in the word).

Since T must be in the word but not in position 2, T must be in position 3.  
That leaves position 2 to be filled by another letter, and position 3 must be T.

So the word structure is:
S _ T A R

Now we need a letter for position 2 that is not in the excluded set and is not already used (S, T, A, R). Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ T A R:
- SCART – C is excluded.
- SHIRT – I is already in the word (but we have S H I T A R, which would place I in position 3, but position 3 must be T. Doesn't fit.)
- SLATE – L is allowed, but E is excluded.
- SPURT – P is excluded.
- STERT – Not a valid word.
- SWART – W is allowed, but ""SWART"" is archaic.

Actually, the only common word that fits S _ T A R is ""SHIRT"" if we consider the letters correctly. Wait, no - ""SHIRT"" would be S H I R T, but we have A in position 4, so that's not matching.

Wait, our structure is S _ _ A R with T and I in the remaining positions. Since T must be in position 3 (as it can't be in position 2), and I must be in position 2 (as it can't be in position 4), the word becomes:

S I T A R

""SI T A R"" – but that's not a valid English word. 

Wait, let's re-examine:
We have positions 2 and 3 to fill. T must be in the word (not in position 2), so T must be in position 3. I must be in the word (not in position 4), so I must be in position 2. Thus the word is S I T A R.

But ""SITAR"" is a valid English word (a stringed instrument). Let me check:
- S in 1: ✓
- I in 2: allowed (not excluded)
- T in 3: allowed (and required)
- A in 4: ✓
- R in 5: ✓

All constraints satisfied.
