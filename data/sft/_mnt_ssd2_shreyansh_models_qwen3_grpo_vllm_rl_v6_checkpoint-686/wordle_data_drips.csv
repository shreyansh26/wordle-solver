### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically use frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these high-frequency letters.

A good balance would be ""AROSE"" - it uses 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), all of which appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) – x → not in the word
- R (2nd letter) – ✓ → R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd)
- O (3rd letter) – x → not in the word
- S (4th letter) – - → S is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E (5th letter) – x → not in the word

So we know:
- 2nd letter is R
- S is somewhere in the word but not 4th
- A, O, E are excluded

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and S somewhere else (positions 1,3, or 5). Also, avoid A, O, E.

Good consonants left: S, T, L, N, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s try a word like “TRIPS”:
- T (1st) – possible
- R (2nd) – matches ✓
- I (3rd) – possible
- P (4th) – possible
- S (5th) – satisfies S is in word but not in 4th position

This gives us coverage of T, I, P as new letters to test.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - S exists but is not in position 4.
   - A, O, E are not in the word.

2. TRIPS → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
   - R confirmed in position 2 (already known).
   - I is in position 3.
   - P is in position 4.
   - S is in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ R I P S

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, T.

Possible first letters (common English consonants not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, S, V, W, Y.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in RIPS:  
- BRIPS – not a valid English word.  
- CRIPS – valid (slang for gangsters).  
- DRIPS – valid.  
- FRIPS – not valid.  
- GRIPS – valid.  
- PRIPS – not valid.  
- TRIPS – already guessed.

The most common and likely correct word is “DRIPS” or “GRIPS”. Between these, “DRIPS” is slightly more common.

Therefore, I’ll guess DRIPS.
