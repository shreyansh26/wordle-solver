For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. Common starting strategies include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Including common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoiding repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives good coverage of common letters in various positions.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen only from the still-allowed set, and the whole word must be valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. Common starting strategies include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Including common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoiding repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives good coverage of common letters in various positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked “x,” so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters.  
Next guess should:
- Avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
- Still cover a fresh set of high-frequency letters to maximize new information.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A balanced word that uses none of the eliminated letters and includes several common ones is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these were in SLATE, and together they hit five distinct high-frequency letters.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions: O (from position 2) and N (from position 4).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and N (but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4).
- Does **not** contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.

Remaining common letters to test: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the known O and N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and N in new positions.
2. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.
3. Maximizes new information by introducing several fresh letters.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- Letters: C, H, I, N, K – all allowed so far.
- Positions: N is in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so this would be invalid.

Next candidate: “PINKY”
- Letters: P, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- Positions: N is in position 3 (new position), O is not used, but we already know O is in the word somewhere else.

But we know O must be present, so we need a word that includes O and N, and only allowed letters.

Candidate: “WONKY”
- W, O, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so invalid.

Candidate: “COIGN”
- C, O, I, G, N – but this seems obscure.

Candidate: “GONIF”
- G, O, N, I, F – but F is less common.

Candidate: “MONEY”
- M, O, N, E, Y – but E is eliminated.

Candidate: “HONEY”
- H, O, N, E, Y – E is eliminated.

Candidate: “PONCY”
- P, O, N, C, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Candidate: “CONIC”
- C, O, N, I, C – but C is repeated, and O is in position 2 (invalid).

Candidate: “NINNY”
- N is repeated, but we don’t know if N is allowed twice.

Let’s try “PINKO”:
- P, I, N, K, O – all allowed.
- Positions: N is in position 3 (new), O is in position 5 (new), no conflicts.

This seems valid and introduces new letters P, I, K, O, N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, P, K, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓) and their positions:
- O is in position 5 (✓ from every guess since it appeared and stayed green)
- I and N both appeared green in PINKO but turned yellow in CHINO, meaning they are in the word but NOT in the positions we tried for them.

Positions we have tried so far:
- Position 2: I was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so I cannot be in position 2.
- Position 3: N was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so N cannot be in position 3.
- Position 5: O is confirmed green.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ O, and it must contain both I and N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but:
- I cannot be in position 2
- N cannot be in position 3

We still need to test positions for I and N. Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word ending in O that uses I and N in allowable positions.

Possible patterns:  
- I in 1, N in 2 → I N _ _ O  
- I in 1, N in 4 → I _ _ N O  
- I in 3, N in 1,2,4 → N _ I _ O, N _ _ I O, N _ _ _ O (but N can’t be in 3)  
- I in 4, N in 1,2,3 → N _ _ I O, _ N _ I O, _ _ N I O

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D,P,K,C,H).

From the remaining letters: B, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known I, N, O).

Scanning possibilities:
- I N _ _ O: “INBOX” – but X is allowed, and INBOX is a valid word.  
- I _ _ N O: “IMINO” – not a valid word.  
- N _ I _ O: “NIXIO” – not valid.  
- N _ _ I O: “NIMBO” – not valid.  
- _ N _ I O: “GNIOI” – not valid.  
- _ _ N I O: “VINGO” – not valid.  
- _ _ I N O: “MIGNO” – not valid.  

The only valid word fitting the constraints is “INBOX”.

Let’s verify:
- Ends with O (✓)  
- Contains I and N (✓)  
- I is in position 1 (new position, not 2)  
- N is in position 2 (new position, not 3)  
- All letters used are still allowed (I, N, B, X, O) – none were in the banned list.

Therefore, “INBOX” is the optimal next guess.

Positions we have tried so far:
- Position 2: I was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so I cannot be in position 2.
- Position 3: N was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so N cannot be in position 3.
- Position 5: O is confirmed green.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ O, and it must contain both I and N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but:
- I cannot be in position 2
- N cannot be in position 3

We still need to test positions for I and N. Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word ending in O that uses I and N in allowable positions.

Possible patterns:  
- I in 1, N in 2 → I N _ _ O  
- I in 1, N in 4 → I _ _ N O  
- I in 3, N in 1,2,4 → N _ I _ O, N _ _ I O, N _ _ _ O (but N can’t be in 3)  
- I in 4, N in 1,2,3 → N _ _ I O, _ N _ I O, _ _ N I O

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D,P,K,C,H).

From the remaining letters: B, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known I, N, O).

Scanning possibilities:
- I N _ _ O: “INBOX” – but X is allowed, and INBOX is a valid word.  
- I _ _ N O: “IMINO” – not a valid word.  
- N _ I _ O: “NIXIO” – not valid.  
- N _ _ I O: “NIMBO” – not valid.  
- _ N _ I O: “GNIOI” – not valid.  
- _ _ N I O: “VINGO” – not valid.  
- _ _ I N O: “MIGNO” – not valid.  

The only valid word fitting the constraints is “INBOX”.

Let’s verify:
- Ends with O (✓)  
- Contains I and N (✓)  
- I is in position 1 (new position, not 2)  
- N is in position 2 (new position, not 3)  
- All letters used are still allowed (I, N, B, X, O) – none were in the banned list.

Therefore, “INBOX” is the optimal next guess.",Guess 5: INBOX -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) B(x) O(-) X(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. Common starting strategies include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
2. Including common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. Avoiding repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives good coverage of common letters in various positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked “x,” so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters.  
Next guess should:
- Avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
- Still cover a fresh set of high-frequency letters to maximize new information.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A balanced word that uses none of the eliminated letters and includes several common ones is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these were in SLATE, and together they hit five distinct high-frequency letters.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
- Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions: O (from position 2) and N (from position 4).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and N (but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4).
- Does **not** contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.

Remaining common letters to test: C, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the known O and N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and N in new positions.
2. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.
3. Maximizes new information by introducing several fresh letters.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- Letters: C, H, I, N, K – all allowed so far.
- Positions: N is in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so this would be invalid.

Next candidate: “PINKY”
- Letters: P, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- Positions: N is in position 3 (new position), O is not used, but we already know O is in the word somewhere else.

But we know O must be present, so we need a word that includes O and N, and only allowed letters.

Candidate: “WONKY”
- W, O, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (but feedback says O is not in position 2), so invalid.

Candidate: “COIGN”
- C, O, I, G, N – but this seems obscure.

Candidate: “GONIF”
- G, O, N, I, F – but F is less common.

Candidate: “MONEY”
- M, O, N, E, Y – but E is eliminated.

Candidate: “HONEY”
- H, O, N, E, Y – E is eliminated.

Candidate: “PONCY”
- P, O, N, C, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Candidate: “CONIC”
- C, O, N, I, C – but C is repeated, and O is in position 2 (invalid).

Candidate: “NINNY”
- N is repeated, but we don’t know if N is allowed twice.

Let’s try “PINKO”:
- P, I, N, K, O – all allowed.
- Positions: N is in position 3 (new), O is in position 5 (new), no conflicts.

This seems valid and introduces new letters P, I, K, O, N.

Current known facts:

Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, P, K  
Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:  
- I is in position 2  
- N is in position 3  
- O is in position 5  

So the pattern so far is: _ I N _ O

Remaining unused common letters (from the “high-frequency but not yet tested” pool):  
C, G, H, M, V, W, Y, plus the already-used O, I, N.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen only from the still-allowed set, and the whole word must be valid.

Candidate words fitting _ I N _ O:

- CHINO (but C and H are allowed, but is CHINO a valid 5-letter word? Yes, short for “chinoise” or refers to a type of fabric.)
- GINO_ – but we need a 5-letter word ending in O.
- HINGO – valid (a variant spelling of “hinge” or a surname)
- MINCO – not a standard word
- VINCO – not a standard word
- WINGO – valid (a surname or “winged” as slang)

Among these, “CHINO” and “HINGO” are both valid. “CHINO” uses C and H, both still allowed. “HINGO” uses H and G, both allowed. Both are equally valid guesses, but “CHINO” is more common.

Let’s go with CHINO.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, P, K, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓) and their positions:
- O is in position 5 (✓ from every guess since it appeared and stayed green)
- I and N both appeared green in PINKO but turned yellow in CHINO, meaning they are in the word but NOT in the positions we tried for them.

Positions we have tried so far:
- Position 2: I was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so I cannot be in position 2.
- Position 3: N was green in PINKO (✓) but yellow in CHINO (✗), so N cannot be in position 3.
- Position 5: O is confirmed green.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ O, and it must contain both I and N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but:
- I cannot be in position 2
- N cannot be in position 3

We still need to test positions for I and N. Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word ending in O that uses I and N in allowable positions.

Possible patterns:  
- I in 1, N in 2 → I N _ _ O  
- I in 1, N in 4 → I _ _ N O  
- I in 3, N in 1,2,4 → N _ I _ O, N _ _ I O, N _ _ _ O (but N can’t be in 3)  
- I in 4, N in 1,2,3 → N _ _ I O, _ N _ I O, _ _ N I O

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D,P,K,C,H).

From the remaining letters: B, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known I, N, O).

Scanning possibilities:
- I N _ _ O: “INBOX” – but X is allowed, and INBOX is a valid word.  
- I _ _ N O: “IMINO” – not a valid word.  
- N _ I _ O: “NIXIO” – not valid.  
- N _ _ I O: “NIMBO” – not valid.  
- _ N _ I O: “GNIOI” – not valid.  
- _ _ N I O: “VINGO” – not valid.  
- _ _ I N O: “MIGNO” – not valid.  

The only valid word fitting the constraints is “INBOX”.

Let’s verify:
- Ends with O (✓)  
- Contains I and N (✓)  
- I is in position 1 (new position, not 2)  
- N is in position 2 (new position, not 3)  
- All letters used are still allowed (I, N, B, X, O) – none were in the banned list.

Therefore, “INBOX” is the optimal next guess.

Let's summarize what we know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, P, K, C, H, B, X

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
- O is in the word and must be in position 5 (it appeared green in guess 3 and guess 5, and was yellow in guess 4 but still present).

Known positions:
- Position 5: O (✓)

Known letters that must appear elsewhere:
- I and N (both appeared green in guess 3 but turned yellow in subsequent guesses, so they are in the word but not in the positions tested so far).

Positions tested for I and N:
- I was in position 2 (guess 3) and position 1 (guess 5) - cannot be in 1 or 2
- N was in position 3 (guess 3) and position 2 (guess 4) - cannot be in 2 or 3

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ O, and must contain I and N in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- I in 3, N in 4 → _ I N _ O
- I in 4, N in 3 → _ N I _ O (but N can't be in 3)
- N in 1, I in 3 or 4 → N _ I _ O or N _ _ I O
- N in 4, I in 3 → _ I N 4 (but N can't be in 3)

From the remaining letters (not yet banned): F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in O with I and N in positions 1,3,4:

Possible candidates:
- N I _ _ O: ""NINIO"" - invalid
- _ I N _ O: ""FINCO"" - C is banned
- ""MINIO"" - valid (small fish or minnow)
- ""VINIO"" - valid (name)
- ""MINGO"" - G is allowed
- ""WINGO"" - G is allowed
- ""MINGO"", ""WINGO"" are both valid

Let's choose ""MINGO"" as it's a common word and uses M, I, N, G, O - all allowed.

Check positions:
- M (new)
- I (position 2 - but I cannot be in position 2 from guess 3 feedback)
Oops, in ""MINGO"" I is in position 2 which is banned. Let's try ""VINIO"":
- V (new)
- I (position 2 - banned) - also banned

""MINIO"":
- M (new)
- I (position 2 - banned) - banned

""WINGO"":
- W (new)
- I (position 3 - allowed)
- N (position 4 - allowed)
- G (new)
- O (position 5 - confirmed)

This fits all constraints.

S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, P, K, C, H, B, X

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
- O is in the word and must be in position 5 (it appeared green in guess 3 and guess 5, and was yellow in guess 4 but still present).

Known positions:
- Position 5: O (✓)

Known letters that must appear elsewhere:
- I and N (both appeared green in guess 3 but turned yellow in subsequent guesses, so they are in the word but not in the positions tested so far).

Positions tested for I and N:
- I was in position 2 (guess 3) and position 1 (guess 5) - cannot be in 1 or 2
- N was in position 3 (guess 3) and position 2 (guess 4) - cannot be in 2 or 3

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ O, and must contain I and N in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- I in 3, N in 4 → _ I N _ O
- I in 4, N in 3 → _ N I _ O (but N can't be in 3)
- N in 1, I in 3 or 4 → N _ I _ O or N _ _ I O
- N in 4, I in 3 → _ I N 4 (but N can't be in 3)

From the remaining letters (not yet banned): F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in O with I and N in positions 1,3,4:

Possible candidates:
- N I _ _ O: ""NINIO"" - invalid
- _ I N _ O: ""FINCO"" - C is banned
- ""MINIO"" - valid (small fish or minnow)
- ""VINIO"" - valid (name)
- ""MINGO"" - G is allowed
- ""WINGO"" - G is allowed
- ""MINGO"", ""WINGO"" are both valid

Let's choose ""MINGO"" as it's a common word and uses M, I, N, G, O - all allowed.

Check positions:
- M (new)
- I (position 2 - but I cannot be in position 2 from guess 3 feedback)
Oops, in ""MINGO"" I is in position 2 which is banned. Let's try ""VINIO"":
- V (new)
- I (position 2 - banned) - also banned

""MINIO"":
- M (new)
- I (position 2 - banned) - banned

""WINGO"":
- W (new)
- I (position 3 - allowed)
- N (position 4 - allowed)
- G (new)
- O (position 5 - confirmed)

This fits all constraints.",Guess 6: WINGO -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(-) O(✓),FAIL
