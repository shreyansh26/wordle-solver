For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at the options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the most common in English words
- It tests positions for these letters simultaneously
- It has no repeating letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

   – P and I are NOT in the word.  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – N and T are in the word but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
- Must contain N and T somewhere other than positions 4 and 5 respectively.  
- Cannot contain A, R, S, E, P, I.  

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains both N and T (but N not in position 4, T not in position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “MOUNT”:
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 4 → but feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (POINT had N in position 4 and it was “-”). So N cannot be in position 4.  
Therefore “MOUNT” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLOUD”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains no N or T → violates requirement.  

Next: “BOUND”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 4 → again violates “N not in position 4”.  

Next: “FOUNT”

- Contains T but not N → violates requirement.  

Next: “DONUT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 5 → but feedback said T is in the word but wrong position (POINT had T in position 5 and it was “-”), so T cannot be in position 5.  
Thus “DONUT” is invalid.

Next: “HOTEL” – contains E (eliminated).

Next: “BONUS” – contains S (eliminated).

Next: “TONIC” – contains I (eliminated).

Next: “GONUT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 5 → again invalid (T cannot be in position 5).

Next: “TONER” – contains R and E (both eliminated).

Next: “TONYL” – Y is allowed, but let’s check letters: T, O, N, Y, L.

- T is in position 5 → but feedback said T is in the word but wrong position (POINT had T in position 5 and it was “-”), so T cannot be in position 5.  
Thus “DONUT” is invalid.

Next: “HOTEL” – contains E (eliminated).

Next: “BONUS” – contains S (eliminated).

Next: “TONIC” – contains I (eliminated).

Next: “GONUT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 5 → again invalid (T cannot be in position 5).

Next: “TONER” – contains R and E (both eliminated).

Next: “TONYL” – Y is allowed, but let’s check letters: T, O, N, Y, L.  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Letters: T, O, N, Y, L – none of A, R, S, E, P, I.  
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “TONYL”.

   T must be in 3 or 4.  
   - _ O T _ N → T in 3 (valid).  
   - _ O _ T N → T in 4 (valid).

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at the options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the most common in English words
- It tests positions for these letters simultaneously
- It has no repeating letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in the 3rd position)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A strong next guess is ""POINT"" because:
- It contains O (in position 2, testing a new position)
- It uses P, I, N, T which are all common and haven't been tested yet
- It avoids all the eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)
- All letters are unique, maximizing coverage

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)  
   – P and I are NOT in the word.  
   – O is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – N and T are in the word but in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
- Must contain N and T somewhere other than positions 4 and 5 respectively.  
- Cannot contain A, R, S, E, P, I.  

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains both N and T (but N not in position 4, T not in position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “MOUNT”:
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 4 → but feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (POINT had N in position 4 and it was “-”). So N cannot be in position 4.  
Therefore “MOUNT” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLOUD”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains no N or T → violates requirement.  

Next: “BOUND”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 4 → again violates “N not in position 4”.  

Next: “FOUNT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains T but not N → violates requirement.  

Next: “DONUT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 5 → but feedback said T is in the word but wrong position (POINT had T in position 5 and it was “-”), so T cannot be in position 5.  
Thus “DONUT” is invalid.

Next: “HOTEL” – contains E (eliminated).

Next: “BONUS” – contains S (eliminated).

Next: “TONIC” – contains I (eliminated).

Next: “GONUT”  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 5 → again invalid (T cannot be in position 5).

Next: “TONER” – contains R and E (both eliminated).

Next: “TONYL” – Y is allowed, but let’s check letters: T, O, N, Y, L.  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 1 (allowed).  
- Letters: T, O, N, Y, L – none of A, R, S, E, P, I.

- Pattern: _ O _ _ _  
- Must contain N and T.  
- N cannot be in position 3 or 4.  
- T cannot be in position 1 or 5.  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, etc. (excluding A, R, S, E, P, I, Y, L).

Possible positions for N: 1, 5  
Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 4.

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: N in position 1  
   N O _ _ _  
   T must be in 3 or 4.  
   - N O T _ _ → T in 3 (valid).  
   - N O _ T _ → T in 4 (valid).  
   - N O _ _ T → T in 5 (invalid, T cannot be in 5).  

Case 2: N in position 5  
   _ O _ _ N  
   T must be in 3 or 4.  
   - _ O T _ N → T in 3 (valid).  
   - _ O _ T N → T in 4 (valid).  

Now find 5-letter words matching these patterns using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: N O T _ _  
   Need two more letters (not N, O, T, and from allowed set).  
   Common endings: NOTCH, NOTED, NOTED, etc.  
   NOTCH: letters N, O, T, C, H – all allowed.  
   NOTED: contains D (allowed) but E is eliminated.  
   NOTCH is valid.

Pattern 2: N O _ T _  
   Need letters for positions 3 and 5.  
   N O B T _ → B and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O U T _ → U and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O M T _ → M and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O W T _ → W and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O C T _ → C and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O D T _ → D and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O G T _ → G and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O K T _ → K and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O F T _ → F and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O H T _ → H and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O M T _ → M and _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O U T _ → N O U T _ – need a 5th letter.  
   N O U T S – S is eliminated.  
   N O U T H – H is allowed.  
   N O U T H is valid.

Pattern 3: _ O T _ N  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 4.  
   C O T _ N → C and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   B O T _ N → B and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   D O T _ N → D and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   F O T _ N → F and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   G O T _ N → G and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   H O T _ N → H and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   M O T _ N → M and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   K O T _ N → K and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   W O T _ N → W and _ – need a 4th letter.  
   C O T A N – A is eliminated.  
   C O T U N – U is allowed.  
   C O T U N is valid.

Pattern 4: _ O _ T N  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
   B O _ T N → B and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   D O _ T N → D and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   F O _ T N → F and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   G O _ T N → G and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   H O _ T N → H and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   M O _ T N → M and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   K O _ T N → K and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   W O _ T N → W and _ – need a 3rd letter.  
   B O U T N – U is allowed.  
   B O U T N is valid.

Among these, ""NOTCH"" (N O T C H) is the most straightforward valid word matching the constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _ → N O T C H (positions: N1, O2, T3, C4, H5).  
- O in position 2 (✓).  
- Contains N and T.  
- N not in position 3 or 4 (it’s in 1) – OK.  
- T not in position 1 or 5 (it’s in 3) – OK.  
- Letters: N, O, T, C, H – none of A, R, S, E, P, I, Y, L.  

Therefore, ""NOTCH"" is a valid next guess.
