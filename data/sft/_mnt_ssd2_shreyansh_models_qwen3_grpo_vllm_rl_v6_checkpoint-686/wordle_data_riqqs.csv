For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving me good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 2 in CRANE)
- A, N, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters and place R in a different position. I’ll try “TRIOL” – it has:
- T (common consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, moved to position 1)
- I (common vowel)
- O (common vowel)
- L (common consonant)

This tests five new letters and moves R to a new position.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D  

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
R and I  

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2 (from CRANE and TRIOL/URBID).
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4 (from TRIOL and URBID).

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We have only two letters confirmed (R, I) and three positions left to determine.  
We need three brand-new letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
Common remaining consonants: S, M, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Common remaining vowel: none left (A, E, O, U are out), so we’ll stick to consonants.

A good next guess should:
1. Place R and I in positions we haven’t tested.
2. Introduce three fresh consonants.

Let’s try “FRISK”:
- F (new)
- R (must be in word, now in position 3)
- I (must be in word, now in position 4)
- S (new)
- K (new)

Wait: I cannot be in position 4 (from URBID feedback). So let’s adjust.

Try “WRIST”:
- W (new)
- R (position 2 – already ruled out by CRANE)

No good.  
Try “PRISM”:
- P (new)
- R (position 2 – ruled out)

Still no good.  
Try “RIFTS”:
- R (position 1 – ruled out)

No.

Let’s systematically list possible positions:

R can be 3,4,5  
I can be 1,2,5 and not overlap with R.

Case 1: R at 3  
Then I can be 1,2,5  
Word pattern:  
- I _ R _ _  
- _ I R _ _  
- _ _ R _ I  

Case 2: R at 4  
Then I can be 1,2,5  
Word pattern:  
- I _ _ R _  
- _ I _ R _  
- _ _ _ R I  

Case 3: R at 5  
Then I can be 1,2  
Word pattern:  
- I _ _ _ R  
- _ I _ _ R  

We need three new letters. Let’s pick common ones: S, M, K.

Let’s try “MIRKS”:
- M (new)
- I (position 2 – allowed)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- K (new)
- S (new)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses R and I in allowed positions.
- Introduces three new letters (M, K, S).
- No letters from the banned list.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving me good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 2 in CRANE)
- A, N, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters and place R in a different position. I’ll try “TRIOL” – it has:
- T (common consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, moved to position 1)
- I (common vowel)
- O (common vowel)
- L (common consonant)

This tests five new letters and moves R to a new position.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, I  

From CRANE: R is in the word but not in position 2.  
From TRIOL: R is in the word but not in position 1, and I is in the word but not in position 3.

So the word contains both R and I, and we have yet to place them correctly.  
We also need to test new consonants and the remaining vowels (U is still untested).

A good next guess should:
1. Include both R and I in new positions.
2. Introduce fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

Let’s try “URBID”:
- U (new vowel)
- R (known to be present, now in position 2)
- B (new consonant)
- I (known to be present, now in position 4)
- D (new consonant)

This tests three new letters (U, B, D) while placing R and I in positions we haven’t checked yet.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2 (from CRANE and TRIOL/URBID).
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4 (from TRIOL and URBID).

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We have only two letters confirmed (R, I) and three positions left to determine.  
We need three brand-new letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
Common remaining consonants: S, M, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y

From the latest feedback:

- I is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- R is still in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, TRIOL, URBID, MIRKS).
  - Therefore R must be in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D, M, K.
- Letters confirmed IN the word: I (position 2), R (position 5), S (position 5 is taken by R, so S must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).

So far the word looks like: _ I _ _ R  
and it must contain S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining unused common letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, plus S.

We need two more letters (since we already have I and R fixed) and one of them must be S.

Possible patterns:
1. S I _ _ R
2. _ I S _ R
3. _ I _ S R

Let’s pick the second pattern: _ I S _ R  
We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding all banned letters.

Good candidates: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “FISHR” – but H and F are both new, and S is in position 3.

But “FISHR” isn’t a valid English word.

Try “WISPR” – W, P are new, but “WISPR” isn’t valid.

Try “PISR” – too short.

Let’s try “PISAR” – not valid.

Try “FISAR” – not valid.

Try “VISAR” – not valid.

Try “WISER” – E is banned.

Try “WISPR” – again, not valid.

Let’s try the third pattern: _ I _ S R  
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.

Try “F I G S R” – “FIGSR” not valid.

Try “P I G S R” – “PIGSR” not valid.

Try “P I V S R” – “PIVSR” not valid.

Try “F I V S R” – “FIVSR” not valid.

Try “P I G S R” – still not valid.

Try “P I S _ R” – already considered.

Let’s try the first pattern: S I _ _ R  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4.

Try “S I G H R” – “SIGHR” not valid.

Try “S I F G R” – “SIFGR” not valid.

Try “S I P H R” – “SIPHR” not valid.

Try “S I V G R” – “SIVGR” not valid.

Let’s try actual valid English words that fit _ I _ _ R with S somewhere and no banned letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving me good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 2 in CRANE)
- A, N, E are all NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain C, A, N, E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

A good next guess would use new letters and place R in a different position. I’ll try “TRIOL” – it has:
- T (common consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, moved to position 1)
- I (common vowel)
- O (common vowel)
- L (common consonant)

This tests five new letters and moves R to a new position.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, I  

From CRANE: R is in the word but not in position 2.  
From TRIOL: R is in the word but not in position 1, and I is in the word but not in position 3.

So the word contains both R and I, and we have yet to place them correctly.  
We also need to test new consonants and the remaining vowels (U is still untested).

A good next guess should:
1. Include both R and I in new positions.
2. Introduce fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

Let’s try “URBID”:
- U (new vowel)
- R (known to be present, now in position 2)
- B (new consonant)
- I (known to be present, now in position 4)
- D (new consonant)

This tests three new letters (U, B, D) while placing R and I in positions we haven’t checked yet.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D  

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
R and I  

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2 (from CRANE and TRIOL/URBID).
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4 (from TRIOL and URBID).

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We have only two letters confirmed (R, I) and three positions left to determine.  
We need three brand-new letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
Common remaining consonants: S, M, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Common remaining vowel: none left (A, E, O, U are out), so we’ll stick to consonants.

A good next guess should:
1. Place R and I in positions we haven’t tested.
2. Introduce three fresh consonants.

Let’s try “FRISK”:
- F (new)
- R (must be in word, now in position 3)
- I (must be in word, now in position 4)
- S (new)
- K (new)

Wait: I cannot be in position 4 (from URBID feedback). So let’s adjust.

Try “WRIST”:
- W (new)
- R (position 2 – already ruled out by CRANE)

No good.  
Try “PRISM”:
- P (new)
- R (position 2 – ruled out)

Still no good.  
Try “RIFTS”:
- R (position 1 – ruled out)

No.  
Try “FRIAR”:
- R (position 5 – allowed)
- I (position 2 – allowed)
- F, A, R: A is out.

No.  
Try “FRIAR” again, but A is out.

Try “FRIED” – E is out.

Try “FRIAR” – A is out.

Try “FRISS” – S is repeated.

Try “FRIAR” – A is out.

Let’s systematically list possible positions:

R can be 3,4,5  
I can be 1,2,5 and not overlap with R.

Case 1: R at 3  
Then I can be 1,2,5  
Word pattern:  
- I _ R _ _  
- _ I R _ _  
- _ _ R _ I  

Case 2: R at 4  
Then I can be 1,2,5  
Word pattern:  
- I _ _ R _  
- _ I _ R _  
- _ _ _ R I  

Case 3: R at 5  
Then I can be 1,2  
Word pattern:  
- I _ _ _ R  
- _ I _ _ R  

We need three new letters. Let’s pick common ones: S, M, K.

Let’s try “MIRKS”:
- M (new)
- I (position 2 – allowed)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- K (new)
- S (new)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses R and I in allowed positions.
- Introduces three new letters (M, K, S).
- No letters from the banned list.

From the latest feedback:

- I is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from previous guesses) – wait, that’s impossible. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback shows:
- I is correct in position 2 (✓)
- S is correct in position 5 (✓)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – but every position (1,2,3,4,5) has been checked for R and marked wrong? That can’t be.

Let me re-summarize all feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 2.

2. TRIOL → T(x) R(-) I(-) O(x) L(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 1.  
   – I exists, not in pos 3.

3. URBID → U(x) R(-) B(x) I(-) D(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 2.  
   – I exists, not in pos 4.

4. MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)  
   – I is fixed in pos 2.  
   – S is fixed in pos 5.  
   – R exists, not in pos 3.

So R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 (from guesses 1-4) and must be in position 4.

Thus the word pattern is:
_ I R _ S

We need one more letter in position 1 and 3, using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters already eliminated: C,A,N,E,T,O,L,U,B,D,M,K  
Remaining common letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 3.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – but H and S are allowed? S is already in pos 5, so S cannot appear again. So position 3 cannot be S.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – invalid (S repeated).

Try “FRIYS” – Y and F are allowed, but S is already at 5.

Try “FRIPS” – P and F allowed, S already at 5.

But we need a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s list possible words matching _ I R _ S:

- FRISS – invalid (S repeated)
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U is eliminated
- VIRUS – V, U, but U is eliminated
- GIRTH – doesn’t fit
- FRIED – E is eliminated
- FRIAR – A is eliminated
- FRISS – already invalid
- PRIUS – P,R,I,U,S – U is eliminated
- FRIIS – not common
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated

Wait, let me think differently. The only remaining position for R is 4, and we have _ I R _ S.

Possible words:
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – S repeated
- FRIED – E eliminated

Hmm, seems like very few options. Let me check remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – not a word.

Try “FRIYS” – not a word.

Try “FRIPS” – not a word.

Try “FRIWY” – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words.

Possible valid words fitting _ I R _ S:

- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated
- FRIAR – A eliminated

This is concerning. Let me double-check eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D, M, K.

So allowed letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, I, R, S (but I and S are fixed).

Thus possible letters for positions 1 and 3: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

We need a valid word _ I R _ S.

- Y I R Y S –YIRYS – not a word

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine R positions:

From all feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 (from guesses 1-4) – but position 4 is the only remaining. So R must be in position 4.

Thus the word is definitely _ I R _ S.

But none of the combinations seem to form valid English words with remaining letters.

Let me check if any valid English word fits _ I R _ S with allowed letters.

Looking at English words:
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated
- FRIAR – A eliminated

It appears the only possible word is FRIAR, but A is eliminated.

This suggests an inconsistency – perhaps I misread a feedback.

Re-checking Guess 4: MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)

The R(-) means R is in the word but in the wrong position. In MIRKS, R is in position 3, so R is not in position 3.

Previously:
- CRANE: R not in 2
- TRIOL: R not in 1
- URBID: R not in 2
- MIRKS: R not in 3

Thus R cannot be in 1,2,3 and must be in 4 or 5. But S is fixed in 5, so R must be in 4.

Thus the word is _ I R _ S.

Given that, and no valid word seems possible, perhaps I missed a letter.

Wait, let me list all allowed letters again:

Eliminated: C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D, M, K  
Allowed: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, I, R, S

Thus positions:
1: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y
2: I (fixed)
3: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y
4: R (fixed)
5: S (fixed)

Thus the word must be [F,G,H,P,V,W,Y] I R [F,G,H,P,V,W,Y] S

Looking for valid English words:

- F I R F S – FIRFS – not a word
- F I R G S – FIRGS – not a word

- Y I R V S – YIRV S – not a word
- Y I R W S – YIRW S – not a word
- Y I R Y S – YIRY S – not a word

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that I missed a valid word.

Wait, let me think of ""FRISS"" – but S is already in position 5, so it would have two S's, which is unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the word is ""FRISS"" – but it has two S's, and position 5 is S, so position 3 would also be S, but that's not allowed as S is already fixed in 5.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Upon closer inspection, the word must be _ I R _ S with R in 4, I in 2, S in 5.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""FRIAR"", but A is eliminated.

This suggests the secret word is ""FRIAR"", but A was marked x in CRANE. This is impossible.

Therefore, I must have misread the feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 4: MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)

The R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 3. It does not preclude positions 1,2,4,5.

So possible positions for R: 1,4,5 (since 2,3 are ruled out).

But I is fixed in 2, S in 5.

Thus R must be in 1 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R I _ _ S
2. _ I _ R S

Let me explore these.

Pattern 1: R I _ _ S
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R I F F S – RIFFS – valid word

- R I Y P S – RIYPS – not a word
- R I Y V S – RIYVS – not a word
- R I Y W S – RIYWS – not a word

Pattern 2: _ I _ R S
We need two letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible words:
- F I G R S – FIGRS – not a word
- F I H R S – FI H R S – not a word
- F I P R S – F I P R S – not a word
- F I V R S – F I V R S – not a word
- F I W R S – F I W R S – not a word
- F I Y R S – F I Y R S – not a word

- G I F R S – GIFRS – not a word

- P I G R S – PI G R S – not a word
- P I H R S – PI H R S – not a word
- P I V R S – PI V R S – not a word
- P I W R S – PI W R S – not a word

- W I H R S – WI H R S – not a word
- W I P R S – WI P R S – not a word

- Y I F R S – YI F R S – not a word
- Y I G R S – YI G R S – not a word
- Y I H R S – YI H R S – not a word
- Y I P R S – YI P R S – not a word
- Y I V R S – YI V R S – not a word
- Y I W R S – YI W R S – not a word

The only valid word I can find is ""RIFFS"" under pattern 1.

Let me check ""RIFFS"":
- R I F F S
- R: position 1 (allowed, not ruled out)
- I: position 2 (fixed ✓)
- F: position 3 (new letter)
- F: position 4 (new letter)
- S: position 5 (fixed ✓)

This seems to fit all constraints.

<guess>RIFFS</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is:

<guess>RIFFS</guess>",RIFFS,"From the latest feedback:

- I is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from previous guesses) – wait, that’s impossible. Let me re-read carefully.

Actually, the feedback shows:
- I is correct in position 2 (✓)
- S is correct in position 5 (✓)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – but every position (1,2,3,4,5) has been checked for R and marked wrong? That can’t be.

Let me re-summarize all feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 2.

2. TRIOL → T(x) R(-) I(-) O(x) L(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 1.  
   – I exists, not in pos 3.

3. URBID → U(x) R(-) B(x) I(-) D(x)  
   – R exists, not in pos 2.  
   – I exists, not in pos 4.

4. MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)  
   – I is fixed in pos 2.  
   – S is fixed in pos 5.  
   – R exists, not in pos 3.

So R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 (from guesses 1-4) and must be in position 4.

Thus the word pattern is:
_ I R _ S

We need one more letter in position 1 and 3, using letters not yet eliminated.

Letters already eliminated: C,A,N,E,T,O,L,U,B,D,M,K  
Remaining common letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 3.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – but H and S are allowed? S is already in pos 5, so S cannot appear again. So position 3 cannot be S.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – invalid (S repeated).

Try “FRIYS” – Y and F are allowed, but S is already at 5.

Try “FRIPS” – P and F allowed, S already at 5.

But we need a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s list possible words matching _ I R _ S:

- FRISS – invalid (S repeated)
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U is eliminated
- VIRUS – V, U, but U is eliminated
- GIRTH – doesn’t fit
- FRIED – E is eliminated
- FRIAR – A is eliminated
- FRISS – already invalid
- PRIUS – P,R,I,U,S – U is eliminated
- FRIIS – not common
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated

Wait, let me think differently. The only remaining position for R is 4, and we have _ I R _ S.

Possible words:
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – S repeated
- FRIED – E eliminated

Hmm, seems like very few options. Let me check remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not eliminated): F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try “FRIHS” – not a word.

Try “FRIYS” – not a word.

Try “FRIPS” – not a word.

Try “FRIWY” – not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual words.

Possible valid words fitting _ I R _ S:

- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated
- FRIAR – A eliminated

This is concerning. Let me double-check eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D, M, K.

So allowed letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, I, R, S (but I and S are fixed).

Thus possible letters for positions 1 and 3: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

We need a valid word _ I R _ S.

Let me list possible combinations:

- F I R G S – FIRGS – not a word
- F I R H S – FIRHS – not a word
- F I R P S – FIRPS – not a word
- F I R V S – FIRVS – not a word
- F I R W S – FIRWS – not a word
- F I R Y S – FIRYS – not a word

- Y I R P S –YIRPS – not a word
- Y I R V S –YIRVS – not a word
- Y I R W S –YIRWS – not a word
- Y I R Y S –YIRYS – not a word

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine R positions:

From all feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 (from guesses 1-4) – but position 4 is the only remaining. So R must be in position 4.

Thus the word is definitely _ I R _ S.

But none of the combinations seem to form valid English words with remaining letters.

Let me check if any valid English word fits _ I R _ S with allowed letters.

Looking at English words:
- FRIAR – A eliminated
- PRIIS – not common
- TRIIS – not common
- URIUS – U eliminated
- VIRUS – U eliminated
- FRISS – invalid
- FRIED – E eliminated
- FRIAR – A eliminated

It appears the only possible word is FRIAR, but A is eliminated.

This suggests an inconsistency – perhaps I misread a feedback.

Re-checking Guess 4: MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)

The R(-) means R is in the word but in the wrong position. In MIRKS, R is in position 3, so R is not in position 3.

Previously:
- CRANE: R not in 2
- TRIOL: R not in 1
- URBID: R not in 2
- MIRKS: R not in 3

Thus R cannot be in 1,2,3 and must be in 4 or 5. But S is fixed in 5, so R must be in 4.

Thus the word is _ I R _ S.

Given that, and no valid word seems possible, perhaps I missed a letter.

Wait, let me list all allowed letters again:

Eliminated: C, A, N, E, T, O, L, U, B, D, M, K  
Allowed: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y, I, R, S

Thus positions:
1: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y
2: I (fixed)
3: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y
4: R (fixed)
5: S (fixed)

Thus the word must be [F,G,H,P,V,W,Y] I R [F,G,H,P,V,W,Y] S

Looking for valid English words:

- F I R F S – FIRFS – not a word

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that I missed a valid word.

Wait, let me think of ""FRISS"" – but S is already in position 5, so it would have two S's, which is unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the word is ""FRISS"" – but it has two S's, and position 5 is S, so position 3 would also be S, but that's not allowed as S is already fixed in 5.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Upon closer inspection, the word must be _ I R _ S with R in 4, I in 2, S in 5.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""FRIAR"", but A is eliminated.

This suggests the secret word is ""FRIAR"", but A was marked x in CRANE. This is impossible.

Therefore, I must have misread the feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 4: MIRKS → M(x) I(✓) R(-) K(x) S(✓)

The R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 3. It does not preclude positions 1,2,4,5.

So possible positions for R: 1,4,5 (since 2,3 are ruled out).

But I is fixed in 2, S in 5.

Thus R must be in 1 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:
1. R I _ _ S
2. _ I _ R S

Let me explore these.

Pattern 1: R I _ _ S
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed letters: F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

The only valid word I can find is ""RIFFS"" under pattern 1.

Let me check ""RIFFS"":
- R I F F S
- R: position 1 (allowed, not ruled out)
- I: position 2 (fixed ✓)
- F: position 3 (new letter)
- F: position 4 (new letter)
- S: position 5 (fixed ✓)

This seems to fit all constraints.

<guess>RIFFS</guess>Based on the feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is:",Guess 6: RIFFS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) F(x) F(x) S(✓),FAIL
