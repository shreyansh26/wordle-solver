For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any, to test as many different letters as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on ARISE:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any, to test as many different letters as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, I, S, E are all NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

Good letters left to try (since we can’t use R, I, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word that fits these constraints is “PLANT”:
- Contains A (in position 3).
- Does not contain R, I, S, or E.
- Uses common letters P, L, N, T.

Let’s try PLANT.

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   - A is again marked “-”, so it is still in the wrong place.  
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Letters we know ARE in the word: A (but not in positions 1 or 3).

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A cannot be in positions 1 or 3).  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T).

A good candidate is “COBRA”:
- Contains A in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses C, O, B, R.  
  – However, R is already excluded, so COBRA is invalid.

Next candidate: “CABAL”
- Contains A in positions 2 and 4.  
- Uses C, B, L.  
  – L is excluded, so CABAL is invalid.

Next candidate: “COMMA”
- Contains A in position 5.  
- Uses C, O, M.  
  – No excluded letters. COMMA is valid and tests C, O, M, and A in position 5.

Another candidate: “GAMMA”
- Uses G, M, and A in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3).  
  – Invalid.

“COBRA” and “CABAL” are out.  
“COMMA” is valid and tests new letters.

Let’s go with COMMA.

Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, I, S, E are all NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

Good letters left to try (since we can’t use R, I, S, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word that fits these constraints is “PLANT”:
- Contains A (in position 3).
- Does not contain R, I, S, or E.
- Uses common letters P, L, N, T.

Let’s try PLANT.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   - A is again marked “-”, so it is still in the wrong place.  
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Letters we know ARE in the word: A (but not in positions 1 or 3).

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A cannot be in positions 1 or 3).  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T).

A good candidate is “COBRA”:
- Contains A in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses C, O, B, R.  
  – However, R is already excluded, so COBRA is invalid.

Next candidate: “CABAL”
- Contains A in positions 2 and 4.  
- Uses C, B, L.  
  – L is excluded, so CABAL is invalid.

Next candidate: “COMMA”
- Contains A in position 5.  
- Uses C, O, M.  
  – No excluded letters. COMMA is valid and tests C, O, M, and A in position 5.

Another candidate: “GAMMA”
- Uses G, M, and A in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3).  
  – Invalid.

“COBRA” and “CABAL” are out.  
“COMMA” is valid and tests new letters.

Let’s go with COMMA.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
O (position 2)
M (position 3)
A (position 5)

So the word pattern so far is:
_  O  M  _  A

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen only from the available set, to make a valid 5-letter English word that matches _ O M _ A.

Possible candidates:
- BOMBA (but B is allowed, second B is duplicate and may or may not be allowed)
- DOMA? (no common word)
- FOMA? (no)
- GOMA? (no)
- HOMA? (HOMA is a valid word, meaning a sacrificial offering in ancient Greece)
- JOMA? (no)
- KOMA? (no)
- WOMA? (no)
- YOMA? (no)
- BOMBA is the only plausible English word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BOMBA.

From the feedback:

- Letters NOT in the word (✗): R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B  
- Letters that ARE in the word (✓): O (position 2), M (position 3), A (position 5)  
- Therefore the pattern is: _ O M _ A  

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4 from the allowed set to form a valid 5-letter English word matching _ O M _ A.

Scanning possibilities:

1. D O M _ A → “DOMA” is not a valid word.  
2. F O M _ A → “FOMA” is not a valid word.  
3. G O M _ A → “GOMA” is not a valid word.  
4. H O M _ A → “HOMA” is a valid English word (a sacrificial offering).  
5. J O M _ A → “JOMA” is not a valid word.  
6. K O M _ A → “KOMA” is not a valid word.  
7. W O M _ A → “WOMA” is not a valid word.  
8. Y O M _ A → “YOMA” is not a valid word.  

The only valid word left is HOMA.  
Since H has not been ruled out, this must be the word.

The feedback says “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That means the word we’re looking for is five letters long, but HOMA is only four letters.  
Therefore the pattern _ O M _ A must be completed with a fifth letter in position 4, and we still need a letter in position 1.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form

Scanning the dictionary for words matching ?OM?A:

- DOMA? – no  
- FOMA? – no

- HOMA? – no (only 4 letters)  
- JOMA? – no  
- KOMA? – no  
- WOMA? – no  
- YOMA? – no  

The only valid English word of the correct form is **DOMA**, but D is still allowed and DOMA is five letters (a valid Scrabble dictionary word, though uncommon).  

Since no other common word fits, we must guess DOMA.
