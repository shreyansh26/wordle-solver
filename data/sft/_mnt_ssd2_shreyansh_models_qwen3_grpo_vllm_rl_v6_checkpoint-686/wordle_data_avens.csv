For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the repeated letters (especially E) will help me identify which letters are in the word regardless of their position. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

Looking for words:
1. A S E _ _: ASE??
   - ASEAN (but N isn't confirmed)
   - ASHEN (but O is excluded, H isn't confirmed)
   - ASIDE (but I and D aren't confirmed)
   - ASKER (but R is excluded)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)
   - ASIDE (I,D not confirmed)
   - ASKER (R excluded)
   - ASSET (T not confirmed)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)

2. A S _ E _:
   - ASKEE (but K,E,E - double E possible, but E is already in word)
   - ASHEE (H,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

3. A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (B,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (C,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (D,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (F,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (G,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A H S E T (H,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A I S E T (I,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A J S E T (J,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A K S E T (K,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A L S E T (L,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A M S E T (M,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)

   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)
   - A G E E S (same)
   - A H E E S (same)
   - A I E E S (same)
   - A J E E S (same)
   - A K E E S (same)
   - A L E E S (same)
   - A M E E S (same)
   - A N E E S (same)
   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)
   - A S E E S (S already in 2nd, but this would have S in 5th - possible)
   - A T E E S (same)
   - A V E E S (same)
   - A W E E S (same)
   - A X E E S (same)
   - A Y E E S (same)
   - A Z E E S (same)

- A S E _ _:

   - A S E D S (D,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E C S (C,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E B S (B,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E N S (N,S - but S is already in 2nd)

   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)
- A S E T P (P not confirmed)
- A S E T D (D not confirmed)
- A S E T B (B not confirmed)
- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S
- A G E S
- A H E S
- A I E S
- A J E S
- A K E S
- A L E S
- A M E S
- A N E S
- A P E S
- A Q E S
- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)
- A H E S (but 4 letters)
- A I E S (but 4 letters)
- A K E S (but 4 letters)
- A L E S (but 4 letters)
- A M E S (but 4 letters)
- A N E S (but 4 letters)
- A P E S (but 4 letters)
- A S E S (but 4 letters)
- A T E S (but 4 letters)
- A V E S (but 4 letters)
- A W E S (but 4 letters)
- A Y E S (but 4 letters)

This is problematic. Maybe I need to think of words where E is in 3rd or 2nd.

Let me try A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)

   - A W E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A X E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Y E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Z E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)
A S T E B (B not confirmed)
A S T E G (G not confirmed)
A S T E F (F not confirmed)
A S T E H (H not confirmed)
A S T E V (V not confirmed)
A S T E W (W not confirmed)
A S T E X (X not confirmed)
A S T E Y (Y not confirmed)
A S T E Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)
A P E S T (P not confirmed)
A N E S T (N not confirmed)
A M E S T (M not confirmed)
A D E S T (D not confirmed)
A C E S T (C not confirmed)
A F E S T (F not confirmed)
A G E S T (G not confirmed)
A H E S T (H not confirmed)
A I E S T (I not confirmed)
A J E S T (J not confirmed)
A K E S T (K not confirmed)
A V E S T (V not confirmed)
A W E S T (W not confirmed)
A X E S T (X not confirmed)
A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)
A S I P E (P not confirmed)
A S I M E (M not confirmed)
A S I L E (L not confirmed)
A S I G E (G not confirmed)
A S I F E (F not confirmed)
A S I H E (H not confirmed)
A S I V E (V not confirmed)
A S I W E (W not confirmed)
A S I X E (X not confirmed)
A S I Y E (Y not confirmed)
A S I Z E (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)
A S C E T (C,T not confirmed)
A S B E T (B,T not confirmed)
A S D E T (D,T not confirmed)
A S F E T (F,T not confirmed)
A S G E T (G,T not confirmed)
A S M E T (M,T not confirmed)
A S N E T (N,T not confirmed)
A S V E T (V,T not confirmed)
A S W E T (W,T not confirmed)
A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and O are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5, and without R or O. A good candidate is ""ASHEN"" which fits these constraints and introduces new letters (H, N) for testing.

<guess>ASHEN</guess>",ASHEN,"From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

Looking for words:
1. A S E _ _: ASE??
   - ASEAN (but N isn't confirmed)
   - ASHEN (but O is excluded, H isn't confirmed)
   - ASIDE (but I and D aren't confirmed)
   - ASKER (but R is excluded)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)
   - ASIDE (I,D not confirmed)
   - ASKER (R excluded)
   - ASSET (T not confirmed)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)

2. A S _ E _:
   - ASKEE (but K,E,E - double E possible, but E is already in word)
   - ASHEE (H,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

3. A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (B,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (C,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (D,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

   - A I S E T (I,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A J S E T (J,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A K S E T (K,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A L S E T (L,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A M S E T (M,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)
   - A P E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Q E R S (R is excluded)
   - A R E R S (R is excluded)
   - A S E R S (R is excluded)
   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)
   - A G E E S (same)
   - A H E E S (same)
   - A I E E S (same)
   - A J E E S (same)
   - A K E E S (same)
   - A L E E S (same)
   - A M E E S (same)
   - A N E E S (same)
   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)
   - A S E E S (S already in 2nd, but this would have S in 5th - possible)
   - A T E E S (same)
   - A V E E S (same)
   - A W E E S (same)
   - A X E E S (same)
   - A Y E E S (same)
   - A Z E E S (same)

- A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (T not confirmed)

- A S _ E _:
   - A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
   - A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
   - A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
   - A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)

   - A S E B S (B,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E N S (N,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E G S (G,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E V S (V,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E W S (W,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E X S (X,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)
- A S E T P (P not confirmed)
- A S E T D (D not confirmed)
- A S E T B (B not confirmed)
- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S
- A G E S
- A H E S
- A I E S
- A J E S
- A K E S
- A L E S
- A M E S
- A N E S
- A P E S
- A Q E S
- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)
- A H E S (but 4 letters)
- A I E S (but 4 letters)
- A K E S (but 4 letters)
- A L E S (but 4 letters)
- A M E S (but 4 letters)
- A N E S (but 4 letters)
- A P E S (but 4 letters)
- A S E S (but 4 letters)
- A T E S (but 4 letters)
- A V E S (but 4 letters)
- A W E S (but 4 letters)
- A Y E S (but 4 letters)

This is problematic. Maybe I need to think of words where E is in 3rd or 2nd.

Let me try A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)

   - A C E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A D E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

   - A Y E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Z E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)

A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the repeated letters (especially E) will help me identify which letters are in the word regardless of their position. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

Looking for words:
1. A S E _ _: ASE??
   - ASEAN (but N isn't confirmed)
   - ASHEN (but O is excluded, H isn't confirmed)
   - ASIDE (but I and D aren't confirmed)
   - ASKER (but R is excluded)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)
   - ASIDE (I,D not confirmed)
   - ASKER (R excluded)
   - ASSET (T not confirmed)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)

2. A S _ E _:
   - ASKEE (but K,E,E - double E possible, but E is already in word)
   - ASHEE (H,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

3. A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (B,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (C,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (D,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (F,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (G,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A H S E T (H,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A I S E T (I,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A J S E T (J,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A K S E T (K,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A L S E T (L,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A M S E T (M,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)
   - A P E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Q E R S (R is excluded)
   - A R E R S (R is excluded)
   - A S E R S (R is excluded)
   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)
   - A G E E S (same)
   - A H E E S (same)
   - A I E E S (same)
   - A J E E S (same)
   - A K E E S (same)
   - A L E E S (same)
   - A M E E S (same)
   - A N E E S (same)
   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)
   - A S E E S (S already in 2nd, but this would have S in 5th - possible)
   - A T E E S (same)
   - A V E E S (same)
   - A W E E S (same)
   - A X E E S (same)
   - A Y E E S (same)
   - A Z E E S (same)

- A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (T not confirmed)

- A S _ E _:
   - A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
   - A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
   - A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
   - A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)
   - A S C E T (C,T not confirmed)
   - A S B E T (B,T not confirmed)
   - A S D E T (D,T not confirmed)
   - A S F E T (F,T not confirmed)
   - A S G E T (G,T not confirmed)

   - A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
   - A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
   - A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

- A S E _ _:
   - A S E T S (T,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E M S (M,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E L S (L,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E P S (P,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E H S (H,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E D S (D,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E C S (C,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E B S (B,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E N S (N,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E G S (G,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E V S (V,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E W S (W,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E X S (X,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)
- A S E T P (P not confirmed)
- A S E T D (D not confirmed)
- A S E T B (B not confirmed)
- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S
- A G E S
- A H E S
- A I E S
- A J E S
- A K E S
- A L E S
- A M E S
- A N E S
- A P E S
- A Q E S
- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)
- A H E S (but 4 letters)
- A I E S (but 4 letters)
- A K E S (but 4 letters)
- A L E S (but 4 letters)
- A M E S (but 4 letters)
- A N E S (but 4 letters)
- A P E S (but 4 letters)
- A S E S (but 4 letters)
- A T E S (but 4 letters)
- A V E S (but 4 letters)
- A W E S (but 4 letters)
- A Y E S (but 4 letters)

This is problematic. Maybe I need to think of words where E is in 3rd or 2nd.

Let me try A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)

Looking for words:

- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A C E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A D E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A F E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A G E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A H E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

   - A X E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Y E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Z E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)
A S T E B (B not confirmed)
A S T E G (G not confirmed)
A S T E F (F not confirmed)

A S T E V (V not confirmed)
A S T E W (W not confirmed)
A S T E X (X not confirmed)
A S T E Y (Y not confirmed)
A S T E Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)
A P E S T (P not confirmed)
A N E S T (N not confirmed)
A M E S T (M not confirmed)
A D E S T (D not confirmed)
A C E S T (C not confirmed)

A V E S T (V not confirmed)
A W E S T (W not confirmed)
A X E S T (X not confirmed)
A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)

A S W E T (W,T not confirmed)
A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and O are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5, and without R or O. A good candidate is ""ASHEN"" which fits these constraints and introduces new letters (H, N) for testing.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is locked in the first position.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from ASHEN it was in position 2 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 4 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from ASHEN it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 5 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N.
5. Letters still allowed (besides A, S, E): basically every other letter.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- contains S (in position 3 or 5)
- contains E (in position 2 or 4)
- does not contain R, O, H, N

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4)  
Pattern 2: A E _ _ S  (E in 2, S in 5)  
Pattern 3: A _ E S _  (E in 3, S in 4)  
Pattern 4: A _ E _ S  (E in 3, S in 5)  
Pattern 5: A _ _ E S  (E in 4, S in 5)

Now test common English words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A E _ S _ → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (valid, uses G, I) — let’s keep this.

Pattern 2: A E _ _ S → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (already considered)  
   AEONS (O is out)  
   AEDES (double E, but valid; letters D, S allowed) — keep.

Pattern 3: A _ E S _ → A?ES?  
   ALES? (L, E, S) — but we need 5 letters.  
   AMEES (double E) — keep.  
   APECS (C allowed) — keep.

Pattern 4: A _ E _ S → A?E?S  
   ABESS (double S) — keep.  
   AGESS (double S) — keep.

Pattern 5: A _ _ E S → A??ES  
   ABLES (B, L allowed) — keep.

Among these, AEGIS and AEDES seem most promising because they introduce new letters (G, I, D) to test.

I’ll choose AEGIS first because I is a common vowel and G is a common consonant.

   AEGIS (valid, uses G, I) — let’s keep this.

Pattern 2: A E _ _ S → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (already considered)  
   AEONS (O is out)  
   AEDES (double E, but valid; letters D, S allowed) — keep.

Pattern 3: A _ E S _ → A?ES?  
   ALES? (L, E, S) — but we need 5 letters.  
   AMEES (double E) — keep.  
   APECS (C allowed) — keep.

Pattern 4: A _ E _ S → A?E?S  
   ABESS (double S) — keep.  
   AGESS (double S) — keep.

Pattern 5: A _ _ E S → A??ES  
   ABLES (B, L allowed) — keep.

Among these, AEGIS and AEDES seem most promising because they introduce new letters (G, I, D) to test.

I’ll choose AEGIS first because I is a common vowel and G is a common consonant.",Guess 3: AEGIS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) E(-) G(x) I(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the repeated letters (especially E) will help me identify which letters are in the word regardless of their position. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

Looking for words:
1. A S E _ _: ASE??
   - ASEAN (but N isn't confirmed)
   - ASHEN (but O is excluded, H isn't confirmed)
   - ASIDE (but I and D aren't confirmed)
   - ASKER (but R is excluded)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)
   - ASIDE (I,D not confirmed)
   - ASKER (R excluded)
   - ASSET (T not confirmed)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)

2. A S _ E _:
   - ASKEE (but K,E,E - double E possible, but E is already in word)
   - ASHEE (H,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

3. A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (B,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (C,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (D,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

   - A I S E T (I,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A J S E T (J,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A K S E T (K,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

   - A M S E T (M,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)
   - A P E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Q E R S (R is excluded)
   - A R E R S (R is excluded)
   - A S E R S (R is excluded)
   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)
   - A G E E S (same)
   - A H E E S (same)
   - A I E E S (same)
   - A J E E S (same)
   - A K E E S (same)
   - A L E E S (same)
   - A M E E S (same)
   - A N E E S (same)
   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)
   - A S E E S (S already in 2nd, but this would have S in 5th - possible)
   - A T E E S (same)
   - A V E E S (same)
   - A W E E S (same)
   - A X E E S (same)
   - A Y E E S (same)
   - A Z E E S (same)

- A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (T not confirmed)

   - A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
   - A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
   - A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)

- A S E _ _:
   - A S E T S (T,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E M S (M,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E L S (L,S - but S is already in 2nd)

   - A S E D S (D,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E C S (C,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E B S (B,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E N S (N,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E G S (G,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E V S (V,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E W S (W,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E X S (X,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)
- A S E T P (P not confirmed)
- A S E T D (D not confirmed)
- A S E T B (B not confirmed)
- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S
- A G E S
- A H E S
- A I E S
- A J E S
- A K E S
- A L E S
- A M E S
- A N E S
- A P E S
- A Q E S
- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)
- A H E S (but 4 letters)
- A I E S (but 4 letters)
- A K E S (but 4 letters)
- A L E S (but 4 letters)
- A M E S (but 4 letters)
- A N E S (but 4 letters)
- A P E S (but 4 letters)
- A S E S (but 4 letters)
- A T E S (but 4 letters)
- A V E S (but 4 letters)
- A W E S (but 4 letters)
- A Y E S (but 4 letters)

This is problematic. Maybe I need to think of words where E is in 3rd or 2nd.

Let me try A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)

   - A C E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A D E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

   - A Y E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Z E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)
A S T E B (B not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)
A P E S T (P not confirmed)
A N E S T (N not confirmed)
A M E S T (M not confirmed)
A D E S T (D not confirmed)

A V E S T (V not confirmed)
A W E S T (W not confirmed)
A X E S T (X not confirmed)
A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)

A S I W E (W not confirmed)
A S I X E (X not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)

A S W E T (W,T not confirmed)
A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and O are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5, and without R or O. A good candidate is ""ASHEN"" which fits these constraints and introduces new letters (H, N) for testing.

<guess>ASHEN</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ASHEN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) H(x) E(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is locked in the first position.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from ASHEN it was in position 2 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 4 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from ASHEN it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 5 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N.
5. Letters still allowed (besides A, S, E): basically every other letter.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- contains S (in position 3 or 5)
- contains E (in position 2 or 4)
- does not contain R, O, H, N

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4)  
Pattern 2: A E _ _ S  (E in 2, S in 5)  
Pattern 3: A _ E S _  (E in 3, S in 4)  
Pattern 4: A _ E _ S  (E in 3, S in 5)  
Pattern 5: A _ _ E S  (E in 4, S in 5)

Now test common English words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A E _ S _ → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (valid, uses G, I) — let’s keep this.

Pattern 2: A E _ _ S → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (already considered)  
   AEONS (O is out)  
   AEDES (double E, but valid; letters D, S allowed) — keep.

Pattern 3: A _ E S _ → A?ES?  
   ALES? (L, E, S) — but we need 5 letters.  
   AMEES (double E) — keep.  
   APECS (C allowed) — keep.

Pattern 4: A _ E _ S → A?E?S  
   ABESS (double S) — keep.  
   AGESS (double S) — keep.

Pattern 5: A _ _ E S → A??ES  
   ABLES (B, L allowed) — keep.

Among these, AEGIS and AEDES seem most promising because they introduce new letters (G, I, D) to test.

I’ll choose AEGIS first because I is a common vowel and G is a common consonant.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the repeated letters (especially E) will help me identify which letters are in the word regardless of their position. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

1. A S E _ _: ASE??

   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)
   - A P E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Q E R S (R is excluded)
   - A R E R S (R is excluded)
   - A S E R S (R is excluded)
   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)

   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)

   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)

- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S

- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)
A S T E B (B not confirmed)
A S T E G (G not confirmed)
A S T E F (F not confirmed)

A S T E V (V not confirmed)
A S T E W (W not confirmed)
A S T E X (X not confirmed)
A S T E Y (Y not confirmed)
A S T E Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)
A P E S T (P not confirmed)
A N E S T (N not confirmed)
A M E S T (M not confirmed)
A D E S T (D not confirmed)
A C E S T (C not confirmed)

A V E S T (V not confirmed)
A W E S T (W not confirmed)
A X E S T (X not confirmed)
A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)
A S I P E (P not confirmed)
A S I M E (M not confirmed)
A S I L E (L not confirmed)
A S I G E (G not confirmed)
A S I F E (F not confirmed)
A S I H E (H not confirmed)
A S I V E (V not confirmed)
A S I W E (W not confirmed)
A S I X E (X not confirmed)
A S I Y E (Y not confirmed)
A S I Z E (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)
A S C E T (C,T not confirmed)
A S B E T (B,T not confirmed)
A S D E T (D,T not confirmed)
A S F E T (F,T not confirmed)
A S G E T (G,T not confirmed)
A S M E T (M,T not confirmed)
A S N E T (N,T not confirmed)
A S V E T (V,T not confirmed)
A S W E T (W,T not confirmed)
A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and O are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5, and without R or O. A good candidate is ""ASHEN"" which fits these constraints and introduces new letters (H, N) for testing.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ASHEN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) H(x) E(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is locked in the first position.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from ASHEN it was in position 2 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 4 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from ASHEN it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 5 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N.
5. Letters still allowed (besides A, S, E): basically every other letter.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- contains S (in position 3 or 5)
- contains E (in position 2 or 4)
- does not contain R, O, H, N

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4)  
Pattern 2: A E _ _ S  (E in 2, S in 5)  
Pattern 3: A _ E S _  (E in 3, S in 4)  
Pattern 4: A _ E _ S  (E in 3, S in 5)  
Pattern 5: A _ _ E S  (E in 4, S in 5)

Now test common English words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A E _ S _ → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (valid, uses G, I) — let’s keep this.

Pattern 2: A E _ _ S → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (already considered)  
   AEONS (O is out)  
   AEDES (double E, but valid; letters D, S allowed) — keep.

Pattern 3: A _ E S _ → A?ES?  
   ALES? (L, E, S) — but we need 5 letters.  
   AMEES (double E) — keep.  
   APECS (C allowed) — keep.

Pattern 4: A _ E _ S → A?E?S  
   ABESS (double S) — keep.  
   AGESS (double S) — keep.

Pattern 5: A _ _ E S → A??ES  
   ABLES (B, L allowed) — keep.

Among these, AEGIS and AEDES seem most promising because they introduce new letters (G, I, D) to test.

I’ll choose AEGIS first because I is a common vowel and G is a common consonant.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: AEGIS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) E(-) G(x) I(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now have:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. S is in the word and is now known to be in position 5 (from AEGIS feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from ASHEN: E(-) at 4, from AEGIS: E(-) at 2; and it was already excluded from 5 in AROSE).  
   Therefore E must be in position 3.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N, G, I.
5. Allowed letters: all others except the above.

Current pattern: A _ E _ S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- has E in position 3
- has S in position 5
- does not contain R, O, H, N, G, I

Possible middle letters (positions 2 and 4) must be from remaining consonants/vowels.  
Let’s list possibilities for positions 2 and 4:

Position 2: any letter except A, E, S, R, O, H, N, G, I  
Position 4: same set

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word matching A _ E _ S.

Possible candidates:
- ABETS (B, T) – but T is allowed, B is allowed.  
- ACETS (C, T) – but C and T allowed.  
- ADEPT (D, P) – but ends with T, not S.  
- ALEPS (L, P) – but P allowed, L allowed.  
- AMECS (M, C) – but C allowed, M allowed.  
- APENS (P, N) – but N is ruled out.  
- AWEBS (W, B) – but B allowed, W allowed.  
- AFEWS (F, W) – but F allowed, W allowed.  
- ADEPS (D, P) – but ends with S.  
- ADEWS (D, W) – but ends with S.  
- ALEPS (L, P) – already noted.  
- ABLES (B, L) – ends with S.  
- ACLES (C, L) – ends with S.  
- ADEWS (D, W) – ends with S.  
- AWEPS (W, P) – ends with S.  
- AFEPS (F, P) – ends with S.

Among these, the most common English word that fits is ABLES (meaning ""able to do""), but that uses L which hasn't been ruled out, and B hasn't been ruled out.

Another is ACLES (a Scottish word for ""a sharp blow""), but it's less common.

ABLES seems the best choice here.

Let me verify: A(✓) B _ E L S – positions: A(1), B(2), E(3), L(4), S(5).  
Letters used: A, B, E, L, S.  
All required conditions met: A fixed, E in 3, S in 5, no ruled-out letters.

Therefore, ABLES is a valid next guess.

We now have four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
2. ASHEN → A(✓) S(-) H(x) E(-) N(-)
3. AEGIS → A(✓) E(-) G(x) I(x) S(✓)
4. ABLES → A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-) S(✓)

What we know for certain:
- Position 1: A (locked)
- Position 5: S (locked)
- The word must contain E, and E is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from AEGIS and ABLES feedback).
- However, position 4 is the only remaining position where E could logically fit (since positions 2 and 3 are excluded), but E was already excluded from position 4 in AEGIS feedback (E(-) at position 4). This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From ABLES:
- A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
This means:
- A is correct in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" for position 4).
- S is correct in position 5.

So E must be in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded, and position 1 and 5 are taken by A and S respectively).

Thus the pattern is: A _ E _ S

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N, G, I, B, L

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4: C, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching A _ E _ S with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- ACETS (but C and T are allowed)
- ADEPT (but ends with T, not S)
- AFEWS (but ends with S, W is allowed)
- AWEPS (but ends with S, W and P are allowed)
- ADEWS (but ends with S, D and W are allowed)
- ALEPS (but L is excluded)
- AMECS (but ends with S, M and C are allowed)
- APENS (but N is excluded)
- AWEBS (but ends with S, W and B are allowed, but B is excluded)

From these, the most common valid word is ACETS (short for acetate or acetabulum), but it's less common. Another is AFEWS (meaning ""a few""), which is valid.

However, let me check if there's a more common word. Another possibility is AWECS (but not a valid word). 

The best valid option seems AFEWS.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) F _ E W S
- Letters: A, F, E, W, S
- None of these letters are in the excluded list.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""a small number"").

Therefore, AFEWS is the next logical guess.

From ABLES:
- A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
This means:
- A is correct in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" for position 4).
- S is correct in position 5.

So E must be in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded, and position 1 and 5 are taken by A and S respectively).

Thus the pattern is: A _ E _ S

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N, G, I, B, L

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4: C, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching A _ E _ S with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- ACETS (but C and T are allowed)
- ADEPT (but ends with T, not S)
- AFEWS (but ends with S, W is allowed)
- AWEPS (but ends with S, W and P are allowed)
- ADEWS (but ends with S, D and W are allowed)
- ALEPS (but L is excluded)
- AMECS (but ends with S, M and C are allowed)
- APENS (but N is excluded)
- AWEBS (but ends with S, W and B are allowed, but B is excluded)

From these, the most common valid word is ACETS (short for acetate or acetabulum), but it's less common. Another is AFEWS (meaning ""a few""), which is valid.

However, let me check if there's a more common word. Another possibility is AWECS (but not a valid word). 

The best valid option seems AFEWS.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) F _ E W S
- Letters: A, F, E, W, S
- None of these letters are in the excluded list.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""a small number"").

Therefore, AFEWS is the next logical guess.",Guess 5: AFEWS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) F(x) E(✓) W(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the repeated letters (especially E) will help me identify which letters are in the word regardless of their position. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in the 4th position and E not in the 5th position. Also, no R or O.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _
S must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E in AROSE feedback, but E is not in 5th). Wait, E is not in 5th, so 5th could be S? But S was in 4th in AROSE and marked -, so S can't be in 4th, but could be 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, E is in word but not in 5th, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Let me think of words:
- A S _ _ E (but E can't be 5th, so this is invalid)
- A _ S _ E (invalid, same reason)
- A _ _ S E (invalid)
- A E _ S _ (possible)
- A _ E S _ (possible)
- A _ _ E S (possible)

Looking for words:
- A F E S T (but T isn't confirmed)
- A M E S T (no)
- A C E S T (no)
- A B E S T (no)
- A D E S T (no)
- A P E S T (no)
- A L E S T (no)
- A N E S T (no)
- A R E S T (but R is excluded)
- A S E N T (no)
- A S E T _ (no)
- A S _ E _ (no)
- A S _ _ E (no)
- A _ S E _ (no)
- A _ S _ E (no)
- A _ _ S E (no)
- A E S T _ (no)
- A E _ S _ (possible: A E S T _ but T isn't confirmed)
- A E _ _ S (possible: A E R I S but R is excluded)
- A E D I S (no)
- A E G I S (no)
- A E L I S (no)
- A E M I S (no)
- A E N I S (no)
- A E P I S (no)
- A E T I S (no)
- A E _ _ S (need to find words ending with S)
- A _ E _ S (possible: A B E S T but T isn't confirmed)
- A _ _ E S (possible: A B E E S but E is repeated and position unknown)

Wait, let's think differently. We know:
- A _ _ _ _
- Must contain S and E
- S not in 4th
- E not in 5th
- No R or O

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let's try:
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd)
- A _ S _ E (E in 5th but E can't be 5th - invalid)
- A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
- A _ A S E (invalid - A is already 1st)
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ E _ S (E in 3rd, S in 5th - possible)

So possible structures:
1. A S E _ _
2. A S _ E _
3. A _ S E _
4. A _ E _ S

Looking for words:
1. A S E _ _: ASE??
   - ASEAN (but N isn't confirmed)
   - ASHEN (but O is excluded, H isn't confirmed)
   - ASIDE (but I and D aren't confirmed)
   - ASKER (but R is excluded)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)
   - ASIDE (I,D not confirmed)
   - ASKER (R excluded)
   - ASSET (T not confirmed)
   - ASHEN (H,N not confirmed)

2. A S _ E _:
   - ASKEE (but K,E,E - double E possible, but E is already in word)
   - ASHEE (H,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASPEE (P,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASLEE (L,E,E - but E is already in word)
   - ASKEE (K,E,E - but E is already in word)

3. A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (B,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (C,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (D,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (F,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (G,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A H S E T (H,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A I S E T (I,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A J S E T (J,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A K S E T (K,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A L S E T (L,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A M S E T (M,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A N S E T (N,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A P S E T (P,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Q S E T (Q,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A R S E T (R is excluded)
   - A S S E T (S,S,E,T - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A T S E T (T,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A V S E T (V,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A W S E T (W,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A X S E T (X,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Y S E T (Y,S,E,T - T not confirmed)
   - A Z S E T (Z,S,E,T - T not confirmed)

4. A _ E _ S:
   - A B E R S (R is excluded)
   - A C E R S (R is excluded)
   - A D E R S (R is excluded)
   - A F E R S (R is excluded)
   - A G E R S (R is excluded)
   - A H E R S (R is excluded)
   - A I E R S (R is excluded)
   - A J E R S (R is excluded)
   - A K E R S (R is excluded)
   - A L E R S (R is excluded)
   - A M E R S (R is excluded)
   - A N E R S (R is excluded)
   - A P E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Q E R S (R is excluded)
   - A R E R S (R is excluded)
   - A S E R S (R is excluded)
   - A T E R S (R is excluded)
   - A V E R S (R is excluded)
   - A W E R S (R is excluded)
   - A X E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Y E R S (R is excluded)
   - A Z E R S (R is excluded)

Hmm, none of these seem promising. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative approach: Since A is fixed, and we need S and E somewhere, let's try:
- A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
- A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
- A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
- A S _ E _ (E in 4th, S in 2nd - possible)
- A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)

Looking for words:
- A _ _ E S:
   - A B E E S (but E is already in word, double E possible)
   - A C E E S (same)
   - A D E E S (same)
   - A F E E S (same)
   - A G E E S (same)
   - A H E E S (same)
   - A I E E S (same)
   - A J E E S (same)
   - A K E E S (same)
   - A L E E S (same)
   - A M E E S (same)
   - A N E E S (same)
   - A P E E S (same)
   - A Q E E S (same)
   - A R E E S (R excluded)
   - A S E E S (S already in 2nd, but this would have S in 5th - possible)
   - A T E E S (same)
   - A V E E S (same)
   - A W E E S (same)
   - A X E E S (same)
   - A Y E E S (same)
   - A Z E E S (same)

- A _ S E _:
   - A B S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A C S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A D S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A F S E T (T not confirmed)
   - A G S E T (T not confirmed)

   - A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
   - A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
   - A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
   - A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)
   - A S C E T (C,T not confirmed)
   - A S B E T (B,T not confirmed)
   - A S D E T (D,T not confirmed)
   - A S F E T (F,T not confirmed)

- A S E _ _:
   - A S E T S (T,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E M S (M,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E L S (L,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E P S (P,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E H S (H,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E D S (D,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E C S (C,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E B S (B,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E N S (N,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E G S (G,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E V S (V,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E W S (W,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E X S (X,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Y S (Y,S - but S is already in 2nd)
   - A S E Z S (Z,S - but S is already in 2nd)

This seems stuck. Maybe I should try a word that uses S and E in positions allowed by the feedback, and uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for words starting with A, containing S and E, no R or O, S not in 4th, E not in 5th.

Possible candidates:
- A S E T S (but S is repeated)
- A S E T H (but H not confirmed)
- A S E T T (but T not confirmed)
- A S E T N (N not confirmed)
- A S E T M (M not confirmed)
- A S E T P (P not confirmed)
- A S E T D (D not confirmed)
- A S E T B (B not confirmed)
- A S E T G (G not confirmed)
- A S E T F (F not confirmed)
- A S E T V (V not confirmed)
- A S E T W (W not confirmed)
- A S E T X (X not confirmed)
- A S E T Y (Y not confirmed)
- A S E T Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in different positions.

Alternative structure: A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)
A _ S _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A S _ _ E (E in 5th - invalid)
A _ _ S E (E in 5th - invalid)

So the only possible structure seems to be A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th).

Looking for words ending with ES:
- A B E S (but 4 letters)
- A C E S
- A D E S
- A F E S
- A G E S
- A H E S
- A I E S
- A J E S
- A K E S
- A L E S
- A M E S
- A N E S
- A P E S
- A Q E S
- A R E S (R excluded)
- A S E S
- A T E S
- A V E S
- A W E S
- A X E S
- A Y E S
- A Z E S

Most of these are not valid 5-letter words. The valid ones are:
- A C E S (but 4 letters)
- A D E S (but 4 letters)
- A F E S (but 4 letters)
- A G E S (but 4 letters)
- A H E S (but 4 letters)
- A I E S (but 4 letters)
- A K E S (but 4 letters)
- A L E S (but 4 letters)
- A M E S (but 4 letters)
- A N E S (but 4 letters)
- A P E S (but 4 letters)
- A S E S (but 4 letters)
- A T E S (but 4 letters)
- A V E S (but 4 letters)
- A W E S (but 4 letters)
- A Y E S (but 4 letters)

This is problematic. Maybe I need to think of words where E is in 3rd or 2nd.

Let me try A _ E S _ (E in 3rd, S in 4th - but S can't be 4th - invalid)
A _ S E _ (E in 4th, S in 3rd - possible)
A S E _ _ (E in 3rd, S in 2nd - possible)
A _ _ E S (E in 4th, S in 5th - possible)

   - A C E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A D E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

   - A X E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Y E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)
   - A Z E E S (E,E - but E is already in word)

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters.

Let me try A S T E N (but N not confirmed)
A S T E P (P not confirmed)
A S T E D (D not confirmed)
A S T E B (B not confirmed)
A S T E G (G not confirmed)
A S T E F (F not confirmed)

A S T E V (V not confirmed)
A S T E W (W not confirmed)
A S T E X (X not confirmed)
A S T E Y (Y not confirmed)
A S T E Z (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A L E S T (but L not confirmed)
A P E S T (P not confirmed)
A N E S T (N not confirmed)
A M E S T (M not confirmed)
A D E S T (D not confirmed)
A C E S T (C not confirmed)

A V E S T (V not confirmed)
A W E S T (W not confirmed)
A X E S T (X not confirmed)
A Y E S T (Y not confirmed)
A Z E S T (Z not confirmed)

This is not working. Maybe I need to think of words with S and E in positions not yet ruled out, and use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Let me try A S I D E (but D not confirmed)
A S I N E (N not confirmed)
A S I C E (C not confirmed)
A S I P E (P not confirmed)
A S I M E (M not confirmed)
A S I L E (L not confirmed)

A S I V E (V not confirmed)
A S I W E (W not confirmed)
A S I X E (X not confirmed)
A S I Y E (Y not confirmed)
A S I Z E (Z not confirmed)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I should try A S H E N (H,N not confirmed)
A S P E N (P,N not confirmed)
A S L E T (L,T not confirmed)
A S K E T (K,T not confirmed)
A S C E T (C,T not confirmed)

A S W E T (W,T not confirmed)
A S X E T (X,T not confirmed)
A S Y E T (Y,T not confirmed)
A S Z E T (Z,T not confirmed)

The most promising seems A S H E N (ASHEN) - but H and N are not confirmed yet. However, it's a valid word and might give us information about H and N.

Let me try A S H E N as the second guess.Based on the feedback from AROSE:
- A is correct in first position.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and O are not in the word.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S and E, with S not in position 4 and E not in position 5, and without R or O. A good candidate is ""ASHEN"" which fits these constraints and introduces new letters (H, N) for testing.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is locked in the first position.
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from ASHEN it was in position 2 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 4 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore S must be in position 3 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from ASHEN it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and from AROSE it was in position 5 and also marked “-”).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N.
5. Letters still allowed (besides A, S, E): basically every other letter.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- contains S (in position 3 or 5)
- contains E (in position 2 or 4)
- does not contain R, O, H, N

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4)  
Pattern 2: A E _ _ S  (E in 2, S in 5)  
Pattern 3: A _ E S _  (E in 3, S in 4)  
Pattern 4: A _ E _ S  (E in 3, S in 5)  
Pattern 5: A _ _ E S  (E in 4, S in 5)

Now test common English words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 1: A E _ S _ → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (valid, uses G, I) — let’s keep this.

Pattern 2: A E _ _ S → AE…S…  
   AEGIS (already considered)  
   AEONS (O is out)  
   AEDES (double E, but valid; letters D, S allowed) — keep.

Pattern 3: A _ E S _ → A?ES?  
   ALES? (L, E, S) — but we need 5 letters.  
   AMEES (double E) — keep.  
   APECS (C allowed) — keep.

Pattern 4: A _ E _ S → A?E?S  
   ABESS (double S) — keep.  
   AGESS (double S) — keep.

Pattern 5: A _ _ E S → A??ES  
   ABLES (B, L allowed) — keep.

Among these, AEGIS and AEDES seem most promising because they introduce new letters (G, I, D) to test.

I’ll choose AEGIS first because I is a common vowel and G is a common consonant.

From the three rounds we now have:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. S is in the word and is now known to be in position 5 (from AEGIS feedback: S(✓)).
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from ASHEN: E(-) at 4, from AEGIS: E(-) at 2; and it was already excluded from 5 in AROSE).  
   Therefore E must be in position 3.
4. Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N, G, I.
5. Allowed letters: all others except the above.

Current pattern: A _ E _ S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- has E in position 3
- has S in position 5
- does not contain R, O, H, N, G, I

Possible middle letters (positions 2 and 4) must be from remaining consonants/vowels.  
Let’s list possibilities for positions 2 and 4:

Position 2: any letter except A, E, S, R, O, H, N, G, I  
Position 4: same set

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word matching A _ E _ S.

Possible candidates:
- ABETS (B, T) – but T is allowed, B is allowed.  
- ACETS (C, T) – but C and T allowed.  
- ADEPT (D, P) – but ends with T, not S.  
- ALEPS (L, P) – but P allowed, L allowed.  
- AMECS (M, C) – but C allowed, M allowed.  
- APENS (P, N) – but N is ruled out.  
- AWEBS (W, B) – but B allowed, W allowed.  
- AFEWS (F, W) – but F allowed, W allowed.  
- ADEPS (D, P) – but ends with S.  
- ADEWS (D, W) – but ends with S.  
- ALEPS (L, P) – already noted.  
- ABLES (B, L) – ends with S.  
- ACLES (C, L) – ends with S.  
- ADEWS (D, W) – ends with S.  
- AWEPS (W, P) – ends with S.  
- AFEPS (F, P) – ends with S.

Among these, the most common English word that fits is ABLES (meaning ""able to do""), but that uses L which hasn't been ruled out, and B hasn't been ruled out.

Another is ACLES (a Scottish word for ""a sharp blow""), but it's less common.

ABLES seems the best choice here.

Let me verify: A(✓) B _ E L S – positions: A(1), B(2), E(3), L(4), S(5).  
Letters used: A, B, E, L, S.  
All required conditions met: A fixed, E in 3, S in 5, no ruled-out letters.

Therefore, ABLES is a valid next guess.

We now have four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
2. ASHEN → A(✓) S(-) H(x) E(-) N(-)
3. AEGIS → A(✓) E(-) G(x) I(x) S(✓)
4. ABLES → A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-) S(✓)

What we know for certain:
- Position 1: A (locked)
- Position 5: S (locked)
- The word must contain E, and E is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from AEGIS and ABLES feedback).
- However, position 4 is the only remaining position where E could logically fit (since positions 2 and 3 are excluded), but E was already excluded from position 4 in AEGIS feedback (E(-) at position 4). This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From ABLES:
- A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
This means:
- A is correct in position 1.
- B is NOT in the word.
- L is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" for position 4).
- S is correct in position 5.

So E must be in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded, and position 1 and 5 are taken by A and S respectively).

Thus the pattern is: A _ E _ S

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, H, N, G, I, B, L

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4: C, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching A _ E _ S with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- ACETS (but C and T are allowed)
- ADEPT (but ends with T, not S)
- AFEWS (but ends with S, W is allowed)
- AWEPS (but ends with S, W and P are allowed)
- ADEWS (but ends with S, D and W are allowed)
- ALEPS (but L is excluded)
- AMECS (but ends with S, M and C are allowed)
- APENS (but N is excluded)
- AWEBS (but ends with S, W and B are allowed, but B is excluded)

From these, the most common valid word is ACETS (short for acetate or acetabulum), but it's less common. Another is AFEWS (meaning ""a few""), which is valid.

However, let me check if there's a more common word. Another possibility is AWECS (but not a valid word). 

The best valid option seems AFEWS.

Let me verify:
- A(✓) F _ E W S
- Letters: A, F, E, W, S
- None of these letters are in the excluded list.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word (meaning ""a small number"").

Therefore, AFEWS is the next logical guess.

From the five rounds we now have the following locked-in letters:

And we know these additional facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, H, N, G, I, B, L, F, W
- Positions 2 and 4 must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet.

Remaining letters (excluding the known absent ones and the fixed A, E, S):
C, D, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form A _ E _ S.

Looking through common English words fitting this pattern:
- ACETS (valid, but C and T are allowed)
- ADEPT (ends with T, not S)
- AMECS (ends with S, M and C allowed)
- APENS (N is excluded)
- AWECS (invalid)
- ATECS (invalid)
- ADEPS (ends with S, D and P allowed)
- APEKS (ends with S, P and K allowed)

The most common valid word among these is ACETS, but it's a bit obscure. Another is ADEPS (short for ""deposits""), but that's also uncommon. 

However, ""AMECS"" is not a standard English word. ""APENS"" is invalid (N excluded). 

The only clear valid word left is ACETS, but since we have very few options, let's check if there's another.

Looking again, ""AWECS"" is invalid. ""ATECS"" is invalid. 

Actually, the word ""ACETS"" is listed in dictionaries as the plural of ""acet"" (though rare), and ""ADEPS"" is also rare. 

But there's another word: ""AWECS"" is invalid. 

Wait, let me think of more common words. 

Actually, the word ""AWECS"" is invalid. 

Upon reflection, the only remaining valid word that fits is ""ACETS"", but since we've exhausted most possibilities, let's check if ""AWECS"" is valid - no, it's not.

Another possibility is ""AWEPS"" but W is excluded. 

Thus, the only remaining valid word seems to be ""ACETS"", but since we have very few options left, let's verify:

ACETS: A(✓) C E(✓) T S(✓) - but this would be positions 1,3,5 locked as A E S, but our pattern is A _ E _ S. 

Wait, no: ACETS is A-C-E-T-S, which would be positions 1,3,5 as A, E, S - but that's exactly the pattern we need: A _ E _ S with C and T in positions 2 and 4.

Thus, ACETS is the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints.
