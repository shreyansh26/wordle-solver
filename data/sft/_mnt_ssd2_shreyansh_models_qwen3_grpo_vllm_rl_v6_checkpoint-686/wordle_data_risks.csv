For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and consonants that appear frequently.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
Letters confirmed IN the word: R, S, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2)  
- S is confirmed in position 5 (from guess 2)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with remaining letters to place: R and I (and possibly others we haven’t tried yet).

We also know we still need two more letters, none of which can be A, O, E, T, P.

Good remaining common letters: N, L, D, U, C, M, G, B, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- ends in S  
- uses R and I in new positions  
- introduces two new, common, unused letters.

One strong candidate is “DRIPS”:
- D (new)  
- R (allowed in position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3)  
- P (already ruled out – oops!)  
- S (correct in position 5)

P is already excluded, so DRIPS is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRISP” – P is excluded.

Next: “BRISK”:
- B (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- S (position 4 – but S cannot be in position 4, it must be in 5)  
So BRISK is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next: “FRISK” – same problem, S in position 4.

Next: “GRINS”:
- G (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- N (new)

This satisfies every constraint:
- Ends with S in position 5  
- R is in position 2 (never ruled out)  
- I is in position 3 (never ruled out)  
- Uses two new letters G and N  
- No excluded letters (A, O, E, T, P) appear.

So GRINS looks perfect.

- I: cannot be in position 3 (from guesses 2, 3)  
- S: must be in position 5 (✓ in guess 2 and 3)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S

We need two more letters, none of which are in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Constraints:
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is ruled out)  
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 4 (since 3 is ruled out)  
- They can’t overlap.

Possible placements:

5. R in 4, I in 1: I _ _ R S  
6. R in 4, I in 2: _ I _ R S  

Let’s pick a word that uses R and I in one of these patterns and adds two new common letters.

Option 1: R I _ _ S – needs two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
   - RI _ _ S: “RIFTS” – but T is excluded.  
   - RIBRS – invalid (repeats R).  
   - RILMS – not a word.

   - “DIRKS” – D and K are new; “DIRKS” is a valid word (plural of dirk, a dagger).  

DIRKS satisfies:
- Ends with S in position 5.  
- R in position 3 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).  
- Uses two new letters D and K.  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, DIRKS is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and consonants that appear frequently.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is not in the word at all (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R somewhere other than position 2.
- Contains S somewhere other than position 4.

Next I want to:
1. Keep R and S (confirmed letters) in new positions.
2. Introduce other common consonants and vowels not yet tried (like I, U, T, N, L, D).
3. Avoid A, O, E.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (confirmed, now in position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- P (new consonant)
- S (confirmed, now in position 5)

This places R in a new spot (position 2) and S in a new spot (position 5), while adding T, I, and P which are all common and untested.

Guess 2: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
Letters confirmed IN the word: R, S, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2)  
- S is confirmed in position 5 (from guess 2)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with remaining letters to place: R and I (and possibly others we haven’t tried yet).

We also know we still need two more letters, none of which can be A, O, E, T, P.

Good remaining common letters: N, L, D, U, C, M, G, B, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- ends in S  
- uses R and I in new positions  
- introduces two new, common, unused letters.

One strong candidate is “DRIPS”:
- D (new)  
- R (allowed in position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3)  
- P (already ruled out – oops!)  
- S (correct in position 5)

P is already excluded, so DRIPS is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRISP” – P is excluded.

Next: “BRISK”:
- B (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- S (position 4 – but S cannot be in position 4, it must be in 5)  
So BRISK is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next: “FRISK” – same problem, S in position 4.

Next: “GRINS”:
- G (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- N (new)  
- S (position 5 – correct)  

This satisfies every constraint:
- Ends with S in position 5  
- R is in position 2 (never ruled out)  
- I is in position 3 (never ruled out)  
- Uses two new letters G and N  
- No excluded letters (A, O, E, T, P) appear.

So GRINS looks perfect.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S

6. R in 4, I in 2: _ I _ R S

   - “RIMPS” – P excluded.  
   - “RILKS” – K is new, but “RILKS” is obscure.

   - “DIRKS” – D and K are new; “DIRKS” is a valid word (plural of dirk, a dagger).  

DIRKS satisfies:
- Ends with S in position 5.  
- R in position 3 (allowed).

From the new feedback on DIRKS:

- R (position 3) is in the word but in the WRONG position (-).

- Position 3: must contain R, but NOT in position 3 (so R must be in position 1)
- Position 1: must be R (since R must be somewhere and position 3 is the only place left, but it's marked wrong there, so it must be in position 1)

The only letter left is position 3. From previous guesses we know the letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P, G, N, D. Common remaining letters: B, C, F, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, especially vowels and consonants that appear frequently.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) is not in the word at all (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- Contains R somewhere other than position 2.
- Contains S somewhere other than position 4.

Next I want to:
1. Keep R and S (confirmed letters) in new positions.
2. Introduce other common consonants and vowels not yet tried (like I, U, T, N, L, D).
3. Avoid A, O, E.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (confirmed, now in position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- P (new consonant)
- S (confirmed, now in position 5)

This places R in a new spot (position 2) and S in a new spot (position 5), while adding T, I, and P which are all common and untested.

Guess 2: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P  
Letters confirmed IN the word: R, S, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2)  
- S is confirmed in position 5 (from guess 2)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with remaining letters to place: R and I (and possibly others we haven’t tried yet).

We also know we still need two more letters, none of which can be A, O, E, T, P.

Good remaining common letters: N, L, D, U, C, M, G, B, F, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- ends in S  
- uses R and I in new positions  
- introduces two new, common, unused letters.

One strong candidate is “DRIPS”:
- D (new)  
- R (allowed in position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3)  
- P (already ruled out – oops!)  
- S (correct in position 5)

P is already excluded, so DRIPS is invalid.

Next candidate: “CRISP” – P is excluded.

Next: “BRISK”:
- B (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- S (position 4 – but S cannot be in position 4, it must be in 5)  
So BRISK is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next: “FRISK” – same problem, S in position 4.

Next: “GRINS”:
- G (new)  
- R (position 2 – allowed)  
- I (position 3 – allowed)  
- N (new)  
- S (position 5 – correct)  

This satisfies every constraint:
- Ends with S in position 5  
- R is in position 2 (never ruled out)  
- I is in position 3 (never ruled out)  
- Uses two new letters G and N  
- No excluded letters (A, O, E, T, P) appear.

So GRINS looks perfect.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, P, G, N

- I: cannot be in position 3 (from guesses 2, 3)  
- S: must be in position 5 (✓ in guess 2 and 3)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
with remaining letters to place: R and I (and possibly others not yet tested).

We need two more letters, none of which are in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Constraints:
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is ruled out)  
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 4 (since 3 is ruled out)  
- They can’t overlap.

Possible placements:
1. R in 1, I in 2: R I _ _ S  
2. R in 1, I in 4: R _ I _ S  
3. R in 3, I in 1: I _ R _ S  
4. R in 3, I in 2: _ I R _ S  
5. R in 4, I in 1: I _ _ R S  
6. R in 4, I in 2: _ I _ R S  

Let’s pick a word that uses R and I in one of these patterns and adds two new common letters.

Option 1: R I _ _ S – needs two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
   - RI _ _ S: “RIFTS” – but T is excluded.  
   - RIBRS – invalid (repeats R).  
   - RILMS – not a word.  

Option 2: R _ I _ S  
   - R _ I _ S: “RIVYS” – not a word.  
   - “RIMPS” – P excluded.  
   - “RILKS” – K is new, but “RILKS” is obscure.  

Option 3: I _ R _ S  
   - I _ R _ S: “IRKYS” – not a word.  
   - “IRLUS” – not a word.  
   - “IRLMS” – not a word.  

Option 4: _ I R _ S  
   - _ I R _ S: “CIRKS” – K is new, but “CIRKS” is obscure.  
   - “DIRKS” – D and K are new; “DIRKS” is a valid word (plural of dirk, a dagger).  

DIRKS satisfies:
- Ends with S in position 5.  
- R in position 3 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (allowed).  
- Uses two new letters D and K.  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, DIRKS is a strong next guess.

From the latest feedback on RILKS:

- K (position 4) is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓).

So the pattern is now fully determined: R I _ K S with position 3 being the only unknown. From previous feedback, we know L is not in position 3. Also, we have already excluded: A, O, E, T, P, G, N, D, L. The remaining common letters for position 3 are B, C, F, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting R I _ K S:
- RIFKS – invalid
- RIMKS – invalid
- RIBKS – invalid
- RICKS – valid (plural of rick, though uncommon)
- RIFTS – T is excluded
- RILLS – L is excluded and double L unlikely
- RIKKS – not a word

The only valid word left is RICKS, despite its uncommon usage. Since all other letters are confirmed correct except position 3, and no other letters fit, RICKS must be the answer.
