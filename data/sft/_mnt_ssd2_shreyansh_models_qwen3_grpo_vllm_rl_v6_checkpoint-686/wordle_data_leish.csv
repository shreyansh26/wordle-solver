For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, and O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with S.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere in positions 1-4.

We now know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O are excluded.
3. The letter E appears somewhere in positions 1-4, but not in position 5 (since E(-) in AROSE means E is not in position 5).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 5.
- Include E in a different position (1-4).
- Avoid A, R, O.
- Introduce new common consonants.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try a word like ""LETS"". But that repeats T and S. Instead, ""HEXYS"" is invalid (not a word). ""BESOM"" has O (excluded). ""DENSE"" has E in position 4 (good), ends with S, and introduces D, N, E.

But ""DENSE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. However, it has S in position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if DENSE uses any excluded letters (A, R, O) – it doesn't. So DENSE is a valid next guess.

Another option is ""MENSE"" (but MENSE isn't common). ""TENSE"" is better. TENSE:
- Ends with S (correct).
- E is in position 3 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- T and N are new common consonants.
- No A, R, O.

So TENSE seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, T, N, D, C  (from the three guesses)

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- S (must be in position 5, ✓ twice)  
- E (must appear at least once, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 because it was marked “-” in all those spots in previous guesses)  
  → Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.

Remaining consonants still allowed:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in S (position 5).  
2. Contains E in position 1 or 2.  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
   – E, S allowed.  
   – Choose three consonants from the remaining set, avoiding repeats and ruled-out letters.  
   Common patterns: E L I V E → “ELVES” (V allowed, L allowed, I allowed).  
     Check letters: E, L, I, V, S – none are ruled out.

“ELVES” satisfies every constraint.

Alternative check:  
- E in position 2: _ E _ _ S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, and O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with S.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere in positions 1-4.

We now know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O are excluded.
3. The letter E appears somewhere in positions 1-4, but not in position 5 (since E(-) in AROSE means E is not in position 5).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 5.
- Include E in a different position (1-4).
- Avoid A, R, O.
- Introduce new common consonants.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try a word like ""LETS"". But that repeats T and S. Instead, ""HEXYS"" is invalid (not a word). ""BESOM"" has O (excluded). ""DENSE"" has E in position 4 (good), ends with S, and introduces D, N, E.

But ""DENSE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. However, it has S in position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if DENSE uses any excluded letters (A, R, O) – it doesn't. So DENSE is a valid next guess.

Another option is ""MENSE"" (but MENSE isn't common). ""TENSE"" is better. TENSE:
- Ends with S (correct).
- E is in position 3 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- T and N are new common consonants.
- No A, R, O.

So TENSE seems like a strong second guess.

3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.

Let’s list possible consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to form common words:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ S → e.g., “EERIE” (but has I and E repeats).  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ _ S → e.g., “BEDES” (invalid), “HEXES” (invalid), “LEDES” (invalid).  
- If E is in position 4: _ _ _ E S → e.g., “DICES” (C and I allowed), “FLEES” (L allowed), “MIMES” (M allowed).

Among these, “DICES” fits:
- Ends with S.
- E in position 4.
- Letters D, I, C are still allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.

So “DICES” is a valid next guess.

Let’s tabulate everything we know after four guesses.

Ruled-out letters (x in any position):
A, R, O, T, N, D, C, V

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S (position 5, ✓ in guesses 1, 2, 4)
- E (must appear at least once; it has been “-” in positions 3, 4, 5 across the guesses, so E cannot be there)  
  → E must be in position 1 or 2.

Positions we have tried so far:
1 2 3 4 5
E(-) L(-) V(x) E(-) S(-)  (from ELVES)

That tells us:
- E is not in position 1 (feedback “-” here)  
- E is not in position 4 (feedback “-” in guess 3 and again “-” in guess 4)  
- E is not in position 5 (feedback “-” in guess 1)  

Hence the only remaining place for E is position 2.

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ S  
with E fixed in position 2 and S fixed in position 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need three consonants for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are distinct,
- come from the allowed set,
- form a valid English word.

Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3:
- B E F _ S → “BEFES” (invalid)
- B E G _ S → “BEGES” (invalid)
- F E M _ S → “FEMES” (invalid)
- H E M _ S → “HEMES” (invalid)
- F E X _ S → “FEXES” (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)
- B E G S _ (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)

Instead, let’s list real words fitting _ E _ _ S with allowed letters:
- B E G S _ → no 5-letter word
- B E F S _ → no
- F E M S _ → no
- H E M S _ → “HEMPS” (P allowed)
- P E G S _ → “PEGAS” (invalid)
- F E L S _ → “FELLS” (L allowed, but double L is okay; check letters: F, E, L, L, S – all allowed)
- F E L S → “FELLS” is a valid word.

Check letters in “FELLS”:
F, E, L, L, S – none are ruled out.

Thus, “FELLS” is a valid next guess.

A, R, O, T, N, D, C, V

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S (position 5, ✓ in guesses 1, 2, 4)
- E (must appear at least once; it has been “-” in positions 3, 4, 5 across the guesses, so E cannot be there)  
  → E must be in position 1 or 2.

Positions we have tried so far:
1 2 3 4 5
E(-) L(-) V(x) E(-) S(-)  (from ELVES)

That tells us:
- E is not in position 1 (feedback “-” here)  
- E is not in position 4 (feedback “-” in guess 3 and again “-” in guess 4)  
- E is not in position 5 (feedback “-” in guess 1)  

Hence the only remaining place for E is position 2.

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ S  
with E fixed in position 2 and S fixed in position 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need three consonants for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are distinct,
- come from the allowed set,
- form a valid English word.

Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3:
- B E F _ S → “BEFES” (invalid)
- B E G _ S → “BEGES” (invalid)
- F E M _ S → “FEMES” (invalid)
- H E M _ S → “HEMES” (invalid)
- F E X _ S → “FEXES” (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)
- B E G S _ (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)

Instead, let’s list real words fitting _ E _ _ S with allowed letters:
- B E G S _ → no 5-letter word
- B E F S _ → no
- F E M S _ → no
- H E M S _ → “HEMPS” (P allowed)
- P E G S _ → “PEGAS” (invalid)
- F E L S _ → “FELLS” (L allowed, but double L is okay; check letters: F, E, L, L, S – all allowed)
- F E L S → “FELLS” is a valid word.

Check letters in “FELLS”:
F, E, L, L, S – none are ruled out.

Thus, “FELLS” is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: FELLS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(✓) L(-) L(-) S(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, and O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with S.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere in positions 1-4.

We now know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O are excluded.
3. The letter E appears somewhere in positions 1-4, but not in position 5 (since E(-) in AROSE means E is not in position 5).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 5.
- Include E in a different position (1-4).
- Avoid A, R, O.
- Introduce new common consonants.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try a word like ""LETS"". But that repeats T and S. Instead, ""HEXYS"" is invalid (not a word). ""BESOM"" has O (excluded). ""DENSE"" has E in position 4 (good), ends with S, and introduces D, N, E.

But ""DENSE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. However, it has S in position 5, which is correct. But we need to check if DENSE uses any excluded letters (A, R, O) – it doesn't. So DENSE is a valid next guess.

Another option is ""MENSE"" (but MENSE isn't common). ""TENSE"" is better. TENSE:
- Ends with S (correct).
- E is in position 3 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- T and N are new common consonants.
- No A, R, O.

So TENSE seems like a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)

Guess 2: TENSE  
Feedback: T(x) E(✓) N(x) S(✓) E(-)

Key deductions so far:
1. The word ends with S (S is in position 5 and marked ✓ twice).
2. The letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (since E was marked “-” in both guesses, meaning it’s present but not in those spots).
3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, N.
4. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.

Let’s list possible consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to form common words:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ S → e.g., “EERIE” (but has I and E repeats).  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ _ S → e.g., “BEDES” (invalid), “HEXES” (invalid), “LEDES” (invalid).  
- If E is in position 4: _ _ _ E S → e.g., “DICES” (C and I allowed), “FLEES” (L allowed), “MIMES” (M allowed).

Among these, “DICES” fits:
- Ends with S.
- E in position 4.
- Letters D, I, C are still allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.

So “DICES” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, T, N, D, C  (from the three guesses)

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- S (must be in position 5, ✓ twice)  
- E (must appear at least once, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 because it was marked “-” in all those spots in previous guesses)  
  → Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.

Remaining consonants still allowed:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in S (position 5).  
2. Contains E in position 1 or 2.  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
   – E, S allowed.  
   – Choose three consonants from the remaining set, avoiding repeats and ruled-out letters.  
   Common patterns: E L I V E → “ELVES” (V allowed, L allowed, I allowed).  
     Check letters: E, L, I, V, S – none are ruled out.

“ELVES” satisfies every constraint.

Alternative check:  
- E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
   – Would require a consonant in position 1, e.g., B E G S … but no valid 5-letter word fits without repeating letters or using ruled-out letters.

Therefore, “ELVES” is the only viable next guess.

Let’s tabulate everything we know after four guesses.

Ruled-out letters (x in any position):
A, R, O, T, N, D, C, V

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S (position 5, ✓ in guesses 1, 2, 4)
- E (must appear at least once; it has been “-” in positions 3, 4, 5 across the guesses, so E cannot be there)  
  → E must be in position 1 or 2.

Positions we have tried so far:
1 2 3 4 5
E(-) L(-) V(x) E(-) S(-)  (from ELVES)

That tells us:
- E is not in position 1 (feedback “-” here)  
- E is not in position 4 (feedback “-” in guess 3 and again “-” in guess 4)  
- E is not in position 5 (feedback “-” in guess 1)  

Hence the only remaining place for E is position 2.

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ S  
with E fixed in position 2 and S fixed in position 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need three consonants for positions 1, 3, 4 that:
- are distinct,
- come from the allowed set,
- form a valid English word.

Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3:
- B E F _ S → “BEFES” (invalid)
- B E G _ S → “BEGES” (invalid)
- F E M _ S → “FEMES” (invalid)
- H E M _ S → “HEMES” (invalid)
- F E X _ S → “FEXES” (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)
- B E G S _ (invalid)
- B E G G S (invalid)

Instead, let’s list real words fitting _ E _ _ S with allowed letters:
- B E G S _ → no 5-letter word
- B E F S _ → no
- F E M S _ → no
- H E M S _ → “HEMPS” (P allowed)
- P E G S _ → “PEGAS” (invalid)
- F E L S _ → “FELLS” (L allowed, but double L is okay; check letters: F, E, L, L, S – all allowed)
- F E L S → “FELLS” is a valid word.

Check letters in “FELLS”:
F, E, L, L, S – none are ruled out.

Thus, “FELLS” is a valid next guess.

Key deductions:
- S is still in position 5 (✓ in previous guesses, but this shows “-” because the position is now locked).
- E is in the word and is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L appears but is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (both marked “-”).
- F is ruled out (x).

So the word must be of the form: _ E _ _ S  
with E fixed in position 2 and S fixed in position 5.

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, T, N, D, C, V, F

Letters that must appear:  
E (position 2), S (position 5), and at least one L somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since L is in the word but not in 3 or 4).

Possible positions for L:  
- Position 1: L E _ _ S  
- Position 3: _ E L _ S  

Allowed consonants for remaining blanks (from still-allowed set):  
B, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Check valid words:

1. L E _ _ S  
   - L E G A S → invalid (A ruled out)  
   - L E G I S → “LEGIS” (valid)  
   - L E G A L → ends in L, not S  
   - L E G A M → invalid  
   - L E G I T → invalid (T ruled out)  
   - L E G A L → invalid

   - M E L L S → “MELLS” (valid)  
   - P E L L S → “PELLS” (valid)  

Among these, “LEGIS” is the most straightforward given the constraints. It places L in position 1, E in 2, S in 5, and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “LEGIS”.

   - L E G I S → “LEGIS” (valid)  
   - L E G A L → ends in L, not S  
   - L E G A M → invalid  
   - L E G I T → invalid (T ruled out)  
   - L E G A L → invalid  
   - L E G A S → invalid (A)  
   - L E G I S → “LEGIS” (valid word, letters L,E,G,I,S – all allowed)

2. _ E L _ S  
   - B E L L S → “BELLS” (valid)  
   - H E L L S → invalid (H,E,L,L,S – all allowed, but “HELLS” is a word)  
   - M E L L S → “MELLS” (valid)  
   - P E L L S → “PELLS” (valid)  

Among these, “LEGIS” is the most straightforward given the constraints. It places L in position 1, E in 2, S in 5, and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “LEGIS”.",Guess 6: LEGIS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) G(x) I(-) S(-),FAIL
