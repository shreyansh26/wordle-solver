### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes R but avoids A, O, S. Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, etc. A word like “TREND” fits (ends in E, has R, avoids A/O/S). Let’s check:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE feedback).
2. R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND feedback).
3. T, N, D are not in the word (from TREND feedback).
4. A, O, S are not in the word (from AROSE feedback).
5. E is in the word but not in position 3 (from TREND feedback). However, we already know it must be in position 5, so this is consistent.

Available letters: We can use any letters except A, O, S, T, N, D. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y. Vowels: E (fixed at position 5), I, U.

R must be in positions 1, 4 (since it can't be 2 or 3). Let's try placing R in position 1: R _ _ _ E. We need three consonants for positions 2,3,4 that are not T,N,D,A,O,S. Possible letters: B,C,F,G,H,L,M,P,V,W,Y.

A word like ""RIFLE"" comes to mind: R I F L E. Let's check:
- R in position 1 (new position)
- I (vowel, not yet tested)
- F, L (consonants not yet tested)
- Ends in E (correct)
- No A, O, S, T, N, D.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in RE with R in position 4:  
The only common English word that fits is “C U R V E” (but V is allowed, and positions would be C U R V E – wait, R is in position 3 here, not 4).  
Actually, the pattern is _ _ _ R E, so we need three letters before R.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in “_ _ _ R E” with R in position 4:
- B U R E → 4 letters
- C U R E → 4 letters
- P U R E → 4 letters
- M U R E → 4 letters
- G U R E → 4 letters
- H U R E → 4 letters
- V U R E → 4 letters
- W U R E → 4 letters
- Y U R E → 4 letters

Hmm, none of these are 5 letters. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the R position.

Wait, the feedback on RIFLE shows R(-), meaning R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
From AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
From TREND, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2 (reconfirmed).  
From RIFLE, R was in position 1 and got (-), so R not in 1.  
Thus R can be in positions 3 or 4.

But in TREND, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
In AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
In RIFLE, R was in position 1 and got (-), so R not in 1.  
Thus R must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, from TREND, E was in position 3 and got (-), so E not in 3 (but we know E is in 5, so this is fine).  
From RIFLE, I was in position 2 and got (x), so I is not in word (already known).  
F was in position 3 and got (x), so F is not in word.  
L was in position 4 and got (x), so L is not in word.

So possible letters for positions 1,2,3,4:  
Consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

And R must be in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant for position 4, avoiding banned letters.

Possible word: C H R U E → not valid.  
B R U N E → but N is banned.  
C R U C E → but C is repeated and valid?  
Actually, let’s think of common words:  
B R U C E → valid 5-letter word: BRUCE.  
Check letters: B, R, U, C, E.  
B, C, U, E are allowed (A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L are banned).  
R is in position 2 here, but from AROSE and TREND, R cannot be in position 2.  
So BRUCE is invalid because R would be in position 2.

Next option: C R U C E → R in position 2 again, invalid.  
H R U C E → not a word.  
P R U C E → PRUCE? Not common.  
M U R C E → MURCE? Not a word.  
B U R C E → BURCE? Not a word.  

Now try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E  
We need three letters for positions 1,2,3.  
Possible word: C H U R E → CHURE? Not valid.  
B U R G E → BURGE? Not common.  
P U R G E → PURGE. Valid word.  
Check letters: P, U, R, G, E.  
All allowed (no A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L).  
R is in position 4, which is allowed.  

Thus PURGE is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E and contains R somewhere in positions 1-4. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes R but avoids A, O, S. Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, etc. A word like “TREND” fits (ends in E, has R, avoids A/O/S). Let’s check:
- T, R, E, N, D – none are A, O, or S. R is in position 2 (different from position 2 in AROSE), and E is fixed at position 5. This should give new info.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE feedback).
2. R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND feedback).
3. T, N, D are not in the word (from TREND feedback).
4. A, O, S are not in the word (from AROSE feedback).
5. E is in the word but not in position 3 (from TREND feedback). However, we already know it must be in position 5, so this is consistent.

Available letters: We can use any letters except A, O, S, T, N, D. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y. Vowels: E (fixed at position 5), I, U.

R must be in positions 1, 4 (since it can't be 2 or 3). Let's try placing R in position 1: R _ _ _ E. We need three consonants for positions 2,3,4 that are not T,N,D,A,O,S. Possible letters: B,C,F,G,H,L,M,P,V,W,Y.

A word like ""RIFLE"" comes to mind: R I F L E. Let's check:
- R in position 1 (new position)
- I (vowel, not yet tested)
- F, L (consonants not yet tested)
- Ends in E (correct)
- No A, O, S, T, N, D.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

From all feedback:

1. Word ends in E (position 5).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.  
   Therefore R must be in position 5.  
   But position 5 is already E.  
   This is impossible → contradiction.

That means my earlier assumption must be wrong.  
Re-examine R placement:

- AROSE: R in position 2 → (-) → R not in 2  
- TREND: R in position 2 → (-) → R not in 2 (same)  
- RIFLE: R in position 1 → (-) → R not in 1

So far: R not in 1, 2, 3.  
The only remaining positions for R are 4 or 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ _ R E

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E and contains R somewhere in positions 1-4. It does NOT contain A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes R but avoids A, O, S. Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, etc. A word like “TREND” fits (ends in E, has R, avoids A/O/S). Let’s check:
- T, R, E, N, D – none are A, O, or S. R is in position 2 (different from position 2 in AROSE), and E is fixed at position 5. This should give new info.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (from AROSE feedback).
2. R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND feedback).
3. T, N, D are not in the word (from TREND feedback).
4. A, O, S are not in the word (from AROSE feedback).
5. E is in the word but not in position 3 (from TREND feedback). However, we already know it must be in position 5, so this is consistent.

Available letters: We can use any letters except A, O, S, T, N, D. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y. Vowels: E (fixed at position 5), I, U.

R must be in positions 1, 4 (since it can't be 2 or 3). Let's try placing R in position 1: R _ _ _ E. We need three consonants for positions 2,3,4 that are not T,N,D,A,O,S. Possible letters: B,C,F,G,H,L,M,P,V,W,Y.

A word like ""RIFLE"" comes to mind: R I F L E. Let's check:
- R in position 1 (new position)
- I (vowel, not yet tested)
- F, L (consonants not yet tested)
- Ends in E (correct)
- No A, O, S, T, N, D.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

From all feedback so far:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).
2. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3.  
   Therefore R must be in position 4: _ _ _ R E.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L.
4. Remaining possible consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels U (since E is already used and A, I, O are out).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ R E using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B U R E (but that’s 4 letters)
- C U R E (4 letters)
- B U R G E (6 letters)
- C H U R E (not a word)
- P U R E (4 letters)
- M U R E (4 letters)
- B R U E (4 letters)
- C R U E (4 letters)
- G U R E (4 letters)
- H U R E (4 letters)
- V U R E (4 letters)
- W U R E (4 letters)
- Y U R E (4 letters)

Looking for 5-letter words ending in RE with R in position 4:  
The only common English word that fits is “C U R V E” (but V is allowed, and positions would be C U R V E – wait, R is in position 3 here, not 4).  
Actually, the pattern is _ _ _ R E, so we need three letters before R.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in “_ _ _ R E” with R in position 4:
- B U R E → 4 letters
- C U R E → 4 letters
- P U R E → 4 letters
- M U R E → 4 letters
- G U R E → 4 letters
- H U R E → 4 letters
- V U R E → 4 letters
- W U R E → 4 letters
- Y U R E → 4 letters

Hmm, none of these are 5 letters. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the R position.

Wait, the feedback on RIFLE shows R(-), meaning R is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
From AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
From TREND, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2 (reconfirmed).  
From RIFLE, R was in position 1 and got (-), so R not in 1.  
Thus R can be in positions 3 or 4.

But in TREND, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
In AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), so R not in 2.  
In RIFLE, R was in position 1 and got (-), so R not in 1.  
Thus R must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, from TREND, E was in position 3 and got (-), so E not in 3 (but we know E is in 5, so this is fine).  
From RIFLE, I was in position 2 and got (x), so I is not in word (already known).  
F was in position 3 and got (x), so F is not in word.  
L was in position 4 and got (x), so L is not in word.

So possible letters for positions 1,2,3,4:  
Consonants: B, C, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

And R must be in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try R in position 3: _ _ R _ E  
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant for position 4, avoiding banned letters.

Possible word: C H R U E → not valid.  
B R U N E → but N is banned.  
C R U C E → but C is repeated and valid?  
Actually, let’s think of common words:  
B R U C E → valid 5-letter word: BRUCE.  
Check letters: B, R, U, C, E.  
B, C, U, E are allowed (A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L are banned).  
R is in position 2 here, but from AROSE and TREND, R cannot be in position 2.  
So BRUCE is invalid because R would be in position 2.

Next option: C R U C E → R in position 2 again, invalid.  
H R U C E → not a word.  
P R U C E → PRUCE? Not common.  
M U R C E → MURCE? Not a word.  
B U R C E → BURCE? Not a word.  

Now try R in position 4: _ _ _ R E  
We need three letters for positions 1,2,3.  
Possible word: C H U R E → CHURE? Not valid.  
B U R G E → BURGE? Not common.  
P U R G E → PURGE. Valid word.  
Check letters: P, U, R, G, E.  
All allowed (no A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L).  
R is in position 4, which is allowed.  

Thus PURGE is a valid next guess.

Not common.  \nM U R C E → MURCE? Not a word.  \nB U R C E → BURCE?

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, O, S, T, N, D, I, F, L, P, U, C, V

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (must be in position 5, since every time it’s placed elsewhere it got “-”)
- R (must appear somewhere, and the only positions left where it hasn’t been ruled out are 3 or 4)

So the pattern must be: _ _ [R or ?] [R or ?] E  
with R appearing exactly once in positions 3 or 4, and all other letters coming from the still-allowed set: B, G, H, K, M, Q, W, Y (plus R).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with R in position 3 or 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B R E W E – invalid (not a word)  
- G R E E N – N is banned  
- H A V E – A, V banned  
- M A R E – A banned  
- B R E A K – A banned  
- B R E W – 4 letters  
- G R E B – not a word  
- H A R P – A, P banned  
- K E E P – P banned  
- M I R E – I banned  
- W H E E T – T banned  
- Y E L P – P banned  

The only valid English word left that fits is “H E R B E” – but that’s not a word.  
Wait: “M E R G E” – G is allowed, E is fixed at 5, R in 3: M E R G E → positions: M(1) E(2) R(3) G(4) E(5).  
Check letters: M, E, R, G, E – all allowed.  
R is in position 3 (never been ruled out), E is in 5 (correct), and no banned letters.

So the final guess is MERGE.
