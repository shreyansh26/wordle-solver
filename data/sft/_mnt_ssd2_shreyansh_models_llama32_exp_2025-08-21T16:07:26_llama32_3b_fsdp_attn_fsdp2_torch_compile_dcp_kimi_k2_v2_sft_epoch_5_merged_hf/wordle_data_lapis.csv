### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters in the word and their positions:
- I is fixed in position 4.

Letters in the word but wrong positions:
- A was in position 2 in BASIC and is now ✓ in position 2. So A is in position 2.
- S was in position 3 in BASIC and is now “-” (wrong position), so S is NOT in position 3.

Letters not in the word at all:
R, O, E, T, N, B, C.

So far the pattern is:
_ A _ I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
A, S, I (already placed), plus common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 5.
S must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (but 2 is A, 4 is I), so S is likely position 1 or 5.
If S is position 1, then 5 must be another letter. If S is position 5, then 3 must be another letter.

Let’s try S in position 1. That gives:
S A _ I _

We need a common consonant for position 3. From remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.
Let’s pick G (common) for position 3: S A G I _.
We need a final letter for position 5. From remaining letters, let’s pick M (common) → S A G I M. Is “SAGIM” a valid word? No.
Let’s pick D → S A G I D. Is “SAGID” valid? No.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fourth; must be 1,2,3, or 5).
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. I’ll also try to include a few other common unused letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) to maximize information.

Candidate word: STAIN
- S in position 1 (new position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- Uses T, I, N (common letters not yet tested)
- Avoids R, O, E

<guess>STAIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- The word has an I in position 4.
- It contains A (not in positions 1 or 3) and S (not in positions 1 or 4).
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N.

Possible positions for A: 2, 5.
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5.

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I’ll construct a word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Uses A and S in new positions.
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate word: BASIC
- B (new letter)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- S in position 3 (new position for S)
- I in position 4 (correct)
- C (new letter)

This satisfies all constraints so far.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fourth; must be 1,2,3, or 5).
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. I’ll also try to include a few other common unused letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) to maximize information.

Candidate word: STAIN
- S in position 1 (new position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- Uses T, I, N (common letters not yet tested)
- Avoids R, O, E

<guess>STAIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- The word has an I in position 4.
- It contains A (not in positions 1 or 3) and S (not in positions 1 or 4).
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N.

Possible positions for A: 2, 5.
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5.

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

I’ll construct a word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Uses A and S in new positions.
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate word: BASIC
- B (new letter)
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- S in position 3 (new position for S)
- I in position 4 (correct)
- C (new letter)

This satisfies all constraints so far.

<guess>BASIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: BASIC -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(-) I(✓) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters in the word and their positions:
- I is fixed in position 4.

Letters in the word but wrong positions:
- A was in position 2 in BASIC and is now ✓ in position 2. So A is in position 2.
- S was in position 3 in BASIC and is now “-” (wrong position), so S is NOT in position 3.

Letters not in the word at all:
R, O, E, T, N, B, C.

So far the pattern is:
_ A _ I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
A, S, I (already placed), plus common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 5.
S must go in position 1, 2, or 5 (but 2 is A, 4 is I), so S is likely position 1 or 5.
If S is position 1, then 5 must be another letter. If S is position 5, then 3 must be another letter.

Let’s try S in position 1. That gives:
S A _ I _

We need a common consonant for position 3. From remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.
Let’s pick G (common) for position 3: S A G I _.
We need a final letter for position 5. From remaining letters, let’s pick M (common) → S A G I M. Is “SAGIM” a valid word? No.
Let’s pick D → S A G I D. Is “SAGID” valid? No.
Let’s pick L → S A G I L. Is “SAGIL” valid? No.
Let’s pick H → S A G I H. Is “SAGIH” valid? No.
Let’s pick K → S A G I K. Is “SAGIK” valid? No.
Let’s pick P → S A G I P. Is “SAGIP” valid? No.
Let’s pick F → S A G I F. Is “SAGIF” valid? No.
Let’s pick Y → S A G I Y. Is “SAGIY” valid? No.

SAGI_ is not a valid word.

Alternative: S in position 5. That gives _ A _ I S.
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Common letters: D and G?
D in position 1: D A _ I S. Need a letter for position 3. G? D A G I S? “DAGIS” – not valid.
F? D A F I S? “DAFIS” – not valid.
H? D A H I S? “DAHIS” – not valid.
K? D A K I S? “DAKIS” – not valid.
L? D A L I S? “DALIS” – not valid.
M? D A M I S? “DAMIS” – not valid.
P? D A P I S? “DAPIS” – not valid.
V? D A V I S? “DAVIS” – yes! “DAVIS” is a valid word.

So “DAVIS” fits:
- D (new letter)
- A (position 2, ✓)
- V (new letter)
- I (position 4, ✓)
- S (position 5, new position)

Let’s check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2) and I (position 4), S (position 5).
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, N, B, C.
- S is now in position 5 (allowed).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 4 (correct).

“DAVIS” is a valid guess.
