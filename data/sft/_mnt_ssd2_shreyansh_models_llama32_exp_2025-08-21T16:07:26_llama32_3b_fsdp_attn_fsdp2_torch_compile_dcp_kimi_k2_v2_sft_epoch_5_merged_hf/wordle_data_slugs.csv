For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word pattern so far is: S L _ _ _

I need to avoid A, T, E completely. I should also try to introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow down the remaining letters. Good candidates for the next three positions include:
- Vowels: I, O, U
- Consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""SLING"" because:
1. Keeps S and L fixed in positions 1 and 2.
2. Uses I and N (common letters).
3. Uses G (another common consonant).
4. Avoids A, T, E.

Another possibility is ""SLUMP"" but M and P are both fine, though ""SLING"" seems slightly more common.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with S L _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, I, N
- Letter G is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it got “-” feedback there)

So positions 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters:
- Not in {A, T, E, I, N, G}  (G is already confirmed in the word but not at the end)
- Possibly other common letters like O, U, R, D, C, M, P, etc.

We know G is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5. To maximize information, I’ll try placing G in position 3 and test two new common consonants/vowels in positions 4–5.

Good candidates:
- O and R are very common.
- “SLOR_” or “SLUG_” could be the pattern.

Let me pick “SLORR” – but that’s not a valid 5-letter word. Instead, “SLOR” + one more letter? Actually, “SLOR” is 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word.

A valid word fitting S L _ _ _ with G somewhere not at the end: “SLOGS” – but S is already used twice and we don’t know if letters can repeat.

Better: “SLUMP” uses U, M, P – all new letters not ruled out yet – and moves G to position 4. But we already tried N and N is out, so M/P are fine.

Wait, “SLUMP” has G in position 4, which is allowed (“-” only said G isn’t in position 5). And U, M, P are new.

But let me try a word that also tests O and R. “SLOR” is 4 letters. A 5-letter word with G in 3rd: “GLOOM” – but O is repeated and M is new. Actually “GLOOM” has G in 1st position, but we already have S in 1st, so double letters are possible, but we have no info on doubles yet.

Another option: “SLORC” – but C is not common enough.

Actually, “SLURP” is a good choice:
- S, L fixed.
- U and P are new letters.
- R is new.
- G is moved to position 4 (which is allowed).

Yes, “SLURP”.

But wait, “SLURP” has R and P and U – all new letters. But G was “-” in position 5, so it could be in 3,4. “SLURP” has G in 4, which is fine.

Double-check: A, T, E, I, N are out. G can be in 3 or 4. “SLURP” puts G in 4. Letters used: S, L, U, R, P. None of U, R, P have been ruled out.

So “SLURP” is a solid next guess.

- U and P are new letters.
- R is new.
- G is moved to position 4 (which is allowed).

Yes, “SLURP”.

But wait, “SLURP” has R and P and U – all new letters. But G was “-” in position 5, so it could be in 3,4. “SLURP” has G in 4, which is fine.

Double-check: A, T, E, I, N are out. G can be in 3 or 4. “SLURP” puts G in 4. Letters used: S, L, U, R, P. None of U, R, P have been ruled out.

So “SLURP” is a solid next guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: S L U _ _  (positions 1-3 locked in)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, I, N, R, P
- Letter G is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 4 (from Guess 3), so G must be in position 5.  
  Wait — that contradicts Guess 2, which said G(-) (in word but wrong position).  
  Re-reading: Guess 2 said G(-) meaning G is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
  Guess 3 then locked position 5 as U(✓), so G cannot be in the word at all — which conflicts with Guess 2’s G(-).  
  Therefore the G(-) in Guess 2 must simply confirm G is in the word (somewhere other than pos 5), and position 5 is definitely U now.  
  So we have: S L U _ _ with G somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are fixed), but position 3 is already U.  
  Hence G must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: S L U G _

Only the last letter remains unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: A, T, E, I, N, R, P  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A common 5-letter word matching S L U G _ is “SLUGS” but that repeats S.  
“SLUG” is 4 letters.  
Looking at valid 5-letter words: “SLUGS” is invalid (double S).  
“SLUG” invalid length.  
Actually, “SLUGS” is 5 letters but ends in S, which is allowed.

But let me check: S L U G S — yes, “SLUGS” is a valid 5-letter word.  
Letters used: S, L, U, G, S — only G is new, but we have no info on double letters.

Alternative: “SLUMS” – but M is still possible.  
“SLUMS” is a valid word.

Between “SLUGS” and “SLUMS”, both fit. I’ll pick “SLUGS” first because G is more common in position 4.

But wait — in Guess 3, position 4 was U(✓), so G in position 4 is locked.  
Therefore the word is S L U G U — but that’s 5 letters only if the last U is allowed.  
Actually the pattern is S L U G _ (position 4 is G).  
A valid word: “SLUGS” (S L U G S).  
Let me verify: S, L, U, G, S — all letters not ruled out except R,P which are out.  
So “SLUGS” is valid.

But let me try a word that uses a new letter in position 5.  
“SLUMS” is valid too, but “SLUGS” is more common.

I’ll go with “SLUGS”.
