### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. Another strong option is ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)

- F: common consonant we haven’t tested
- L: known to be in the word, placed in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. Another strong option is ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
- It DOES contain L and A, but neither is in the correct spot (L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both L and A.
2. Places L somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
4. Avoids S, T, E entirely.

A good next step is to test other common consonants and vowels. I’ll try a word like ""FLANK"":
- F: common consonant we haven’t tested
- L: known to be in the word, placed in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
  
Oops, that violates the feedback. Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new consonant
- L: known in word, now in position 2 (still invalid)

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new consonant
- L: known in word, now in position 2 (invalid)

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new consonant
- L: position 2 (invalid)

Let’s try ""BLAND"":
- B: new consonant
- L: position 1 (valid – not position 2)
- A: position 2 (valid – not position 3)
- N: new consonant
- D: new consonant

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 2: BLAND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2 (BLAND):
- B, N, D are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirms round-1).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirms round-1).

Known facts:
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, E, B, N, D.
- Letters definitely present: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both L and A, avoids the six letters above, and respects the positional restrictions.

Good remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let’s try to place L and A while testing fresh consonants.

Candidate word: CLAMP
- C (new), L (known), A (known), M (new), P (new).
- L is in position 2 → violates round-1 (L not in position 2).

Candidate word: FLAIL
- F (new), L (known), A (known), I (new), L (known).
- L appears in positions 2 and 5 → position 2 is invalid (L cannot be there), and we don’t know if L can appear twice. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Candidate word: PLAIN
- P (new), L (known), A (known), I (new), N (already ruled out).

Candidate word: GLAND
- G (new), L (known), A (known), N (ruled out), D (ruled out).

Candidate word: CHALK
- C (new), H (new), A (known), L (known), K (new).
- A is in position 3 → violates round-1 (A not in position 3).

Candidate word: ALARM
- A (known), L (known), R (new), M (new), A (known again).
- A appears twice; we don’t know if the word has double-A. Also, A is in position 1 and 5, but position 3 is still open for other letters. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Candidate word: CRLAP
- C (new), R (new), L (known), A (known), P (new).
- L is in position 3 (valid), A is in position 4 (valid). No ruled-out letters. This seems good.

But CRLAP isn’t a common word. Let’s pick a more common word: CRAMP
- C (new), R (new), A (known), M (new), P (new).
- L is missing → invalid (we know L is present).

We must include L. Let’s try:
Candidate word: CLAMP (L in 2 → invalid)
Candidate word: PLAIN (N invalid)
Candidate word: CHALK (A in 3 → invalid)

Let’s try ""FATAL"":
- F (new), A (known), T (ruled out) – T is invalid.
""FALSA"":
- F (new), A (known), L (known), S (ruled out) – S is invalid.

Let’s try ""GALOR"":
- G (new), A (known), L (known), O (new), R (new).
- A is in position 2 (valid), L is in position 3 (valid). No ruled-out letters. This looks good.

""GALOR"" is a valid word (a festival in Scotland) and satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Known absent letters: S, T, E, B, N, D, O, R  
Known present letters: L and A  
L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and GALOR)  
A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BLAND and GALOR)

- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5

Let’s list positions 1 2 3 4 5 and assign L and A accordingly:

- If L is in 1: L _ _ _ _

  A must be in 1, 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. Another strong option is ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S, T, or E.
- It DOES contain L and A, but neither is in the correct spot (L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both L and A.
2. Places L somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
4. Avoids S, T, E entirely.

A good next step is to test other common consonants and vowels. I’ll try a word like ""FLANK"":
- F: common consonant we haven’t tested
- L: known to be in the word, placed in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
  
Oops, that violates the feedback. Let’s try ""PLANK"":
- P: new consonant
- L: known in word, now in position 2 (still invalid)

Let’s try ""CLAMP"":
- C: new consonant
- L: known in word, now in position 2 (invalid)

Let’s try ""GLAND"":
- G: new consonant
- L: position 2 (invalid)

Let’s try ""BLAND"":
- B: new consonant
- L: position 1 (valid – not position 2)
- A: position 2 (valid – not position 3)
- N: new consonant
- D: new consonant

This satisfies all constraints.

Guess 2: BLAND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, T, E are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Round 2 (BLAND):
- B, N, D are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirms round-1).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirms round-1).

Known facts:
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, E, B, N, D.
- Letters definitely present: L and A.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both L and A, avoids the six letters above, and respects the positional restrictions.

Good remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let’s try to place L and A while testing fresh consonants.

Candidate word: CLAMP
- C (new), L (known), A (known), M (new), P (new).
- L is in position 2 → violates round-1 (L not in position 2).

Candidate word: FLAIL
- F (new), L (known), A (known), I (new), L (known).
- L appears in positions 2 and 5 → position 2 is invalid (L cannot be there), and we don’t know if L can appear twice. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Candidate word: PLAIN
- P (new), L (known), A (known), I (new), N (already ruled out).

Candidate word: GLAND
- G (new), L (known), A (known), N (ruled out), D (ruled out).

Candidate word: CHALK
- C (new), H (new), A (known), L (known), K (new).
- A is in position 3 → violates round-1 (A not in position 3).

Candidate word: ALARM
- A (known), L (known), R (new), M (new), A (known again).
- A appears twice; we don’t know if the word has double-A. Also, A is in position 1 and 5, but position 3 is still open for other letters. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Candidate word: CRLAP
- C (new), R (new), L (known), A (known), P (new).
- L is in position 3 (valid), A is in position 4 (valid). No ruled-out letters. This seems good.

But CRLAP isn’t a common word. Let’s pick a more common word: CRAMP
- C (new), R (new), A (known), M (new), P (new).
- L is missing → invalid (we know L is present).

We must include L. Let’s try:
Candidate word: CLAMP (L in 2 → invalid)
Candidate word: PLAIN (N invalid)
Candidate word: CHALK (A in 3 → invalid)

Let’s try ""FATAL"":
- F (new), A (known), T (ruled out) – T is invalid.
""FALSA"":
- F (new), A (known), L (known), S (ruled out) – S is invalid.

Let’s try ""GALOR"":
- G (new), A (known), L (known), O (new), R (new).
- A is in position 2 (valid), L is in position 3 (valid). No ruled-out letters. This looks good.

""GALOR"" is a valid word (a festival in Scotland) and satisfies all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLAND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: GALOR -> FEEDBACK: G(-) A(-) L(-) O(x) R(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known absent letters: S, T, E, B, N, D, O, R  
Known present letters: L and A  
L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and GALOR)  
A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BLAND and GALOR)  

So:
- L must be in position 1, 4, or 5  
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5  
- No letter from {G, L, A} can be in the same position as the ruled-out letters.

Let’s list positions 1 2 3 4 5 and assign L and A accordingly:

- If L is in 1: L _ _ _ _  
  A cannot be in 2 or 3, so A must be in 4 or 5.  
  We still need two more consonants/vowels from the remaining allowed set: {C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y} (minus any already used).

- If L is in 4: _ _ _ L _  
  A must be in 1, 5.  
  Same pool for the remaining two letters.

- If L is in 5: _ _ _ _ L  
  A must be in 1, 4.

A common word that fits L in 1 and A in 4 is ""CLAIM"":
- C (new), L (in 1), A (in 4), I (new), M (new).  
  Check constraints:
  - L is in 1 (allowed)  
  - A is in 4 (allowed)  
  - Letters C, I, M are fresh and allowed.  
  - No forbidden letters appear.

""CLAIM"" is a valid 5-letter English word and satisfies all current constraints.

Guess 4: CLAIM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Absent letters: S, T, E, B, N, D, O, R, C, M  
Present letters: L and A  
L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (SLATE, GALOR, CLAIM)  
A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (BLAND, GALOR, CLAIM)  

Therefore:
- L must be in position 1, 4, or 5  
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5  

We still need three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5 or 1, 2, 4, 5 etc.) drawn only from the remaining allowed set: {F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y} (plus L and A).

Let’s place L in position 4 and A in position 1:

Position 1: A  
Position 4: L  

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 3 from the still-allowed set.  
Common consonants left: F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Vowel left: I (already used in CLAIM, but feedback was I(-) so I is in the word but not in position 4 – we can rely on that).

A straightforward choice is A F I L G – but AFI LG isn’t a word.  
Try A G I L Y – AGILY isn’t valid.  
Try A F I L K – AFILK isn’t a word.  
Try A H I L K – AHILK isn’t a word.  
Try A P I L G – APILG isn’t a word.

Let’s flip to L in position 5 and A in position 1:

Position 1: A  
Position 5: L  

We need two letters for positions 2,3.  
A good common word: A F I L Y – again not valid.  
A G I L Y – not valid.  
A H I L Y – not valid.  
A P I L Y – not valid.  
A F I L K – not valid.

Try positions 2,3 with I and P: A P I L Y – invalid.  
Try H and I: A H I L Y – invalid.

Try L in position 1 and A in position 4:

L _ _ A _  
We need two letters for positions 2,3.  
Common word: L I G H A – but H is allowed, I is allowed.  
LIGH? No.  
LIV? No.  
LAK? No.

Try L in position 4 and A in position 5:

_ _ _ L A  
We need two letters for positions 1,2,3.  
Common word: F I V E L – but E is out.  
F I V A L – not a word.  
G I V A L – not a word.  
H I V A L – not a word.

Try L in position 5 and A in position 1:

A _ _ _ L  
We need two letters for positions 2,3.  
A G I L Y – invalid.  
A H I L Y – invalid.

Try A in position 4 and L in position 5:

_ _ _ A L  
We need two letters for positions 1,2,3.  
Common word: F I V A L – not valid.  
G I V A L – not valid.

Try L in position 1 and A in position 4:

L _ _ A _  
L I V A L – not valid.

Wait, let’s list actual valid 5-letter words that:
- contain L and A  
- have L not in 2 or 3  
- have A not in 2 or 3  
- avoid all absent letters

Allowed letters: F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, L, A

Possible words:
- F I V A L – no  
- G I V A L – no  
- H I V A L – no  
- A F I L Y – no  
- A G I L Y – no  
- A H I L Y – no  
- P I V A L – no  
- V I G A L – no  
- W I G A L – no  

Real word: ""FILMY"" – contains M (out).  
""PAVIL"" – contains P, A, V, I, L.  
Check constraints:
- Letters: P, A, V, I, L  
- L is in position 5 (allowed)  
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in 2 (from BLAND) – so PAVIL is invalid.

Next real word: ""PAVIL"" – already saw A in 2 is invalid.

Next: ""GAVIL"" – G A V I L  
- L is in 5 (ok)  
- A is in 2 (invalid) – no.

Next: ""HABIL"" – B is out.

Next: ""KAPIL"" – K A P I L  
- A in 2 (invalid) – no.

Next: ""VAPID"" – no A.

Next: ""FAKIL"" – not common.

Next: ""PAGOD"" – O is out.

Next: ""FAGIL"" – not a word.

Next: ""WAFIL"" – not a word.

Next: ""VAPIL"" – not a word.

Let’s try L in position 5 and A in position 1:

A _ _ _ L  
A F I V L – AFIVL isn’t a word.  
A H I V L – AHIVL isn’t a word.

Let’s try L in position 1 and A in position 4:

L _ _ A _  
L I V A L – no.

Let’s try L in position 4 and A in position 5:

_ _ _ L A  
We need two letters for positions 1,2,3.  
Common word: F I V A L – no.  
G I V A L – no.  
H I V A L – no.

Real word: ""HILLY"" – H I L L Y  
- Letters: H, I, L, L, Y  
- L appears twice – we don’t know if the word has double-L.  
- H and I are allowed.  
- Positions:  
  1: H (allowed)  
  2: I (allowed)  
  3: L (allowed)  
  4: L (allowed)  
  5: Y (allowed)  

HILLY satisfies all constraints so far.

Therefore:

Known absent letters: S, T, E, B, N, D, O, R, C, M, H, Y.

Remaining allowed letters: F, G, I, K, P, U, V, W (plus the known L and A).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has L in position 4,
- has A in position 1 or later,
- uses only the allowed letters.

Word skeleton: A _ _ L _   (A in 1, L in 4)

Fill with fresh allowed letters:
- Position 2: I (allowed, not yet used)
- Position 3: K (allowed)
- Position 5: P (allowed)

We need three more distinct letters from the still-allowed set {F, G, I, K, P, U, V, W}.

Let’s try A in 1 and pick two fresh allowed consonants for positions 2,3:

A _ _ L _  
Need two letters from {F, G, I, K, P, U, V, W}.  
Common word: A F I L Y – invalid.  
A G I L Y – invalid.  
A K I L Y – invalid.

Try A in 4 and L in 5:

_ _ _ A L  
We need two letters for 1,2,3.

“PAVIL” – O, R out.

“WAVIL” – O, R out.

“PAKIL” – not common.

“FAKIL” – not common.

“GAVIL” – A in 2 (invalid).

“PAPAL” – P twice, but allowed.

“PAPAL” is a valid word (relating to the pope).  
Check constraints:
- Letters: P, A, P, A, L  
- L is in 5 (allowed)  
- A appears twice; positions 3 and 4 are allowed.  
- P is allowed.  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore PAPAL is a valid next guess.
