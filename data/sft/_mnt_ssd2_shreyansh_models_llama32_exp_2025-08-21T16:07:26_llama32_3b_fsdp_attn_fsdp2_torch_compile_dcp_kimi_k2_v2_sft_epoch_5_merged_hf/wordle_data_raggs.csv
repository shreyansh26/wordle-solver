### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S, O (common consonants)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that exist in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has A, R, S but not O or E.
- A is not first, R is not second, S is not fourth.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does not contain O or E
3. Positions of A, R, S must be different from first guess

Let me think of words with A, R, S but no O or E. Some possibilities:
- RASPY (but has P and Y which weren't tested)
- SARAN (but has N which wasn't tested)
- STARS (but has S twice which might not be optimal)
- CRASH (but has H and C which weren't tested)
- TRASH (but has T and H which weren't tested)

Looking at these, ""STARS"" looks promising because:
- It uses S in positions 1 and 5 (originally position 4)
- It uses A in position 3 (originally position 1)
- It uses R in position 2 (originally position 2 - actually same position, which is bad since R was marked as wrong position in 2)
Oops, R would be in position 2 again; that's no good.

""CRASH"" has R in position 2 again - no.

""TRASH"" has R in position 2 - no.

""RASPY"" has R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), S in position 3 (new) - this seems good.

But let me think of another: ""SARAN"" - but A is in position 3 (same as STARS), and N is new.

Actually, ""STARS"" is bad because R is in position 2. Let me look for a word where R is not in position 2.

""RATES"" - but E is excluded.

""RAISE"" - but E is excluded.

""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""STAIN"" - but has I and N which weren't tested, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- T in 2 (new)
- A in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- N in 5 (new)

This seems good - uses S, A, R in new positions, and introduces T, I, N.

But wait, does this maximize information? Maybe ""STARS"" is better even with R in position 2, because it tests S in 1 and 5, A in 3, and R in 2 is a problem.

Alternative: ""SANDY"" - but has N and D, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- A in 2 (new)
- N in 3 (new)
- D in 4 (new)
- Y in 5 (new)

This uses A in 2, S in 1, and introduces N, D, Y.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O and E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, T, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – R cannot be 2nd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S
- Does NOT contain O, E, T, I, N
- Places A, R, S in positions not yet ruled out.

Looking for words with A, R, S plus three other unused letters (from the 20 unused consonants/vowels not yet tested).

Some candidates:
- CRASH → uses C, R, A, S, H. Positions: A(2), R(1), S(3) – none of A, R, S are in forbidden positions. Also introduces C, H.
- GRASP → G, R, A, S, P. Positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- DRAMA → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M. A(1) and A(3) – A cannot be 3rd. Discard.
- CRASP → C, R, A, S, P. A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- HARPY → has P, Y. Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces H, P, Y.
- SPRAY → has P, Y, and A(2), R(3), S(1) – S cannot be 1st. Discard.
- CRAMS → M, S. A(2), R(1), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces C, M.

Between CRASH, HARPY, and CRAMS, CRASH seems strongest as it introduces C, H, and M – all new letters.

Let me verify:
- CRASH: C, R, A, S, H
  – A is in position 2 (allowed 2, 4, 5)
  – R is in position 1 (allowed 1, 3, 4, 5)
  – S is in position 3 (allowed 2, 3, 5)
  – No O, E, T, I, N
  – Uses new letters C, H, M

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, T, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – R cannot be 2nd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S
- Does NOT contain O, E, T, I, N
- Places A, R, S in positions not yet ruled out.

Looking for words with A, R, S plus three other unused letters (from the 20 unused consonants/vowels not yet tested).

Some candidates:
- CRASH → uses C, R, A, S, H. Positions: A(2), R(1), S(3) – none of A, R, S are in forbidden positions. Also introduces C, H.
- GRASP → G, R, A, S, P. Positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- DRAMA → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M. A(1) and A(3) – A cannot be 3rd. Discard.
- CRASP → C, R, A, S, P. A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- HARPY → has P, Y. Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces H, P, Y.
- SPRAY → has P, Y, and A(2), R(3), S(1) – S cannot be 1st. Discard.
- CRAMS → M, S. A(2), R(1), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces C, M.

Between CRASH, HARPY, and CRAMS, CRASH seems strongest as it introduces C, H, and M – all new letters.

Let me verify:
- CRASH: C, R, A, S, H
  – A is in position 2 (allowed 2, 4, 5)
  – R is in position 1 (allowed 1, 3, 4, 5)
  – S is in position 3 (allowed 2, 3, 5)
  – No O, E, T, I, N
  – Uses new letters C, H, M

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S, O (common consonants)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that exist in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has A, R, S but not O or E.
- A is not first, R is not second, S is not fourth.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does not contain O or E
3. Positions of A, R, S must be different from first guess

Let me think of words with A, R, S but no O or E. Some possibilities:
- RASPY (but has P and Y which weren't tested)
- SARAN (but has N which wasn't tested)
- STARS (but has S twice which might not be optimal)
- CRASH (but has H and C which weren't tested)
- TRASH (but has T and H which weren't tested)

Looking at these, ""STARS"" looks promising because:
- It uses S in positions 1 and 5 (originally position 4)
- It uses A in position 3 (originally position 1)
- It uses R in position 2 (originally position 2 - actually same position, which is bad since R was marked as wrong position in 2)
Oops, R would be in position 2 again; that's no good.

""CRASH"" has R in position 2 again - no.

""TRASH"" has R in position 2 - no.

""RASPY"" has R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), S in position 3 (new) - this seems good.

But let me think of another: ""SARAN"" - but A is in position 3 (same as STARS), and N is new.

Actually, ""STARS"" is bad because R is in position 2. Let me look for a word where R is not in position 2.

""RATES"" - but E is excluded.

""RAISE"" - but E is excluded.

""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""STAIN"" - but has I and N which weren't tested, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- T in 2 (new)
- A in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- N in 5 (new)

This seems good - uses S, A, R in new positions, and introduces T, I, N.

But wait, does this maximize information? Maybe ""STARS"" is better even with R in position 2, because it tests S in 1 and 5, A in 3, and R in 2 is a problem.

Alternative: ""SANDY"" - but has N and D, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- A in 2 (new)
- N in 3 (new)
- D in 4 (new)
- Y in 5 (new)

This uses A in 2, S in 1, and introduces N, D, Y.

But ""STAIN"" seems better as it uses A in 3, R in 1 (new), S in 1 (new), and introduces T, I, N.

I think ""STAIN"" is a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)

- CRASP → C, R, A, S, P. A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- HARPY → has P, Y. Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces H, P, Y.
- SPRAY → has P, Y, and A(2), R(3), S(1) – S cannot be 1st. Discard.
- CRAMS → M, S. A(2), R(1), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces C, M.

Between CRASH, HARPY, and CRAMS, CRASH seems strongest as it introduces C, H, and M – all new letters.

Let me verify:
- CRASH: C, R, A, S, H
  – A is in position 2 (allowed 2, 4, 5)
  – R is in position 1 (allowed 1, 3, 4, 5)
  – S is in position 3 (allowed 2, 3, 5)
  – No O, E, T, I, N
  – Uses new letters C, H, M

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let me think of words with A, R, S but no O or E. Some possibilities:
- RASPY (but has P and Y which weren't tested)
- SARAN (but has N which wasn't tested)
- STARS (but has S twice which might not be optimal)
- CRASH (but has H and C which weren't tested)
- TRASH (but has T and H which weren't tested)

Looking at these, ""STARS"" looks promising because:
- It uses S in positions 1 and 5 (originally position 4)
- It uses A in position 3 (originally position 1)
- It uses R in position 2 (originally position 2 - actually same position, which is bad since R was marked as wrong position in 2)
Oops, R would be in position 2 again; that's no good.

""CRASH"" has R in position 2 again - no.

""TRASH"" has R in position 2 - no.

""RASPY"" has R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), S in position 3 (new) - this seems good.

But let me think of another: ""SARAN"" - but A is in position 3 (same as STARS), and N is new.

Actually, ""STARS"" is bad because R is in position 2. Let me look for a word where R is not in position 2.

""RATES"" - but E is excluded.

""RAISE"" - but E is excluded.

""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""STAIN"" - but has I and N which weren't tested, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- T in 2 (new)
- A in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- N in 5 (new)

This seems good - uses S, A, R in new positions, and introduces T, I, N.

But wait, does this maximize information? Maybe ""STARS"" is better even with R in position 2, because it tests S in 1 and 5, A in 3, and R in 2 is a problem.

Alternative: ""SANDY"" - but has N and D, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- A in 2 (new)
- N in 3 (new)
- D in 4 (new)
- Y in 5 (new)

This uses A in 2, S in 1, and introduces N, D, Y.

But ""STAIN"" seems better as it uses A in 3, R in 1 (new), S in 1 (new), and introduces T, I, N.

I think ""STAIN"" is a strong second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O and E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, T, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – R cannot be 2nd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S
- Does NOT contain O, E, T, I, N
- Places A, R, S in positions not yet ruled out.

Looking for words with A, R, S plus three other unused letters (from the 20 unused consonants/vowels not yet tested).

Some candidates:
- CRASH → uses C, R, A, S, H. Positions: A(2), R(1), S(3) – none of A, R, S are in forbidden positions. Also introduces C, H.
- GRASP → G, R, A, S, P. Positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- DRAMA → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M. A(1) and A(3) – A cannot be 3rd. Discard.
- CRASP → C, R, A, S, P. A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- HARPY → has P, Y. Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces H, P, Y.
- SPRAY → has P, Y, and A(2), R(3), S(1) – S cannot be 1st. Discard.
- CRAMS → M, S. A(2), R(1), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces C, M.

Between CRASH, HARPY, and CRAMS, CRASH seems strongest as it introduces C, H, and M – all new letters.

Let me verify:
- CRASH: C, R, A, S, H
  – A is in position 2 (allowed 2, 4, 5)
  – R is in position 1 (allowed 1, 3, 4, 5)
  – S is in position 3 (allowed 2, 3, 5)
  – No O, E, T, I, N
  – Uses new letters C, H, M

Looks good.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, S are in the word but not in the positions tried so far.
   – O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

3. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.
   – C, H are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, E, T, I, N, C, H
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be 1, 3
  – R cannot be 2
  – S cannot be 1, 4
- We still need to test other vowels/consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that contains A, R, S and three new letters, with A, R, S placed in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible positions left for each:
- A: can be 2, 4, 5
- R: can be 1, 3, 4, 5
- S: can be 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these and introduces new common letters.

Candidate: DRAMA
- D, R, A, M, A → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M.
- Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – but we don’t have S here. Doesn’t work.

Candidate: GRASP
- G, R, A, S, P → positions: A(3) – forbidden (A cannot be 3), and S(4) – forbidden (S cannot be 4). Discard.

Candidate: HARPY
- H is already ruled out.

Candidate: PRASM
- P, R, A, S, M → positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SPARK
- S, P, A, R, K → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SKRAM
- S, K, R, A, M → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SRAM
- S, R, A, M → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: MARSH
- M, A, R, S, H → H is ruled out. Discard.

Candidate: BARDS
- B, A, R, D, S → positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – works!
- Contains B, D (new letters)
- No forbidden letters
- A, R, S are in allowed positions

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: FARMS
- F, A, R, M, S → positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – works similarly.

Between BARDS and FARMS, BARDS introduces B and D – both common.

Let’s go with BARDS.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S, O (common consonants)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that exist in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has A, R, S but not O or E.
- A is not first, R is not second, S is not fourth.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does not contain O or E
3. Positions of A, R, S must be different from first guess

Let me think of words with A, R, S but no O or E. Some possibilities:
- RASPY (but has P and Y which weren't tested)
- SARAN (but has N which wasn't tested)
- STARS (but has S twice which might not be optimal)
- CRASH (but has H and C which weren't tested)
- TRASH (but has T and H which weren't tested)

Looking at these, ""STARS"" looks promising because:
- It uses S in positions 1 and 5 (originally position 4)
- It uses A in position 3 (originally position 1)
- It uses R in position 2 (originally position 2 - actually same position, which is bad since R was marked as wrong position in 2)
Oops, R would be in position 2 again; that's no good.

""CRASH"" has R in position 2 again - no.

""TRASH"" has R in position 2 - no.

""RASPY"" has R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), S in position 3 (new) - this seems good.

But let me think of another: ""SARAN"" - but A is in position 3 (same as STARS), and N is new.

Actually, ""STARS"" is bad because R is in position 2. Let me look for a word where R is not in position 2.

""RATES"" - but E is excluded.

""RAISE"" - but E is excluded.

""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""STAIN"" - but has I and N which weren't tested, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- T in 2 (new)
- A in 3 (new)
- I in 4 (new)
- N in 5 (new)

This seems good - uses S, A, R in new positions, and introduces T, I, N.

But wait, does this maximize information? Maybe ""STARS"" is better even with R in position 2, because it tests S in 1 and 5, A in 3, and R in 2 is a problem.

Alternative: ""SANDY"" - but has N and D, and positions:
- S in 1 (new)
- A in 2 (new)
- N in 3 (new)
- D in 4 (new)
- Y in 5 (new)

This uses A in 2, S in 1, and introduces N, D, Y.

But ""STAIN"" seems better as it uses A in 3, R in 1 (new), S in 1 (new), and introduces T, I, N.

I think ""STAIN"" is a strong second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O and E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E, T, I, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – R cannot be 2nd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S
- Does NOT contain O, E, T, I, N
- Places A, R, S in positions not yet ruled out.

Looking for words with A, R, S plus three other unused letters (from the 20 unused consonants/vowels not yet tested).

Some candidates:
- CRASH → uses C, R, A, S, H. Positions: A(2), R(1), S(3) – none of A, R, S are in forbidden positions. Also introduces C, H.
- GRASP → G, R, A, S, P. Positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- DRAMA → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M. A(1) and A(3) – A cannot be 3rd. Discard.
- CRASP → C, R, A, S, P. A(3) – forbidden. Discard.
- HARPY → has P, Y. Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces H, P, Y.
- SPRAY → has P, Y, and A(2), R(3), S(1) – S cannot be 1st. Discard.
- CRAMS → M, S. A(2), R(1), S(5) – all allowed. Introduces C, M.

Between CRASH, HARPY, and CRAMS, CRASH seems strongest as it introduces C, H, and M – all new letters.

Let me verify:
- CRASH: C, R, A, S, H
  – A is in position 2 (allowed 2, 4, 5)
  – R is in position 1 (allowed 1, 3, 4, 5)
  – S is in position 3 (allowed 2, 3, 5)
  – No O, E, T, I, N
  – Uses new letters C, H, M

Looks good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, S are in the word but not in the positions tried so far.
   – O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

3. CRASH → C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.
   – C, H are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, E, T, I, N, C, H
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be 1, 3
  – R cannot be 2
  – S cannot be 1, 4
- We still need to test other vowels/consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that contains A, R, S and three new letters, with A, R, S placed in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible positions left for each:
- A: can be 2, 4, 5
- R: can be 1, 3, 4, 5
- S: can be 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these and introduces new common letters.

Candidate: DRAMA
- D, R, A, M, A → has A twice (no advantage), and D, M.
- Positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – but we don’t have S here. Doesn’t work.

Candidate: GRASP
- G, R, A, S, P → positions: A(3) – forbidden (A cannot be 3), and S(4) – forbidden (S cannot be 4). Discard.

Candidate: HARPY
- H is already ruled out.

Candidate: PRASM
- P, R, A, S, M → positions: A(3) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SPARK
- S, P, A, R, K → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SKRAM
- S, K, R, A, M → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: SRAM
- S, R, A, M → positions: S(1) – forbidden. Discard.

Candidate: MARSH
- M, A, R, S, H → H is ruled out. Discard.

Candidate: BARDS
- B, A, R, D, S → positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – works!
- Contains B, D (new letters)
- No forbidden letters
- A, R, S are in allowed positions

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: FARMS
- F, A, R, M, S → positions: A(2), R(3), S(5) – works similarly.

Between BARDS and FARMS, BARDS introduces B and D – both common.

Let’s go with BARDS.

<guess>BARDS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)
Guess 4: BARDS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(-) D(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on BARDS:
- A(✓) : A is now locked into position 2.
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(✓) : S is in the word and is now locked into position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ S
- Letters in the word: A (position 2), R (somewhere), S (position 5)
- Letters not in the word: O, E, T, I, N, C, H, B, D
- Positions ruled out:
  – A is only in position 2.
  – S is only in position 5.
  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 3 (from CRASH) and cannot be in position 2 (from BARDS). So R must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. R A _ _ S
2. _ A _ R S

We need to fill the two blanks with letters not yet ruled out. The remaining usable letters include: F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ S or R A _ _ S.

Words fitting _ A _ _ S:
- F A _ _ S: FARMS? But M and F are okay. Let’s check positions: F(1), A(2), R(3) – but R cannot be in 3 (from CRASH). So FARMS is invalid.
- G A _ _ S: GAMS? Only 4 letters.
- L A _ _ S: LASS? Not 5 letters.
- M A _ _ S: MARMS? Again 4 letters.
- P A _ _ S: PARMS? Also 4 letters.

Words fitting R A _ _ S:
- R A _ _ S: First letter R, second letter A, third letter needs to be from remaining letters. RA_KS? RA_LS? RA_M_S? RA_P_S? RA_G_S? RA_F_S?

Looking at common words:
- R A F _ S: RAFTS? But T is ruled out.
- R A G _ S: RAGGS? But S is already in 5 and double S might not help.
- R A J _ S: RAJAH? But H is ruled out.
- R A L _ S: RALES? E is ruled out.
- R A M _ S: RAMPS? P and M are okay, but S is already in 5.
- R A P _ S: RAPID? But I and D are ruled out.
- R A V _ S: RAVES? E is ruled out.
- R A W _ S:RAWLS? But L is okay, W is okay. Let’s check positions: R(1), A(2), W(3), L(4), S(5). This fits all constraints:
  – A is in 2, S in 5.
  – R is in 1 (allowed).
  – W and L are new letters not yet tested.
  – No forbidden letters.

So ""RAWLS"" seems perfect.

RA_F_S?\n\nLooking at common words:\n- R A F _ S: RAFTS? But T is ruled out.\n- R A G _ S: RAGGS? But S is already in 5 and double S might not help.\n- R A J _ S: RAJAH? But H is ruled out.\n- R A L _ S: RALES? E is ruled out.\n- R A M _ S: RAMPS? P and M are okay, but S is already in 5.\n- R A P _ S: RAPID? But I and D are ruled out.\n- R A V _ S: RAVES? E is ruled out.\n- R A W _ S:RAWLS? But L is okay, W is okay. Let’s check positions: R(1), A(2), W(3), L(4), S(5). This fits all constraints:\n  – A is in 2, S in 5.\n  – R is in 1 (allowed).\n  – W and L are new letters not yet tested.\n  – No forbidden letters.\n\nSo ""RAWLS"" seems perfect.\n\n<guess>RAWLS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) S(-) H(x)\nGuess 4: BARDS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(-) D(x) S(✓)\nGuess 5: RAWLS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on RAWLS:
- R(✓) : R is in position 1.
- A(✓) : A is in position 2.
- S(✓) : S is in position 5.
- W(x) : W is not in the word.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.

So the word must be: R A _ _ S with the blanks filled by letters not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: O, E, T, I, N, C, H, B, D, W, L.

Remaining usable letters: F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters from this pool to fill positions 3 and 4.

Looking for common combinations:
- R A M _ S → RAMPS (but P is okay, M is okay)
- R A F _ S → RAJAH (but H is ruled out)
- R A G _ S → RAGGS (but double S at end)
- R A K _ S → RAKES (but E is ruled out)
- R A M _ S → RAMMS (but double M)
- R A P _ S → RAPES (but E is ruled out)
- R A J _ S → RAJAH (H ruled out)
- R A V _ S → RAVES (E ruled out)
- R A M _ S → RAMMS (double M)

The most common valid word fitting R A _ _ S with remaining letters is ""RAMPS"":
- R A M P S
- Positions: R(1), A(2), M(3), P(4), S(5)
- All letters are allowed (M and P haven't been ruled out).
