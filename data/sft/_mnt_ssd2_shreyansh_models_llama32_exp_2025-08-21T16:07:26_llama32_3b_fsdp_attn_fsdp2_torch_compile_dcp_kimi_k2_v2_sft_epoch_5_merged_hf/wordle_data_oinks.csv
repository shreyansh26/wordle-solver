### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.
  – S cannot be in 1st or 4th position.
  – N cannot be in 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, N
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, U, D
- Places O, S, N in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters (avoiding A, R, E, U, D): good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to spread O, S, N into allowed slots:
- O allowed in 1st, 4th, or 5th
- S allowed in 2nd, 3rd, or 5th
- N allowed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters we have ruled out: A, R, E, U, D, F  
Letters we know are in the word: I, O, S, N  
Positions ruled out so far:

- O: cannot be 2nd, 3rd, 4th (from AROSE and SOUND) – only 1st or 5th left.  
- S: cannot be 1st, 4th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from FISON) – only 2nd or 5th left.  
- N: cannot be 4th (from SOUND) or 5th (from FISON) – only 1st, 2nd, 3rd left.

We also know:
- The word must contain I, and I can be in any remaining position (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) without conflict.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains I, O, S, N
2. Uses only letters not in the banned set (no A, R, E, U, D, F)
3. Places O, S, N in allowed positions
4. Places I somewhere convenient.

Looking at remaining common letters (B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.) and considering the constraints:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1st or 5th
- S can be 2nd or 5th
- N can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd

Let’s try to construct a word:

Possible pattern: O _ I _ N  or  O _ N _ I  etc.

But N cannot be 4th or 5th (already ruled out), and S cannot be 1st,4th,3rd – so S must be 2nd or 5th.

Try O S I N _ – S is 2nd (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), N is 4th (but N cannot be 4th) – bad.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains O and S, but they are not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. Does not use A, R, or E.

A good next guess might be “SOUND”:
- It has both S and O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), and O is in position 2 (not 3).
- It avoids A, R, E.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - U and D are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S, N
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, D
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.
  – S cannot be in 1st or 4th position.
  – N cannot be in 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, N
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, U, D
- Places O, S, N in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters (avoiding A, R, E, U, D): good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to spread O, S, N into allowed slots:
- O allowed in 1st, 4th, or 5th
- S allowed in 2nd, 3rd, or 5th
- N allowed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th

One word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters is “SNICK”:
- S in 1st – but we ruled out 1st for S! Bad idea.

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1st – again ruled out. Bad.

Try “KNOSY”
- Contains K, N, O, S, Y
- O in 3rd – ruled out. Bad.

Try “STONY”
- S in 1st – ruled out. Bad.

Try “NOSKY”
- N in 1st (allowed), O in 2nd (ruled out). Bad.

Try “COINS”
- C, O, I, N, S
- O in 2nd – ruled out. Bad.

Try “FISON”
- F, I, S, O, N
- S in 3rd (allowed), O in 4th (allowed), N in 5th (allowed)
- Does not use any forbidden letters (A, R, E, U, D)
This looks valid.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: F, I, S, O, N – all allowed.
- Positions:
  – S is in 3rd (not 1st or 4th) – ok
  – O is in 4th (not 2nd or 3rd) – ok
  – N is in 5th (not 4th) – ok
- No A, R, E, U, D – ok

Word: N S I O _

We need a 5th letter; available letters (not banned): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Try N S I O K → “NSIOK” – not a valid English word.

Try N S I O L → “NSIOL” – invalid.

Try N S I O M → “NSIOM” – invalid.

Try N S I O P → “NSIOP” – invalid.

Try N S I O T → “NSIOT” – invalid.

Try N S I O Y → “NSIOY” – invalid.

Let’s try N in 3rd:
- _ _ N _ _
Then O and S must fit into 1st, 2nd, 5th with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 5th.

Let’s try C O N I S – but C is allowed, O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try T O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try P O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try H O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try L O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try S in 5th:
- _ _ _ _ S
Then O and N must fit into 1st, 2nd, 3rd with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s try I N O _ S – I 1st (allowed), N 2nd (allowed), O 3rd (allowed), _ 4th, S 5th.
We need a 4th letter from allowed set: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Try I N O L S – “INOLS” – invalid.

Try I N O M S – “INOMS” – invalid.

Try I N O P S – “INOPS” – invalid.

Try I N O T S – “INOTS” – invalid.

Try I N O C S – “INocs” – invalid.

Try I N O G S – “INGOS” – invalid.

Try I N O K S – “INKS” – valid English word!

Let’s check:
- Letters: I, N, K, O, S – all allowed.
- Positions:
  – I is 1st (no restriction) – ok
  – N is 2nd (not 4th or 5th) – ok
  – O is 4th (not 2nd or 3rd) – ok
  – S is 5th (not 1st or 4th) – ok
- No banned letters – ok

Therefore “INKS” satisfies all constraints.

The previous attempt “INKS” was rejected because it was not exactly five letters (it had spaces).  
We are told:

- Letters that must appear: I, O, S, N  
- Letters that cannot appear: A, R, E, U, D, F  
- Position constraints:
  – O cannot be 2nd or 3rd or 4th → only 1st or 5th remain.  
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th → only 2nd or 5th remain.  
  – N cannot be 4th or 5th → only 1st, 2nd, 3rd remain.

We also know I must appear somewhere, and it can go in any remaining slot (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) without conflict.

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1st  
O _ _ _ _  
Then S and N must fit into 2nd, 3rd, 5th with I placed elsewhere.  
Possible patterns:

  O I N C H  → “OINCH” – valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains O and S, but they are not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. Does not use A, R, or E.

A good next guess might be “SOUND”:
- It has both S and O.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), and O is in position 2 (not 3).
- It avoids A, R, E.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   - U and D are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S, N
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, D
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in 2nd or 3rd position.
  – S cannot be in 1st or 4th position.
  – N cannot be in 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, N
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, U, D
- Places O, S, N in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters (avoiding A, R, E, U, D): good candidates are B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to spread O, S, N into allowed slots:
- O allowed in 1st, 4th, or 5th
- S allowed in 2nd, 3rd, or 5th
- N allowed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th

One word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters is “SNICK”:
- S in 1st – but we ruled out 1st for S! Bad idea.

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1st – again ruled out. Bad.

Try “KNOSY”
- Contains K, N, O, S, Y
- O in 3rd – ruled out. Bad.

Try “STONY”
- S in 1st – ruled out. Bad.

Try “NOSKY”
- N in 1st (allowed), O in 2nd (ruled out). Bad.

Try “COINS”
- C, O, I, N, S
- O in 2nd – ruled out. Bad.

Try “FISON”
- F, I, S, O, N
- S in 3rd (allowed), O in 4th (allowed), N in 5th (allowed)
- Does not use any forbidden letters (A, R, E, U, D)
This looks valid.

Let me double-check:
- Letters: F, I, S, O, N – all allowed.
- Positions:
  – S is in 3rd (not 1st or 4th) – ok
  – O is in 4th (not 2nd or 3rd) – ok
  – N is in 5th (not 4th) – ok

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters we have ruled out: A, R, E, U, D, F  
Letters we know are in the word: I, O, S, N  
Positions ruled out so far:

- O: cannot be 2nd, 3rd, 4th (from AROSE and SOUND) – only 1st or 5th left.  
- S: cannot be 1st, 4th (from AROSE) or 3rd (from FISON) – only 2nd or 5th left.  
- N: cannot be 4th (from SOUND) or 5th (from FISON) – only 1st, 2nd, 3rd left.

We also know:
- The word must contain I, and I can be in any remaining position (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) without conflict.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains I, O, S, N
2. Uses only letters not in the banned set (no A, R, E, U, D, F)
3. Places O, S, N in allowed positions
4. Places I somewhere convenient.

Looking at remaining common letters (B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.) and considering the constraints:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1st or 5th
- S can be 2nd or 5th
- N can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: O in 1st
- O _ _ _ _
Then S and N must fit into 2nd, 3rd, 5th with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: O _ I _ N  or  O _ N _ I  etc.

But N cannot be 4th or 5th (already ruled out), and S cannot be 1st,4th,3rd – so S must be 2nd or 5th.

Let’s try O N I S _ – but N is 2nd (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), S is 4th (but S cannot be 4th from AROSE feedback) – bad.

Try O S I N _ – S is 2nd (allowed), I is 3rd (allowed), N is 4th (but N cannot be 4th) – bad.

Try O _ I N S – N is 4th (invalid) – bad.

Option 2: O in 5th
- O _ _ _ O
Then S and N must fit into 2nd, 3rd with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s try O N I S _ – N 2nd (allowed), I 3rd (allowed), S 4th (invalid) – bad.

Try O S I N _ – S 2nd (allowed), I 3rd (allowed), N 4th (invalid) – bad.

Try O _ I N S – N 4th (invalid) – bad.

Option 3: N in 1st
- N _ _ _ _
Then O and S must fit into 2nd, 3rd, 5th with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s try N O I S _ – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try N S I O _ – S 2nd (allowed), I 3rd (allowed), O 4th (allowed) – this looks valid!
Word: N S I O _

We need a 5th letter; available letters (not banned): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Try N S I O K → “NSIOK” – not a valid English word.

Try N S I O L → “NSIOL” – invalid.

Try N S I O M → “NSIOM” – invalid.

Try N S I O P → “NSIOP” – invalid.

Try N S I O T → “NSIOT” – invalid.

Try N S I O Y → “NSIOY” – invalid.

Let’s try N in 3rd:
- _ _ N _ _
Then O and S must fit into 1st, 2nd, 5th with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 5th.

Let’s try C O N I S – but C is allowed, O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try T O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try P O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try H O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try L O N I S – O 2nd (invalid) – bad.

Try S in 5th:
- _ _ _ _ S
Then O and N must fit into 1st, 2nd, 3rd with I somewhere.

Possible pattern: I in 2nd or 3rd.

Let’s try I N O _ S – I 1st (allowed), N 2nd (allowed), O 3rd (allowed), _ 4th, S 5th.
We need a 4th letter from allowed set: B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Try I N O L S – “INOLS” – invalid.

Try I N O M S – “INOMS” – invalid.

Try I N O P S – “INOPS” – invalid.

Try I N O T S – “INOTS” – invalid.

Try I N O C S – “INocs” – invalid.

Try I N O G S – “INGOS” – invalid.

Try I N O K S – “INKS” – valid English word!

Let’s check:
- Letters: I, N, K, O, S – all allowed.
- Positions:
  – I is 1st (no restriction) – ok
  – N is 2nd (not 4th or 5th) – ok
  – O is 4th (not 2nd or 3rd) – ok
  – S is 5th (not 1st or 4th) – ok
- No banned letters – ok

Therefore “INKS” satisfies all constraints.

Guess 4: INKS -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The previous attempt “INKS” was rejected because it was not exactly five letters (it had spaces).  
We are told:

- Letters that must appear: I, O, S, N  
- Letters that cannot appear: A, R, E, U, D, F  
- Position constraints:
  – O cannot be 2nd or 3rd or 4th → only 1st or 5th remain.  
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th → only 2nd or 5th remain.  
  – N cannot be 4th or 5th → only 1st, 2nd, 3rd remain.

We also know I must appear somewhere, and it can go in any remaining slot (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) without conflict.

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: O in 1st  
O _ _ _ _  
Then S and N must fit into 2nd, 3rd, 5th with I placed elsewhere.  
Possible patterns:
- I in 2nd: O I N _ _  → need 4th and 5th letters from allowed set (B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y).  
  O I N C H  → “OINCH” – valid word.

Case 2: O in 5th  
O _ _ _ O  
Then S and N must fit into 2nd, 3rd with I placed in 1st or 2nd or 3rd.  
Possible patterns:
- I in 1st: I N _ _ O  → need 3rd, 4th letters.  
  I N C H O  → “INCHO” – invalid.  
- I in 2nd: _ I N _ O  → need 1st, 4th letters.  
  C I N C O – invalid.  
- I in 3rd: _ _ I N O  → need 1st, 2nd letters.  
  C H I N O – “CHINO” – valid.

Case 3: N in 1st  
N _ _ _ _  
Then O and S must fit into 2nd, 3rd, 5th with I placed in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.  
Possible patterns:
- I in 2nd: N I _ _ _  
  N I C H O – “NICH O” – invalid.  
- I in 3rd: N _ I _ _  
  N C I H O – “NCIHO” – invalid.  
- I in 4th: N _ _ I _  
  N C H I O – “NCHIO” – invalid.

Case 4: S in 5th  
_ _ _ _ S  
Then O and N must fit into 1st, 2nd, 3rd with I placed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd.  
Possible patterns:
- I in 1st: I _ N _ S  
  I C N O S – invalid.  
- I in 2nd: _ I N _ S  
  C I N C S – invalid.  
- I in 3rd: _ _ I N S  
  C H I N S – “CHINS” – valid.

Among the candidates, “CHINO” (Case 2,3) and “NICH O” (Case 1) are the best, but “NICH O” is invalid.  
“CHINS” fits all constraints:  
Letters: C, H, I, N, S – all allowed.  
Positions:  
- C (1st) – ok  
- H (2nd) – ok  
- I (3rd) – ok  
- N (4th) – ok (N not excluded from 4th now)  
- S (5th) – ok  

Therefore, the next logical guess is “CHINS”.

Let’s update what we now know after the five guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word:

- I: cannot be 3rd (from FISON) → can be 1,2,4,5
- N: cannot be 4th (from SOUND) or 5th (from FISON) → only 1st, 2nd, 3rd

So the word structure is:
- 1st: I or O or N
- 2nd: I or O or N
- 3rd: N (only allowed here)
- 4th: I or O
- 5th: S (fixed)

Also, the word must contain O and S, and now I is confirmed.

So the word looks like:
N _ I _ S  or  _ N I _ S  or  _ _ N I S

But N cannot be 5th (already S), and we have only 3 slots to fill.

Let’s list possible words matching N _ I _ S:

Need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed set (B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y) and must form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- N I _ S – but N is 1st, I 3rd, S 5th. Need 2nd and 4th letters.
  N I C K S – “NICKS” – valid.

Check constraints:
- Letters: N, I, C, K, S – all allowed (C was just ruled out, but wait, C was ruled out in CHINS, so C is out. So “NICKS” uses N, I, C, K, S – C is banned. Oops.)

Next try: N O I _ S
- Need 4th letter from allowed set.
  N O I L S – “NOILS” – invalid.

Try: _ N I O S
- 1st letter: must be from allowed set (B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y).
  B N I O S – invalid.

Try: _ _ N I S
- 1st and 2nd letters: allowed set.
  B L N I S – invalid.

Alternative: maybe I should have checked that C was banned in CHINS feedback. Wait, CHINS feedback was C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) S(✓), so C and H are out, but that was already accounted for.

Wait, let’s re-examine:

From CHINS feedback:
- C(x) – C not in word.
- H(x) – H not in word.
- I(-) – I is in word but not in 3rd (already knew).
- N(-) – N is in word but not in 4th (already knew).
- S(✓) – S is in 5th.

So the word ends with S.

So the word structure is:
[1] [2] [3] [4] S
with I, O, N present, and no A, R, E, U, D, F, C, H.

So possible positions:
- O: 1st or 5th (but 5th is S), so O must be 1st.
- N: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5th is S), so I must be 2nd or 4th.

Let’s list possible words starting with O, ending with S, containing I and N, no banned letters.

Valid English words fitting O _ _ _ S:
- ONIONS – uses O, N, I, O, N – but O is repeated, and we don’t know if O can repeat.
- OPIKS – invalid.
- OTIS – too short.
- ONSI – not valid.

Wait, let’s think systematically:

We have:
O _ _ _ S
Must contain I and N (from feedback), and no banned letters.

Possible letters left: B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y

Let’s try:
O N I _ S – need 4th letter.
O N I L S – “ONILS” – invalid.

O N I M S – “ONIMS” – invalid.

O N I K S – “ONIKS” – invalid.

O N I P S – “ONIPS” – invalid.

O N I T S – “ONITS” – invalid.

O N I G S – “ONIGS” – invalid.

O N I V S – “ONIVS” – invalid.

O N I W S – “ONIWS” – invalid.

O N I Y S – “ONIYS” – invalid.

O N I Z S – “ONIZS” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid.

Let’s try:
O _ N I S
- 2nd letter: allowed set.
  O B N I S – “OBNIS” – invalid.

O G N I S – “OGNIS” – invalid.

O L N I S – “OLNIS” – invalid.

O M N I S – “OMNIS” – invalid.

O P N I S – “OPNIS” – invalid.

O T N I S – “OTNIS” – invalid.

O V N I S – “OVNIS” – invalid.

O W N I S – “OWNIS” – invalid.

O Y N I S – “OYNIS” – invalid.

O Z N I S – “OZNIS” – invalid.

None of these are valid.

Next try:
_ O N I S
- 1st letter: allowed set.
  B O N I S – “BONIS” – valid (British spelling of “bonis” meaning good, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, O, N, I, S – all allowed (B is allowed, O, N, I, S are confirmed).
- Positions:
  – B (1st) – ok
  – O (2nd) – ok (only 2nd allowed for O)
  – N (3rd) – ok (N allowed in 3rd)
  – I (4th) – ok
  – S (5th) – ok (confirmed 5th)

So “BONIS” fits all constraints.

But is “BONIS” a valid 5-letter English word? Some dictionaries list it as a variant spelling. However, Scrabble accepts it.

Another candidate: “PONIS” – but P is allowed, but “PONIS” is also valid.

But let’s see which gives more information.

Actually, let’s think of “KNOSY” – but Y is allowed, but O is 3rd (invalid).

“KNOSY” invalid.

“KNIPS” – uses K, N, I, P, S – K and P are allowed.

But “KNIPS” ends with S, but we know S is 5th, so “KNIPS” is invalid (5 letters ending with S).

Wait, “KNIPS” is 5 letters: K, N, I, P, S – ends with S, contains I, N, uses allowed letters.

But we need O, I, N, S – “KNIPS” lacks O.

We must use O, I, N, S.

So we need a word with O, I, N, S plus one more letter.

We have O, I, N, S must be in the word, and it must be 5 letters.

So possible words:
- O N I _ S – need 4th letter.
- _ O N I S – 1st letter must be allowed.

Allowed 1st letters: B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y

Try B O N I S – “BONIS” – valid.

Try G O N I S – “GONIS” – invalid.

Try L O N I S – “LONIS” – invalid.

Try M O N I S – “MONIS” – invalid.

Try P O N I S – “PONIS” – invalid.

Try T O N I S – “TONIS” – valid!

Check “TONIS”:
- T (1st) – allowed
- O (2nd) – allowed (only 2nd allowed for O)
- N (3rd) – allowed
- I (4th) – allowed
- S (5th) – allowed
- Contains O, I, N, S – ok
- No banned letters – ok

“TONIS” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is “TONIS”.
</think>

<guess>TONIS</guess>",TONIS,"Let’s update what we now know after the five guesses.

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- I (from FISON feedback)
- O (from AROSE & SOUND)
- S (from AROSE & CHINS feedback showing S in 5th is correct)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, E, U, D, F, C, H

Positions ruled out so far:
- O: cannot be 2,3,4 → only 1st or 5th
- S: cannot be 1,4 → only 2nd or 5th (but CHINS shows S in 5th is correct, so S must be 5th)
- I: cannot be 3rd (from FISON) → can be 1,2,4,5
- N: cannot be 4th (from SOUND) or 5th (from FISON) → only 1st, 2nd, 3rd

So the word structure is:
- 1st: I or O or N
- 2nd: I or O or N
- 3rd: N (only allowed here)
- 4th: I or O
- 5th: S (fixed)

Also, the word must contain O and S, and now I is confirmed.

So the word looks like:
N _ I _ S  or  _ N I _ S  or  _ _ N I S

But N cannot be 5th (already S), and we have only 3 slots to fill.

Let’s list possible words matching N _ I _ S:

Need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed set (B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y) and must form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- N I _ S – but N is 1st, I 3rd, S 5th. Need 2nd and 4th letters.
  N I C K S – “NICKS” – valid.

Check constraints:
- Letters: N, I, C, K, S – all allowed (C was just ruled out, but wait, C was ruled out in CHINS, so C is out. So “NICKS” uses N, I, C, K, S – C is banned. Oops.)

Next try: N O I _ S
- Need 4th letter from allowed set.
  N O I L S – “NOILS” – invalid.

Try: _ N I O S
- 1st letter: must be from allowed set (B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y).
  B N I O S – invalid.

Try: _ _ N I S
- 1st and 2nd letters: allowed set.
  B L N I S – invalid.

Alternative: maybe I should have checked that C was banned in CHINS feedback. Wait, CHINS feedback was C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) S(✓), so C and H are out, but that was already accounted for.

Wait, let’s re-examine:

From CHINS feedback:
- C(x) – C not in word.
- H(x) – H not in word.
- I(-) – I is in word but not in 3rd (already knew).
- N(-) – N is in word but not in 4th (already knew).
- S(✓) – S is in 5th.

So the word ends with S.

So the word structure is:
[1] [2] [3] [4] S
with I, O, N present, and no A, R, E, U, D, F, C, H.

So possible positions:
- O: 1st or 5th (but 5th is S), so O must be 1st.
- N: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5th is S), so I must be 2nd or 4th.

Let’s list possible words starting with O, ending with S, containing I and N, no banned letters.

Valid English words fitting O _ _ _ S:
- ONIONS – uses O, N, I, O, N – but O is repeated, and we don’t know if O can repeat.
- OPIKS – invalid.
- OTIS – too short.
- ONSI – not valid.

Wait, let’s think systematically:

We have:
O _ _ _ S
Must contain I and N (from feedback), and no banned letters.

Possible letters left: B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y

Let’s try:
O N I _ S – need 4th letter.
O N I L S – “ONILS” – invalid.

O N I M S – “ONIMS” – invalid.

O N I K S – “ONIKS” – invalid.

O N I P S – “ONIPS” – invalid.

O N I T S – “ONITS” – invalid.

O N I G S – “ONIGS” – invalid.

O N I V S – “ONIVS” – invalid.

O N I W S – “ONIWS” – invalid.

O N I Y S – “ONIYS” – invalid.

O N I Z S – “ONIZS” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid.

Let’s try:
O _ N I S
- 2nd letter: allowed set.
  O B N I S – “OBNIS” – invalid.

O G N I S – “OGNIS” – invalid.

O L N I S – “OLNIS” – invalid.

O M N I S – “OMNIS” – invalid.

O P N I S – “OPNIS” – invalid.

O T N I S – “OTNIS” – invalid.

O V N I S – “OVNIS” – invalid.

O W N I S – “OWNIS” – invalid.

O Y N I S – “OYNIS” – invalid.

O Z N I S – “OZNIS” – invalid.

None of these are valid.

Next try:
_ O N I S
- 1st letter: allowed set.
  B O N I S – “BONIS” – valid (British spelling of “bonis” meaning good, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).

Check constraints:
- Letters: B, O, N, I, S – all allowed (B is allowed, O, N, I, S are confirmed).
- Positions:
  – B (1st) – ok
  – O (2nd) – ok (only 2nd allowed for O)
  – N (3rd) – ok (N allowed in 3rd)
  – I (4th) – ok
  – S (5th) – ok (confirmed 5th)

So “BONIS” fits all constraints.

But is “BONIS” a valid 5-letter English word? Some dictionaries list it as a variant spelling. However, Scrabble accepts it.

Another candidate: “PONIS” – but P is allowed, but “PONIS” is also valid.

But let’s see which gives more information.

Actually, let’s think of “KNOSY” – but Y is allowed, but O is 3rd (invalid).

“KNOSY” invalid.

“KNIPS” – uses K, N, I, P, S – K and P are allowed.

But “KNIPS” ends with S, but we know S is 5th, so “KNIPS” is invalid (5 letters ending with S).

Wait, “KNIPS” is 5 letters: K, N, I, P, S – ends with S, contains I, N, uses allowed letters.

But we need O, I, N, S – “KNIPS” lacks O.

We must use O, I, N, S.

So we need a word with O, I, N, S plus one more letter.

We have O, I, N, S must be in the word, and it must be 5 letters.

So possible words:
- O N I _ S – need 4th letter.
- _ O N I S – 1st letter must be allowed.

Allowed 1st letters: B, G, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y

Try B O N I S – “BONIS” – valid.

Try G O N I S – “GONIS” – invalid.

Try L O N I S – “LONIS” – invalid.

Try M O N I S – “MONIS” – invalid.

Try P O N I S – “PONIS” – invalid.

Try T O N I S – “TONIS” – valid!

Check “TONIS”:
- T (1st) – allowed
- O (2nd) – allowed (only 2nd allowed for O)
- N (3rd) – allowed
- I (4th) – allowed
- S (5th) – allowed
- Contains O, I, N, S – ok
- No banned letters – ok

“TONIS” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is “TONIS”.",Guess 6: TONIS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) N(✓) I(-) S(✓),FAIL
