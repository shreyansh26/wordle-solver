- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

   - A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A R _ _
- It contains E (not in position 1 or 5) and O (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or Y.

Letters we still need to place: E, O, plus two more letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Possible positions for E: 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded).
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is taken by A), so 1, 4, or 5.

We also know we need two more consonants that haven’t been used yet (avoiding S, L, Y).

Good candidates for the next guess should test new consonants while placing E and O in possible remaining spots. A word like “OATER” would be bad because it repeats E and O in already-known positions, and uses T and R but R is already known.

A better word is “CATER” but that repeats E and O in bad positions.

Let’s try “OCEAN” but that’s 6 letters.

Wait, we need 5 letters and must place E and O in positions 1,3,4,5 (but A is fixed at 2).

Let’s try “EARTH” – but A is fixed at 2, so this won’t work.

A valid word fitting _ A R _ _ with E and O somewhere is “PARER” – but R is already in position 3 and we can’t have two R’s.

Another option: “MARE” – too short.

“CAROL” – but O is in position 4, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5). So this is invalid.

“EARLY” already tried.

“TAPER” – T and P are new, E in 3, O in 4, A in 2. This fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- T and P are new letters.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Avoids S entirely.
This should help us determine the correct positions for E, A, R, O while testing a new letter L.

A valid word fitting _ A R _ _ with E and O somewhere is “PARER” – but R is already in position 3 and we can’t have two R’s.

Another option: “MARE” – too short.

“CAROL” – but O is in position 4, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5). So this is invalid.

“EARLY” already tried.

“TAPER” – T and P are new, E in 3, O in 4, A in 2. This fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- T and P are new letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, E (but not S).
- Does NOT have A in position 1, R in position 2, O in position 3, or E in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, O, E in different positions and avoids S. A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Uses E (now in position 1, which was in position 5 before).
- Uses A (now in position 2, which was in position 1 before).
- Uses R (now in position 3, which was in position 2 before).
- Uses O (now in position 4, which was in position 3 before).
- Avoids S entirely.
This should help us determine the correct positions for E, A, R, O while testing a new letter L.

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
   - S is not in the word.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A R _ _
- It contains E (not in position 1 or 5) and O (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or Y.

Letters we still need to place: E, O, plus two more letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Possible positions for E: 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded).
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is taken by A), so 1, 4, or 5.

We also know we need two more consonants that haven’t been used yet (avoiding S, L, Y).

Good candidates for the next guess should test new consonants while placing E and O in possible remaining spots. A word like “OATER” would be bad because it repeats E and O in already-known positions, and uses T and R but R is already known.

A better word is “CATER” but that repeats E and O in bad positions.

Let’s try “OCEAN” but that’s 6 letters.

Wait, we need 5 letters and must place E and O in positions 1,3,4,5 (but A is fixed at 2).

Let’s try “EARTH” – but A is fixed at 2, so this won’t work.

- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- T and P are new letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, O, E (but not S).
- Does NOT have A in position 1, R in position 2, O in position 3, or E in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, O, E in different positions and avoids S. A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Uses E (now in position 1, which was in position 5 before).
- Uses A (now in position 2, which was in position 1 before).
- Uses R (now in position 3, which was in position 2 before).
- Uses O (now in position 4, which was in position 3 before).
- Avoids S entirely.
This should help us determine the correct positions for E, A, R, O while testing a new letter L.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
   - S is not in the word.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A R _ _
- It contains E (not in position 1 or 5) and O (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain S, L, or Y.

Letters we still need to place: E, O, plus two more letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Possible positions for E: 3 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded).
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 2 is taken by A), so 1, 4, or 5.

We also know we need two more consonants that haven’t been used yet (avoiding S, L, Y).

Good candidates for the next guess should test new consonants while placing E and O in possible remaining spots. A word like “OATER” would be bad because it repeats E and O in already-known positions, and uses T and R but R is already known.

A better word is “CATER” but that repeats E and O in bad positions.

Let’s try “OCEAN” but that’s 6 letters.

Wait, we need 5 letters and must place E and O in positions 1,3,4,5 (but A is fixed at 2).

Let’s try “EARTH” – but A is fixed at 2, so this won’t work.

A valid word fitting _ A R _ _ with E and O somewhere is “PARER” – but R is already in position 3 and we can’t have two R’s.

Another option: “MARE” – too short.

“CAROL” – but O is in position 4, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5). So this is invalid.

“EARLY” already tried.

“TAPER” – T and P are new, E in 3, O in 4, A in 2. This fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- T and P are new letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: TAPER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, O, E are in the word but misplaced.
   – S is out.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)
   – A is fixed at position 2.
   – R is fixed at position 3.
   – E is still in but not at 1 or 5.
   – L and Y are out.

3. TAPER → T(x) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A again confirmed at 2.
   – E is now fixed at position 4.
   – R is fixed at 3.
   – T and P are out.

Current known pattern: _ A R E _

Letters still needed: two more consonants that haven’t been tried (cannot be S, L, Y, T, P).

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also know O is in the word but not in position 3 (from AROSE), and positions 2,4,5 are taken, so O must be in position 1 or 5.

Thus the word is one of these two patterns:
- O A R E _  (O in 1)
- _ A R E O  (O in 5)

Let’s pick “O A R E _” and choose a new consonant for the last spot.  
A good untested consonant is N → OAREN is not a word.  
Next, try C → OAREC – not valid.  
Try D → OARED – valid word and uses D (new), O (position 1), A (2), R (3), E (4).

This fits all constraints.

Guess 4: OARED -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback:

OARED → O(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)

This tells us:
- O is now fixed in position 1.
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is fixed in position 3.
- E is fixed in position 4.
- D is not in the word.

So the pattern is now: O A R E _

Only the last letter is unknown.  
We know the remaining letter cannot be: S, L, Y, T, P, D.

Also, we still need to test the letter C (from earlier steps) – C has not been tried yet and fits nicely.

So the word must be O A R E C.

Let’s verify:
- O A R E C → O(1) A(2) R(3) E(4) C(5)
- No conflicts with any previous feedback.
- C is a new letter being tested in position 5.
