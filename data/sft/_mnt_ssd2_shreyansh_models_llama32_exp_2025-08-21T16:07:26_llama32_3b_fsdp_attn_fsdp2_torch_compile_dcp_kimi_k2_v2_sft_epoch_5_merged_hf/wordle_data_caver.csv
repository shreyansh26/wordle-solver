### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on CAPER:
- C is now in the correct position (✓) – position 1
- A is still in the correct position (✓) – position 2
- P is not in the word (x)
- E is still in the correct position (✓) – position 4
- R is still in the correct position (✓) – position 5

So the pattern is now:
C A _ E R

We know P is not in the word, and we have ruled out I, S, O, T, P.

We need a letter for position 3. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit C A _ E R:
- C A V E R (V is common)
- C A D E R (D is common)
- C A N E R (N is common)
- C A M E R (M is common)

""CAVER"" is a good test – it uses V, which is common and hasn't been tried yet. If CAVER gives us any hits or mis-placements, we can refine from there.
