### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct last position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A word like ""UNTIE"" would violate rule 2 because of the T and I, but that's not the case here - we know position 5 is E, so we need to focus on words ending in E.

Let's try ""UNTIE"" - it ends in E and contains U, N, T, I, all of which could be in the word.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 5, which is correct, and doesn't contain A, R, O, S. The letters U, N, T, I could all be in the word.

Another option is ""WIDEN"" but that doesn't end in E.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"" as it fits all the constraints.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The vowels left to test are: Y (sometimes used as a vowel), and maybe no more vowels are possible. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word should use as many new, common consonants as possible while keeping the final E. A strong candidate is “WEDGE”:
- W, D, G are new consonants.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)  
   – U, N, T, I are out.

3. WEDGE → W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   – W, D, G are out.

So the forbidden letters are now: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G.

The remaining alphabet for positions 1-4 is: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z plus any other vowels still possible (but we’ve only confirmed E so far).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.
- Uses fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words that fit:
- BUMPY – but ends in Y, not E.
- FLYTE – contains T (forbidden).
- CHIME – contains I (forbidden).
- BLOKE – contains O (forbidden).
- FABLE – contains A (forbidden).
- MAPLE – contains A (forbidden).
- YODEL – contains O (forbidden).
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- HUMVE – not a valid word.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- VENUE – contains U (forbidden).
- VENOM – contains O (forbidden).
- VENUE – still contains U.
- PYGMY – ends in Y.
- CHYMK – not valid.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- FLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- CLAVE – contains A (forbidden).
- PLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- BLAME – contains A (forbidden).
- CHIDE – contains I (forbidden).
- WHIFF – contains W (forbidden).
- YOUTH – contains O, U, T (all forbidden).
- VENUE – U is forbidden.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- HAKKE – not valid.
- BULKY – ends in Y.
- FUNKY – ends in Y.
- LUMPY – ends in Y.
- MUCKY – ends in Y.
- PUCKY – ends in Y.
- CHUMP – ends in P.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K (but K is allowed).

The only valid 5-letter word that ends in E and uses fresh consonants is “CHIDE”, but it contains I (forbidden).  
Next best is “FLUME”, but U is forbidden.

Wait – let’s list all remaining consonants and see a pattern:

Allowed consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E (already fixed), and Y can act as vowel.

Try “CHYME” – not a word.  
Try “BLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
Try “PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “BUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “FUNKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “LUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “MUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “PUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “JEMMY” – ends in Y.  
Try “KAYAK” – ends in K (but K is allowed).

Actually, let’s look for a word with E in position 4 or 5, but we already know E is in position 5, so positions 1-4 must be from remaining consonants and Y.

A valid word is “CHIDE” – but I is forbidden.  
“FLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“BLAME” – A is forbidden.  
“PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
“BUMPY” – ends in Y.

Wait – how about “BEEFY” – but E is in position 2, not 5.

Let’s try “CHYME” – not valid.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words ending in E that do not contain any forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- “BEEFY” – ends in Y.
- “CHEEK” – ends in K.
- “FLECK” – contains C, K, but ends in K.
- “HEDGE” – contains D (forbidden).
- “JEMMY” – ends in Y.
- “KAYAK” – ends in K.
- “LUMPY” – ends in Y.
- “MUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “PUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “VYME” – not valid.
- “YODEL” – contains O, D (both forbidden).
- “ZEBE” – not valid.

Actually, the only valid word that comes to mind is “CHIDE”, but I is forbidden.  
Next is “FLUME” – U is forbidden.

Let me re-examine: are there any valid 5-letter words ending in E without A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G?

Looking up, a valid word is “BEEFY” – but ends in Y.

Wait – how about “CHEEK”?  
Letters: C, H, E, E, K.  
E is allowed in positions 1-4, but we know E is fixed in position 5.  
So “CHEEK” would be C H E E K, but we need E in position 5, so the last E would be in position 4, but we have two E’s. That’s allowed.

But is “CHEEK” a valid word? Yes.

Does it contain any forbidden letters? No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G – all absent.  
And it ends in E – position 5.  
And the letters C, H, E, K are all fresh (except E, which we know is correct).

So “CHEEK” is a valid guess.

Another candidate is “FLECK” – but ends in K, not E.

I think “CHEEK” is the best choice here.

But is “CHEEK” a valid word? Yes.

Does it contain any forbidden letters? No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G – all absent.

And the letters C, H, E, K are all fresh (except E, which we know is correct).

So “CHEEK” is a valid guess.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct last position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A word like ""UNTIE"" would violate rule 2 because of the T and I, but that's not the case here - we know position 5 is E, so we need to focus on words ending in E.

Let's try ""UNTIE"" - it ends in E and contains U, N, T, I, all of which could be in the word.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 5, which is correct, and doesn't contain A, R, O, S. The letters U, N, T, I could all be in the word.

Another option is ""WIDEN"" but that doesn't end in E.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"" as it fits all the constraints.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- The last letter is E (both guesses ended with E and both got ✓ on the 5th position).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

That leaves the possible pool of letters (for positions 1-4) as: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus whatever we haven’t ruled out.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The vowels left to test are: Y (sometimes used as a vowel), and maybe no more vowels are possible. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word should use as many new, common consonants as possible while keeping the final E. A strong candidate is “WEDGE”:
- W, D, G are new consonants.
- E is already confirmed in position 5.
- The word doesn’t contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s go with “WEDGE”.

<guess>WEDGE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: WEDGE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)  
   – U, N, T, I are out.

3. WEDGE → W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   – W, D, G are out.

So the forbidden letters are now: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G.

The remaining alphabet for positions 1-4 is: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z plus any other vowels still possible (but we’ve only confirmed E so far).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.
- Uses fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words that fit:
- BUMPY – but ends in Y, not E.
- FLYTE – contains T (forbidden).
- CHIME – contains I (forbidden).
- BLOKE – contains O (forbidden).
- FABLE – contains A (forbidden).
- MAPLE – contains A (forbidden).
- YODEL – contains O (forbidden).
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- HUMVE – not a valid word.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- VENUE – contains U (forbidden).
- VENOM – contains O (forbidden).
- VENUE – still contains U.
- PYGMY – ends in Y.
- CHYMK – not valid.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- FLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- CLAVE – contains A (forbidden).
- PLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- BLAME – contains A (forbidden).
- CHIDE – contains I (forbidden).
- WHIFF – contains W (forbidden).
- YOUTH – contains O, U, T (all forbidden).
- VENUE – U is forbidden.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- HAKKE – not valid.
- BULKY – ends in Y.
- FUNKY – ends in Y.
- LUMPY – ends in Y.
- MUCKY – ends in Y.
- PUCKY – ends in Y.
- CHUMP – ends in P.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K (but K is allowed).

The only valid 5-letter word that ends in E and uses fresh consonants is “CHIDE”, but it contains I (forbidden).  
Next best is “FLUME”, but U is forbidden.

Wait – let’s list all remaining consonants and see a pattern:

Allowed consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E (already fixed), and Y can act as vowel.

Try “CHYME” – not a word.  
Try “BLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
Try “PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “BUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “FUNKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “LUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “MUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “PUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “JEMMY” – ends in Y.  
Try “KAYAK” – ends in K (but K is allowed).

Actually, let’s look for a word with E in position 4 or 5, but we already know E is in position 5, so positions 1-4 must be from remaining consonants and Y.

A valid word is “CHIDE” – but I is forbidden.  
“FLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“BLAME” – A is forbidden.  
“PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
“BUMPY” – ends in Y.

Wait – how about “BEEFY” – but E is in position 2, not 5.

Let’s try “CHYME” – not valid.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words ending in E that do not contain any forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- “BEEFY” – ends in Y.
- “CHEEK” – ends in K.
- “FLECK” – contains C, K, but ends in K.
- “HEDGE” – contains D (forbidden).
- “JEMMY” – ends in Y.
- “KAYAK” – ends in K.
- “LUMPY” – ends in Y.
- “MUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “PUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “VYME” – not valid.
- “YODEL” – contains O, D (both forbidden).
- “ZEBE” – not valid.

Actually, the only valid word that comes to mind is “CHIDE”, but I is forbidden.  
Next is “FLUME” – U is forbidden.

Let me re-examine: are there any valid 5-letter words ending in E without A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G?

Looking up, a valid word is “BEEFY” – but ends in Y.

Wait – how about “CHEEK”?  
Letters: C, H, E, E, K.  
E is allowed in positions 1-4, but we know E is fixed in position 5.  
So “CHEEK” would be C H E E K, but we need E in position 5, so the last E would be in position 4, but we have two E’s. That’s allowed.

But is “CHEEK” a valid word? Yes.

Does it contain any forbidden letters? No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G – all absent.  
And it ends in E – position 5.  
And the letters C, H, E, K are all fresh (except E, which we know is correct).

So “CHEEK” is a valid guess.

Another candidate is “FLECK” – but ends in K, not E.

I think “CHEEK” is the best choice here.

From the new feedback on CHEEK:
- C and K are NOT in the word (x).
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- The two E’s in positions 3 and 4 are also in the wrong positions (-).

So:
- Position 5 is still E (already known).
- H is somewhere in positions 1-4.
- The two E’s in positions 3 and 4 are not in the word at all (since they were marked wrong-position, but we already know E is fixed in position 5, so these letters must be elsewhere).

However, the feedback shows E in positions 3 and 4 are wrong-position, which implies those E’s do not exist in the word. But we know from earlier that the word must end with E. This seems like a contradiction at first glance.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:
- For CHEEK: C(x) H(-) E(-) E(-) K(x)

This means:
- C and K are not in the word.
- H is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- The first E (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- The second E (position 4) is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- The third E (position 5) is in the word but NOT in position 5. But we already know from earlier that the word ends with E (position 5). This suggests that the word must contain E in position 5, and the feedback for CHEEK is implying that the other E’s in positions 3 and 4 are not in the word, which is consistent with E being only in position 5.

So the word ends with E, and contains H somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is wrong for H).

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G, C, K.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1-4: B, F, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, and possibly others.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing H somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and using only the remaining allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words:
- BHEME – not valid.
- FHEME – not valid.
- JHEME – not valid.
- LHEME – not valid.
- MHEME – not valid.
- PHEME – not valid.
- VHEME – not valid.
- YHEME – not valid.
- ZHEME – not valid.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be ""HEME"" + some letter, but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let’s try ""HEXED"" – but D is forbidden.

Another approach: the word must be ""HEME"" + some letter, but that’s not working.

Let me list valid 5-letter words ending in E that contain H and do not contain any forbidden letters:

- ""BHEME"" – invalid.
- ""FHEME"" – invalid.
- ""LHEME"" – invalid.
- ""MHEME"" – invalid.
- ""PHEME"" – invalid.
- ""VHEME"" – invalid.
- ""YHEME"" – invalid.
- ""ZHEME"" – invalid.

Actually, none of these are valid. Let me try ""HEME"" + another letter.

Wait, let’s try ""HEXED"" – but D is forbidden.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct last position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A word like ""UNTIE"" would violate rule 2 because of the T and I, but that's not the case here - we know position 5 is E, so we need to focus on words ending in E.

Let's try ""UNTIE"" - it ends in E and contains U, N, T, I, all of which could be in the word.

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 5, which is correct, and doesn't contain A, R, O, S. The letters U, N, T, I could all be in the word.

Another option is ""WIDEN"" but that doesn't end in E.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"" as it fits all the constraints.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- The last letter is E (both guesses ended with E and both got ✓ on the 5th position).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

That leaves the possible pool of letters (for positions 1-4) as: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus whatever we haven’t ruled out.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The vowels left to test are: Y (sometimes used as a vowel), and maybe no more vowels are possible. Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word should use as many new, common consonants as possible while keeping the final E. A strong candidate is “WEDGE”:
- W, D, G are new consonants.
- E is already confirmed in position 5.
- The word doesn’t contain any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s go with “WEDGE”.

<guess>WEDGE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: WEDGE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)  
   – U, N, T, I are out.

3. WEDGE → W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   – W, D, G are out.

So the forbidden letters are now: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G.

The remaining alphabet for positions 1-4 is: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z plus any other vowels still possible (but we’ve only confirmed E so far).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.
- Uses fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate words that fit:
- BUMPY – but ends in Y, not E.
- FLYTE – contains T (forbidden).
- CHIME – contains I (forbidden).
- BLOKE – contains O (forbidden).
- FABLE – contains A (forbidden).
- MAPLE – contains A (forbidden).
- YODEL – contains O (forbidden).
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- HUMVE – not a valid word.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- VENUE – contains U (forbidden).
- VENOM – contains O (forbidden).
- VENUE – still contains U.
- PYGMY – ends in Y.
- CHYMK – not valid.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- FLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- CLAVE – contains A (forbidden).
- PLUME – contains U (forbidden).
- BLAME – contains A (forbidden).
- CHIDE – contains I (forbidden).
- WHIFF – contains W (forbidden).
- YOUTH – contains O, U, T (all forbidden).
- VENUE – U is forbidden.
- JEMMY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K.
- HAKKE – not valid.
- BULKY – ends in Y.
- FUNKY – ends in Y.
- LUMPY – ends in Y.
- MUCKY – ends in Y.
- PUCKY – ends in Y.
- CHUMP – ends in P.
- BUMPY – ends in Y.
- JUMPY – ends in Y.
- KAYAK – ends in K (but K is allowed).

The only valid 5-letter word that ends in E and uses fresh consonants is “CHIDE”, but it contains I (forbidden).  
Next best is “FLUME”, but U is forbidden.

Wait – let’s list all remaining consonants and see a pattern:

Allowed consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E (already fixed), and Y can act as vowel.

Try “CHYME” – not a word.  
Try “BLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
Try “PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
Try “BUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “FUNKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “LUMPY” – ends in Y.  
Try “MUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “PUCKY” – ends in Y.  
Try “JEMMY” – ends in Y.  
Try “KAYAK” – ends in K (but K is allowed).

Actually, let’s look for a word with E in position 4 or 5, but we already know E is in position 5, so positions 1-4 must be from remaining consonants and Y.

A valid word is “CHIDE” – but I is forbidden.  
“FLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“BLAME” – A is forbidden.  
“PLUME” – U is forbidden.  
“CLAVE” – A is forbidden.  
“BUMPY” – ends in Y.

Wait – how about “BEEFY” – but E is in position 2, not 5.

Let’s try “CHYME” – not valid.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words ending in E that do not contain any forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- “BEEFY” – ends in Y.
- “CHEEK” – ends in K.
- “FLECK” – contains C, K, but ends in K.
- “HEDGE” – contains D (forbidden).
- “JEMMY” – ends in Y.
- “KAYAK” – ends in K.
- “LUMPY” – ends in Y.
- “MUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “PUCKY” – ends in Y.
- “VYME” – not valid.
- “YODEL” – contains O, D (both forbidden).
- “ZEBE” – not valid.

Actually, the only valid word that comes to mind is “CHIDE”, but I is forbidden.  
Next is “FLUME” – U is forbidden.

Let me re-examine: are there any valid 5-letter words ending in E without A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G?

Looking up, a valid word is “BEEFY” – but ends in Y.

Wait – how about “CHEEK”?  
Letters: C, H, E, E, K.  
E is allowed in positions 1-4, but we know E is fixed in position 5.  
So “CHEEK” would be C H E E K, but we need E in position 5, so the last E would be in position 4, but we have two E’s. That’s allowed.

But is “CHEEK” a valid word? Yes.

Does it contain any forbidden letters? No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G – all absent.  
And it ends in E – position 5.  
And the letters C, H, E, K are all fresh (except E, which we know is correct).

So “CHEEK” is a valid guess.

Another candidate is “FLECK” – but ends in K, not E.

I think “CHEEK” is the best choice here.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are out.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)  
   – U, N, T, I are out.

3. WEDGE → W(x) E(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)  
   – W, D, G are out.

4. CHEEK → C(x) H(-) E(-) E(-) K(x)  
   – C, K are out.  
   – H is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – The second E is in position 4 but is wrong (we already know position 5 is E).

So the word:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains H somewhere except position 2.
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G, C, K.

Remaining usable letters (for positions 1-4) include: B, F, J, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z plus the vowel E (already fixed in position 5) and Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Includes H in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).

Possible words:
- H must appear once among positions 1, 3, 4.
- Remaining two positions must be from B, F, J, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z.

Let’s list valid English words ending in E with H in 1, 3, or 4 and without any forbidden letters:

- HEDGE – contains D (forbidden).  
- HUMVE – U is forbidden.  
- HYPE – ends in E, contains Y, P.  
  – Letters: H, Y, P, E – all allowed.  
  – H is in position 1 (allowed).  
  – E is in position 5 (correct).  
  – Y and P are new tests.

“HYPE” seems perfect.
