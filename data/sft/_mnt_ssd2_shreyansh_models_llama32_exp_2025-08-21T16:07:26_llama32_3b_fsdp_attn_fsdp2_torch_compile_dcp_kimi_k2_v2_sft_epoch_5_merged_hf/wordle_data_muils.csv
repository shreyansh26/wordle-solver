### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This provides a good balance of consonants and vowels. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).

I’ll look for a word with S and L plus other common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""SOLID"":

It also satisfies the positional constraints:
- S is not first (it’s third) ✔
- L is not second or third (it’s not used at all) ✔

From all feedback so far:

So the remaining positions for S, L, I are:

We need two more letters from the still-allowed set:

Let’s try to form a word that uses S, L, I plus U and another consonant, while respecting the positional constraints.

Try placing:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This provides a good balance of consonants and vowels. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S and L, but not A, T, or E. It also does not have S in position 1 or L in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and L (but not A, T, E).
2. Does not place S in position 1 or L in position 2.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, T, E).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, O, U

I’ll look for a word with S and L plus other common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""SOLID"":
- Uses S and L (S in position 1 is now in position 2, L in position 2 is now in position 3, so both are in new positions; S is not first, L is not second—valid).
- Uses O and I (remaining vowels).
- Uses D (remaining consonant).
- No A, T, E.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) L(-) I(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, T, E are NOT in the word.

Round 2 (SOLID):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so L cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O, D are NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Letters we know are in the word: S, L, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D  

Hence the remaining alphabet includes (among others): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have to place:
- S somewhere other than position 1.
- L somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.
- I somewhere other than position 4.

A word that uses S, L, I and only allowed consonants/vowels not yet ruled out is “RISPY”:
- R (allowed)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 3 – allowed, since S only can’t be in 1)
- P (allowed)
- Y (allowed)

It also satisfies the positional constraints:
- S is not first (it’s third) ✔
- L is not second or third (it’s not used at all) ✔
- I is not fourth (it’s second) ✔

No forbidden letters (A, T, E, O, D) appear.

So “RISPY” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y  

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in positions 1 (SLATE) or 3 (RISPY).
- L cannot be in positions 2 (SLATE) or 3 (SOLID) or 5 (RISPY, since L didn’t appear there).
- I cannot be in positions 2 (SOLID) or 4 (RISPY).

So the remaining positions for S, L, I are:
- S: possible positions 2, 4, 5
- L: possible positions 1, 4
- I: possible positions 1, 3, 5

We need two more letters from the still-allowed set:
Allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Allowed vowels: U (only vowel left)

Try placing:

Let me list possible words that fit:

Let's extract the new information from Guess 4:

LUSHS → L(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) S(✓)

- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U is in the word AND in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5.
- H is NOT in the word.
- The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So we now know:
- Letters in the word: S, L, U, S (five S's imply S is in the word at least once, and position 5 has one).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y, H.
- Position 2 is U.
- S is in the word and must appear at least once (positions 2, 4, or 5 are possible, but position 5 is now confirmed as S).
- L is in the word but not in 1, 2, 3, 5 → L must be in 4.
- I is in the word but not in 4 (from SOLID), and not in 2 or 5 (from RISPY), so I must be in 1 or 3.

So far we have:
- Position 1: I or another consonant
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I or another consonant
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: S

We still need one more letter (since we have four known letters). The remaining allowed letters are:
B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern:
- _ U _ L S
- with I somewhere in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. I U _ L S
2. _ U I L S

Let's explore these:

1. I U _ L S:
   - Need a consonant for position 3 from allowed set.
   - Possible: I U B L S – ""IUBLS"" – no.
   - Possible: I U N L S – ""IUNLS"" – no.
   - Real word: I U N L S – ""IUOLS"" – no.

2. _ U I L S:
   - Need a consonant for position 1 from allowed set.
   - Possible: B U I L S – ""BU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: C U I L S – ""CU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: F U I L S – ""FU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: G U I L S – ""GU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: M U I L S – ""MU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: N U I L S – ""NU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: V U I L S – ""VU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: W U I L S – ""WU Ils"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be 5 letters and fit the pattern _ U _ L S with I appearing once more.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in -ULS:
- BULKS – but K is allowed, S is already in 5, but we have four letters and need five letters total. No, ""BULKS"" is 5 letters but has K and S. Wait, ""BULKS"" is B-U-L-K-S, which has U in 2, L in 3 (but L must be in 4). So invalid.

Actually, we need _ U _ L S with I somewhere. Let me list possible words:

- B U I L S – ""BU Ils"" – no.
- C U I L S – ""CU Ils"" – no.
- F U I L S – ""FU Ils"" – no.
- G U I L S – ""GU Ils"" – no.
- M U I L S – ""MU Ils"" – no.
- N U I L S – ""NU Ils"" – no.
- V U I L S – ""VU Ils"" – no.
- W U I L S – ""WU Ils"" – no.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the pattern is _ U _ L S with I appearing once more. Let me think of valid 5-letter words fitting this:

Possible words:
- B U I L S – no.
- C U I L S – no.
- F U I L S – no.
- G U I L S – no.
- M U I L S – no.
- N U I L S – no.
- V U I L S – no.
- W U I L S – no.

Actually, ""FUSIL"" was suggested earlier but has I in position 3 and L in 4, S in 5, U in 2. Let's check if ""FUSIL"" fits all constraints:

F: allowed
U: position 2 (✓)
S: position 5 (✓)
I: position 3 (allowed, not in 2,4,5)
L: position 4 (✓)

""FUSIL"" seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This provides a good balance of consonants and vowels. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it includes the letter L which is also quite common and appears in many 5-letter words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S and L, but not A, T, or E. It also does not have S in position 1 or L in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and L (but not A, T, E).
2. Does not place S in position 1 or L in position 2.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, T, E).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, O, U

I’ll look for a word with S and L plus other common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""SOLID"":
- Uses S and L (S in position 1 is now in position 2, L in position 2 is now in position 3, so both are in new positions; S is not first, L is not second—valid).
- Uses O and I (remaining vowels).
- Uses D (remaining consonant).
- No A, T, E.

<guess>SOLID</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) L(-) I(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A, T, E are NOT in the word.

Round 2 (SOLID):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so L cannot be in 2 or 3).
- O, D are NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Letters we know are in the word: S, L, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D  

Hence the remaining alphabet includes (among others): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have to place:
- S somewhere other than position 1.
- L somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.
- I somewhere other than position 4.

A word that uses S, L, I and only allowed consonants/vowels not yet ruled out is “RISPY”:
- R (allowed)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 3 – allowed, since S only can’t be in 1)
- P (allowed)
- Y (allowed)

It also satisfies the positional constraints:
- S is not first (it’s third) ✔
- L is not second or third (it’s not used at all) ✔
- I is not fourth (it’s second) ✔

No forbidden letters (A, T, E, O, D) appear.

So “RISPY” is a valid next guess.

<guess>RISPY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) L(-) I(-) D(x)
Guess 3: RISPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word: S, L, I  
Known letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y  

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in positions 1 (SLATE) or 3 (RISPY).
- L cannot be in positions 2 (SLATE) or 3 (SOLID) or 5 (RISPY, since L didn’t appear there).
- I cannot be in positions 2 (SOLID) or 4 (RISPY).

So the remaining positions for S, L, I are:
- S: possible positions 2, 4, 5
- L: possible positions 1, 4
- I: possible positions 1, 3, 5

We need two more letters from the still-allowed set:
Allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Allowed vowels: U (only vowel left)

Let’s try to form a word that uses S, L, I plus U and another consonant, while respecting the positional constraints.

Try placing:
- S in position 2
- L in position 1
- I in position 5
- Need two more letters, but we only have three letters in the word so far. Wait, we need five letters total.

Let me list possible words that fit:
- S must be in 2, 4, or 5
- L must be in 1 or 4
- I must be in 1, 3, or 5

One valid combination: S in 2, L in 1, I in 5.
Word: L S _ _ I
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set.

Possible: L S U N I (but ""LSUNI"" isn't a word)
Actually, let me think of real words:

Try ""LUSHS"" – but S is in 5, which is allowed, but has H and S.
But we need to place I somewhere.

Another approach: S in 4, L in 1 or 4, I in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let's try:
- S in 4
- L in 1
- I in 3
Word: L _ I S _
Need two letters for positions 2 and 5 from allowed set.

Possible: L U I S N → ""LUISN"" – not a word.
""LUSIN"" – not a word.
""LISUN"" – not a word.

Alternative: S in 4, L in 4 (but L can't be in 4 if S is there), so L in 1.

Let's try:
- S in 1 (but S can't be in 1 from SLATE feedback) – oops, invalid.

Another valid combination: S in 2, L in 4, I in 5.
Word: _ S _ L I
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible: B S U L I – ""BSULI"" – no.
C S U L I – ""CSULI"" – no.
F S U L I – ""FSULI"" – no.

Real word: ""FUSIL"" – but F, U, S, I, L.
Check constraints:
- S is in position 3 – allowed (not 1 or 3 in previous guesses? Wait, in RISPY, S was in position 3 and got ""-"", so S cannot be in 3. So S must be in 2 or 4.

Similarly, L cannot be in 2 or 3 or 5, so L must be in 1 or 4.

I cannot be in 2 or 4, so I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try placing:
- S in 2
- L in 4
- I in 3
Word: _ S I L _
Need letters for positions 1 and 5.

Possible: B S I L N – ""BSILN"" – no.
C S I L N – ""CSILN"" – no.
F S I L N – ""FSILN"" – no.

Real word: ""FILMS"" – but has M and F, but F is allowed.

Check constraints:
F: allowed
I: must be in word, here in position 2 – but I cannot be in 2 (from SOLID feedback). So invalid.

Another approach: S in 4, L in 1, I in 5
Word: L _ _ S I
Need letters for positions 2 and 3.
Possible: L U B S I – ""LUBSI"" – no.
L U C S I – ""LUCSI"" – no.

Real word: ""LUSHS"" – but has H and S, and U.
Check constraints:
L: position 1 – allowed
U: allowed
S: position 4 – allowed
I: position 3 – allowed
H: allowed
And ""LUSHS"" is a valid word.

Let me verify:
- L in 1 – allowed (not in 2,3,5)
- U – allowed
- S in 4 – allowed (not in 1,3)
- I in 3 – allowed (not in 2,4)
- H – allowed

No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) L(-) I(-) D(x)
Guess 3: RISPY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) I(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: LUSHS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's extract the new information from Guess 4:

LUSHS → L(-) U(✓) S(-) H(x) S(✓)

- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U is in the word AND in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5.
- H is NOT in the word.
- The final S is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So we now know:
- Letters in the word: S, L, U, S (five S's imply S is in the word at least once, and position 5 has one).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y, H.
- Position 2 is U.
- S is in the word and must appear at least once (positions 2, 4, or 5 are possible, but position 5 is now confirmed as S).
- L is in the word but not in 1, 2, 3, 5 → L must be in 4.
- I is in the word but not in 4 (from SOLID), and not in 2 or 5 (from RISPY), so I must be in 1 or 3.

So far we have:
- Position 1: I or another consonant
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I or another consonant
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: S

We still need one more letter (since we have four known letters). The remaining allowed letters are:
B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern:
- _ U _ L S
- with I somewhere in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
1. I U _ L S
2. _ U I L S

Let's explore these:

1. I U _ L S:
   - Need a consonant for position 3 from allowed set.
   - Possible: I U B L S – ""IUBLS"" – no.
   - Possible: I U N L S – ""IUNLS"" – no.
   - Real word: I U N L S – ""IUOLS"" – no.

2. _ U I L S:
   - Need a consonant for position 1 from allowed set.
   - Possible: B U I L S – ""BU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: C U I L S – ""CU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: F U I L S – ""FU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: G U I L S – ""GU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: M U I L S – ""MU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: N U I L S – ""NU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: V U I L S – ""VU Ils"" – no.
   - Possible: W U I L S – ""WU Ils"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be 5 letters and fit the pattern _ U _ L S with I appearing once more.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in -ULS:
- BULKS – but K is allowed, S is already in 5, but we have four letters and need five letters total. No, ""BULKS"" is 5 letters but has K and S. Wait, ""BULKS"" is B-U-L-K-S, which has U in 2, L in 3 (but L must be in 4). So invalid.

Actually, we need _ U _ L S with I somewhere. Let me list possible words:

- B U I L S – ""BU Ils"" – no.
- C U I L S – ""CU Ils"" – no.
- F U I L S – ""FU Ils"" – no.
- G U I L S – ""GU Ils"" – no.
- M U I L S – ""MU Ils"" – no.
- N U I L S – ""NU Ils"" – no.
- V U I L S – ""VU Ils"" – no.
- W U I L S – ""WU Ils"" – no.

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the pattern is _ U _ L S with I appearing once more. Let me think of valid 5-letter words fitting this:

Possible words:
- B U I L S – no.
- C U I L S – no.
- F U I L S – no.
- G U I L S – no.
- M U I L S – no.
- N U I L S – no.
- V U I L S – no.
- W U I L S – no.

Actually, ""FUSIL"" was suggested earlier but has I in position 3 and L in 4, S in 5, U in 2. Let's check if ""FUSIL"" fits all constraints:

F: allowed
U: position 2 (✓)
S: position 5 (✓)
I: position 3 (allowed, not in 2,4,5)
L: position 4 (✓)

And no forbidden letters.

""FUSIL"" seems valid.

Let me verify constraints:
- F: allowed
- U: position 2 (✓)
- S: position 5 (✓)
- I: position 3 (allowed)
- L: position 4 (✓)
- No A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y, H.

This fits perfectly.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E.

S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 3.  
I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.  
L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 5.

Recap of everything we now know:

Letters we have ruled out: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y, H, F  
Letters we know are in the word: S, L, I, U (and we finally know S is in position 5 from LUSHS).  
So the word is _ U _ L S.

Positions still open: 1 and 3.

Constraints:
- Position 1 consonant: any allowed consonant except those ruled out above.  
- Position 3 consonant: any allowed consonant except those ruled out above, and must also avoid repeating any letter already in the word (none have been repeated).  

Allowed consonants left: B, C, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid English word of the form ? U ? L S.

Let’s list possibilities quickly:
- B U B L S – no.  
- B U C L S – no.  
- B U N L S – no.  
- C U B L S – no.  
- C U N L S – no.  
- G U N L S – no.  
- J U N L S – no.  
- M U N L S – no.  
- V U N L S – no.  
- W U N L S – no.  
- C U L S – but we need 5 letters.  
- Actually, the pattern is 1-2-3-4-5:  
  1: ?  
  2: U  
  3: ?  
  4: L  
  5: S  

So the word is [1][2] [3] [4] [5] with:
- 2 = U  
- 4 = L  
- 5 = S  

And letters 1 and 3 must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants.

We need a real 5-letter word fitting:  
? U ? L S

Possible real words:
- BULKS – but L is in 4, S in 5, but K is allowed. Wait, ""BULKS"" has K in 3 and L in 4, S in 5, U in 2.  
  Letters: B, U, L, K, S – all allowed.  
  And:
- BULKS is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- B: allowed  
- U: position 2 (✓)  
- L: position 4 (✓)  
- K: allowed  
- S: position 5 (✓)  

No forbidden letters. This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is BULKS.

Letters we have ruled out: A, T, E, O, D, R, P, Y, H, F  
Letters we know are in the word: S, L, I, U (and we finally know S is in position 5 from LUSHS).  
So the word is _ U _ L S.

Positions still open: 1 and 3.

Constraints:
- Position 1 consonant: any allowed consonant except those ruled out above.  
- Position 3 consonant: any allowed consonant except those ruled out above, and must also avoid repeating any letter already in the word (none have been repeated).  

Allowed consonants left: B, C, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid English word of the form ? U ? L S.

Let’s list possibilities quickly:
- B U B L S – no.  
- B U C L S – no.  
- B U N L S – no.  
- C U B L S – no.  
- C U N L S – no.  
- G U N L S – no.  
- J U N L S – no.  
- M U N L S – no.  
- V U N L S – no.  
- W U N L S – no.  
- C U L S – but we need 5 letters.  
- Actually, the pattern is 1-2-3-4-5:  
  1: ?  
  2: U  
  3: ?  
  4: L  
  5: S  

So the word is [1][2] [3] [4] [5] with:
- 2 = U  
- 4 = L  
- 5 = S  

And letters 1 and 3 must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants.

We need a real 5-letter word fitting:  
? U ? L S

Possible real words:
- BULKS – but L is in 4, S in 5, but K is allowed. Wait, ""BULKS"" has K in 3 and L in 4, S in 5, U in 2.  
  Letters: B, U, L, K, S – all allowed.  
  And:
- BULKS is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- B: allowed  
- U: position 2 (✓)  
- L: position 4 (✓)  
- K: allowed  
- S: position 5 (✓)  

No forbidden letters. This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is BULKS.",Guess 6: BULKS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(-) K(x) S(✓),FAIL
