### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us feedback on these highly common letters and help narrow down the secret word significantly.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).

I need a new 5-letter word that uses R, S, E, avoids A & O, and respects the positional restrictions.  
Let me pick a word that shifts R, S, E to new positions and adds two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (T and I are high-frequency untested letters).

Candidate: STERE
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4).

- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.

I need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E, avoids A/O/T, and respects the positional restrictions.  
Let’s try to shift R, S, E into allowed slots and add two new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet (I and N are good untested letters).

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, 5.
- E can be in 1, 2, 4.
- R can be in 1, 3, 5.

Candidate: SNIPE
- S in position 1 – but S is forbidden in position 1 (from STERE feedback).  
Bad candidate.

Candidate: ERISE
- E in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (forbidden – R cannot be in 2).  
Bad candidate.

Candidate: INERS
- I, N, E, R, S.
- E in position 3 (forbidden – E cannot be in 3).  
Bad candidate.

Candidate: SNIPE already failed.

Try: SIREN
- S in 1 – forbidden.  
Bad.

Try: RISEN
- R in 1 (allowed), I in 2, S in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), N in 5.
- Contains R, S, E without forbidden letters.
- Check positions:
  – R is in 1 (allowed, since R was only banned from 2 & 4).
  – S is in 3 (allowed, since S was only banned from 1 & 4).
  – E is in 4 (allowed, since E was only banned from 3 & 5).
This seems valid.

From the new feedback on RISEN:
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position (position 1).
- I(✓) – I is in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S must be in 4 or 5).
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position (position 4).
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so N must be in 3).

Current constraints:
1. Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 1), I (pos 2), S (pos 4 or 5), E (pos 4), N (pos 3).
2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, T.
3. Positions so far:
   1: R
   2: I
   3: N
   4: E
   5: S (or another letter if S isn't in 5)
4. The remaining letter must be from the unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

Since S must be in position 5 (because it can't be in 3 and 4 is E), we have:
   1: R
   2: I
   3: N
   4: E
   5: S

This forms the pattern R I N E S. The only missing letter is at position 3, but we've already placed R, I, N, E, S. However, we need a 5-letter word, and this pattern gives us RINES.

Let's verify:
- RINES:
  - R (pos 1) ✓
  - I (pos 2) ✓
  - N (pos 3) ✓
  - E (pos 4) ✓
  - S (pos 5) ✓
  - No A, O, T used.
  - All constraints satisfied.

This should be the correct word.
