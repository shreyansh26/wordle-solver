### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Try TRULY was invalid because R was in position 2.

Next candidate: TARDY
- T in position 1.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- D, Y are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: TULIP (but I is excluded), TAWNY (W, Y new), TURBO (O excluded), TARDY seems best.

Let’s go with TARDY.

Check:
- T in position 1 (✓ from TRAIN).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 3 but can be in 2).
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in positions 1 or 2).

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate endings:
- TAR_ _ → TARDO (but D is out), TAROK (K is allowed), TAROT (T is already used), TARPS (P,S allowed), etc.
- TAR_ _ with valid letters: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (but T already used), TARDO (D out), TARSI (S,I out), TAROC (C allowed), TAROT (T duplicate).

Best valid words: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (if T repeats, which is allowed).

TAROK is a valid word (a variant spelling of “tarok” or “tarock”), but less common.

TARPS is a valid word (short for “tarps” – temporary roof).

TAROT is the most common word among these and uses T again in position 5, which is allowed.

So I’ll choose TAROT.

Check:
- T A R O T → but O is excluded (from AROSE feedback), so this fails.

Next choice: TARPS → T A R P S → P and S are allowed, S wasn’t excluded yet.

Check: T A R P S → valid letters, no conflicts.

Another candidate: TAROC → T A R O C → O is excluded.

TAROT fails because of O.

So TARPS seems the only valid option left that fits all constraints.

But wait, let’s double-check: TARPS uses P and S, both allowed.

Thus, TARPS is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (and keeps them in different positions than 1 and 2 respectively).
2. Avoids O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, T, N, L, U, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- R is moved to position 2 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 2 in AROSE, but we know it's somewhere else).
- A is moved to position 3.
- Uses T, I, N which are new and common.

Another option could be ""DRAIN"" or ""RATIO"", but ""TRAIN"" seems efficient.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T is in the word and in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already known it’s not in position 1 either).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains A and R, but A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2 or 1 (since it was excluded from position 1 by TRAIN’s feedback).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, I, N.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5.
Remaining possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

We need a word that:
- Starts with T.
- Uses A and R in allowed positions.
- Avoids O, S, E, I, N.
- Uses other common letters (D, L, C, U, etc.) to test new letters.

Candidate letters: U, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try TRULY:
- T in position 1 (✓).
- R in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from TRAIN feedback). So this is invalid.

Try TRULY was invalid because R was in position 2.

Next candidate: TARDY
- T in position 1.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- D, Y are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: TULIP (but I is excluded), TAWNY (W, Y new), TURBO (O excluded), TARDY seems best.

Let’s go with TARDY.

Check:
- T in position 1 (✓ from TRAIN).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 3 but can be in 2).
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in positions 1 or 2).
- D and Y are new letters.
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, I, N) are used.

   – R is in the word but not in position 2 (already excluded from 1).
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. TARDY → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
   – T confirmed in position 1.
   – A confirmed in position 2.
   – R confirmed in position 3.
   – D and Y are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
T A R _ _

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, R, T already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate endings:
- TAR_ _ → TARDO (but D is out), TAROK (K is allowed), TAROT (T is already used), TARPS (P,S allowed), etc.
- TAR_ _ with valid letters: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (but T already used), TARDO (D out), TARSI (S,I out), TAROC (C allowed), TAROT (T duplicate).

Best valid words: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (if T repeats, which is allowed).

TAROK is a valid word (a variant spelling of “tarok” or “tarock”), but less common.

TARPS is a valid word (short for “tarps” – temporary roof).

TAROT is the most common word among these and uses T again in position 5, which is allowed.

So I’ll choose TAROT.

Check:
- T A R O T → but O is excluded (from AROSE feedback), so this fails.

Next choice: TARPS → T A R P S → P and S are allowed, S wasn’t excluded yet.

Check: T A R P S → valid letters, no conflicts.

Another candidate: TAROC → T A R O C → O is excluded.

TAROT fails because of O.

So TARPS seems the only valid option left that fits all constraints.

But wait, let’s double-check: TARPS uses P and S, both allowed.

Thus, TARPS is a valid guess.

From the four rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   – O, S, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – T is in position 1.
   – R is in the word but not in position 2 (already excluded from 1).
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I and N are out.

3. TARDY → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
   – T confirmed in position 1.
   – A confirmed in position 2.
   – R confirmed in position 3.
   – D and Y are out.

4. TARPS → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(x)
   – P and S are out.

So the pattern is now:
T A R _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, R, T already placed).

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible endings:
- TAR_ _ : TAROK (O, K allowed), TARFO (O, F allowed), TARLC (L, C allowed), etc.
- TAR_ _ with valid letters: TAROK (K, O allowed but O is excluded), TARFO (O excluded), TARLC (no O, I, S, E, N, D, Y, P, etc.).

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- TAROK – uses K and O; O is excluded → invalid.
- TARFO – uses F and O; O excluded → invalid.
- TARLC – uses L and C; both allowed and no conflicts.

TARLC is a valid word (a variant spelling of “tarok” or “taroc” but not standard).

Another check: TARUM – uses U, M; both allowed, no conflicts.

But TARLC seems the most straightforward with available letters.

However, let’s verify TARUM:
- T A R U M → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) U M.
- U and M are allowed (not yet excluded).

Thus, TARUM is a valid guess.

But let’s also consider TAROK – but O is excluded.

So possible words:
- TARLC
- TARUM

Between these, TARUM is more common.

But let’s see if there’s another: TARAG – but G is allowed, but “TARAG” isn’t a standard word.

TARDO – D is out.

TARSI – S, I out.

TAROC – O, C: O excluded.

TAROT – T repeated, but T is allowed to repeat, and O excluded.

Thus, the only valid remaining word seems TARLC or TARUM.

But let’s check if there’s another: TARAK – K allowed, but “TARAK” isn’t standard.

TARAG – not standard.

TARAY – Y excluded.

TARAZ – Z allowed, but “TARAZ” isn’t standard.

Thus, the only valid standard word left appears to be TARLC or TARUM.

But let’s re-examine available letters for position 4 and 5.

Allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- TAROK – O excluded.
- TARFO – O excluded.
- TARAG – not standard.
- TARUM – valid (slang for “tumid”).
- TARLC – valid (variant of “tarok” but not standard).

Given that, the best valid guess seems TARLC, but it’s a variant. The standard word list recognizes “TAROK” as a variant of “TAROT” but with O excluded.

However, from standard word lists, the actual standard word that fits is “TAROT”, but O is excluded.

Rechecking: the standard word list includes “TAROK” (a variant of “TAROT” but invalid due to O).

Thus, the only valid standard word left is “TARLC”.

But “TARLC” isn’t standard. This suggests I might have missed another.

Another valid word: TARAG – not standard.

Thus, the valid word left is TARUM.

However, upon reviewing standard word lists, the actual word that fits is “TAROT”, but O is excluded.

This implies the only valid word left is TARLC, but it’s not standard.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct standard word that fits the constraints is “TAROK” but O is excluded.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Rechecking:

From AROSE: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x) – O, S, E excluded.

From TRAIN: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) – I, N excluded.

From TARDY: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x) – D, Y excluded.

From TARPS: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(x) – P, S excluded.

Thus, letters excluded so far: O, S, E, I, N, D, Y, P.

So excluded letters: O, S, E, I, N, D, Y, P.

Available letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- TAROK (O excluded)
- TARFO (O excluded)
- TARAG (not standard)
- TARUM (valid)
- TARLC (variant of “tarok”, but not standard)

Thus, the only valid guess left is TARUM.

But let’s verify: TARUM is a valid word (meaning “to fatten”).

Therefore, the next guess is TARUM.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (and keeps them in different positions than 1 and 2 respectively).
2. Avoids O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, T, N, L, U, D, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- R is moved to position 2 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 2 in AROSE, but we know it's somewhere else).
- A is moved to position 3.
- Uses T, I, N which are new and common.

Another option could be ""DRAIN"" or ""RATIO"", but ""TRAIN"" seems efficient.

<guess>TRAIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T is in the word and in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already known it’s not in position 1 either).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains A and R, but A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2 or 1 (since it was excluded from position 1 by TRAIN’s feedback).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, I, N.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3, 4, 5.
Remaining possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

We need a word that:
- Starts with T.
- Uses A and R in allowed positions.
- Avoids O, S, E, I, N.
- Uses other common letters (D, L, C, U, etc.) to test new letters.

Candidate letters: U, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try TRULY:
- T in position 1 (✓).
- R in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from TRAIN feedback). So this is invalid.

Try TRULY was invalid because R was in position 2.

Next candidate: TARDY
- T in position 1.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- D, Y are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: TULIP (but I is excluded), TAWNY (W, Y new), TURBO (O excluded), TARDY seems best.

Let’s go with TARDY.

Check:
- T in position 1 (✓ from TRAIN).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 3 but can be in 2).
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in positions 1 or 2).
- D and Y are new letters.
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, I, N) are used.

<guess>TARDY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: TARDY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   – O, S, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – T is in position 1.
   – R is in the word but not in position 2 (already excluded from 1).
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I and N are out.

3. TARDY → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
   – T confirmed in position 1.
   – A confirmed in position 2.
   – R confirmed in position 3.
   – D and Y are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
T A R _ _

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, R, T already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate endings:
- TAR_ _ → TARDO (but D is out), TAROK (K is allowed), TAROT (T is already used), TARPS (P,S allowed), etc.
- TAR_ _ with valid letters: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (but T already used), TARDO (D out), TARSI (S,I out), TAROC (C allowed), TAROT (T duplicate).

Best valid words: TAROK, TARPS, TAROT (if T repeats, which is allowed).

TAROK is a valid word (a variant spelling of “tarok” or “tarock”), but less common.

TARPS is a valid word (short for “tarps” – temporary roof).

TAROT is the most common word among these and uses T again in position 5, which is allowed.

So I’ll choose TAROT.

Check:
- T A R O T → but O is excluded (from AROSE feedback), so this fails.

Next choice: TARPS → T A R P S → P and S are allowed, S wasn’t excluded yet.

Check: T A R P S → valid letters, no conflicts.

Another candidate: TAROC → T A R O C → O is excluded.

TAROT fails because of O.

So TARPS seems the only valid option left that fits all constraints.

But wait, let’s double-check: TARPS uses P and S, both allowed.

Thus, TARPS is a valid guess.

<guess>TARPS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   – O, S, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – T is in position 1.
   – R is in the word but not in position 2 (already excluded from 1).
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – I and N are out.

3. TARDY → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
   – T confirmed in position 1.
   – A confirmed in position 2.
   – R confirmed in position 3.
   – D and Y are out.

4. TARPS → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(x)
   – P and S are out.

So the pattern is now:
T A R _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A, R, T already placed).

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible endings:
- TAR_ _ : TAROK (O, K allowed), TARFO (O, F allowed), TARLC (L, C allowed), etc.
- TAR_ _ with valid letters: TAROK (K, O allowed but O is excluded), TARFO (O excluded), TARLC (no O, I, S, E, N, D, Y, P, etc.).

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- TAROK – uses K and O; O is excluded → invalid.
- TARFO – uses F and O; O excluded → invalid.
- TARLC – uses L and C; both allowed and no conflicts.

TARLC is a valid word (a variant spelling of “tarok” or “taroc” but not standard).

Another check: TARUM – uses U, M; both allowed, no conflicts.

But TARLC seems the most straightforward with available letters.

However, let’s verify TARUM:
- T A R U M → T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) U M.
- U and M are allowed (not yet excluded).

Thus, TARUM is a valid guess.

But let’s also consider TAROK – but O is excluded.

So possible words:
- TARLC

Between these, TARUM is more common.

But let’s see if there’s another: TARAG – but G is allowed, but “TARAG” isn’t a standard word.

TARAG – not standard.

TARAY – Y excluded.

TARAZ – Z allowed, but “TARAZ” isn’t standard.

Thus, the only valid standard word left appears to be TARLC or TARUM.

But let’s re-examine available letters for position 4 and 5.

Allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:

- TARFO – O excluded.
- TARAG – not standard.
- TARUM – valid (slang for “tumid”).
- TARLC – valid (variant of “tarok” but not standard).

Given that, the best valid guess seems TARLC, but it’s a variant. The standard word list recognizes “TAROK” as a variant of “TAROT” but with O excluded.

However, from standard word lists, the actual standard word that fits is “TAROT”, but O is excluded.

Rechecking: the standard word list includes “TAROK” (a variant of “TAROT” but invalid due to O).

Thus, the only valid standard word left is “TARLC”.

But “TARLC” isn’t standard. This suggests I might have missed another.

Another valid word: TARAG – not standard.

Thus, the valid word left is TARUM.

However, upon reviewing standard word lists, the actual word that fits is “TAROT”, but O is excluded.

This implies the only valid word left is TARLC, but it’s not standard.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct standard word that fits the constraints is “TAROK” but O is excluded.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Rechecking:

From AROSE: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x) – O, S, E excluded.

From TRAIN: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) – I, N excluded.

From TARDY: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x) – D, Y excluded.

From TARPS: T(✓) A(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(x) – P, S excluded.

Thus, letters excluded so far: O, S, E, I, N, D, Y, P.

So excluded letters: O, S, E, I, N, D, Y, P.

Available letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- TAROK (O excluded)
- TARFO (O excluded)
- TARAG (not standard)
- TARUM (valid)
- TARLC (variant of “tarok”, but not standard)

Thus, the only valid guess left is TARUM.

But let’s verify: TARUM is a valid word (meaning “to fatten”).

Therefore, the next guess is TARUM.
