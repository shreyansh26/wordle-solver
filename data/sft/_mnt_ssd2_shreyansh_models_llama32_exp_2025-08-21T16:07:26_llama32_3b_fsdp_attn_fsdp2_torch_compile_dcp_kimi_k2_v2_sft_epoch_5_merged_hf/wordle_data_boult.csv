### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes O somewhere except position 3.
- Excludes A, R, S, E.

Common consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Common vowels still available: I, U (O is already confirmed).

A good next guess would use fresh common letters while placing O in a different spot. A candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.
- O is placed in position 2 instead of 3 to test its new location.

<guess>POINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - O – and we know O is in position 2 (✓ at second letter).
   - T – somewhere, but not in position 5 (✓ at fifth letter means it’s actually in position 5, so this is a contradiction unless the feedback was mis-recorded. Re-reading: the feedback for POINT is P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓). So T is in position 5, and the feedback symbol at position 5 is indeed ✓, meaning T is correct there. Therefore T is the last letter.)

So the word pattern is: _ O _ _ T

Letters still available (excluding the ones we’ve ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has T in position 5.
- Uses only the still-available letters.

Candidate words that fit _ O _ _ T:
- BOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed) – but is BOUGH a valid English word? Yes, “bough” is archaic but accepted.
- COULD (but L and D are allowed) – but would require U, L, D.
- DOOT (but O is repeated, and D, O, T are allowed) – but “doot” is rare.
- FORTH (F, O, R, T, H) – but R is excluded.
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – uses M, U, H; “mouth” is common.
- YOUTH (Y, O, U, T, H) – uses Y, U, H.

Among these, “MOUTH” is common and uses fresh letters M, U, H while fitting the pattern.

Let’s choose MOUTH.

<guess>MOUTH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, M, H.
2. Positions we have:
   - Position 2 = O (✓)
   - Position 5 = T (✓ from POINT feedback) – but in MOUTH the same T is marked “-” (wrong position), which is impossible if T is indeed at position 5.  
     Therefore the feedback for MOUTH must have been mis-recorded; the ✓ at position 5 in POINT stands, so T is locked at position 5.
3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - U – marked “✓” in MOUTH, so U is in the word, but not in position 3 (since MOUTH had U in position 3 and it got ✓, wait: no, in MOUTH the feedback was U(✓) which means U is in the word and in the correct position – position 3.  
     So U is fixed at position 3: _ O U _ T
4. Remaining letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: ? O U ? T

Possible candidates:
- BOUET (but E is excluded)
- COULD (but L, D are allowed) – but D is allowed, L is allowed. Check if COULD fit: C O U L D – yes, and all letters are allowed.
- FOUCE (but C is allowed) – but FOUCE isn’t a common word.
- GOUCT (not a word)
- COVET (C, O, V, E, T) – but E is excluded.
- DOUBT (but B is allowed) – but pattern is _ O U _ T, so DOUBT doesn’t fit.
- COULT (not a word)
- COUPT (not a word)

The most common valid word fitting _ O U _ T is COULD.

Let’s check:
- C, O, U, L, D – none are in the excluded list.
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓ from MOUTH feedback)
- T is in position 5 (✓ from POINT feedback)
- L and D are new letters to test.

Thus COULD is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes O somewhere except position 3.
- Excludes A, R, S, E.

Common consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Common vowels still available: I, U (O is already confirmed).

A good next guess would use fresh common letters while placing O in a different spot. A candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.
- O is placed in position 2 instead of 3 to test its new location.

<guess>POINT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word:
   - O – and we know O is in position 2 (✓ at second letter).
   - T – somewhere, but not in position 5 (✓ at fifth letter means it’s actually in position 5, so this is a contradiction unless the feedback was mis-recorded. Re-reading: the feedback for POINT is P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓). So T is in position 5, and the feedback symbol at position 5 is indeed ✓, meaning T is correct there. Therefore T is the last letter.)

So the word pattern is: _ O _ _ T

Letters still available (excluding the ones we’ve ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has T in position 5.
- Uses only the still-available letters.

Candidate words that fit _ O _ _ T:
- BOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed) – but is BOUGH a valid English word? Yes, “bough” is archaic but accepted.
- COULD (but L and D are allowed) – but would require U, L, D.
- DOOT (but O is repeated, and D, O, T are allowed) – but “doot” is rare.
- FORTH (F, O, R, T, H) – but R is excluded.
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – uses M, U, H; “mouth” is common.
- YOUTH (Y, O, U, T, H) – uses Y, U, H.

Among these, “MOUTH” is common and uses fresh letters M, U, H while fitting the pattern.

Let’s choose MOUTH.

Guess 3: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, M, H.
2. Positions we have:
   - Position 2 = O (✓)
   - Position 5 = T (✓ from POINT feedback) – but in MOUTH the same T is marked “-” (wrong position), which is impossible if T is indeed at position 5.  
     Therefore the feedback for MOUTH must have been mis-recorded; the ✓ at position 5 in POINT stands, so T is locked at position 5.
3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - U – marked “✓” in MOUTH, so U is in the word, but not in position 3 (since MOUTH had U in position 3 and it got ✓, wait: no, in MOUTH the feedback was U(✓) which means U is in the word and in the correct position – position 3.  
     So U is fixed at position 3: _ O U _ T
4. Remaining letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: ? O U ? T

Possible candidates:
- BOUET (but E is excluded)
- COULD (but L, D are allowed) – but D is allowed, L is allowed. Check if COULD fit: C O U L D – yes, and all letters are allowed.
- FOUCE (but C is allowed) – but FOUCE isn’t a common word.
- GOUCT (not a word)
- COVET (C, O, V, E, T) – but E is excluded.
- DOUBT (but B is allowed) – but pattern is _ O U _ T, so DOUBT doesn’t fit.
- COULT (not a word)
- COUPT (not a word)

The most common valid word fitting _ O U _ T is COULD.

Let’s check:
- C, O, U, L, D – none are in the excluded list.
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓ from MOUTH feedback)
- T is in position 5 (✓ from POINT feedback)
- L and D are new letters to test.

Thus COULD is a strong next guess.

   - Position 3 = U (✓ from MOUTH and COULD)
   - Position 4 = L (✓ from COULD)

   So the pattern is: _ O U L _

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, M, H, C, D.

3. Remaining letters that can still appear:
   B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? O U L ?

   Possible candidates:
   - BOUL? – no common words.
   - FOUL? – “FOUL” is a word (archaic for “foul” or “foil”), but let’s check more common ones.
   - GOUL? – no.
   - JOUL? – no.
   - KOUL? – no.
   - QOUL? – no.
   - VOUL? – no.
   - WOUL? – no.
   - XOUL? – no.
   - YOUL? – no.
   - ZOUL? – no.

   The only reasonably common English word that fits _ O U L _ and uses allowed letters is “FOUL” (F, O, U, L, F). Even though F appears twice, it is still valid, and we have not ruled out F yet.

   Other candidates like “BOUL” or “GOUL” etc. are not valid words.

The feedback for Guess 5 says “Model answer is not five letters,” so FOUL is not considered a 5-letter word for this puzzle.  
Looking back at the pattern _ O U L _ and the letters still allowed (B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), the only common English word that fits is:

- B O U L ? – but no common 5-letter word starts with BOUL.
- F O U L ? – “FOUL” is not valid.
- G O U L ? – no.
- V O U L ? – no.

Wait—let’s re-examine the allowed letters and see if any other common word appears.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible 5-letter words:
- B O U L D – D is excluded.
- B O U L K – “BOULK” is not a word.
- F O U L S – S is excluded.
- G O U L D – D excluded.
- J O U L S – S excluded.
- K O U L S – S excluded.
- V O U L D – D excluded.
- W O U L D – D excluded.
- Y O U L D – D excluded.

But “BOUGH” is a valid 5-letter word: B, O, U, G, H.  
H is already excluded (H(x) in MOUTH), so BOUGH is invalid.

Next candidate: “BOULT” (a geological term) – but T is already locked at position 5, and BOULT ends with T, so it fits _ O U L T.  
However, we already have T locked at position 5 from POINT feedback, and COULD feedback confirmed L at position 4, so BOULT would be B O U L T – but T is already at position 5, so BOULT is invalid (would have T twice).

Wait—let’s list all possible letters remaining and see if any valid word appears:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible 5-letter words:
- B O U L ? – no common word.
- F O U L ? – only “FOUL” (invalid).
- G O U L ? – no.
- V O U L ? – no.

But “JOULE” is 5 letters: J, O, U, L, E.  
E is excluded (E(x) in AROSE), so JOULE is invalid.

“VOULT” – invalid.

“WOUL” – invalid.

“YOUN” – pattern _ O U N T, but N is excluded.

“BOULT” – as above, has double T.

“FOUL” – invalid.

“COUL” – invalid (C excluded).

“GOULT” – invalid.

“JOULT” – invalid.

“KOULT” – invalid.

“QOULT” – invalid.

“VOULT” – invalid.

“WOUL” – invalid.

“BOUL” – invalid.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Wait—POINT feedback said T(✓) at position 5, so T is definitely at position 5.  
MOUTH feedback showed T(-) at position 4, which is impossible if T is at position 5.  
Therefore the feedback for MOUTH must have been mis-recorded. The correct reading is:

MOUTH feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓) H(x)

So T is at position 4, but this contradicts POINT feedback that T is at position 5.  
This must have been a typo in recording; the correct feedback should be:

POINT feedback: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓) – meaning T is at position 5.

MOUTH feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x) – this is impossible because T is already confirmed at position 5.

This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback provided. However, proceeding as if the latest feedback (COULD/FOUL) supersedes or corrects earlier feedback:

From COULD/FOUL we now have:
- Position 4 = L (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 5 (✓ from POINT)

Thus the pattern is: _ O U L T

Valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern with allowed letters (B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z):

- BOULT – invalid (double T).
- BOUL? – no common word.
- FOUL? – invalid.
- GOUL? – invalid.
- JOUL? – invalid.
- KOULT – invalid.
- QOULT – invalid.
- VOULT – invalid.
- WOULT – invalid.
- YOULT – invalid.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Re-evaluating:

Wait—let’s list all possible 5-letter words matching _ O U L _ with allowed letters:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B O U L ? – none.
- F O U L ? – none.
- G O U L ? – none.
- V O U L ? – none.

But “BOUGH” is invalid (H excluded). 

Realization: The only valid common word fitting _ O U L _ with remaining letters is “BOULT,” but it has T twice. However, T is already confirmed at position 5, so a second T at position 4 is acceptable.

But “BOULT” is a valid geological term (variant spelling of “boul” or “boult”), and B, O, U, L, T have not been ruled out.

Thus the only remaining plausible guess is:

<guess>BOULT</guess>",BOULT,"The feedback for Guess 5 says “Model answer is not five letters,” so FOUL is not considered a 5-letter word for this puzzle.  
Looking back at the pattern _ O U L _ and the letters still allowed (B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), the only common English word that fits is:

- B O U L ? – but no common 5-letter word starts with BOUL.
- F O U L ? – “FOUL” is not valid.
- G O U L ? – no.
- V O U L ? – no.

Wait—let’s re-examine the allowed letters and see if any other common word appears.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible 5-letter words:
- B O U L D – D is excluded.
- B O U L K – “BOULK” is not a word.
- F O U L S – S is excluded.
- G O U L D – D excluded.
- J O U L S – S excluded.
- K O U L S – S excluded.
- V O U L D – D excluded.
- W O U L D – D excluded.
- Y O U L D – D excluded.

But “BOUGH” is a valid 5-letter word: B, O, U, G, H.  
H is already excluded (H(x) in MOUTH), so BOUGH is invalid.

Next candidate: “BOULT” (a geological term) – but T is already locked at position 5, and BOULT ends with T, so it fits _ O U L T.  
However, we already have T locked at position 5 from POINT feedback, and COULD feedback confirmed L at position 4, so BOULT would be B O U L T – but T is already at position 5, so BOULT is invalid (would have T twice).

Wait—let’s list all possible letters remaining and see if any valid word appears:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible 5-letter words:
- B O U L ? – no common word.
- F O U L ? – only “FOUL” (invalid).
- G O U L ? – no.
- V O U L ? – no.

But “JOULE” is 5 letters: J, O, U, L, E.  
E is excluded (E(x) in AROSE), so JOULE is invalid.

“VOULT” – invalid.

“WOUL” – invalid.

“YOUN” – pattern _ O U N T, but N is excluded.

“BOULT” – as above, has double T.

“FOUL” – invalid.

“COUL” – invalid (C excluded).

“GOULT” – invalid.

“JOULT” – invalid.

“KOULT” – invalid.

“QOULT” – invalid.

“VOULT” – invalid.

“WOUL” – invalid.

“BOUL” – invalid.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Wait—POINT feedback said T(✓) at position 5, so T is definitely at position 5.  
MOUTH feedback showed T(-) at position 4, which is impossible if T is at position 5.  
Therefore the feedback for MOUTH must have been mis-recorded. The correct reading is:

MOUTH feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓) H(x)

So T is at position 4, but this contradicts POINT feedback that T is at position 5.  
This must have been a typo in recording; the correct feedback should be:

POINT feedback: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓) – meaning T is at position 5.

MOUTH feedback: M(x) O(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x) – this is impossible because T is already confirmed at position 5.

This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback provided. However, proceeding as if the latest feedback (COULD/FOUL) supersedes or corrects earlier feedback:

From COULD/FOUL we now have:
- Position 4 = L (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 5 (✓ from POINT)

Thus the pattern is: _ O U L T

Valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern with allowed letters (B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z):

- BOULT – invalid (double T).
- BOUL? – no common word.
- FOUL? – invalid.
- GOUL? – invalid.
- JOUL? – invalid.
- KOULT – invalid.
- QOULT – invalid.
- VOULT – invalid.
- WOULT – invalid.
- YOULT – invalid.

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Re-evaluating:

Wait—let’s list all possible 5-letter words matching _ O U L _ with allowed letters:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B O U L ? – none.
- F O U L ? – none.
- G O U L ? – none.
- V O U L ? – none.

But “BOUGH” is invalid (H excluded). 

Realization: The only valid common word fitting _ O U L _ with remaining letters is “BOULT,” but it has T twice. However, T is already confirmed at position 5, so a second T at position 4 is acceptable.

But “BOULT” is a valid geological term (variant spelling of “boul” or “boult”), and B, O, U, L, T have not been ruled out.

Thus the only remaining plausible guess is:

<guess>BOULT</guess>",Guess 6: BOULT -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
