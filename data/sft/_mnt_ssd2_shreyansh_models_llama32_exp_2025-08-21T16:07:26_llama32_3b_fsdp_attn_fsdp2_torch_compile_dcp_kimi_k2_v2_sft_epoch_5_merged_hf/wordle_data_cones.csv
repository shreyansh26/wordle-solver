### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

- E is now in position 3 (originally position 5, so this tests a new position).

Another: “MENSE” – E in position 3, invalid.

Candidate: “DENSE” – same issue.

Candidate: “HONEY” – E in position 4, S in position 5 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed). Letters: H, O, N, E, Y – none of L,A,T,I,R. This seems valid.

Let’s try “HONEY”.

Check:
- H: new letter
- O: new vowel
- N: in word, not in position 5 (here position 3) – ok
- E: in position 4 – ok
- Y: new letter

This fits all constraints.

From the new feedback on HONEY:
- H is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in position 2.
- N is in the word and in position 3.
- E is in the word and in position 4.
- Y is not in the word.

So far we have:
Positions: 1   2   3   4   5
Letters:   ?   O   N   E   ?

Letters known to be in the word: S, O, N, E
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, I, R, H, Y

We still need a letter for position 1. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (cannot be L, T, R, H, Y). Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

We also know S must be in the word somewhere, but it cannot be in position 1 (from SLATE feedback), and positions 2,3,4 are taken by O,N,E. So S must be in position 5.

Thus the word structure is: ? O N E S

Looking for 5-letter words matching ?ONES:
- CONES: not a word.
- DONES: not a word.
- FONES: not a word.
- GONES: not a word.
- KONES: not a word.
- MONES: not a word.
- PONES: not a word.
- VONES: not a word.
- WONES: not a word.

Wait, let's check if ""ONES"" is the correct pattern. Actually, the structure is ? O N E S, so we need a letter for position 1 that makes a valid word ending in ONES.

Common words ending in ONES:
- CONES: no, C is not ruled out, but we have ? O N E S, so CONES would be C O N E S – let's check if this fits all constraints:
  - C: not ruled out.
  - O, N, E, S: all confirmed letters fit.
  - No disallowed letters (L,A,T,I,R,H,Y are absent).

""CONES"" is a valid word and fits perfectly.

Alternative: ""ONES"" – but that would require O in position 1, but we have O in position 2 confirmed. So ""ONES"" is invalid (O would be in position 1, but we know O is in position 2).

Thus, the only valid word fitting the pattern is ""CONES"".
