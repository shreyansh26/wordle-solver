For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be ""RADIO"":
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- A: confirmed in the word, trying position 2.
- D: common consonant, not ruled out.
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- O: common vowel, not ruled out.

This gives us a good spread of new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)
   – A is now fixed in position 2.
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. CANDY → C(x) A(✓) N(-) D(-) Y(x)
   – A still ✓ in position 2.
   – D is still in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (it was in position 4 here, so it’s not 4 either).
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – C and Y are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain D and N (but D ≠ 3,4 and N ≠ 3).
- Must NOT contain: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, C, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

Let’s place D in position 1 or 3 or 5 (but not 4), and N in position 1, 4 or 5.

Try placing D in position 1 and N in position 4: D A _ N _
We need a valid consonant for position 3 and 5. Common consonants left: B, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E at all.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be ""RADIO"":
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- A: confirmed in the word, trying position 2.
- D: common consonant, not ruled out.
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- O: common vowel, not ruled out.

This gives us a good spread of new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, I, O are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Contains D (not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain: S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

Remaining common letters to try: N, C, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, U, Y, etc.

We still need consonants and vowels. Since A is fixed in position 2 and we’ve ruled out I and O, the only other common vowel is U.

Let’s try a word that places D in a new spot and introduces other common consonants. A good candidate is “MADGY” but that’s not a valid word. “CANDY” is valid and uses:
- C: common consonant.
- A: confirmed in position 2.
- N: common consonant.
- D: confirmed in the word (not in position 3, try position 4).
- Y: common ending letter.

This tests C, N, Y while respecting the constraints and confirming A in position 2.

   – A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)  
   – A is now locked in position 2.  
   – D is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – R, I, O are **not** in the word.

3. CANDY → C(x) A(✓) N(-) D(-) Y(x)  
   – A still correct in position 2.  
   – N is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – D is in the word but **not** in position 4 (and already not in 3).  
   – C and Y are **not** in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain D and N (but D ≠ 3,4 and N ≠ 3).
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, C, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2.
- Places D somewhere other than 3 or 4 (so 1 or 5).
- Places N somewhere other than 3 (so 1, 4, or 5).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Trying D in position 1 and N in position 4: _ A _ N D  
Valid word candidate: B A N D Y → but Y is ruled out.  
Valid word candidate: M A N D A → but A already in position 2 and we don’t know if another A exists.  
Valid word candidate: H A N D Y → Y ruled out.  
Valid word candidate: P A N D A → A already in position 2, and D in 4 is allowed (only 3 and 4 ruled out for D so far).  
P A N D A is valid and tests P, N, D in new spots while keeping A fixed.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(-) I(x) O(x)  
   – A is locked in position 2.  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – R, I, O are NOT in the word.

3. CANDY → C(x) A(✓) N(-) D(-) Y(x)  
   – A still correct in position 2.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and already not in 3).  
   – C, Y are NOT in the word.

4. PANDA → P(x) A(✓) N(-) D(-) A(-)  
   – A correct in position 2 (already known).  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and already not in 3).  
   – A appears again in position 5; we don’t know if the word has two A’s yet.

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, R, I, O, C, Y, P

Letters confirmed in the word:  
A (fixed in position 2)  
D (somewhere other than 3 or 4)  
N (somewhere other than 3)

Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Fixed letter: A in 2  
D must be in 1 or 5  
N must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and cannot coincide with D)

Let’s try to place D in position 1 and N in position 4:  
D A _ N _  
The remaining letter in position 3 must be a new consonant not yet ruled out.  
Available consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

A common word that fits: D A M N _ → but we need a 5-letter word.  
D A M N U → not a word.  
D A M N A → two A’s; we don’t yet know if the word has two A’s, but it’s a valid word.  
D A M N Y → Y is ruled out.

D A M N G → not a word.  
D A M N H → not a word.  
D A M N B → not a word.  
D A M N M → not a word.

Let’s try D in position 5 and N in position 1:  
N A _ _ D  
The two missing letters (positions 3 and 4) must be new consonants.  
N A M B D → not a word.  
N A M M D → not a word.  
N A M U D → not a word.  
N A M G D → not a word.  
N A M H D → not a word.  
N A M B D → not a word.

Let’s try D in position 1 and N in position 4 again, but this time use a valid word:  
D A M N A → valid word (two A’s).  
Let’s check constraints:  
- D in 1: allowed.  
- A in 2: fixed.  
- M: new letter, not ruled out.  
- N in 4: allowed.  
- A in 5: allowed (we don’t know if the word has two A’s, but it’s a valid 5-letter word).
