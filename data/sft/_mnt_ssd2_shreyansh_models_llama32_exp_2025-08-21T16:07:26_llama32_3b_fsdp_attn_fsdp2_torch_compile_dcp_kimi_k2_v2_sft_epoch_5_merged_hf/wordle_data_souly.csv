### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another option is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

Letters that ARE in the word: S, O, U  
Exact positions already fixed:

- O is in position 2 (✓)

- SOULT (not a valid word)
- SOUPY (valid, but Y is uncommon)
- SOUGI (not a word)

The most common valid word fitting S O U _ _ is “SOULS”, but that would require S to appear twice, which is allowed but might be unlikely.  
Another common word is “SOUP?” – “SOUPY” is not a standard word.  
“SOUGH” is invalid.  
“SOULT” is invalid.  

The only clearly valid, common word left is “SOULS”.

Let’s check the letters against what we know:
- S, O, U are confirmed.
- L is still possible (not ruled out).
- S is allowed to appear again (no restriction yet on double letters).

Therefore, “SOULS” is a plausible next guess.

“SOULT” is invalid.  

The only clearly valid, common word left is “SOULS”.

Let’s check the letters against what we know:
- S, O, U are confirmed.
- L is still possible (not ruled out).
- S is allowed to appear again (no restriction yet on double letters).

Therefore, “SOULS” is a plausible next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another option is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E
- Letters definitely present: O, S
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O and S (so they stay in play).
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out (no A, R, E).

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are all still possible.
- O is in position 2 (safe; not position 3).
- S is missing, so this is no good.  I’ll revise.

Better candidate: “SPOIL”
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- P, I, L are still possible.
- O is in position 3 → already ruled out (O can’t be in position 3).

Revised candidate: “SOUND”
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- U, N, D are still possible.
- Doesn’t reuse any ruled-out letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, O, U  
Exact positions already fixed:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓)

So the word so far looks like: S O U _ _

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding A, R, E, N, D).  Common remaining consonants and vowels include: I, L, T, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that match the pattern “SOU__” gives:
- SOULS
- SOUP?
- SOUSE (but E is ruled out)
- SOUGH (not a valid word)
- SOULT (not a valid word)
- SOUPY (valid, but Y is uncommon)
- SOUGI (not a word)
- SOUMP (not a word)

The most common valid word fitting S O U _ _ is “SOULS”, but that would require S to appear twice, which is allowed but might be unlikely.  
Another common word is “SOUP?” – “SOUPY” is not a standard word.  
“SOUGH” is invalid.  
“SOULT” is invalid.  

The only clearly valid, common word left is “SOULS”.

Let’s check the letters against what we know:
- S, O, U are confirmed.
- L is still possible (not ruled out).
- S is allowed to appear again (no restriction yet on double letters).

Therefore, “SOULS” is a plausible next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another option is ""SLATE"", which also covers common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E
- Letters definitely present: O, S
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps O and S (so they stay in play).
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out (no A, R, E).

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, U, D are all still possible.
- O is in position 2 (safe; not position 3).
- S is missing, so this is no good.  I’ll revise.

Better candidate: “SPOIL”
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- P, I, L are still possible.
- O is in position 3 → already ruled out (O can’t be in position 3).

Revised candidate: “SOUND”
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- U, N, D are still possible.
- Doesn’t reuse any ruled-out letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, O, U  
Exact positions already fixed:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- U is in position 3 (✓)

So the word so far looks like: S O U _ _

We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding A, R, E, N, D).  Common remaining consonants and vowels include: I, L, T, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A quick scan of 5-letter words that match the pattern “SOU__” gives:
- SOULS
- SOUP?
- SOUSE (but E is ruled out)
- SOUGH (not a valid word)
- SOULT (not a valid word)
- SOUPY (valid, but Y is uncommon)
- SOUGI (not a word)
- SOUMP (not a word)

The most common valid word fitting S O U _ _ is “SOULS”, but that would require S to appear twice, which is allowed but might be unlikely.  
Another common word is “SOUP?” – “SOUPY” is not a standard word.  
“SOUGH” is invalid.  
“SOULT” is invalid.  

The only clearly valid, common word left is “SOULS”.

Let’s check the letters against what we know:
- S, O, U are confirmed.
- L is still possible (not ruled out).
- S is allowed to appear again (no restriction yet on double letters).

Therefore, “SOULS” is a plausible next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: SOULS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the three rounds we now have:

Fixed letters and positions:
1: S ✓  
2: O ✓  
3: U ✓  
4: L ✓  

So the word is S O U L _ .

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, N, D, S (since the second S came back as “-”, i.e., letter exists but is not in position 5).

We need a single letter for position 5 that:
- is not any of A, R, E, N, D, S  
- has not been used in any previous guess (so far only S, O, U, L have been used).

Remaining common consonants/vowels: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit S O U L _ :
- S O U L K  (K is still allowed)
- S O U L P  (P is still allowed)
- S O U L M  (M is still allowed)
- S O U L C  (C is still allowed)
- S O U L T  (T is still allowed)

Among these, “SoulK” is not a recognized English word, but “Soul” is a 4-letter word; we need the K.  
“SoulP”, “SoulM”, “SoulC”, “SoulT” are all valid.

I’ll choose “SoulP” next, since P is a common consonant and this is a common word.

<guess>SoulP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: SOULS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) S(-)
Guess 4: SoulP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) L(✓) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We now have four letters fixed:

Position 1: S ✓  
Position 2: O ✓  
Position 3: U ✓  
Position 4: L ✓  
Position 5: must be a letter NOT in {A, R, E, N, D, P} and not already used in any guess (S, O, U, L are already used).

Remaining legal letters for position 5: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter English words that start with “Soul” and end with one of these letters:
- SoulK  (K is legal)
- SoulC  (C is legal)
- SoulM  (M is legal)
- SoulT  (T is legal)
- SoulB  (B is legal)
- SoulF  (F is legal)
- SoulG  (G is legal)
- SoulH  (H is legal)
- SoulI  (I is legal)
- SoulV  (V is legal)
- SoulW  (W is legal)

Among these, “SoulK” is the only common English word.  It follows that the secret word must be “SoulK”.

Let me verify:  
S O U L K  
- S, O, U, L already confirmed in their exact spots.  
- K has not been used or ruled out.  
- No forbidden letters appear.

Therefore, the next (and likely final) guess is “SoulK”.
