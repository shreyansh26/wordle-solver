- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, P, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (fits the feedback).
- Uses H, I, R, K which are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids L, A, T, E as required.

Round 2 (SHIRK):

- K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, B, M, F, V, W, Y, P, etc.

I want a word that:
- Uses S (not in pos 1) and K (not in pos 5).
- Avoids all eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R.
- Prefers other common letters.

A good candidate is “SNOUT”:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except pos 1).
- K is not in this word, so I’ll still need to place K later, but this guess brings in new letters to test.
- N, O, U are all common and untested so far.

However, I must include K somewhere in the next guess because K is definitely in the word. Therefore, I’ll choose a word that places K in a new spot and tests additional common letters.

Let me try “SKUNK”:
- S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is NOT in position 1) – invalid.

Try “SNACK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Try “SOUND”:

But let me check if SPUNK is valid: yes, it’s a recognized 5-letter word.

But to maximize information, I’ll choose a word that tests more new common letters. A better choice is “SNOOK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid (feedback says S is not in position 1).

“SKUMP”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

“SKUNK” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SUKNY” – not a word.

“SOUND” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SNOWY” – uses N, O, W, Y, and S not in pos 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

Round 2 (SHIRK):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed).
- H, I, R are NOT in the word.
- K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, I, R.
- Letters known to be in the word: S (somewhere other than pos 1) and K (somewhere other than pos 5).

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, B, M, F, V, W, Y, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

I want a word that:
- Uses S (not in pos 1) and K (not in pos 5).
- Avoids all eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R.
- Prefers other common letters.

A good candidate is “SNOUT”:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except pos 1).
- K is not in this word, so I’ll still need to place K later, but this guess brings in new letters to test.
- N, O, U are all common and untested so far.

However, I must include K somewhere in the next guess because K is definitely in the word. Therefore, I’ll choose a word that places K in a new spot and tests additional common letters.

Let me try “SKUNK”:
- S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is NOT in position 1) – invalid.

Try “SNACK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Try “CLOUD”:
- No S or K – invalid.

Back to basics: I need a word that contains both S and K, avoids L,A,T,E,H,I,R, and places S>pos 1 and K>pos 5.

A valid word: “SPUNK”:
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- P, U, N, K are all new letters.
- K is in position 5 (allowed, since K can’t be in position 5, but feedback says K is in the word but wrong position in SHIRK, which was position 5, so K can be in positions 1-4. This guess puts K in position 4 – allowed).

But let me check if SPUNK is valid: yes, it’s a recognized 5-letter word.

But to maximize information, I’ll choose a word that tests more new common letters. A better choice is “SNOOK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid (feedback says S is not in position 1).

“SKUMP”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

“SKUNK” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SUKNY” – not a word.

“SOUND” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SNOWY” – uses N, O, W, Y, and S not in pos 1.

Wait, SNOWY has S in position 1 – invalid.

“NOVSK” – not a word.

Let me try “CLOSK” – invalid.

“KNOBS” – S in pos 5, K in pos 1 (allowed), and tests N, O, B.

Yes! KNOBS fits:
- K in position 1 (allowed, since K can be anywhere except pos 5).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except pos 1).
- N, O, B are new common letters.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Therefore, my next guess is KNOBS.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated):
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, N, B

Letters definitely IN the word:
- S – and it is in the correct position (position 5, as indicated by KNOBS’s final ✓).

- K – but it is NOT in position 1 (from KNOBS’s first “K(-)”).

- O – it is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from KNOBS’s third letter “O(-)”).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ S, and must contain K and O somewhere in positions 2–4 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out for K and O respectively).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet:
C, D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing both K and O, with K not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ K S  (O in 2, K in 4)
- _ K _ O S  (K in 2, O in 4)
- _ _ O K S  (O in 3 – but feedback says O is NOT in position 3, so skip)
- _ _ K O S  (K in 3, O in 4)

The most common words fitting these patterns are:
- CLOUD – but it doesn’t contain K.
- COUGH – ends in H (invalid).
- COMPS – ends in S, but K is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), C, M, P are new letters.

Wait, let’s list valid words:
- _ O _ K S: “FOOKS” – invalid.
- _ K _ O S: “MOKES” – invalid (E eliminated).
- _ _ K O S: “DUKOS” – invalid.
- _ _ O K S: invalid.

Try “COMPS”:
- Ends in S ✓
- Contains K and O ✓
- K is in position 3 (allowed) ✓
- O is in position 2 (allowed) ✓
- C, M, P are new letters.

But we already know S is fixed at position 5, so positions 1–4 must be arranged as _ O _ K S (or similar). Let’s instead pick a word that forces O into position 2 and K into position 4, e.g., “M O K _ S” – but we need a valid word.

The valid word “MOCKS” fits:
- M, C, K, O, S
- K is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- Ends with S ✓
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Let me verify:
- M, O, C, K, S – none of L,A,T,E,H,I,R,N,B appear.
- S is correctly placed at 5.
- K and O are present and in allowed positions.

Therefore, “MOCKS” is a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, P, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (fits the feedback).
- Uses H, I, R, K which are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids L, A, T, E as required.

Yes! KNOBS fits:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S appears somewhere else).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not as the first letter).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, P, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""SHIRK"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (fits the feedback).
- Uses H, I, R, K which are all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids L, A, T, E as required.

<guess>SHIRK</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

Round 2 (SHIRK):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed).
- H, I, R are NOT in the word.
- K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, I, R.
- Letters known to be in the word: S (somewhere other than pos 1) and K (somewhere other than pos 5).

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, G, B, M, F, V, W, Y, P, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

I want a word that:
- Uses S (not in pos 1) and K (not in pos 5).
- Avoids all eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, H, I, R.
- Prefers other common letters.

A good candidate is “SNOUT”:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except pos 1).
- K is not in this word, so I’ll still need to place K later, but this guess brings in new letters to test.
- N, O, U are all common and untested so far.

However, I must include K somewhere in the next guess because K is definitely in the word. Therefore, I’ll choose a word that places K in a new spot and tests additional common letters.

Let me try “SKUNK”:
- S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is NOT in position 1) – invalid.

Try “SNACK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

Try “CLOUD”:
- No S or K – invalid.

Back to basics: I need a word that contains both S and K, avoids L,A,T,E,H,I,R, and places S>pos 1 and K>pos 5.

A valid word: “SPUNK”:
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- P, U, N, K are all new letters.
- K is in position 5 (allowed, since K can’t be in position 5, but feedback says K is in the word but wrong position in SHIRK, which was position 5, so K can be in positions 1-4. This guess puts K in position 4 – allowed).

But let me check if SPUNK is valid: yes, it’s a recognized 5-letter word.

But to maximize information, I’ll choose a word that tests more new common letters. A better choice is “SNOOK”:
- S in position 1 – invalid (feedback says S is not in position 1).

“SKUMP”:
- S in position 1 – invalid.

“SKUNK” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SUKNY” – not a word.

“SOUND” – invalid (S in pos 1).

“SNOWY” – uses N, O, W, Y, and S not in pos 1.

Wait, SNOWY has S in position 1 – invalid.

“NOVSK” – not a word.

Let me try “CLOSK” – invalid.

“KNOBS” – S in pos 5, K in pos 1 (allowed), and tests N, O, B.

Yes! KNOBS fits:
- K in position 1 (allowed, since K can be anywhere except pos 5).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S can be anywhere except pos 1).
- N, O, B are new common letters.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Therefore, my next guess is KNOBS.

<guess>KNOBS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) I(x) R(x) K(-)
Guess 3: KNOBS -> FEEDBACK: K(-) N(x) O(-) B(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated):
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, N, B

Letters definitely IN the word:
- S – and it is in the correct position (position 5, as indicated by KNOBS’s final ✓).

- K – but it is NOT in position 1 (from KNOBS’s first “K(-)”).

- O – it is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from KNOBS’s third letter “O(-)”).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ S, and must contain K and O somewhere in positions 2–4 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out for K and O respectively).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet:
C, D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing both K and O, with K not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ K S  (O in 2, K in 4)
- _ K _ O S  (K in 2, O in 4)
- _ _ O K S  (O in 3 – but feedback says O is NOT in position 3, so skip)
- _ _ K O S  (K in 3, O in 4)

The most common words fitting these patterns are:
- CLOUD – but it doesn’t contain K.
- COUGH – ends in H (invalid).
- COMPS – ends in S, but K is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), C, M, P are new letters.

Wait, let’s list valid words:
- _ O _ K S: “FOOKS” – invalid.
- _ K _ O S: “MOKES” – invalid (E eliminated).
- _ _ K O S: “DUKOS” – invalid.
- _ _ O K S: invalid.

Try “COMPS”:
- Ends in S ✓
- Contains K and O ✓
- K is in position 3 (allowed) ✓
- O is in position 2 (allowed) ✓
- C, M, P are new letters.

But we already know S is fixed at position 5, so positions 1–4 must be arranged as _ O _ K S (or similar). Let’s instead pick a word that forces O into position 2 and K into position 4, e.g., “M O K _ S” – but we need a valid word.

The valid word “MOCKS” fits:
- M, C, K, O, S
- K is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- Ends with S ✓
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Let me verify:
- M, O, C, K, S – none of L,A,T,E,H,I,R,N,B appear.
- S is correctly placed at 5.
- K and O are present and in allowed positions.

Therefore, “MOCKS” is a solid next guess.

- M is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2, ✓).
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- K is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4, ✓).
- S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5, ✓).

So the secret word pattern is now: _ O _ K S

Letters known NOT in the word so far:
L, A, T, E, H, I, R, N, B, M, C

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3. Available letters (common ones):
D, F, G, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ O _ K S.

Possible candidates:
- D O U K S → “DOUKS” – not a recognized word.
- F O U K S → “FOUKS” – not a word.
- G O U K S → “GOUKS” – not a word.
- P O U K S → “POUKS” – not a word.
- F O G K S → “FOGKS” – not a word.
- F O V K S → “FOVKS” – not a word.
- D O G K S → “DOGKS” – not a word.
- D O U K S – still not a word.

Real words ending in O_K_S:
- “WOKES” – invalid (E eliminated).
- “JOKES” – invalid (E eliminated).
- “COKES” – C and E eliminated.
- “LOKES” – L eliminated.
- “SOKES” – S already used at position 5.
- “TOKES” – T eliminated.

Looking at the pattern _ O _ K S, the only common English word is “FOOKS” (but that’s not valid). Actually, “DOOKS” is invalid. 

Wait, let me list valid English words ending in O_K_S:
- “DOOKS” – no.
- “FOOKS” – no.
- “GOOKS” – no.
- “JOKES” – E eliminated.
- “LOOKS” – L eliminated.
- “OOKS” – no.
- “POOKS” – no.
- “TOOKS” – T eliminated.

Realizing something: the only valid word fitting _ O _ K S with remaining letters is “DOOKS” but that’s not a word. This suggests I might have missed letters. Let me re-examine available letters.

Re-checking available letters:
From remaining alphabet (excluding eliminated ones): D, F, G, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid words:
- “D O U K S” – invalid.
- “F O U K S” – invalid.
- “G O U K S” – invalid.
- “P O U K S” – invalid.

Wait, actually, there’s a valid word: “POOKS” – but P is available, O is in position 2, K in 4, S in 5. “POOKS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify:
- P, O, O, K, S – but O is already in position 2, so the second O in position 3 is allowed (no feedback against it).
- P is available (not eliminated).
- K is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).

Thus, the correct word is “POOKS”.

But note: the feedback for O in KNOBS was “O(-)” (in word but wrong position), and in MOCKS O was in position 2 (✓), so position 3 O is allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is “POOKS”.
