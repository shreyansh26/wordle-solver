For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would be strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (common consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, S).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word (x).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, U, N, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- U cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, U, N, T
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, I
- Places E, U, N, T in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters while respecting the position constraints:
- E can’t be last, so it could be 1-4
- U can’t be first, so it could be 2-5
- N can’t be second, so it could be 1,3,4,5
- T can’t be third, so it could be 1,2,4,5

A word that uses all four known letters while respecting these constraints is “UNTIE” but I is excluded. Next option: “NUTE” is only 4 letters. “TUNER” uses R which is excluded. “CUTE” is 4 letters. “BUNTE” is not a valid word. “MUTED” is valid and contains:
- M (new letter, but we need to test other letters too)
- U (in position 2, allowed)
- N (in position 3, allowed – n cannot be 2, but 3 is ok)
- T (in position 4, allowed – t cannot be 3, 4 is ok)
- E (in position 5, but E cannot be 5 – so this fails)

Next: “TENU” is invalid. “UTEN” is 4 letters. “TUNED” is 5 letters and valid:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 4 is ok)
- D is new, but we need to test other letters too.

But we need to test more letters. Let’s try “CUTEN” – but C is new, and positions:
- C (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (but T cannot be 3 – so invalid)

“GUTEN” – G is new, positions:
- G (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (invalid – same issue)

“PENUT” – P is new, positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 2 is ok)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- U in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed – T has no restriction on 5)

This seems valid and tests a new letter P.

Alternatively, “TUNED” is also valid, but “PENUT” tests more new consonants (P and N again).

Let’s go with “PENUT”.

Check constraints:
- Contains E, U, N, T (required)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed – n can’t be 2, but 3 is ok)
- U is in position 4 (allowed – can’t be 1, so 2-5 ok)
- T is in position 5 (allowed – no restriction on 5)
- No A, R, O, S, I
- All letters are unique so far (P, E, N, U, T – only 4 known letters, so we need one more letter. Actually we have 4 known letters: E, U, N, T and we need one more letter. The word must have 5 letters total, so we need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.)

Wait, “PENUT” is 5 letters: P-E-N-U-T. This contains E, U, N, T and tests P. But we already have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T), so the word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter. The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.

Actually, the word must contain E, U, N, T and one other letter. The 5-letter word containing E, U, N, T and one more letter (not A, R, O, S, I).

Possible words:
- E, U, N, T, plus one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting this is “CUTEN” (but T is in 3, which is invalid). Next: “TUNED” (T-U-N-E-D), but E is in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), D is new. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “TUNED”.

Check:
- T (1) – no restriction
- U (2) – no restriction
- N (3) – no restriction
- E (4) – allowed (E can’t be 5)
- D (5) – new letter, no restriction on 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would be strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (common consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, S).

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word (x).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, U, N, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- U cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, U, N, T
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, I
- Places E, U, N, T in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters while respecting the position constraints:
- E can’t be last, so it could be 1-4
- U can’t be first, so it could be 2-5
- N can’t be second, so it could be 1,3,4,5
- T can’t be third, so it could be 1,2,4,5

A word that uses all four known letters while respecting these constraints is “UNTIE” but I is excluded. Next option: “NUTE” is only 4 letters. “TUNER” uses R which is excluded. “CUTE” is 4 letters. “BUNTE” is not a valid word. “MUTED” is valid and contains:
- M (new letter, but we need to test other letters too)
- U (in position 2, allowed)
- N (in position 3, allowed – n cannot be 2, but 3 is ok)
- T (in position 4, allowed – t cannot be 3, 4 is ok)
- E (in position 5, but E cannot be 5 – so this fails)

Next: “TENU” is invalid. “UTEN” is 4 letters. “TUNED” is 5 letters and valid:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 4 is ok)
- D is new, but we need to test other letters too.

But we need to test more letters. Let’s try “CUTEN” – but C is new, and positions:
- C (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (but T cannot be 3 – so invalid)

“GUTEN” – G is new, positions:
- G (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (invalid – same issue)

“PENUT” – P is new, positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 2 is ok)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- U in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed – T has no restriction on 5)

This seems valid and tests a new letter P.

Alternatively, “TUNED” is also valid, but “PENUT” tests more new consonants (P and N again).

Let’s go with “PENUT”.

Check constraints:
- Contains E, U, N, T (required)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed – n can’t be 2, but 3 is ok)
- U is in position 4 (allowed – can’t be 1, so 2-5 ok)
- T is in position 5 (allowed – no restriction on 5)
- No A, R, O, S, I
- All letters are unique so far (P, E, N, U, T – only 4 known letters, so we need one more letter. Actually we have 4 known letters: E, U, N, T and we need one more letter. The word must have 5 letters total, so we need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.)

Wait, “PENUT” is 5 letters: P-E-N-U-T. This contains E, U, N, T and tests P. But we already have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T), so the word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter. The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.

Actually, the word must contain E, U, N, T and one other letter. The 5-letter word containing E, U, N, T and one more letter (not A, R, O, S, I).

Possible words:
- E, U, N, T, plus one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting this is “CUTEN” (but T is in 3, which is invalid). Next: “TUNED” (T-U-N-E-D), but E is in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), D is new. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “TUNED”.

Check:
- T (1) – no restriction
- U (2) – no restriction
- N (3) – no restriction
- E (4) – allowed (E can’t be 5)
- D (5) – new letter, no restriction on 5

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on TUNED:

- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3

So far we know the word looks like: _ U N E _

Letters known to be in the word: E, U, N, T
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, I, D

We still need one more letter for position 1. The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding the excluded letters. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? U N E ? where ? is a valid letter not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- BUNNE – invalid (double N)
- CUTE – C is allowed, but T is in position 5 (allowed), but we already have T in 4 (E), so T can appear again? The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we have no info on duplicates yet. CUTE is a valid word.
- FUNK – F is allowed, but K is allowed, but this doesn’t use T or N or E. Wait, we need _ U N E _.
- GUNES – G is allowed, but S is excluded.
- HUNKE – not a word.
- JUNK – J is allowed, but J is rare.
- LUNGE – L is allowed, G is allowed, but this is 5 letters: L U N G E – yes, LUNGE is valid.
- MUNGE – M is allowed, G is allowed.
- PUNK – P is allowed, K is allowed.
- YUNGE – Y is allowed, G is allowed.

Among these, LUNGE is a common word and fits the pattern _ U N E _ with L in position 1.

But wait, we have position 5 to fill. Actually the pattern is (1) _ U N E _ (position 2) so positions are:
1: ?
2: U
3: N
4: E
5: ?

So the word is: ? U N E ?

We need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded. The most common letter to follow is T, but T is in position 4 (E), so T can’t be in 5 (no restriction). But we need to decide whether T appears once or twice.

Other common letters left: C, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try C U N E D – but D is excluded. Next: C U N E T – CUNET is not a word. C U N E R – R is excluded. C U N E S – S is excluded.

Next: M U N E D – D excluded. M U N E T – MUNET is not a word.

H U N E D – D excluded.

Y U N E D – D excluded.

K U N E D – D excluded.

M U N E D – D excluded.

C U N E D – D excluded.

Wait, we need to check the remaining letters carefully. The word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N in positions 2,3,4 respectively, and one more letter in positions 1 and 5.

Let me list possible 5-letter words matching ? U N E ?:

Let me verify:
- L is allowed (not in excluded list)
- U in 2 (✓)
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 4 (✓)
- G in 5 (allowed)

This seems correct.

But wait, we have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T) and we need one more letter. In LUNGE, L is new, G is new, and we have 4 letters already. But the word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N, T, and one more letter. The word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter.

But LUNGE is 5 letters: L-U-N-G-E. This contains:

- U (position 2, correct)
- N (position 3, correct)

- G (new letter)

This fits the constraints perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would be strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (common consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, S).

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word (x).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, U, N, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- U cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, U, N, T
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, I
- Places E, U, N, T in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters while respecting the position constraints:
- E can’t be last, so it could be 1-4
- U can’t be first, so it could be 2-5
- N can’t be second, so it could be 1,3,4,5
- T can’t be third, so it could be 1,2,4,5

A word that uses all four known letters while respecting these constraints is “UNTIE” but I is excluded. Next option: “NUTE” is only 4 letters. “TUNER” uses R which is excluded. “CUTE” is 4 letters. “BUNTE” is not a valid word. “MUTED” is valid and contains:
- M (new letter, but we need to test other letters too)
- U (in position 2, allowed)
- N (in position 3, allowed – n cannot be 2, but 3 is ok)
- T (in position 4, allowed – t cannot be 3, 4 is ok)
- E (in position 5, but E cannot be 5 – so this fails)

Next: “TENU” is invalid. “UTEN” is 4 letters. “TUNED” is 5 letters and valid:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 4 is ok)
- D is new, but we need to test other letters too.

But we need to test more letters. Let’s try “CUTEN” – but C is new, and positions:
- C (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (but T cannot be 3 – so invalid)

“GUTEN” – G is new, positions:
- G (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (invalid – same issue)

“PENUT” – P is new, positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 2 is ok)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- U in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed – T has no restriction on 5)

This seems valid and tests a new letter P.

Alternatively, “TUNED” is also valid, but “PENUT” tests more new consonants (P and N again).

Let’s go with “PENUT”.

Check constraints:
- Contains E, U, N, T (required)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed – n can’t be 2, but 3 is ok)
- U is in position 4 (allowed – can’t be 1, so 2-5 ok)
- T is in position 5 (allowed – no restriction on 5)
- No A, R, O, S, I
- All letters are unique so far (P, E, N, U, T – only 4 known letters, so we need one more letter. Actually we have 4 known letters: E, U, N, T and we need one more letter. The word must have 5 letters total, so we need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.)

Wait, “PENUT” is 5 letters: P-E-N-U-T. This contains E, U, N, T and tests P. But we already have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T), so the word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter. The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.

Actually, the word must contain E, U, N, T and one other letter. The 5-letter word containing E, U, N, T and one more letter (not A, R, O, S, I).

Possible words:
- E, U, N, T, plus one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting this is “CUTEN” (but T is in 3, which is invalid). Next: “TUNED” (T-U-N-E-D), but E is in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), D is new. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “TUNED”.

Check:
- T (1) – no restriction
- U (2) – no restriction
- N (3) – no restriction
- E (4) – allowed (E can’t be 5)
- D (5) – new letter, no restriction on 5

This seems valid.

<guess>TUNED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: TUNED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on TUNED:
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- U is in position 2 (✓) – so U is fixed at position 2
- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3
- E is in position 4 (✓) – so E is fixed at position 4
- D is not in the word (x)

So far we know the word looks like: _ U N E _

Letters known to be in the word: E, U, N, T
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, I, D

We still need one more letter for position 1. The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding the excluded letters. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? U N E ? where ? is a valid letter not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- BUNNE – invalid (double N)
- CUTE – C is allowed, but T is in position 5 (allowed), but we already have T in 4 (E), so T can appear again? The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we have no info on duplicates yet. CUTE is a valid word.
- FUNK – F is allowed, but K is allowed, but this doesn’t use T or N or E. Wait, we need _ U N E _.
- GUNES – G is allowed, but S is excluded.
- HUNKE – not a word.
- JUNK – J is allowed, but J is rare.
- LUNGE – L is allowed, G is allowed, but this is 5 letters: L U N G E – yes, LUNGE is valid.
- MUNGE – M is allowed, G is allowed.
- PUNK – P is allowed, K is allowed.
- YUNGE – Y is allowed, G is allowed.

Among these, LUNGE is a common word and fits the pattern _ U N E _ with L in position 1.

But wait, we have position 5 to fill. Actually the pattern is (1) _ U N E _ (position 2) so positions are:
1: ?
2: U
3: N
4: E
5: ?

So the word is: ? U N E ?

We need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded. The most common letter to follow is T, but T is in position 4 (E), so T can’t be in 5 (no restriction). But we need to decide whether T appears once or twice.

Other common letters left: C, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try C U N E D – but D is excluded. Next: C U N E T – CUNET is not a word. C U N E R – R is excluded. C U N E S – S is excluded.

Next: M U N E D – D excluded. M U N E T – MUNET is not a word.

F U N E D – D excluded.

P U N E D – D excluded.

L U N E D – D excluded.

G U N E D – D excluded.

H U N E D – D excluded.

Y U N E D – D excluded.

K U N E D – D excluded.

M U N E D – D excluded.

C U N E D – D excluded.

Wait, we need to check the remaining letters carefully. The word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N in positions 2,3,4 respectively, and one more letter in positions 1 and 5.

Let me list possible 5-letter words matching ? U N E ?:
- B U N E T – not a word.
- C U N E T – not a word.
- F U N E T – not a word.
- G U N E T – not a word.
- H U N E T – not a word.
- J U N E T – not a word.
- L U N G E – LUNGE (valid word).
- M U N G E – MUNG E – not 5 letters.
- P U N G E – PUNG E – not 5 letters.
- Y U N G E – YUNGE – not a word.
- C U N E L – not a word.
- B U N E L – not a word.
- G U N E L – not a word.

The only valid common word is LUNGE.

Let me verify:
- L is allowed (not in excluded list)
- U in 2 (✓)
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 4 (✓)
- G in 5 (allowed)

This seems correct.

But wait, we have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T) and we need one more letter. In LUNGE, L is new, G is new, and we have 4 letters already. But the word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N, T, and one more letter. The word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter.

But LUNGE is 5 letters: L-U-N-G-E. This contains:
- L (new letter)
- U (position 2, correct)
- N (position 3, correct)
- E (position 4, correct)
- G (new letter)

This fits the constraints perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNGE.

- N is in position 3 (✓) – already known.
- G is not in the word (x) – so G is out.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-) – already known from round-1.

So the word is now fully determined except for position 5, and we know it must be:
L U N E ?

We have used the letters L, U, N, E. We just need one more letter for position 5 that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Letters already excluded: A, R, O, S, I, D, G
Letters already confirmed: L, U, N, E
Letters not yet tested: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting L U N E _ is LUNES, but S is excluded. LUNE_ – LUNE is a prefix, but LUNED is a word (past tense of lune, a crescent-shaped mark), but D is excluded.

Actually, the valid words starting with LUNE are:
- LUNE (as in lune-shaped mark)
- LUNGE (already tried, G excluded)
- LUNES (S excluded)
- LUNED (D excluded)

Looking at remaining letters, the only common 5-letter word starting with LUNE is LUNE itself (as in lune-shaped mark). The other possibilities like LUNET, LUNEY, etc. are not valid.

But wait, we need to check if LUNE is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""lune"" is valid (as in lunette, a small crescent-shaped mark on a coin or the moon).

But let me verify if there are other possibilities:
- LUNET – not a word.
- LUNEY – not a word.
- LUNKE – not a word.
- LUNME – not a word.
- LUNPE – not a word.
- LUNT – 4 letters.

Thus, the only valid 5-letter word is LUNE.

But we have position 5 to fill, and we have L-U-N-E. The fifth letter must be new and fit. Actually, the word must be L-U-N-E plus one more letter. The only valid word is LUNES, but S is excluded. This suggests LUNE is the only possible word.

Let me double-check:
- L U N E + ?
- No other common 5-letter words fit. This implies LUNE is the intended word.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNE.

But wait, we have position 5 to fill, and the word must be 5 letters total. The feedback on TUNED (Guess 3) established that E, U, N, T are in the word, and on LUNGE (Guess 4) we established L is in position 1, U in 2, N in 3, E in 4, and G is not in the word. Thus, the word is L-U-N-E plus one more letter. The only valid word is LUNES, but S is excluded. This implies the word must be LUNE.

Thus, the next guess is LUNE.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters that might be in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is already found).

A word like ""UNTIE"" would be strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (common consonants).
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, S).

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is not in the word (x).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (confirms round-1).

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I
- Letters definitely IN the word: E, U, N, T
- E cannot be in position 5
- U cannot be in position 1
- N cannot be in position 2
- T cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, U, N, T
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, I
- Places E, U, N, T in allowed positions

Looking at remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters while respecting the position constraints:
- E can’t be last, so it could be 1-4
- U can’t be first, so it could be 2-5
- N can’t be second, so it could be 1,3,4,5
- T can’t be third, so it could be 1,2,4,5

A word that uses all four known letters while respecting these constraints is “UNTIE” but I is excluded. Next option: “NUTE” is only 4 letters. “TUNER” uses R which is excluded. “CUTE” is 4 letters. “BUNTE” is not a valid word. “MUTED” is valid and contains:
- M (new letter, but we need to test other letters too)
- U (in position 2, allowed)
- N (in position 3, allowed – n cannot be 2, but 3 is ok)
- T (in position 4, allowed – t cannot be 3, 4 is ok)
- E (in position 5, but E cannot be 5 – so this fails)

Next: “TENU” is invalid. “UTEN” is 4 letters. “TUNED” is 5 letters and valid:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 4 is ok)
- D is new, but we need to test other letters too.

But we need to test more letters. Let’s try “CUTEN” – but C is new, and positions:
- C (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (but T cannot be 3 – so invalid)

“GUTEN” – G is new, positions:
- G (new)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- T in 3 (invalid – same issue)

“PENUT” – P is new, positions:
- P (new)
- E in 2 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 2 is ok)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- U in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed – T has no restriction on 5)

This seems valid and tests a new letter P.

Alternatively, “TUNED” is also valid, but “PENUT” tests more new consonants (P and N again).

Let’s go with “PENUT”.

Check constraints:
- Contains E, U, N, T (required)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed – n can’t be 2, but 3 is ok)
- U is in position 4 (allowed – can’t be 1, so 2-5 ok)
- T is in position 5 (allowed – no restriction on 5)
- No A, R, O, S, I
- All letters are unique so far (P, E, N, U, T – only 4 known letters, so we need one more letter. Actually we have 4 known letters: E, U, N, T and we need one more letter. The word must have 5 letters total, so we need one more consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.)

Wait, “PENUT” is 5 letters: P-E-N-U-T. This contains E, U, N, T and tests P. But we already have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T), so the word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter. The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.

Actually, the word must contain E, U, N, T and one other letter. The 5-letter word containing E, U, N, T and one more letter (not A, R, O, S, I).

Possible words:
- E, U, N, T, plus one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting this is “CUTEN” (but T is in 3, which is invalid). Next: “TUNED” (T-U-N-E-D), but E is in 4 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), D is new. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “TUNED”.

Check:
- T (1) – no restriction
- U (2) – no restriction
- N (3) – no restriction
- E (4) – allowed (E can’t be 5)
- D (5) – new letter, no restriction on 5

This seems valid.

<guess>TUNED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: TUNED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on TUNED:
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- U is in position 2 (✓) – so U is fixed at position 2
- N is in position 3 (✓) – so N is fixed at position 3
- E is in position 4 (✓) – so E is fixed at position 4
- D is not in the word (x)

So far we know the word looks like: _ U N E _

Letters known to be in the word: E, U, N, T
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, I, D

We still need one more letter for position 1. The remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet excluding the excluded letters. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? U N E ? where ? is a valid letter not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- BUNNE – invalid (double N)
- CUTE – C is allowed, but T is in position 5 (allowed), but we already have T in 4 (E), so T can appear again? The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we have no info on duplicates yet. CUTE is a valid word.
- FUNK – F is allowed, but K is allowed, but this doesn’t use T or N or E. Wait, we need _ U N E _.
- GUNES – G is allowed, but S is excluded.
- HUNKE – not a word.
- JUNK – J is allowed, but J is rare.
- LUNGE – L is allowed, G is allowed, but this is 5 letters: L U N G E – yes, LUNGE is valid.
- MUNGE – M is allowed, G is allowed.
- PUNK – P is allowed, K is allowed.
- YUNGE – Y is allowed, G is allowed.

Among these, LUNGE is a common word and fits the pattern _ U N E _ with L in position 1.

But wait, we have position 5 to fill. Actually the pattern is (1) _ U N E _ (position 2) so positions are:
1: ?
2: U
3: N
4: E
5: ?

So the word is: ? U N E ?

We need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded. The most common letter to follow is T, but T is in position 4 (E), so T can’t be in 5 (no restriction). But we need to decide whether T appears once or twice.

Other common letters left: C, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try C U N E D – but D is excluded. Next: C U N E T – CUNET is not a word. C U N E R – R is excluded. C U N E S – S is excluded.

Next: M U N E D – D excluded. M U N E T – MUNET is not a word.

F U N E D – D excluded.

P U N E D – D excluded.

L U N E D – D excluded.

G U N E D – D excluded.

H U N E D – D excluded.

Y U N E D – D excluded.

K U N E D – D excluded.

M U N E D – D excluded.

C U N E D – D excluded.

Wait, we need to check the remaining letters carefully. The word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N in positions 2,3,4 respectively, and one more letter in positions 1 and 5.

Let me list possible 5-letter words matching ? U N E ?:
- B U N E T – not a word.
- C U N E T – not a word.
- F U N E T – not a word.
- G U N E T – not a word.
- H U N E T – not a word.
- J U N E T – not a word.
- L U N G E – LUNGE (valid word).
- M U N G E – MUNG E – not 5 letters.
- P U N G E – PUNG E – not 5 letters.
- Y U N G E – YUNGE – not a word.
- C U N E L – not a word.
- B U N E L – not a word.
- G U N E L – not a word.

The only valid common word is LUNGE.

Let me verify:
- L is allowed (not in excluded list)
- U in 2 (✓)
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 4 (✓)
- G in 5 (allowed)

This seems correct.

But wait, we have 4 known letters (E, U, N, T) and we need one more letter. In LUNGE, L is new, G is new, and we have 4 letters already. But the word must be 5 letters total, with E, U, N, T, and one more letter. The word must be a permutation of E, U, N, T + one new letter.

But LUNGE is 5 letters: L-U-N-G-E. This contains:
- L (new letter)
- U (position 2, correct)
- N (position 3, correct)
- E (position 4, correct)
- G (new letter)

This fits the constraints perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNGE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: TUNED -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: LUNGE -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) U(✓) N(✓) G(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LUNGE:
- L is in position 1 (✓) – so L is fixed at position 1.
- U is in position 2 (✓) – already known.
- N is in position 3 (✓) – already known.
- G is not in the word (x) – so G is out.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-) – already known from round-1.

So the word is now fully determined except for position 5, and we know it must be:
L U N E ?

We have used the letters L, U, N, E. We just need one more letter for position 5 that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Letters already excluded: A, R, O, S, I, D, G
Letters already confirmed: L, U, N, E
Letters not yet tested: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

The word must be 5 letters total, so we need one more letter. The most common 5-letter word fitting L U N E _ is LUNES, but S is excluded. LUNE_ – LUNE is a prefix, but LUNED is a word (past tense of lune, a crescent-shaped mark), but D is excluded.

Actually, the valid words starting with LUNE are:
- LUNE (as in lune-shaped mark)
- LUNGE (already tried, G excluded)
- LUNES (S excluded)
- LUNED (D excluded)

Looking at remaining letters, the only common 5-letter word starting with LUNE is LUNE itself (as in lune-shaped mark). The other possibilities like LUNET, LUNEY, etc. are not valid.

But wait, we need to check if LUNE is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""lune"" is valid (as in lunette, a small crescent-shaped mark on a coin or the moon).

But let me verify if there are other possibilities:
- LUNET – not a word.
- LUNEY – not a word.
- LUNKE – not a word.
- LUNME – not a word.
- LUNPE – not a word.
- LUNT – 4 letters.
- LUNGE – already tried (G excluded).

Thus, the only valid 5-letter word is LUNE.

But we have position 5 to fill, and we have L-U-N-E. The fifth letter must be new and fit. Actually, the word must be L-U-N-E plus one more letter. The only valid word is LUNES, but S is excluded. This suggests LUNE is the only possible word.

Let me double-check:
- L U N E + ?
- No other common 5-letter words fit. This implies LUNE is the intended word.

Therefore, the next guess is LUNE.

But wait, we have position 5 to fill, and the word must be 5 letters total. The feedback on TUNED (Guess 3) established that E, U, N, T are in the word, and on LUNGE (Guess 4) we established L is in position 1, U in 2, N in 3, E in 4, and G is not in the word. Thus, the word is L-U-N-E plus one more letter. The only valid word is LUNES, but S is excluded. This implies the word must be LUNE.

Next option: “NUTE” is only 4 letters. “TUNER” uses R which is excluded. “CUTE” is 4 letters. “BUNTE” is not a valid word. “MUTED” is valid and contains:\n- M (new letter, but we need to test other letters too)\n- U (in position 2, allowed)\n- N (in position 3, allowed – n cannot be 2, but 3 is ok)\n- T (in position 4, allowed – t cannot be 3, 4 is ok)\n- E (in position 5, but E cannot be 5 – so this fails)\n\nNext: “TENU” is invalid. “UTEN” is 4 letters. “TUNED” is 5 letters and valid:\n- T in 1 (allowed)\n- U in 2 (allowed)\n- N in 3 (allowed)\n- E in 4 (allowed – E can’t be 5, so 4 is ok)\n- D is new, but we need to test other letters too.\n\nBut we need to test more letters.
