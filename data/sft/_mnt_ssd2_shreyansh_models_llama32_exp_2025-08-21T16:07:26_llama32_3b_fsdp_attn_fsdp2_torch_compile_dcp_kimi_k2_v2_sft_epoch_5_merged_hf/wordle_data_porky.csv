For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with many vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words
This should give good initial information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O, but not A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while placing R and O in new positions. Good letters to test now are T, I, N, L, U, etc. I’ll try a word that keeps R and O but moves them to new spots and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F is a common consonant not yet tested.
- R moves to position 2 (previously position 2 had R, but now it's in a new position).
- O moves to position 3 (previously position 3 had O, but now it's in a new position).
- N and T are common consonants introduced by the word.

However, this might not be optimal since R and O are in positions they were in before. Instead, let's try a word that shifts R and O to new positions and uses new letters.

Better candidate: ""ROUND"":
- R is now in position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was in position 3 before).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new common consonants.

This seems better as it shifts both R and O to new positions and introduces new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with many vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words
This should give good initial information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O, but not A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while placing R and O in new positions. Good letters to test now are T, I, N, L, U, etc. I’ll try a word that keeps R and O but moves them to new spots and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F is a common consonant not yet tested.
- R moves to position 2 (previously position 2 had R, but now it's in a new position).
- O moves to position 3 (previously position 3 had O, but now it's in a new position).
- N and T are common consonants introduced by the word.

However, this might not be optimal since R and O are in positions they were in before. Instead, let's try a word that shifts R and O to new positions and uses new letters.

Better candidate: ""ROUND"":
- R is now in position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was in position 3 before).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new common consonants.

This seems better as it shifts both R and O to new positions and introduces new letters.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A, S, E are out.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - U, N, D are out.
   - R is still not in position 1 (so it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5).
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Must not contain A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Letters left to test: T, L, C, G, H, I, M, P, B, F, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Fixes O in position 2.
- Places R in a new untested position (e.g., position 3 or 4).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels (T, I, L, etc.).

A good candidate is ""FORTH"":
- F is untested.
- O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- R is in position 3 (new position).
- T and H are new common consonants.

This seems efficient.

A good pair is G and Y to test G O R Y _ or G O R _ Y. 
But we need a 5-letter word, so let’s try G O R L Y – but GORLY isn’t a valid word.

Next, L and Y: G O R L Y – still invalid.

Use M and Y: G O R M Y – GORMY isn’t valid.

Use K and Y: G O R K Y – GORKY isn’t valid.

Use P and Y: G O R P Y – GORPY isn’t valid.

Use V and Y: G O R V Y – GORVY isn’t valid.

Use W and Y: G O R W Y – GORWY isn’t valid.

Let’s try G O R M _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending with a valid letter.

How about G O R M Y – no.

Let’s try L O R M _ – but LORM_ – LORM_ isn’t valid.

Let’s try P O R K _ – but K is in position 4, and PORK_ isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O R _ _ with remaining letters.

Allowed letters left: G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- GORGE (but G is used twice, and E is out)
- GORNY (N is out)
- CORGI (C, G, I – C and I are out)
- MORPH (H is out)
- BORIC (B, I, C – B, I, C are out)
- PORGY (P, G, Y – P, G, Y are still allowed)
- VORGY (V, G, Y – V, G, Y are allowed)
- WORRY (W, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)
- YORIC (C is out)
- GORRY (G, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)

The best valid word left seems to be ""PORGY"" – but let me check:
P (allowed), O (used), R (used), G (allowed), Y (allowed).

Next, L and Y: G O R L Y – still invalid.

Use M and Y: G O R M Y – GORMY isn’t valid.

Use K and Y: G O R K Y – GORKY isn’t valid.

Use P and Y: G O R P Y – GORPY isn’t valid.

Use V and Y: G O R V Y – GORVY isn’t valid.

Use W and Y: G O R W Y – GORWY isn’t valid.

Let’s try G O R M _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending with a valid letter.

How about G O R M Y – no.

Let’s try L O R M _ – but LORM_ – LORM_ isn’t valid.

Let’s try P O R K _ – but K is in position 4, and PORK_ isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O R _ _ with remaining letters.

Allowed letters left: G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- GORGE (but G is used twice, and E is out)
- GORNY (N is out)
- CORGI (C, G, I – C and I are out)
- MORPH (H is out)
- BORIC (B, I, C – B, I, C are out)
- PORGY (P, G, Y – P, G, Y are still allowed)
- VORGY (V, G, Y – V, G, Y are allowed)
- WORRY (W, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)
- YORIC (C is out)
- GORRY (G, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)

The best valid word left seems to be ""PORGY"" – but let me check:
P (allowed), O (used), R (used), G (allowed), Y (allowed).

""PORGY"" is a valid 5-letter word and uses only still-allowed letters.

Therefore, I’ll guess PORGY.",Guess 5: PORGY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with many vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words
This should give good initial information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and O, but not A, S, or E.
- R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while placing R and O in new positions. Good letters to test now are T, I, N, L, U, etc. I’ll try a word that keeps R and O but moves them to new spots and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F is a common consonant not yet tested.
- R moves to position 2 (previously position 2 had R, but now it's in a new position).
- O moves to position 3 (previously position 3 had O, but now it's in a new position).
- N and T are common consonants introduced by the word.

However, this might not be optimal since R and O are in positions they were in before. Instead, let's try a word that shifts R and O to new positions and uses new letters.

Better candidate: ""ROUND"":
- R is now in position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was in position 3 before).
- U is a new vowel.
- N and D are new common consonants.

This seems better as it shifts both R and O to new positions and introduces new letters.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A, S, E are out.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - U, N, D are out.
   - R is still not in position 1 (so it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5).
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Must not contain A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Letters left to test: T, L, C, G, H, I, M, P, B, F, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Fixes O in position 2.
- Places R in a new untested position (e.g., position 3 or 4).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels (T, I, L, etc.).

A good candidate is ""FORTH"":
- F is untested.
- O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- R is in position 3 (new position).
- T and H are new common consonants.

This seems efficient.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: FORTH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(x) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A, S, E are out.
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   – U, N, D are out.
   – O is now locked in position 2.
   – R is still not in position 1.

3. FORTH → F(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(x) H(x)
   – F, T, H are out.
   – O is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is now confirmed in position 3.

So the word must look like: _ O R _ _

Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, U, N, D, F, T, H.

Remaining common consonants to test: B, C, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.
Remaining vowels: I (since O is used and A, E, U are out).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5. Let’s pick common consonants and a vowel I.

Candidate words fitting _ O R _ _:
- BORIC (but C is at position 5, B at 1)
- CORGI (but G is at 5, C at 1)
- MORPH (but H is out, so no)
- BORIC looks good: B, O, R, I, C.

Let me check: B, O, R, I, C – none of these letters have been ruled out yet.

So BORIC is a valid next guess.

Guess 4: BORIC -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) R(✓) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback:

- Positions so far: _ O R _ _
- Letters ruled out: A, S, E, U, N, D, F, T, H, B, I, C
- Remaining common letters: G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowel O (used) and R (used).

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 5. Let’s pick from the still-allowed set: G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

A good pair is G and Y to test G O R Y _ or G O R _ Y. 
But we need a 5-letter word, so let’s try G O R L Y – but GORLY isn’t a valid word.

Next, L and Y: G O R L Y – still invalid.

Use M and Y: G O R M Y – GORMY isn’t valid.

Use K and Y: G O R K Y – GORKY isn’t valid.

Use P and Y: G O R P Y – GORPY isn’t valid.

Use V and Y: G O R V Y – GORVY isn’t valid.

Use W and Y: G O R W Y – GORWY isn’t valid.

Let’s try G O R M _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending with a valid letter.

How about G O R M Y – no.

Let’s try L O R M _ – but LORM_ – LORM_ isn’t valid.

Let’s try P O R K _ – but K is in position 4, and PORK_ isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ O R _ _ with remaining letters.

Allowed letters left: G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Valid words:
- GORGE (but G is used twice, and E is out)
- GORNY (N is out)
- CORGI (C, G, I – C and I are out)
- MORPH (H is out)
- BORIC (B, I, C – B, I, C are out)
- PORGY (P, G, Y – P, G, Y are still allowed)
- VORGY (V, G, Y – V, G, Y are allowed)
- WORRY (W, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)
- YORIC (C is out)
- GORRY (G, R, Y – but R is already in position 3)

The best valid word left seems to be ""PORGY"" – but let me check:
P (allowed), O (used), R (used), G (allowed), Y (allowed).

""PORGY"" is a valid 5-letter word and uses only still-allowed letters.

Therefore, I’ll guess PORGY.
