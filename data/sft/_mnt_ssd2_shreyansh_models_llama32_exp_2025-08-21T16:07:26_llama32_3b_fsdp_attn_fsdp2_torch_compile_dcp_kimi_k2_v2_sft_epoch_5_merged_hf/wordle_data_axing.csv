For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt since it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and contains none of R, O, S, E.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters.  
Next, I want to test other frequently occurring consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H  
Good remaining vowels: I, U  

A word that uses several of these is “ADMIT”:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct)
- Uses M, D, I, T (none of which have been ruled out)
- Provides good coverage of remaining common letters

Current known facts:
- First letter is A (✓ in both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it’s a “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include I somewhere other than the 4th slot.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (already known to be present), U (since O and E are out).

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing I not in position 4, and avoiding all eliminated letters (R, O, S, E, D, M, T).

Possible structures: A I _ _ _ , A _ I _ _ , A _ _ I _ , etc.

A good candidate is “AILS” – but S is eliminated.
Another is “ALIBI” – but B and I are okay, and it avoids all banned letters. However, I is in position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

Current facts:
- A is fixed in position 1.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.
- Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: I and N (both received “-” feedback).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both I and N somewhere, plus any other letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining consonants: C, G, B, F, H, K, P, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (O, E eliminated).

We must place I and N somewhere other than:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ADMIT and ANVIL).
- N cannot be in position 2 (from ANVIL).

Possible placements:
- I could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- N could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other still-allowed letters is “ACORN” – but O and R are eliminated.
“APING” – but P, I, N, G are okay, and I is in position 2, N in position 3.  However, G hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Wait, let’s list all banned letters once more:
Eliminated: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.

So in “APING” we have P, A, I, N, G.  All letters are still allowed.  
Positions: A(1)✓, P?, I?, N?, G?

We know I must be somewhere in positions 2-5 and N must be in positions 3-5.

Let’s try “APING” to test P, G, and the correct placement of I and N.

But before finalizing, let me double-check that APING avoids all banned letters:
- A: ok (fixed)
- P: ok (not banned)
- I: ok (must be in word)
- N: ok (must be in word)
- G: ok (not banned)

So APING is valid.

But to get more information, perhaps better is “ANGIN” – but that’s not a common English word.

Another option: “ACIDY” – but D, Y are ok?  Wait, D is banned.

“ACORN” – R is banned.

“ACID” – 4 letters.

“ACORN” – 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think of 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, avoiding all banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- A F I N G – but F, G not ruled out yet, but N is in position 4, which is allowed.
- A C I N G – C, G allowed.
- A P I N G – P, G allowed.

But let’s pick a word that also tests new consonants.  “ACING” – C, G allowed, I in position 3, N in position 4.

Yes, “ACING” is valid, common, and fits all constraints.

So I will go with “ACING”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt since it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and contains none of R, O, S, E.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters.  
Next, I want to test other frequently occurring consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H  
Good remaining vowels: I, U  

A word that uses several of these is “ADMIT”:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct)
- Uses M, D, I, T (none of which have been ruled out)
- Provides good coverage of remaining common letters

Let’s try that.

<guess>ADMIT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current known facts:
- First letter is A (✓ in both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it’s a “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include I somewhere other than the 4th slot.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (already known to be present), U (since O and E are out).

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing I not in position 4, and avoiding all eliminated letters (R, O, S, E, D, M, T).

Possible structures: A I _ _ _ , A _ I _ _ , A _ _ I _ , etc.

A good candidate is “AILS” – but S is eliminated.
Another is “ALIBI” – but B and I are okay, and it avoids all banned letters. However, I is in position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

Better: “ANVIL” – starts with A, contains I in position 2, and uses N, V, L which haven’t been ruled out.

Check: A N V I L – avoids all eliminated letters and positions the I correctly (not 4th).

So I’ll go with ANVIL.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ANVIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) V(x) I(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current facts:
- A is fixed in position 1.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.
- Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: I and N (both received “-” feedback).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both I and N somewhere, plus any other letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining consonants: C, G, B, F, H, K, P, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (O, E eliminated).

We must place I and N somewhere other than:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ADMIT and ANVIL).
- N cannot be in position 2 (from ANVIL).

Possible placements:
- I could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- N could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other still-allowed letters is “ACORN” – but O and R are eliminated.
“APING” – but P, I, N, G are okay, and I is in position 2, N in position 3.  However, G hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Wait, let’s list all banned letters once more:
Eliminated: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.

So in “APING” we have P, A, I, N, G.  All letters are still allowed.  
Positions: A(1)✓, P?, I?, N?, G?

We know I must be somewhere in positions 2-5 and N must be in positions 3-5.

Let’s try “APING” to test P, G, and the correct placement of I and N.

But before finalizing, let me double-check that APING avoids all banned letters:
- A: ok (fixed)
- P: ok (not banned)
- I: ok (must be in word)
- N: ok (must be in word)
- G: ok (not banned)

So APING is valid.

But to get more information, perhaps better is “ANGIN” – but that’s not a common English word.

Another option: “ACIDY” – but D, Y are ok?  Wait, D is banned.

“ACORN” – R is banned.

“ACID” – 4 letters.

“ACORN” – 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think of 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, avoiding all banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- A F I N G – but F, G not ruled out yet, but N is in position 4, which is allowed.
- A C I N G – C, G allowed.
- A P I N G – P, G allowed.

But let’s pick a word that also tests new consonants.  “ACING” – C, G allowed, I in position 3, N in position 4.

Yes, “ACING” is valid, common, and fits all constraints.

So I will go with “ACING”.

From the latest feedback on ACING:
- A is correct in position 1.
- C is not in the word (x).
- I is now correct in position 3.
- N is correct in position 4.
- G is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is:
A _ I N G

The only missing letter is position 2.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L, C.  
Remaining consonants that haven’t been tried: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common ones are B, F, H, K, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A ? I N G that is in the dictionary and uses one of these letters for the second position.

Possible candidates:
- ABING – not a valid English word.
- AFING – not valid.
- AHING – not valid.
- AKING – not valid.
- APING – not valid.
- AWING – not valid.
- AYING – not valid.

The only valid English word fitting A _ I N G is “AING” – but that’s 4 letters.  
Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words: “A” + consonant + “ING”.

Valid 5-letter words:
- AFOGG – no, O, G, G already handled.
- AHEAD – D, E eliminated.
- ALINE – L eliminated.
- ANGEL – E, L eliminated.
- ANGRY – R, Y allowed, R not eliminated (only C, D, M, T, V, L, R in earlier guesses?  
Wait, R was eliminated in AROSE (first guess).  
So ANGRY is invalid because R is banned.

Another check:
- APHID – D eliminated.
- AWFUL – W, U, L – L eliminated.
- AXIOM – O, M eliminated.
- AYONIC – Y, O, N, I, C – C eliminated.
- ABBOT – T eliminated.
- ABBEY – E, Y allowed, E eliminated.
- ABING – not valid.

Realizing I made a mistake: the word must be A _ I N G, with the blank in positions 2.  
Valid English 5-letter words:
- A W I N G – but “AWING” isn’t a recognized word.
- A P I N G – “APING” is a valid word (meaning to make fun of someone).

Let me verify:
- A P I N G:
  – A: ✓ position 1 (matches).
  – P: not yet tested (ok).
  – I: ✓ position 3 (matches).
  – N: ✓ position 4 (matches).
  – G: ✓ position 5 (matches).

All letters are allowed, and it fits the pattern A _ I N G.

- G is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is:
A _ I N G

The only missing letter is position 2.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L, C.  
Remaining consonants that haven’t been tried: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common ones are B, F, H, K, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A ? I N G that is in the dictionary and uses one of these letters for the second position.

Possible candidates:
- ABING – not a valid English word.
- AFING – not valid.
- AHING – not valid.
- AKING – not valid.
- APING – not valid.
- AWING – not valid.
- AYING – not valid.

The only valid English word fitting A _ I N G is “AING” – but that’s 4 letters.  
Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words: “A” + consonant + “ING”.

Valid 5-letter words:
- AFOGG – no, O, G, G already handled.
- AHEAD – D, E eliminated.
- ALINE – L eliminated.
- ANGEL – E, L eliminated.
- ANGRY – R, Y allowed, R not eliminated (only C, D, M, T, V, L, R in earlier guesses?  
Wait, R was eliminated in AROSE (first guess).  
So ANGRY is invalid because R is banned.

Another check:
- APHID – D eliminated.
- AWFUL – W, U, L – L eliminated.
- AXIOM – O, M eliminated.
- AYONIC – Y, O, N, I, C – C eliminated.
- ABBOT – T eliminated.
- ABBEY – E, Y allowed, E eliminated.
- ABING – not valid.

Realizing I made a mistake: the word must be A _ I N G, with the blank in positions 2.  
Valid English 5-letter words:
- A W I N G – but “AWING” isn’t a recognized word.
- A P I N G – “APING” is a valid word (meaning to make fun of someone).

Let me verify:
- A P I N G:
  – A: ✓ position 1 (matches).
  – P: not yet tested (ok).
  – I: ✓ position 3 (matches).
  – N: ✓ position 4 (matches).
  – G: ✓ position 5 (matches).

All letters are allowed, and it fits the pattern A _ I N G.

Therefore, the next logical guess is APING.",Guess 5: APING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt since it covers the most common vowels and consonants efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word starts with A and contains none of R, O, S, E.  
That eliminates a lot of common letters.  
Next, I want to test other frequently occurring consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H  
Good remaining vowels: I, U  

A word that uses several of these is “ADMIT”:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct)
- Uses M, D, I, T (none of which have been ruled out)
- Provides good coverage of remaining common letters

Let’s try that.

<guess>ADMIT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current known facts:
- First letter is A (✓ in both guesses).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it’s a “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include I somewhere other than the 4th slot.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I (already known to be present), U (since O and E are out).

I need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing I not in position 4, and avoiding all eliminated letters (R, O, S, E, D, M, T).

Possible structures: A I _ _ _ , A _ I _ _ , A _ _ I _ , etc.

A good candidate is “AILS” – but S is eliminated.
Another is “ALIBI” – but B and I are okay, and it avoids all banned letters. However, I is in position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

Better: “ANVIL” – starts with A, contains I in position 2, and uses N, V, L which haven’t been ruled out.

Check: A N V I L – avoids all eliminated letters and positions the I correctly (not 4th).

So I’ll go with ANVIL.

<guess>ANVIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ANVIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) V(x) I(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current facts:
- A is fixed in position 1.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.
- Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: I and N (both received “-” feedback).

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the remaining letters must include both I and N somewhere, plus any other letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining consonants: C, G, B, F, H, K, P, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (O, E eliminated).

We must place I and N somewhere other than:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ADMIT and ANVIL).
- N cannot be in position 2 (from ANVIL).

Possible placements:
- I could be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- N could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other still-allowed letters is “ACORN” – but O and R are eliminated.
“APING” – but P, I, N, G are okay, and I is in position 2, N in position 3.  However, G hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Wait, let’s list all banned letters once more:
Eliminated: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L.

So in “APING” we have P, A, I, N, G.  All letters are still allowed.  
Positions: A(1)✓, P?, I?, N?, G?

We know I must be somewhere in positions 2-5 and N must be in positions 3-5.

Let’s try “APING” to test P, G, and the correct placement of I and N.

But before finalizing, let me double-check that APING avoids all banned letters:
- A: ok (fixed)
- P: ok (not banned)
- I: ok (must be in word)
- N: ok (must be in word)
- G: ok (not banned)

So APING is valid.

But to get more information, perhaps better is “ANGIN” – but that’s not a common English word.

Another option: “ACIDY” – but D, Y are ok?  Wait, D is banned.

“ACORN” – R is banned.

“ACID” – 4 letters.

“ACORN” – 4 letters.

Actually, let’s think of 5-letter words starting with A, containing I and N, avoiding all banned letters.

Possible candidates:
- A F I N G – but F, G not ruled out yet, but N is in position 4, which is allowed.
- A C I N G – C, G allowed.
- A P I N G – P, G allowed.

But let’s pick a word that also tests new consonants.  “ACING” – C, G allowed, I in position 3, N in position 4.

Yes, “ACING” is valid, common, and fits all constraints.

So I will go with “ACING”.

Guess 4: ACING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on ACING:
- A is correct in position 1.
- C is not in the word (x).
- I is now correct in position 3.
- N is correct in position 4.
- G is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is:
A _ I N G

The only missing letter is position 2.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, V, L, C.  
Remaining consonants that haven’t been tried: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common ones are B, F, H, K, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A ? I N G that is in the dictionary and uses one of these letters for the second position.

Possible candidates:
- ABING – not a valid English word.
- AFING – not valid.
- AHING – not valid.
- AKING – not valid.
- APING – not valid.
- AWING – not valid.
- AYING – not valid.

The only valid English word fitting A _ I N G is “AING” – but that’s 4 letters.  
Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words: “A” + consonant + “ING”.

Valid 5-letter words:
- AFOGG – no, O, G, G already handled.
- AHEAD – D, E eliminated.
- ALINE – L eliminated.
- ANGEL – E, L eliminated.
- ANGRY – R, Y allowed, R not eliminated (only C, D, M, T, V, L, R in earlier guesses?  
Wait, R was eliminated in AROSE (first guess).  
So ANGRY is invalid because R is banned.

Another check:
- APHID – D eliminated.
- AWFUL – W, U, L – L eliminated.
- AXIOM – O, M eliminated.
- AYONIC – Y, O, N, I, C – C eliminated.
- ABBOT – T eliminated.
- ABBEY – E, Y allowed, E eliminated.
- ABING – not valid.

Realizing I made a mistake: the word must be A _ I N G, with the blank in positions 2.  
Valid English 5-letter words:
- A W I N G – but “AWING” isn’t a recognized word.
- A P I N G – “APING” is a valid word (meaning to make fun of someone).

Let me verify:
- A P I N G:
  – A: ✓ position 1 (matches).
  – P: not yet tested (ok).
  – I: ✓ position 3 (matches).

All letters are allowed, and it fits the pattern A _ I N G.
