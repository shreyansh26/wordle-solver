### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).

- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""PLANT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we need to avoid the forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and has A in position 2. This should give us more information about the remaining consonants and the correct placement of A.

Another option is ""MOUNT"", but that has an O which we know is not in the word. So that's out.

""PLANT"" seems like the best choice here.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their constraints:
- A: in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (because in MADAM it was in position 4 and marked “-” instead of “✓”).  
  Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 already gave “-” when A was there, so A cannot be in 4 either.  
  The only remaining spot is position 5 (A must be at 2 or 5).  
  However, in MADAM A was in position 4 and got “-”, so position 4 is NOT A.  
  Re-checking: in MADAM the feedback for A was A(✓) in position 2, but then why did we get “-” for A in position 4 in PLANT?  
  Wait, no: in PLANT A was in position 3 and got “-”, so A is NOT in position 3.  
  In MADAM A was in position 2 and got “✓”, so A IS in position 2.  
  Therefore A is fixed in position 2.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _

Remaining letters we haven’t tested yet (ignoring the ✗ list):
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word whose pattern is _ A _ _ _ and which uses fresh, common letters.

Good candidates:
- C: C, I, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, Y
- I: I, U, C, G, H, K, B, F, Y

Let’s pick a word that uses three new common consonants in positions 1, 4, 5 while keeping A in position 2.

“C” is a good untested consonant. A word like C A _ _ _ would be nice, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “CABIN”:
- C (new), A (fixed in 2), B (new), I (new), N (but N was eliminated in PLANT).  
  Oops, N is eliminated.

Try “CIGAR”:
- C, I, G, A (fixed in 2), R (R is eliminated).  
  R is out.

Try “BACON”:
- B, A (fixed in 2), C, O (O eliminated), N (N eliminated).  
  O and N are out.

Try “VACAY”:
- V, A (fixed in 2), C, A (duplicate A), Y.  
  Uses V, C, Y which are all still possible.  
  Pattern: _ A _ _ _ → V A C A Y → but position 4 would be A, which is allowed (we only know A is not in 1,3,5).  
  However, we already know A is in position 2 from MADAM.  
  So the word would be V A C A Y.  
  But the feedback for A in MADAM showed A in position 4 got “-”, meaning A is not in 4.  
  So VACAY has A in 4, which is invalid.

Try “HABIT”:
- H, A (fixed in 2), B, I, T (T is eliminated).  
  T is out.

Try “GAMMA”:
- G, A (fixed in 2), M (M is eliminated).  
  M is out.

  L and T are out.

Try “CAULK”:
- C, A (fixed in 2), U, L (L eliminated), K.  
  L is out.

Try “HABIT” again – but T is out.

Try “GABBY”:
- G, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
  Uses G, B, Y.  
  Pattern: _ A _ _ _ → G A B B Y.  
  All letters are still possible.

Another option: “CABBY”:
- C, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
  But C is still possible.

Between GABBY and CABBY, both are equally valid.  
Let’s pick CABBY.

Check constraints:
- C, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
- A is in position 2 – confirmed.  
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D are all absent).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
- It DOES contain A, but not in the 1st position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""PLANT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we need to avoid the forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and has A in position 2. This should give us more information about the remaining consonants and the correct placement of A.

Another option is ""MOUNT"", but that has an O which we know is not in the word. So that's out.

""PLANT"" seems like the best choice here.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions so far:
A (it cannot be in positions 1 or 3)

So the word must contain A, and A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test new common letters: the remaining high-frequency consonants are D, G, H, C, M, B, F, K, etc., and the only remaining common vowel is I (since A is already confirmed).

A good third guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible without using any of the eliminated ones.
3. Be a valid 5-letter word.

One strong candidate is “MADAM”:
- It places A in position 2 (a new spot).
- It introduces M, D, and I, none of which have been ruled out.
- It uses no forbidden letters.

Another candidate could be “CHAIR”, but that uses R which we know is out.

“MADAM” seems best because it keeps the A/A pattern and introduces three fresh, common letters.

Let’s go with MADAM.

<guess>MADAM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: MADAM -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their constraints:
- A: in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (because in MADAM it was in position 4 and marked “-” instead of “✓”).  
  Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 already gave “-” when A was there, so A cannot be in 4 either.  
  The only remaining spot is position 5 (A must be at 2 or 5).  
  However, in MADAM A was in position 4 and got “-”, so position 4 is NOT A.  
  Re-checking: in MADAM the feedback for A was A(✓) in position 2, but then why did we get “-” for A in position 4 in PLANT?

  We know A must be in position 2, so position 4 could be K, position 5 could be A.  
  However, in MADAM A was in position 4 and got “-” (A is not in 4), so A cannot be in 4.  
  Thus HAKKA is invalid because it puts A in 5, which is allowed (A has only been ruled out from 1,3,4,5 so far), but we need to check if A is allowed in 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
- It DOES contain A, but not in the 1st position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

A strong next guess would be a word like ""PLANT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we need to avoid the forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

""PLANT"" uses P, L, N, T - all allowed so far - and has A in position 2. This should give us more information about the remaining consonants and the correct placement of A.

Another option is ""MOUNT"", but that has an O which we know is not in the word. So that's out.

""PLANT"" seems like the best choice here.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions so far:
A (it cannot be in positions 1 or 3)

So the word must contain A, and A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test new common letters: the remaining high-frequency consonants are D, G, H, C, M, B, F, K, etc., and the only remaining common vowel is I (since A is already confirmed).

A good third guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible without using any of the eliminated ones.
3. Be a valid 5-letter word.

One strong candidate is “MADAM”:
- It places A in position 2 (a new spot).
- It introduces M, D, and I, none of which have been ruled out.
- It uses no forbidden letters.

Another candidate could be “CHAIR”, but that uses R which we know is out.

“MADAM” seems best because it keeps the A/A pattern and introduces three fresh, common letters.

Let’s go with MADAM.

<guess>MADAM</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: MADAM -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their constraints:
- A: in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (because in MADAM it was in position 4 and marked “-” instead of “✓”).  
  Therefore A must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 already gave “-” when A was there, so A cannot be in 4 either.  
  The only remaining spot is position 5 (A must be at 2 or 5).  
  However, in MADAM A was in position 4 and got “-”, so position 4 is NOT A.  
  Re-checking: in MADAM the feedback for A was A(✓) in position 2, but then why did we get “-” for A in position 4 in PLANT?  
  Wait, no: in PLANT A was in position 3 and got “-”, so A is NOT in position 3.  
  In MADAM A was in position 2 and got “✓”, so A IS in position 2.  
  Therefore A is fixed in position 2.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _

Remaining letters we haven’t tested yet (ignoring the ✗ list):
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word whose pattern is _ A _ _ _ and which uses fresh, common letters.

Good candidates:
- C: C, I, G, H, K, B, F, V, W, Y
- I: I, U, C, G, H, K, B, F, Y

Let’s pick a word that uses three new common consonants in positions 1, 4, 5 while keeping A in position 2.

“C” is a good untested consonant. A word like C A _ _ _ would be nice, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “CABIN”:
- C (new), A (fixed in 2), B (new), I (new), N (but N was eliminated in PLANT).  
  Oops, N is eliminated.

Try “CIGAR”:
- C, I, G, A (fixed in 2), R (R is eliminated).  
  R is out.

Try “BACON”:
- B, A (fixed in 2), C, O (O eliminated), N (N eliminated).  
  O and N are out.

Try “VACAY”:
- V, A (fixed in 2), C, A (duplicate A), Y.  
  Uses V, C, Y which are all still possible.  
  Pattern: _ A _ _ _ → V A C A Y → but position 4 would be A, which is allowed (we only know A is not in 1,3,5).  
  However, we already know A is in position 2 from MADAM.  
  So the word would be V A C A Y.  
  But the feedback for A in MADAM showed A in position 4 got “-”, meaning A is not in 4.  
  So VACAY has A in 4, which is invalid.

Try “HABIT”:
- H, A (fixed in 2), B, I, T (T is eliminated).  
  T is out.

Try “GAMMA”:
- G, A (fixed in 2), M (M is eliminated).  
  M is out.

Try “FAIRY”:
- F, A (fixed in 2), I, R (R eliminated), Y.  
  R is out.

Try “BAKER”:
- B, A (fixed in 2), K, E (E eliminated), R (R eliminated).  
  E and R are out.

Try “VAULT”:
- V, A (fixed in 2), U, L (L eliminated), T (T eliminated).  
  L and T are out.

Try “CAULK”:
- C, A (fixed in 2), U, L (L eliminated), K.  
  L is out.

Try “HABIT” again – but T is out.

Try “GABBY”:
- G, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
  Uses G, B, Y.  
  Pattern: _ A _ _ _ → G A B B Y.  
  All letters are still possible.

Another option: “CABBY”:
- C, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
  But C is still possible.

Between GABBY and CABBY, both are equally valid.  
Let’s pick CABBY.

Check constraints:
- C, A (fixed in 2), B, B, Y.  
- A is in position 2 – confirmed.  
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D are all absent).  
- Uses new letters C, B, Y.

So CABBY is a good next guess.

  But A is only in position 2, so positions 4 and 5 would be K and A.  
  We know A must be in position 2, so position 4 could be K, position 5 could be A.  
  However, in MADAM A was in position 4 and got “-” (A is not in 4), so A cannot be in 4.

Try “HAKKA”:
- H, A, K, K, A.  
  This seems the best available.

Let’s go with HAKKA.

Check:
- H, A, K, K, A.  
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- Letters used: H, K, A – all still possible.  
- No forbidden letters.

So HAKKA is the next logical guess.
