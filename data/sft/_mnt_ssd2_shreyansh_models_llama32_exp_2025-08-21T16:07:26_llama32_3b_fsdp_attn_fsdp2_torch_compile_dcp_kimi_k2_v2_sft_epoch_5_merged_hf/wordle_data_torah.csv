### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and T (but A not in position 3, T not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A word like ""RATIO"" would fit:
- R, T, I, O are all possible letters not ruled out yet.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- T is in position 3 (but feedback said T is in wrong position, so it can't be in position 4, but position 3 is allowed unless we know otherwise - actually feedback just says T(-) meaning it's in the word but not position 4, so position 3 is fine).

However, let me double-check: the feedback said T is in the word but not in position 4, so position 3 is allowed. A is in the word but not position 3, so position 2 is allowed. 

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded, so no. 
""TRAIN"" - but I is allowed, R, N, A, T. A is in position 3 which is invalid (feedback says A not in position 3). So no.

""RATIN"" - but not a valid word.
""ARTIC"" - A in position 1 (valid), T in position 3 (valid), excludes S,L,E. 

""ARTIC"" seems good: A, T, R, I, C - all allowed letters, A not in position 3, T not in position 4.

But let me think of even better: ""TRAIN"" has A in position 3 (invalid). 
""TRAMP"" - P is allowed, but M might be risky.
""RATIO"" seems good, but maybe ""ACTIN"" - A in position 1, T in position 3, excludes S,L,E.

Actually, ""ACTIN"" is valid and uses common letters. Let me go with that.

Wait, but ""ACTIN"" has A in position 1 (valid), T in position 3 (valid), and excludes S,L,E. But is it the best?

Another good option: ""RATIO"" - R, T, I, O, A. R and I and O are common, A is allowed in position 5 (since it wasn't in position 3).

I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better as it uses R and I which are common and weren't tested yet.

But ""ACTIN"" is also good. Between these, I'll go with ""RATIO"" as it tests more new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, E are out entirely.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2 (RATIO):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is out entirely.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, T, O (and R, but R is not in position 1).
- Letters definitely out: S, L, E, I.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 2 or 3.
  – T cannot be in 3 or 4.
  – O cannot be in 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, O (and R, since R is also in the word).
2. Excludes S, L, E, I.
3. Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s look for a word that uses A, T, O, R plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (common unused letters: C, N, D, U, etc.).

Candidate letters left: C, N, D, U, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Try to place A, T, O, R while avoiding the banned positions.

One valid arrangement: T A R _ O – but position 4 is not allowed for T, and position 2 is banned for A.

Next: _ A T _ O – but position 1 is allowed, position 2 is banned for A, so no.

Try: _ O A T _ – position 1 is allowed, position 2 is allowed for O, position 3 is banned for A, so no.

Try: A _ T _ O – position 1 is allowed for A, position 3 is banned for T, so no.

Try: _ R A T O – position 1 is allowed, position 3 is banned for A, position 4 is banned for T, so no.

Try: T _ A _ O – position 1 is allowed for T, position 3 is banned for A, position 5 is banned for O, so no.

Try: A _ _ T O – position 1 is allowed for A, position 4 is banned for T, position 5 is banned for O, so no.

Try: O _ A T _ – position 1 is allowed for O, position 3 is banned for A, position 4 is allowed for T, but position 5 is allowed for any letter.

O _ A T _:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- A in 3 (banned) – no.

O _ _ T A:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- _ in 2 (allowed)
- T in 4 (banned) – no.

O _ T _ A:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- T in 3 (banned) – no.

_ A T _ O:
- A in 2 (banned) – no.

_ O A T _:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (banned) – no.

_ A _ T O:
- A in 2 (banned) – no.

_ O _ T A:
- O in 2 (allowed)
- _ in 3 (allowed)
- T in 4 (banned) – no.

RATIO also told us R is in the word but not in position 1.

Let’s try to place R.

R must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but not 1.

Try: T A R _ O – T in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (banned) – no.

Try: T O A R _ – T in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (banned) – no.

Try: A T R _ O – A in 1 (allowed), T in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), O in 5 (banned) – no.

Thus, I’ll guess ATORM.

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, E are out entirely.

- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So far we know:

- Letters definitely out: S, L, E, I.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 2 or 3.
  – T cannot be in 3 or 4.
  – O cannot be in 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, O (and R, since R is also in the word).
2. Excludes S, L, E, I.
3. Respects the positional bans above.

Let’s look for a word that uses A, T, O, R plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out (common unused letters: C, N, D, U, etc.).

Candidate letters left: C, N, D, U, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Try to place A, T, O, R while avoiding the banned positions.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and T (but A not in position 3, T not in position 4).
2. Excludes S, L, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to keep narrowing down possibilities.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A word like ""RATIO"" would fit:
- R, T, I, O are all possible letters not ruled out yet.
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- T is in position 3 (but feedback said T is in wrong position, so it can't be in position 4, but position 3 is allowed unless we know otherwise - actually feedback just says T(-) meaning it's in the word but not position 4, so position 3 is fine).

However, let me double-check: the feedback said T is in the word but not in position 4, so position 3 is allowed. A is in the word but not position 3, so position 2 is allowed. 

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded, so no. 
""TRAIN"" - but I is allowed, R, N, A, T. A is in position 3 which is invalid (feedback says A not in position 3). So no.

""RATIN"" - but not a valid word.
""ARTIC"" - A in position 1 (valid), T in position 3 (valid), excludes S,L,E. 

""ARTIC"" seems good: A, T, R, I, C - all allowed letters, A not in position 3, T not in position 4.

But let me think of even better: ""TRAIN"" has A in position 3 (invalid). 
""TRAMP"" - P is allowed, but M might be risky.
""RATIO"" seems good, but maybe ""ACTIN"" - A in position 1, T in position 3, excludes S,L,E.

Actually, ""ACTIN"" is valid and uses common letters. Let me go with that.

Wait, but ""ACTIN"" has A in position 1 (valid), T in position 3 (valid), and excludes S,L,E. But is it the best?

Another good option: ""RATIO"" - R, T, I, O, A. R and I and O are common, A is allowed in position 5 (since it wasn't in position 3).

I think ""RATIO"" is slightly better as it uses R and I which are common and weren't tested yet.

But ""ACTIN"" is also good. Between these, I'll go with ""RATIO"" as it tests more new letters.

Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(-) I(x) O(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, E are out entirely.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2 (RATIO):

- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is out entirely.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- A, T, O, R  (all appeared as “-” at least once)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- S, L, E, I, M

Positions ruled out for each of A, T, O, R by the three guesses:

A:
- Not in 3 (SLATE), not in 2 (RATIO), not in 1 (ATORM)  
  ⇒ A must be in position 4 or 5.

T:
- Not in 4 (SLATE), not in 3 (RATIO), not in 2 (ATORM)  
  ⇒ T must be in position 1, 5.

O:
- Not in 5 (RATIO), not in 3 (ATORM)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1, 2, 4.

R:
- Not in 4 (SLATE), not in 4 (ATORM)  
  ⇒ R must be in position 1, 2, 3, 5.

Additional constraints:
- The word has five distinct letters, since each of A, T, O, R has been marked “-” (present but wrong place) and we have no duplicates indicated.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses each of A, T, O, R exactly once.
2. Places them only in positions allowed by the bans above.
3. Adds one new letter (not S, L, E, I, M) and keeps it in a position that hasn’t been ruled out.

Possible new letters not yet tried: C, N, D, U, G, H, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters while respecting bans.

Banks and bans:
- A: can be 4 or 5
- T: can be 1 or 5
- O: can be 1, 2, 4
- R: can be 1, 2, 3, 5

We need to assign A, T, O, R to three different positions out of 1-5, plus one new letter.

Option 1: T in 1  
   Then A, O, R must go in 4,5 with O in 2 or 4.  
   Possible pattern: T _ A O R or T _ O A R.  
   Fill the remaining spot with a new letter (C, N, D, etc.)

   T _ A O R → T A _ O R → need a letter in position 3.  
   Try “T A C O R” – not a word.  
   Try “T A N O R” – not a word.  
   Try “T A D O R” – not a word.  
   Try “T A U O R” – not a word.  
   Try “T A R O N” – R in 3 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed), A in 2 (banned) – no.

   T _ O A R → T _ O A R → need a letter in position 2.  
   Try “T C O A R” – not a word.  
   Try “T N O A R” – not a word.  
   Try “T D O A R” – not a word.  
   Try “T U O A R” – not a word.  
   Try “T R O A N” – R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (banned) – no.

Option 2: T in 5  
   Then A, O, R must go in 1,2,4 with O in 2 or 4.  
   Possible patterns:
   - A O R _ T  → need a letter in 4 → A O R N T – not a word.  
   - A _ O R T  → A _ O R T → need a letter in 2 → A C O R T – not a word.  
   - O A R _ T  → O A R N T – not a word.  
   - R A O _ T  → R A O N T – not a word.  
   - _ A O R T  → _ A O R T → need a letter in 1 → C A O R T – not a word.  
   - _ R O A T – R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (banned) – no.

Option 3: T in 1, O in 2  
   Then A must be 4 or 5.  
   R must be 3 or 5 (but 5 is taken by T if T is in 1).  
   So R must be 3.  
   Then positions: T O R A _ – but A must be 4 or 5.  
   So T O R A _ – need a letter in 5 → T O R A N – not a word.  
   T O R _ A → T O R C A – not a word.  
   T O R A _ – need a letter in 5 → T O R A N – not a word.

Option 4: T in 1, O in 4  
   Then A must be 4 or 5.  
   R must be 2 or 3.  
   - If R is 2: T R A O _ – A in 3 (banned) – no.  
   - If R is 3: T _ R A O – need a letter in 2 → T C R A O – not a word.  
   - T _ A R O – A in 3 (banned) – no.

Option 5: T in 5, O in 1 or 2  
   - O in 1: O _ _ _ T – need A, R in 2,3 or 4.  
     O R A _ T – A in 3 (banned) – no.  
     O R _ A T – need a letter in 3 → O R C A T – not a word.  
     O R _ T A – T in 4 (banned) – no.

   - O in 2: _ O _ _ T  
     Then A and R must go in 1,3,4 with R in 3 or 4, A in 4 or 5.  
     R A O _ T – A in 2 (banned) – no.  
     R _ O A T – need a letter in 2 → R C O A T – not a word.  
     A R O _ T – A in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (banned) – no.

   - O in 4: _ _ _ O T  
     Then A and R must go in 1,2,3 with R in 3 → A R _ O T – need a letter in 2 → A R C O T – not a word.  
     A _ R O T – need a letter in 2 → A C R O T – not a word.

Option 6: T in 5, O in 2, A in 4  
   Then R must be 1 or 3.  
   - R in 1: R O _ A T  
     Need a letter in 3 → R O C A T – not a word.  
     R O N A T – not a word.  
     R O D A T – not a word.

     D O R A T – not a word.  
     P O R A T – not a word.

Option 7: T in 5, O in 1, A in 4  
   Then R must be 2 or 3.  
   - R in 2: O R _ A T  
     Need a letter in 3 → O R C A T – not a word.  
     O R N A T – not a word.  
     O R D A T – not a word.

   - R in 3: O _ R A T  
     Need a letter in 2 → O C R A T – not a word.  
     O N R A T – not a word.  
     O D R A T – not a word.

Option 8: T in 5, O in 1, A in 5  
   Then R must be 2 or 3.  
   - R in 2: O R _ _ T  
     A must be 4 → O R _ A T  
     Need a letter in 3 → O R C A T – not a word.  
     O R N A T – not a word.  
     O R D A T – not a word.

   - R in 3: O _ R _ T  
     A must be 4 → O _ R A T  
     Need a letter in 2 → O C R A T – not a word.  
     O N R A T – not a word.  
     O D R A T – not a word.

Option 9: T in 5, O in 2, A in 4  
   Then R must be 1 or 3.  
   - R in 1: R O _ A T  
     Need a letter in 3 → R O C A T – not a word.  
     R O N A T – not a word.  
     R O D A T – not a word.

   - R in 3: _ O R A T  
     Need a letter in 1 → C O R A T – not a word.  
     D O R A T – not a word.  
     P O R A T – not a word.

Option 10: T in 5, O in 1, A in 5  
   Same as above, no common word.

Let’s try a different approach: list all possible positions and new letter.

Positions 1-5:

1 2 3 4 5
----------------
A: 4 or 5
T: 1 or 5
O: 1,2,4
R: 1,2,3,5

We need to place A, T, O, R in 1-5 with the bans.

Let’s enumerate valid placements:

- T in 1:
  - Then O must be 2 or 4.
  - A must be 4 or 5.
  - R must be 2,3,5 (but 5 is T) → 2 or 3.

  Case T in 1, O in 2:
    O T _ _ A or O T _ A _
    Need a letter in 3 or 4.
    - O T A R _ – A in 3 (banned) – no.
    - O T R A _ – A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed) → O T R A _ → need a letter in 5 → O T R A N – not a word.  
    O T A _ R – A in 3 (banned) – no.

  Case T in 1, O in 4:
    T _ _ O A or T _ A O _ – but A must be 4 or 5, and O is 4.
    T _ A O _ – need a letter in 2 → T C A O _ – not a word.  
    T _ _ O A → T _ _ O A → need letters in 2,3 → T C R O A – not a word.  
    T R A O _ – A in 3 (banned) – no.

- T in 5:
  - Then O must be 1,2,4.
  - A must be 4 (since 5 is T).
  - R must be 1,2,3.

  Case T in 5, O in 1:
    O _ _ A T
    Need R in 2 or 3.
    - O R _ A T → need a letter in 3 → O R C A T – not a word.  
    - O _ R A T → need a letter in 2 → O C R A T – not a word.

  Case T in 5, O in 2:
    _ O _ A T
    Need R in 1 or 3.
    - R O _ A T → R O C A T – not a word.  
    - _ O R A T → need a letter in 1 → C O R A T – not a word.

  Case T in 5, O in 4:
    _ _ A O T
    Need R in 1 or 2 → R _ A O T or _ R A O T.

    R _ A O T → R C A O T – not a word.  
    _ R A O T → need a letter in 1 → C R A O T – not a word.

No common words found with these constraints.  
But we know the word must be valid and common.

Let me re-examine possible words with A, T, O, R plus one new letter, respecting bans.

Consider “CRANE” – but E is out.
“TRAIN” – I is out.
“RATIO” – I is out.

Look for a word with A, T, O, R plus one new letter in 1-5.

After scanning, a valid common word that fits:
- T in 1, O in 2, A in 4, R in 3, and a new letter in 5 → T O R A N – not a word.  
- T in 1, O in 4, A in 5, R in 2 or 3 → T _ R _ A or T _ A R _.

  T _ A R _ → T C A R _ – need a letter in 5 → T C A R N – not a word.  
  T _ R A _ → T C R A N – not a word.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words containing A, T, O, R and one new letter, then filter by bans.

Scanning word lists, a valid word is “RATIO” – but I is out.

“CRATE” – E is out.

“CARTO” – not common.

“TORAN” – not common.

“TORAS” – S is out.

“TORCH” – H is new, and letters are T, O, R, C, H.

Check TORCH:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- C is new
- H is new

Letters used: T, O, R, C, H – exactly A, T, O, R plus C, H.

Positions:
- A is not present here, but we know A is required.  
So TORCH is invalid (no A).

We must use A, T, O, R exactly once each.

Let me try “RATIO” – but I is out.

“CRATO” – not a word.

“ARTON” – not common.

“TORAN” – not common.

“RATON” – not common.

“CARTO” – not common.

“TORUS” – S is out.

“TORCH” – no A.

“TORAY” – Y is new, but no A.

“TORAN” – not a word.

“TORAS” – S is out.

“TORAT” – duplicate T.

“TORAH” – H is new, A is present, but A is in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), H in 5 (new).  
Check TORAH:
- Letters: T, O, R, A, H – includes A, T, O, R, H – exactly A, T, O, R plus H.
- A is in 4 (allowed)
- T is in 1 (allowed)
- O is in 2 (allowed)
- R is in 3 (allowed)
- H is new and allowed.

TORAH is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Contains A, T, O, R, H – yes.
- Excludes S, L, E, I, M – yes.
- A not in 2 or 3 – in TORAH, A is in 4 (ok).
- T not in 3 or 4 – in TORAH, T is in 1 (ok).
- O not in 5 – in TORAH, O is in 2 (ok).
- R not in 4 – in TORAH, R is in 3 (ok).
- H is new and allowed.

Thus, TORAH is a valid next guess.

Option 10: T in 5, O in 1, A in 5  
   Same as above, no common word.

Let’s try a different approach: list all possible positions and new letter.

Positions 1-5:

1 2 3 4 5
----------------
A: 4 or 5
T: 1 or 5
O: 1,2,4
R: 1,2,3,5

We need to place A, T, O, R in 1-5 with the bans.

Let’s enumerate valid placements:

- T in 1:
  - Then O must be 2 or 4.
  - A must be 4 or 5.
  - R must be 2,3,5 (but 5 is T) → 2 or 3.

  Case T in 1, O in 2:
    O T _ _ A or O T _ A _
    Need a letter in 3 or 4.
    - O T A R _ – A in 3 (banned) – no.
    - O T R A _ – A in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed) → O T R A _ → need a letter in 5 → O T R A N – not a word.  
    O T A _ R – A in 3 (banned) – no.

  Case T in 1, O in 4:
    T _ _ O A or T _ A O _ – but A must be 4 or 5, and O is 4.
    T _ A O _ – need a letter in 2 → T C A O _ – not a word.  
    T _ _ O A → T _ _ O A → need letters in 2,3 → T C R O A – not a word.  
    T R A O _ – A in 3 (banned) – no.

- T in 5:
  - Then O must be 1,2,4.
  - A must be 4 (since 5 is T).
  - R must be 1,2,3.

  Case T in 5, O in 1:
    O _ _ A T
    Need R in 2 or 3.
    - O R _ A T → need a letter in 3 → O R C A T – not a word.  
    - O _ R A T → need a letter in 2 → O C R A T – not a word.

  Case T in 5, O in 2:
    _ O _ A T
    Need R in 1 or 3.
    - R O _ A T → R O C A T – not a word.  
    - _ O R A T → need a letter in 1 → C O R A T – not a word.

  Case T in 5, O in 4:
    _ _ A O T
    Need R in 1 or 2 → R _ A O T or _ R A O T.

    R _ A O T → R C A O T – not a word.  
    _ R A O T → need a letter in 1 → C R A O T – not a word.

No common words found with these constraints.  
But we know the word must be valid and common.

Let me re-examine possible words with A, T, O, R plus one new letter, respecting bans.

Consider “CRANE” – but E is out.
“TRAIN” – I is out.
“RATIO” – I is out.

Look for a word with A, T, O, R plus one new letter in 1-5.

After scanning, a valid common word that fits:
- T in 1, O in 2, A in 4, R in 3, and a new letter in 5 → T O R A N – not a word.  
- T in 1, O in 4, A in 5, R in 2 or 3 → T _ R _ A or T _ A R _.

  T _ A R _ → T C A R _ – need a letter in 5 → T C A R N – not a word.  
  T _ R A _ → T C R A N – not a word.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words containing A, T, O, R and one new letter, then filter by bans.

Scanning word lists, a valid word is “RATIO” – but I is out.

“CRATE” – E is out.

“CARTO” – not common.

“TORAN” – not common.

“TORAS” – S is out.

“TORCH” – H is new, and letters are T, O, R, C, H.

Check TORCH:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- C is new
- H is new

Letters used: T, O, R, C, H – exactly A, T, O, R plus C, H.

Positions:
- A is not present here, but we know A is required.  
So TORCH is invalid (no A).

We must use A, T, O, R exactly once each.

Let me try “RATIO” – but I is out.

“CRATO” – not a word.

“ARTON” – not common.

“TORAN” – not common.

“RATON” – not common.

“CARTO” – not common.

“TORUS” – S is out.

“TORCH” – no A.

“TORAY” – Y is new, but no A.

“TORAN” – not a word.

“TORAS” – S is out.

“TORAT” – duplicate T.

“TORAH” – H is new, A is present, but A is in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), H in 5 (new).  
Check TORAH:
- Letters: T, O, R, A, H – includes A, T, O, R, H – exactly A, T, O, R plus H.
- A is in 4 (allowed)
- T is in 1 (allowed)
- O is in 2 (allowed)
- R is in 3 (allowed)
- H is new and allowed.

TORAH is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Contains A, T, O, R, H – yes.
- Excludes S, L, E, I, M – yes.
- A not in 2 or 3 – in TORAH, A is in 4 (ok).
- T not in 3 or 4 – in TORAH, T is in 1 (ok).
- O not in 5 – in TORAH, O is in 2 (ok).
- R not in 4 – in TORAH, R is in 3 (ok).
- H is new and allowed.

Thus, TORAH is a valid next guess.",Guess 4: TORAH -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
