### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but NOT A or R.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoids A and R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T (new letter, common).
- O moves to position 3 (was 3, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).
- N (new letter, common).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).

However, feedback says O is not in position 3, so STONE might put O back in position 3, which would be bad. 

Instead, let’s try “SOBER”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so this moves it; acceptable).
- B (new letter).
- E in position 4 (was 5, so this moves it; acceptable).
- R is already ruled out, so I need to change this.

Better choice: “SPOKE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so acceptable).
- K (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, so not acceptable – same position).

Next: “POSED”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. 

Another option: “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- U (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable – same position).

“POISE”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- I (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“MOSES”:
- M (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 and 5 (was 4, acceptable for 5 but not 3).

“SLOPE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“SNORE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SPEND”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- N (new).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s try “SPOKE” again as it’s a common word and uses P, K.

Actually, “SPOKE” might not be optimal because K is less common than N or D. 

Better: “SNOUT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SLOTH”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- T (new).
- H (new).

This looks solid. It moves O from position 3 to 2, S from 4 to 1, E is still missing but we’re testing new letters.

But we need to include E somewhere. Let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- T (new).

This is good, but let’s see if we can fit E into position 1 or 2.

“EPOSE”:
- E in position 1 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“POSED” already considered.

“SWEPT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- T (new).

This seems optimal – tests S, O, E in new positions plus new letters W, P, T.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)

- W, P, T are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, E
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E
- Does NOT contain A, R, W, P, T
- Places O, S, E in allowed positions

Let’s list possible positions for each known letter:
O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

We still need two more letters. From the remaining common letters (N, L, I, C, U, D, M, etc.), let’s pick a word that uses O, S, E plus two new letters while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate: “NOISE”
- N (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new)
- S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4 – from AROSE feedback)
So “NOISE” is invalid because of S in 4.

Candidate: “SOUND”
- S in 1 (invalid – S cannot be in 1)
So “SOUND” is invalid.

Candidate: “DPOSE”
- D (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)

- E in 5 (invalid – E cannot be in 5)

Candidate: “LONES”
- L (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This looks valid. It uses new letters L and N while placing O, S, E in allowed positions.

Another candidate: “COSES”
- C (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 and 5 (but S cannot be in 4, and 3 is allowed)
- However, COSES has S in 5 (allowed) and 3 (allowed), but it duplicates S. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but let’s assume no repeats for now.

Between LONES and COSES, LONES seems better as it introduces more new letters.

Let me check:
- LONES: L O N E S
- Positions: O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is not in 3 (OK)
- S is not in 1 or 4 (OK, it’s in 5)
- E is not in 3 or 5 (OK, it’s in 4)
- Letters used: L, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, W, P, T

Thus, LONES is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but NOT A or R.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoids A and R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T (new letter, common).
- O moves to position 3 (was 3, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).
- N (new letter, common).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).

However, feedback says O is not in position 3, so STONE might put O back in position 3, which would be bad. 

Instead, let’s try “SOBER”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so this moves it; acceptable).
- B (new letter).
- E in position 4 (was 5, so this moves it; acceptable).
- R is already ruled out, so I need to change this.

Better choice: “SPOKE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so acceptable).
- K (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, so not acceptable – same position).

Next: “POSED”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. 

Another option: “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- U (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable – same position).

“POISE”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- I (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“MOSES”:
- M (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 and 5 (was 4, acceptable for 5 but not 3).

“SLOPE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“SNORE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SPEND”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- N (new).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s try “SPOKE” again as it’s a common word and uses P, K.

Actually, “SPOKE” might not be optimal because K is less common than N or D. 

Better: “SNOUT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SLOTH”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- T (new).
- H (new).

This looks solid. It moves O from position 3 to 2, S from 4 to 1, E is still missing but we’re testing new letters.

But we need to include E somewhere. Let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- T (new).

This is good, but let’s see if we can fit E into position 1 or 2.

“EPOSE”:
- E in position 1 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“POSED” already considered.

“SWEPT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- T (new).

This seems optimal – tests S, O, E in new positions plus new letters W, P, T.

- S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4 – from AROSE feedback)

- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This looks valid. It uses new letters L and N while placing O, S, E in allowed positions.

Another candidate: “COSES”
- C (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 and 5 (but S cannot be in 4, and 3 is allowed)

From the new feedback on LONES:

- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position 2.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (so N is NOT in position 3).
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So we now know the secret word must look like:

_  O  _  E  S

with the constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T, L
- Letters confirmed in the word: O, E, S (positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so N must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already ruled out by LONES feedback, so N must be in position 1)

Thus the word must be: N  O  _  E  S

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not yet used and not in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching N O _ E S:

- NOSES – but S is already in position 5 and can’t repeat (no evidence of repeats so far).
- NOGES – not a valid word.
- NOMES – not a valid word.
- NODES – not a valid word.
- NOVES – not a valid word.
- NOXES – not a valid word.

Actually, the only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES, but that would have S in position 3 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat, but we have no evidence of repeats). However, NOSES uses S twice, which is allowed.

But let me check if there are other possibilities:

- N O C E S – NOCES is not a word.
- N O D E S – NODES is not a word.
- N O G E S – NOGES is not a word.
- N O M E S – NOMES is not a word.
- N O V E S – NOVES is not a word.

Thus the only valid word seems to be NOSES.

But let me verify NOSES:

- N O S E S
- Positions: N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 1 (matches the feedback that N is in word but not in position 3)
- S is allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)

NOSES is a valid English word (though rare, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling). However, more likely is NOXES, but that’s not a word.

Actually, the common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.

But let me think of others:

- N O D E S – no.
- N O C E S – no.
- N O G E S – no.

Thus NOSES is the only possible word.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From LONES: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 3. Position 3 is currently unknown (position 3 in LONES was N, but feedback was N(-), so N is not in position 3). Thus N could be in position 1.

From earlier, O is in position 2, E in 4, S in 5. Thus positions 1 and 3 are open.

N is confirmed in word, and cannot be in position 3 (from LONES feedback), so N must be in position 1.

Thus word must be N O _ E S.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y.

  - Letters used: N, O, S, E, S – no forbidden letters (A, R, W, P, T, L)

NOSES is valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but NOT A or R.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoids A and R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T (new letter, common).
- O moves to position 3 (was 3, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).
- N (new letter, common).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).

However, feedback says O is not in position 3, so STONE might put O back in position 3, which would be bad. 

Instead, let’s try “SOBER”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so this moves it; acceptable).
- B (new letter).
- E in position 4 (was 5, so this moves it; acceptable).
- R is already ruled out, so I need to change this.

Better choice: “SPOKE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so acceptable).
- K (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, so not acceptable – same position).

Next: “POSED”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. 

Another option: “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- U (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable – same position).

“POISE”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- I (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“MOSES”:
- M (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 and 5 (was 4, acceptable for 5 but not 3).

“SLOPE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“SNORE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SPEND”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- N (new).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s try “SPOKE” again as it’s a common word and uses P, K.

Actually, “SPOKE” might not be optimal because K is less common than N or D. 

Better: “SNOUT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SLOTH”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- T (new).
- H (new).

This looks solid. It moves O from position 3 to 2, S from 4 to 1, E is still missing but we’re testing new letters.

But we need to include E somewhere. Let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- T (new).

This is good, but let’s see if we can fit E into position 1 or 2.

“EPOSE”:
- E in position 1 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“POSED” already considered.

“SWEPT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- T (new).

This seems optimal – tests S, O, E in new positions plus new letters W, P, T.

<guess>SWEPT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
- A and R are not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: SWEPT → S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- W, P, T are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, E
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E
- Does NOT contain A, R, W, P, T
- Places O, S, E in allowed positions

Let’s list possible positions for each known letter:
O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

We still need two more letters. From the remaining common letters (N, L, I, C, U, D, M, etc.), let’s pick a word that uses O, S, E plus two new letters while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate: “NOISE”
- N (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new)
- S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4 – from AROSE feedback)
So “NOISE” is invalid because of S in 4.

Candidate: “SOUND”
- S in 1 (invalid – S cannot be in 1)
So “SOUND” is invalid.

Candidate: “DPOSE”
- D (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 (invalid – E cannot be in 5)

Candidate: “LONES”
- L (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This looks valid. It uses new letters L and N while placing O, S, E in allowed positions.

Another candidate: “COSES”
- C (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 and 5 (but S cannot be in 4, and 3 is allowed)
- However, COSES has S in 5 (allowed) and 3 (allowed), but it duplicates S. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but let’s assume no repeats for now.

Between LONES and COSES, LONES seems better as it introduces more new letters.

Let me check:
- LONES: L O N E S
- Positions: O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is not in 3 (OK)
- S is not in 1 or 4 (OK, it’s in 5)
- E is not in 3 or 5 (OK, it’s in 4)
- Letters used: L, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, W, P, T

Thus, LONES is a valid next guess.

<guess>LONES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
Guess 3: LONES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LONES:

- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position 2.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (so N is NOT in position 3).
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So we now know the secret word must look like:

_  O  _  E  S

with the constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T, L
- Letters confirmed in the word: O, E, S (positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so N must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already ruled out by LONES feedback, so N must be in position 1)

Thus the word must be: N  O  _  E  S

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not yet used and not in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching N O _ E S:

- NOSES – but S is already in position 5 and can’t repeat (no evidence of repeats so far).
- NOGES – not a valid word.
- NOMES – not a valid word.
- NODES – not a valid word.
- NOVES – not a valid word.
- NOXES – not a valid word.

Actually, the only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES, but that would have S in position 3 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat, but we have no evidence of repeats). However, NOSES uses S twice, which is allowed.

But let me check if there are other possibilities:

- N O C E S – NOCES is not a word.
- N O D E S – NODES is not a word.
- N O G E S – NOGES is not a word.
- N O M E S – NOMES is not a word.
- N O V E S – NOVES is not a word.

Thus the only valid word seems to be NOSES.

But let me verify NOSES:

- N O S E S
- Positions: N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 1 (matches the feedback that N is in word but not in position 3)
- S is allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)

NOSES is a valid English word (though rare, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling). However, more likely is NOXES, but that’s not a word.

Actually, the common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.

But let me think of others:

- N O D E S – no.
- N O C E S – no.
- N O G E S – no.

Thus NOSES is the only possible word.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From LONES: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 3. Position 3 is currently unknown (position 3 in LONES was N, but feedback was N(-), so N is not in position 3). Thus N could be in position 1.

From earlier, O is in position 2, E in 4, S in 5. Thus positions 1 and 3 are open.

N is confirmed in word, and cannot be in position 3 (from LONES feedback), so N must be in position 1.

Thus word must be N O _ E S.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y.

Looking for N O _ E S:

- N O C E S – no.
- N O D E S – no.
- N O G E S – no.
- N O M E S – no.
- N O U E S – no.
- N O V E S – no.
- N O Y E S – no.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES (N O S E S). Let me check if S can be in position 3 and 5 – there’s no feedback against it.

Thus the word must be NOSES.

But let me verify:

- NOSES:
  - N(1): allowed (N is in word, position 1)
  - O(2): matches ✓
  - S(3): allowed (S is in word, position 3)
  - E(4): matches ✓
  - S(5): matches ✓
  - Letters used: N, O, S, E, S – no forbidden letters (A, R, W, P, T, L)

NOSES is valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- O is fixed in position 2
- E is fixed in position 4
- S is fixed in position 5
- N is in the word but not in position 3, so must be in position 1
- Forbidden letters: A, R, W, P, T, L

The only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but NOT A or R.
- O is not in position 3.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in new positions.
2. Avoids A and R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “STONE”:
- S moves to position 1 (was 4).
- T (new letter, common).
- O moves to position 3 (was 3, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).
- N (new letter, common).
- E moves to position 5 (was 5, but feedback says it’s in the word but wrong position; I can try it here).

However, feedback says O is not in position 3, so STONE might put O back in position 3, which would be bad. 

Instead, let’s try “SOBER”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so this moves it; acceptable).
- B (new letter).
- E in position 4 (was 5, so this moves it; acceptable).
- R is already ruled out, so I need to change this.

Better choice: “SPOKE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, so acceptable).
- K (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, so not acceptable – same position).

Next: “POSED”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. 

Another option: “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- U (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable – same position).

“POISE”:
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- I (new).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“MOSES”:
- M (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 and 5 (was 4, acceptable for 5 but not 3).

“SLOPE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“SNORE”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SPEND”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- P (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- N (new).
- D (new).

This seems good, but let’s try “SPOKE” again as it’s a common word and uses P, K.

Actually, “SPOKE” might not be optimal because K is less common than N or D. 

Better: “SNOUT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- N (new).
- O in position 3 (was 3, not acceptable – same position).

“SLOTH”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- L (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- T (new).
- H (new).

This looks solid. It moves O from position 3 to 2, S from 4 to 1, E is still missing but we’re testing new letters.

But we need to include E somewhere. Let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- E in position 4 (was 5, acceptable).
- T (new).

This is good, but let’s see if we can fit E into position 1 or 2.

“EPOSE”:
- E in position 1 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- O in position 2 (was 3, acceptable).
- S in position 3 (was 4, acceptable).
- E in position 5 (was 5, not acceptable).

“POSED” already considered.

“SWEPT”:
- S in position 1 (was 4, acceptable).
- W (new).
- E in position 3 (was 5, acceptable).
- P (new).
- T (new).

This seems optimal – tests S, O, E in new positions plus new letters W, P, T.

<guess>SWEPT</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
- A and R are not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: SWEPT → S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- W, P, T are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, E
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
  – E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E
- Does NOT contain A, R, W, P, T
- Places O, S, E in allowed positions

Let’s list possible positions for each known letter:
O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 4

We still need two more letters. From the remaining common letters (N, L, I, C, U, D, M, etc.), let’s pick a word that uses O, S, E plus two new letters while respecting the position constraints.

Candidate: “NOISE”
- N (new)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new)
- S in position 4 (but S cannot be in 4 – from AROSE feedback)
So “NOISE” is invalid because of S in 4.

Candidate: “SOUND”
- S in 1 (invalid – S cannot be in 1)
So “SOUND” is invalid.

Candidate: “DPOSE”
- D (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 (invalid – E cannot be in 5)

Candidate: “LONES”
- L (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N (new)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

This looks valid. It uses new letters L and N while placing O, S, E in allowed positions.

Another candidate: “COSES”
- C (new)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- S in 3 and 5 (but S cannot be in 4, and 3 is allowed)
- However, COSES has S in 5 (allowed) and 3 (allowed), but it duplicates S. We don’t know if letters can repeat, but let’s assume no repeats for now.

Between LONES and COSES, LONES seems better as it introduces more new letters.

Let me check:
- LONES: L O N E S
- Positions: O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is not in 3 (OK)
- S is not in 1 or 4 (OK, it’s in 5)
- E is not in 3 or 5 (OK, it’s in 4)
- Letters used: L, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, W, P, T

Thus, LONES is a valid next guess.

<guess>LONES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
Guess 3: LONES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LONES:

- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position 2.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (so N is NOT in position 3).
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So we now know the secret word must look like:

_  O  _  E  S

with the constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T, L
- Letters confirmed in the word: O, E, S (positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so N must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already ruled out by LONES feedback, so N must be in position 1)

Thus the word must be: N  O  _  E  S

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not yet used and not in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching N O _ E S:

- NOSES – but S is already in position 5 and can’t repeat (no evidence of repeats so far).
- NOGES – not a valid word.
- NOMES – not a valid word.
- NODES – not a valid word.
- NOVES – not a valid word.
- NOXES – not a valid word.

Actually, the only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES, but that would have S in position 3 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat, but we have no evidence of repeats). However, NOSES uses S twice, which is allowed.

But let me check if there are other possibilities:

- N O C E S – NOCES is not a word.
- N O D E S – NODES is not a word.
- N O G E S – NOGES is not a word.
- N O M E S – NOMES is not a word.
- N O V E S – NOVES is not a word.

Thus the only valid word seems to be NOSES.

But let me verify NOSES:

- N O S E S
- Positions: N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5)
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 1 (matches the feedback that N is in word but not in position 3)
- S is allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)

NOSES is a valid English word (though rare, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling). However, more likely is NOXES, but that’s not a word.

Actually, the common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.

But let me think of others:

- N O D E S – no.
- N O C E S – no.
- N O G E S – no.

Thus NOSES is the only possible word.

But wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From LONES: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 3. Position 3 is currently unknown (position 3 in LONES was N, but feedback was N(-), so N is not in position 3). Thus N could be in position 1.

From earlier, O is in position 2, E in 4, S in 5. Thus positions 1 and 3 are open.

N is confirmed in word, and cannot be in position 3 (from LONES feedback), so N must be in position 1.

Thus word must be N O _ E S.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y.

Looking for N O _ E S:

- N O C E S – no.
- N O D E S – no.
- N O G E S – no.
- N O M E S – no.
- N O U E S – no.
- N O V E S – no.
- N O Y E S – no.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES (N O S E S). Let me check if S can be in position 3 and 5 – there’s no feedback against it.

Thus the word must be NOSES.

But let me verify:

- NOSES:
  - N(1): allowed (N is in word, position 1)
  - O(2): matches ✓
  - S(3): allowed (S is in word, position 3)
  - E(4): matches ✓
  - S(5): matches ✓
  - Letters used: N, O, S, E, S – no forbidden letters (A, R, W, P, T, L)

NOSES is valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- O is fixed in position 2
- E is fixed in position 4
- S is fixed in position 5
- N is in the word but not in position 3, so must be in position 1
- Forbidden letters: A, R, W, P, T, L

The only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.

<guess>NOSES</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)
Guess 3: LONES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on NOSES:

- N(✓) – N is in position 1 and correct.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 and correct.
- S(-) – S is in the word but wrong position.  In NOSES, S is in position 3, so S is NOT in position 3.  
  Therefore S must be in position 5 (already confirmed ✓), which confirms S is only in position 5.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 and correct.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

So the word is now fully determined except for position 3, and we know it must be:

N  O  _  E  S

with the blank in position 3.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, W, P, T, L  
We have not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words matching N O _ E S:

- N O C E S → NOCES (not valid)
- N O D E S → NODES (not valid)
- N O G E S → NOGES (not valid)
- N O K E S → NOKES (not valid)
- N O M E S → NOMES (not valid)
- N O U E S → NOUES (not valid)
- N O V E S → NOVES (not valid)
- N O X E S → NOXES (not valid)
- N O Y E S → NOYES (not valid)

The only valid English word fitting N O _ E S is “NOSES”.  
Let me check if the duplicate S is allowed; there’s no feedback against it.

Therefore the word must be NOSES.

We don’t know if letters can repeat, but let’s assume no repeats for now.\n\nBetween LONES and COSES, LONES seems better as it introduces more new letters.\n\nLet me check:\n- LONES: L O N E S\n- Positions: O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5)\n- O is not in 3 (OK)\n- S is not in 1 or 4 (OK, it’s in 5)\n- E is not in 3 or 5 (OK, it’s in 4)\n- Letters used: L, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, W, P, T\n\nThus, LONES is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>LONES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: LONES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on LONES:\n\n- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.\n- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position 2.\n- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (so N is NOT in position 3).\n- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position 4.\n- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position 5.\n\nSo we now know the secret word must look like:\n\n_  O  _  E  S\n\nwith the constraints:\n- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, W, P, T, L\n- Letters confirmed in the word: O, E, S (positions 2, 4, 5 respectively)\n- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so N must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is already ruled out by LONES feedback, so N must be in position 1)\n\nThus the word must be: N  O  _  E  S\n\nThe missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not yet used and not in the forbidden list. Common remaining letters: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y, etc.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words matching N O _ E S:\n\n- NOSES – but S is already in position 5 and can’t repeat (no evidence of repeats so far).\n- NOGES – not a valid word.\n- NOMES – not a valid word.\n- NODES – not a valid word.\n- NOVES – not a valid word.\n- NOXES – not a valid word.\n\nActually, the only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES, but that would have S in position 3 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat, but we have no evidence of repeats). However, NOSES uses S twice, which is allowed.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities:\n\n- N O C E S – NOCES is not a word.\n- N O D E S – NODES is not a word.\n- N O G E S – NOGES is not a word.\n- N O M E S – NOMES is not a word.\n- N O V E S – NOVES is not a word.\n\nThus the only valid word seems to be NOSES.\n\nBut let me verify NOSES:\n\n- N O S E S\n- Positions: N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5)\n- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)\n- E is in position 4 (matches ✓)\n- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)\n- N is in position 1 (matches the feedback that N is in word but not in position 3)\n- S is allowed to repeat (no feedback against it)\n\nNOSES is a valid English word (though rare, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling). However, more likely is NOXES, but that’s not a word.\n\nActually, the common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.\n\nBut let me think of others:\n\n- N O D E S – no.\n- N O C E S – no.\n- N O G E S – no.\n\nThus NOSES is the only possible word.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nFrom LONES: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 3. Position 3 is currently unknown (position 3 in LONES was N, but feedback was N(-), so N is not in position 3). Thus N could be in position 1.\n\nFrom earlier, O is in position 2, E in 4, S in 5. Thus positions 1 and 3 are open.\n\nN is confirmed in word, and cannot be in position 3 (from LONES feedback), so N must be in position 1.\n\nThus word must be N O _ E S.\n\nThe missing letter (position 3) must be a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, G, M, U, V, Y.\n\nLooking for N O _ E S:\n\n- N O C E S – no.\n- N O D E S – no.\n- N O G E S – no.\n- N O M E S – no.\n- N O U E S – no.\n- N O V E S – no.\n- N O Y E S – no.\n\nActually, the only valid English word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES (N O S E S). Let me check if S can be in position 3 and 5 – there’s no feedback against it.\n\nThus the word must be NOSES.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\n- NOSES:\n  - N(1): allowed (N is in word, position 1)\n  - O(2): matches ✓\n  - S(3): allowed (S is in word, position 3)\n  - E(4): matches ✓\n  - S(5): matches ✓\n  - Letters used: N, O, S, E, S – no forbidden letters (A, R, W, P, T, L)\n\nNOSES is valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:\n- O is fixed in position 2\n- E is fixed in position 4\n- S is fixed in position 5\n- N is in the word but not in position 3, so must be in position 1\n- Forbidden letters: A, R, W, P, T, L\n\nThe only common word fitting N O _ E S is NOSES.\n\n<guess>NOSES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: SWEPT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) W(x) E(-) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: LONES -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the latest feedback on NOSES:\n\n- N(✓) – N is in position 1 and correct.\n- O(✓) – O is in position 2 and correct.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but wrong position.

From the feedback on NOSES:

- N(✓) – position 1 correct
- O(✓) – position 2 correct
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so S must be in position 5, which is already confirmed ✓)
- E(✓) – position 4 correct
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

Thus the word is exactly N O _ E S with the blank in position 3.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, W, P, T, L, and also S is already placed at 5 so a second S in position 3 would be redundant.

Looking at the remaining common consonants for position 3 that have not been ruled out:

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, Y, Z (excluding the already excluded ones).

The only common English word that fits N O _ E S is:

N O C E S → NOCES (invalid)
N O D E S → NODES (invalid)
N O G E S → NOGES (invalid)
N O K E S → NOKES (invalid)
N O M E S → NOMES (invalid)
N O U E S → NOUES (invalid)
N O V E S → NOVES (invalid)
N O X E S → NOXES (invalid)
N O Y E S → NOYES (invalid)

The only valid word is **NOSES**.  
We have no reason to doubt that S appears twice; the feedback has never ruled out double letters.

Therefore the word is NOSES.
