1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid).
- Uses I and U as vowels (since A, O, E are out).
- Uses T and N as common consonants.
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S, U, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, U, M.

Let’s try to place the letters:
S must be in 3 or 5.

A promising arrangement is:
Position 1: M

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid).
- Uses I and U as vowels (since A, O, E are out).
- Uses T and N as common consonants.
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G  (8 letters already eliminated)

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions so far:
S  (it cannot be in positions 1 or 4)

So the secret word:
- Must contain S.
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- Must avoid A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left that hasn’t been tried).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses S in a new position (2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses only untested letters.
3. Is still a common 5-letter word.

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- L, U, M, P are all untested letters.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G) are used.

Since M must be in the word but cannot be in position 1, the only remaining positions for M are 4 or 5. Position 4 is already filled by U in position 2, so M must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is taken by U in the previous structure, so M must be in position 5.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters in the word. Another option is ""SLATE"" which covers different letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong next guess would be ""STING"":
- Contains S in position 1 (not position 4, so valid).
- Uses I and U as vowels (since A, O, E are out).
- Uses T and N as common consonants.
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G  (8 letters already eliminated)

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions so far:
S  (it cannot be in positions 1 or 4)

So the secret word:
- Must contain S.
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- Must avoid A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left that hasn’t been tried).

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses S in a new position (2, 3, or 5).
2. Uses only untested letters.
3. Is still a common 5-letter word.

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- L, U, M, P are all untested letters.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G) are used.

Guess 3: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) U(-) M(-) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current information:

Letters known NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P

Letters known TO be in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
S (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4)
U (cannot be in position 3)
M (cannot be in position 4)

So the secret word:
- Contains S, U, M.
- S must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are ruled out).
- U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out).
- M must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out).

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S, U, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, U, M.
- Places them in allowed positions.
- Uses only untested letters for the remaining slots.

Let’s try to place the letters:
S must be in 3 or 5.
U must be in 1,2,4,5.
M must be in 1,2,3,5.

A promising arrangement is:
Position 1: M
Position 2: U
Position 3: S
Position 4: (need a letter not yet used)
Position 5: (need a letter not yet used)

Good candidates for positions 4 and 5: B, C, D, F, H, K, V, W, Y.

Let’s try M U S _ _ . We need two more letters. A common ending could be ""MUSKY"" or ""MUSIC"", but C and K are still available. Let’s try MUSKY:
- M (allowed), U (allowed), S (allowed), K (new), Y (new).
- Check letters: M, U, S, K, Y – none are in the forbidden list.

This seems valid. Let’s go with MUSKY.

Guess 4: MUSKY -> FEEDBACK: M(-) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on MUSKY:
- M is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- U is in the word and is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in the word and is in position 3 (✓)
- K and Y are not in the word (x)

So far we know the secret word looks like:
_ U S _ _

Letters known to be in the word (and their positions):
- U is fixed at position 2
- S is fixed at position 3

Letters known to be in the word but not yet positioned:
- M is in the word but cannot be in position 1

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K, Y

Available letters for positions 1 and 5 (must avoid the above list):
B, C, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus M (but M cannot be in position 1)

Since M must be in the word but cannot be in position 1, the only remaining positions for M are 4 or 5. Position 4 is already filled by U in position 2, so M must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is taken by U in the previous structure, so M must be in position 5.

Thus the word structure is:
_ U S M _

Now we just need a letter for position 1. Available letters (not yet ruled out and not yet used):
B, C, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a common 5-letter word ending in USM_. Let’s think of words like:
- BUSH (but H is available, B is available)
- DUSKY (but K and Y are already ruled out)
- FUSIL (but I is ruled out)
- HUSKS (but K is ruled out)
- JUSLE (but E is ruled out)
- VUSLM (not a word)
- WUSHM (not a word)
- FUSSM (not a word)

Looking at common English words, ""BUSH"" comes to mind:
- B is available (not ruled out)
- U is in position 2 (correct)
- S is in position 3 (correct)
- M is in position 4 (correct)
- H is available (not ruled out)

""BUSH"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern _USM_ with H in position 5. Let’s check letters: B, U, S, M, H – none are in the forbidden list.

This seems like the best next guess.

Actually, the only remaining valid 5-letter word I can find that fits the pattern is “FUSSM” (but that’s not a standard word).  

Let me double-check:

- GUSMS – G is already out

It appears I’ve exhausted all obvious 5-letter words fitting _ U S M _.  
However, there’s one more: “CUSMS” isn’t valid, but “CUSKS” exists (a variant spelling of “cush”).  

Let me verify:  
- C is available  
- U in position 2 ✓  
- S in position 3 ✓  
- M in position 4 ✓  
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S can appear again)  

“CUSH” is a valid 5-letter word, and C, U, S, M are all allowed by the constraints.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is CUSH.
