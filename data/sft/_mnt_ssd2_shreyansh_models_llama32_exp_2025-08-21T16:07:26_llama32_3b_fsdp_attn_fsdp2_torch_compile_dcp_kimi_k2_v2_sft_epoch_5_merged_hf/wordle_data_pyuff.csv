1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced starter word using several of these is “CHORD”.  
- C, H, R, D are all high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  
- O is the only vowel left from the A/E pair that was rejected.  
So “CHORD” gives us a clean set of new letters to test.

Both previous guesses (SLATE and CHORD) used 10 distinct letters and every one of them was marked “x,” so we now know the secret word contains none of:

That leaves the following available letters:

Vowels: I U  
Consonants: B F G J K M N P Q V W X Y Z  

Looking for a 5-letter word that uses five of these remaining letters and no repeats, a good candidate is “MINKY”.

- M, I, N, K, Y are all still possible.  
- It mixes vowel (I) with several common consonants (M, N, K, Y).  
- It has no duplicate letters, maximizing the information we get from the feedback.

So “MINKY” is the best next exploratory guess.

So far we have eliminated:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, I, N, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown):  
Y (because it was marked “-” in MINKY, i.e., letter exists but is not in position 5)

Therefore the secret word contains at least one Y and no other letters from the remaining pool:

Remaining available letters:  
B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  (plus the known-in-word Y)

We need a 5-letter word that uses Y plus four other distinct letters from the remaining set.  
A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit this pattern gives:

- JUMPY – uses J, U, M, P, Y (but M is already ruled out).  
- BUMPY – uses B, U, M, P, Y (M out).  
- GUMPY – same M problem.  
- VUGGY – uses V, U, G, G, Y (but we don’t know if double-G is allowed or helpful).  
- PUFFY – P, U, F, F, Y – again double-F may not be optimal.

A cleaner choice is “JUMPY” if we can use it, but since M is out, the next best is probably “BUMPY” if B, U, P, Y are allowed.  
However, B has not been tested yet, so let’s try it.

But wait: B, U, P, Y are all still legal, and we have no information about B, U, P.  
So “BUMPY” is a valid next test.

But to maximize new letter coverage, “GUMPY” (G, U, M, P, Y) would be bad because M is out.  
“JUMPY” is also bad because M is out.  
“PUFFY” has double F, which is fine, but we’d prefer to test more distinct consonants.

Actually, the cleanest choice is “BUMPY” as it introduces B, U, P, Y (all still legal).  
But let me double-check: B, U, P, Y are all still possible, so “BUMPY” is valid.

However, to get more distinct consonant coverage, “GUMPY” is invalid (M out).  
“FUGGY” uses F, U, G, G, Y – but we don’t know about F or G yet.

I think “BUMPY” is the best next exploratory guess among the valid options.

But wait, let me check if there’s a better word:  
“JUMPY” – J, U, M, P, Y – M is out.  
“VUGGY” – V, U, G, G, Y – uses V, U, G, which are all still possible.  
“VUGGY” seems better as it tests V, U, G, Y.

So I’ll go with “VUGGY”.

But let me double-check:  
- V is still allowed.  
- U is still allowed.  
- G is still allowed.  
- Y is known to be in the word.  
- No duplicate letters.

Yes, “VUGGY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used yet.  
Good candidates among the remaining common letters are: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced starter word using several of these is “CHORD”.  
- C, H, R, D are all high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  
- O is the only vowel left from the A/E pair that was rejected.  
So “CHORD” gives us a clean set of new letters to test.

Guess 2: CHORD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Both previous guesses (SLATE and CHORD) used 10 distinct letters and every one of them was marked “x,” so we now know the secret word contains none of:

S L A T E C H O R D

That leaves the following available letters:

Vowels: I U  
Consonants: B F G J K M N P Q V W X Y Z  

Looking for a 5-letter word that uses five of these remaining letters and no repeats, a good candidate is “MINKY”.

- M, I, N, K, Y are all still possible.  
- It mixes vowel (I) with several common consonants (M, N, K, Y).  
- It has no duplicate letters, maximizing the information we get from the feedback.

So “MINKY” is the best next exploratory guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHORD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Both previous guesses (SLATE and CHORD) used 10 distinct letters and every one of them was marked “x,” so we now know the secret word contains none of:

S L A T E C H O R D

That leaves the following available letters:

Vowels: I U  
Consonants: B F G J K M N P Q V W X Y Z  

Looking for a 5-letter word that uses five of these remaining letters and no repeats, a good candidate is “MINKY”.

- M, I, N, K, Y are all still possible.  
- It mixes vowel (I) with several common consonants (M, N, K, Y).  
- It has no duplicate letters, maximizing the information we get from the feedback.

So “MINKY” is the best next exploratory guess.

Guess 3: MINKY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(x) K(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we have eliminated:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, I, N, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown):  
Y (because it was marked “-” in MINKY, i.e., letter exists but is not in position 5)

Therefore the secret word contains at least one Y and no other letters from the remaining pool:

Remaining available letters:  
B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  (plus the known-in-word Y)

We need a 5-letter word that uses Y plus four other distinct letters from the remaining set.  
A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit this pattern gives:

- JUMPY – uses J, U, M, P, Y (but M is already ruled out).  
- BUMPY – uses B, U, M, P, Y (M out).  
- GUMPY – same M problem.  
- VUGGY – uses V, U, G, G, Y (but we don’t know if double-G is allowed or helpful).  
- PUFFY – P, U, F, F, Y – again double-F may not be optimal.

A cleaner choice is “JUMPY” if we can use it, but since M is out, the next best is probably “BUMPY” if B, U, P, Y are allowed.  
However, B has not been tested yet, so let’s try it.

But wait: B, U, P, Y are all still legal, and we have no information about B, U, P.  
So “BUMPY” is a valid next test.

But to maximize new letter coverage, “GUMPY” (G, U, M, P, Y) would be bad because M is out.  
“JUMPY” is also bad because M is out.  
“PUFFY” has double F, which is fine, but we’d prefer to test more distinct consonants.

Actually, the cleanest choice is “BUMPY” as it introduces B, U, P, Y (all still legal).  
But let me double-check: B, U, P, Y are all still possible, so “BUMPY” is valid.

However, to get more distinct consonant coverage, “GUMPY” is invalid (M out).  
“FUGGY” uses F, U, G, G, Y – but we don’t know about F or G yet.

I think “BUMPY” is the best next exploratory guess among the valid options.

But wait, let me check if there’s a better word:  
“JUMPY” – J, U, M, P, Y – M is out.  
“VUGGY” – V, U, G, G, Y – uses V, U, G, which are all still possible.  
“VUGGY” seems better as it tests V, U, G, Y.

So I’ll go with “VUGGY”.

But let me double-check:  
- V is still allowed.  
- U is still allowed.  
- G is still allowed.  
- Y is known to be in the word.  
- No duplicate letters.

Yes, “VUGGY” is a valid next guess.

Current state:
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, I, N, K, V, G  
  (from all “x” feedback)
- Letters known TO be in the word (but positions unknown):  
  Y (from MINKY and VUGGY)  
  U (from VUGGY, because it was marked “-”)

So the secret word contains at least one Y and at least one U, and no other letters from the remaining pool:

Remaining letters: B, F, J, P, Q, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses Y and U plus three other distinct letters from B, F, J, P, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for common patterns:
- “JUMPY” – J, U, M, P, Y → M is already out.
- “BUMPY” – B, U, M, P, Y → M is out.
- “PUFFY” – P, U, F, F, Y → double F is acceptable, but we’d prefer to test more distinct consonants.
- “FUGGY” – F, U, G, G, Y → G is out.
- “BUMPY” – same M problem.
- “JUMPY” – same M problem.
- “PUFFY” – uses P, U, F, F, Y. Since F is still allowed, this is acceptable.

But let’s try to use more distinct consonants:  
“BUMPY” is invalid (M out).  
“FUGGY” is invalid (G out).  
“JUMPY” invalid (M out).  
“PUFFY” uses P, F (twice), Y – but F is still allowed.

Actually, “PUFFY” is the only common word left that fits the constraints (P, U, F, F, Y) and uses only still-possible letters.

So I’ll go with “PUFFY”.

From the latest feedback on PUFFY:

P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct first position.  
U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.  
F(-) – F is in the word but not in position 3.  
F(✓) – F is in the word and in the correct fourth position.  
Y(-) – Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

- Word pattern: P _ _ F _
- Must contain: P, F (already placed), U, Y
- Must NOT contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, I, N, K, V, G
- U cannot be in position 2
- Y cannot be in position 5

Remaining letters that can still appear: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

We need to place U and Y (and one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z) into positions 2, 3, 5 while respecting the constraints.

Possible letters for position 3 (must be from B, J, Q, W, X, Z):
- Can’t be U (because U can’t be in position 2, and position 3 is allowed)  
- Can’t be Y (because Y can’t be in position 5, and position 3 is allowed)

So position 3 can be any of B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We need to place U and Y in positions 2 and 5 (since position 2 is disallowed for U, and position 5 is disallowed for Y).

So the two unknown letters are positions 2 and 5, with:
- Position 2 must be U (because Y must go in position 5)
- Position 5 must be Y (because U must go in position 2)

But wait, that would put U in position 2, which is disallowed.

Therefore, U must go in position 3, and Y must go in position 5.

So the word structure is: P _ U F Y

Now we just need a letter for position 2 from the remaining allowed letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for common English words matching P _ U F Y:

- P B U F Y – not a word  
- P J U F Y – not a word  
- P Q U F Y – not a word  
- P W U F Y – not a word  
- P X U F Y – not a word  
- P Z U F Y – not a word  

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Let me re-examine:

From the feedback:
- P is correct in position 1
- F is correct in position 4
- U is in the word but not in position 2
- Y is in the word but not in position 5
- We already have P and F fixed in positions 1 and 4

So the word is P _ _ F _ with U and Y somewhere in positions 2,3,5.

But U can’t be in position 2, and Y can’t be in position 5.

So:
- If U is in position 3, then Y must be in position 5, but then the word would be P _ U F Y. As noted, no such English word exists.
- If U is in position 5, then Y must be in position 2 or 3. But position 5 is already U, so Y would have to be in position 2 or 3.

Looking at P Y _ F U or P _ Y F U

Possible words:
- PYGMY – but M is out
- PYXID – but I and D are out
- PYGMY – M out
- PYXID – I, D out

Looking back at the remaining letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- P B Y F U – no such word
- P J Y F U – no such word
- P W Y F U – no such word
- P X Y F U – no such word
- P Z Y F U – no such word

This suggests that my assumption that all five letters must be used may be impossible with the remaining letters. However, we know the word must contain P, F, U, Y. With P and F fixed, the remaining letters are B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

So the word must be P _ _ F _ with U and Y in positions 2,3,5, but respecting the constraints.

Let me list all possible permutations of P, U, Y in positions 2,3,5 with the remaining letters:

Positions:
1: P
2: can be U or Y
3: can be U or Y
4: F
5: can be U or Y, but U can't be here (because U can't be in position 2, and position 5 is allowed for U, but we have no info)

Wait, let me re-express the constraints properly:

Word structure: P _ _ F _

Letters to place: U, Y, plus one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Constraints:
- U cannot be in position 2
- Y cannot be in position 5
- Positions 2,3,5 must use U and Y plus one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Let’s enumerate:

Case 1: U in position 3
Then word is P _ U F _
Y must go in position 2 or 5.
- If Y=2: P Y U F _ → need a letter for position 5 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. No valid English word.
- If Y=5: P _ U F Y → need a letter for position 2 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P B U F Y – but that’s not a word. P J U F Y – no. P W U F Y – no. P X U F Y – no. P Z U F Y – no.

Case 2: U in position 5
Then word is P _ _ F U
Y must go in position 2 or 3.
- If Y=2: P Y _ F U → need a letter for position 3 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P Y B F U – no. P Y J F U – no. P Y W F U – no. P Y X F U – no. P Y Z F U – no.
- If Y=3: P _ Y F U → need a letter for position 2 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P B Y F U – no. P J Y F U – no. P W Y F U – no. P X Y F U – no. P Z Y F U – no.

This seems impossible with the remaining letters. But we know the word must contain P, F, U, Y. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Looking back at the feedback for PUFFY:
- P(✓) – correct in position 1
- U(-) – in word but not in position 2
- F(-) – in word but not in position 3
- F(✓) – correct in position 4
- Y(-) – in word but not in position 5

So the word contains P, F, U, Y and must have F in position 4.

Structure: P _ _ F _

With U and Y needing to go in positions 2,3,5 (but respecting the Y≠5 and U≠2 constraints).

Let me try a different approach: list all valid English words matching P _ _ F _ that contain U and Y and use only letters from the allowed set.

Valid words fitting P _ _ F _:
- PUFFY – already tried, M, I, N, K, S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D are out
- PYGMY – M out
- PYXID – I, D out
- PUGGY – G out
- PIVOT – O, T out
- PABUL – L out
- PABBY – B twice, but B is allowed
- PABUL – L out
- PABBY – B twice, but let’s see: P A B B L – but L is out. Wait, P A B B Y – but Y is in position 5 which is disallowed.

Looking at remaining letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word P _ _ F _ with U and Y in positions 2,3,5.

Let’s try:
- P B U F Y – no such word
- P B Y F U – no such word
- P J U F Y – no
- P J Y F U – no
- P W U F Y – no
- P W Y F U – no
- P X U F Y – no
- P X Y F U – no
- P Z U F Y – no
- P Z Y F U – no

This is problematic. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps the word is P Y _ F U (Y in 2, then U in 5). Then position 3 must be from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for PY _ F U:
- PYGMY – G out
- PYXID – I out
- PYBB – B twice, but B is allowed
- PYBFF – F twice, but F is already in position 4
- PYBFF – but position 3 would be B, position 5 would be F, but we need F in position 4. So PYBFF would be P Y B F F – but this has F in position 4 and 5, but position 5 is U, which is allowed (U can be in position 5). But PYBFF is a valid word.

Let me check if PYBFF uses only allowed letters:
P, Y, B, F, F
- P is allowed (position 1 confirmed)
- Y is allowed (must be in word)
- B is allowed (still legal)
- F is allowed (position 4 confirmed)
- F is allowed (position 5)
- No letters from the banned set are used.

Thus, PYBFF is a valid next guess.

But wait, let me check if there’s a simpler word. Let me try P Y U F _ – but then we need a letter for position 5 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. No valid word fits.

Thus, PYBFF seems the only plausible remaining word that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check: is there any other word?  
- P B U F Y – no  
- P W U F Y – no  
- P X U F Y – no  
- P Z U F Y – no  

All these are invalid. Therefore, PYBFF is the correct next guess.

However, let me think again: perhaps P B Y F U – but that’s not a word.  

Upon reflection, PYBFF appears to be the only valid English word left that fits all constraints. Therefore, I will proceed with that.

But wait, let me check one more thing: is there a word P _ _ F _ with U and Y somewhere else?

Looking at P _ _ F _ with U and Y:

Possible word: P B Y F U – no  
P W Y F U – no  
P X Y F U – no  
P Z Y F U – no  

This suggests PYBFF is the only possible combination. However, I want to make sure I didn’t miss a word.

After careful consideration, PYBFF seems the only valid next guess.

But let me think of another: P Y _ F U  
The only valid word fitting this is PYGMY – but G is out.

Similarly, P W _ F U – no  
P X _ F U – no  
P Z _ F U – no  

This is extremely restrictive. Let me try PYBFF.

Thus, the next guess is PYBFF.

After eliminating all previously tested letters, the only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is:

P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct first position.  
U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 2.  
F(-) – F is in the word but not in position 3.  
F(✓) – F is in the word and in the correct fourth position.  
Y(-) – Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

- Word pattern: P _ _ F _
- Must contain: P, F (already placed), U, Y
- Must NOT contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, I, N, K, V, G
- U cannot be in position 2
- Y cannot be in position 5

Remaining letters that can still appear: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

We need to place U and Y (and one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z) into positions 2, 3, 5 while respecting the constraints.

Possible letters for position 3 (must be from B, J, Q, W, X, Z):
- Can’t be U (because U can’t be in position 2, and position 3 is allowed)  
- Can’t be Y (because Y can’t be in position 5, and position 3 is allowed)

So position 3 can be any of B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We need to place U and Y in positions 2 and 5 (since position 2 is disallowed for U, and position 5 is disallowed for Y).

So the two unknown letters are positions 2 and 5, with:
- Position 2 must be U (because Y must go in position 5)
- Position 5 must be Y (because U must go in position 2)

But wait, that would put U in position 2, which is disallowed.

Therefore, U must go in position 3, and Y must go in position 5.

So the word structure is: P _ U F Y

Now we just need a letter for position 2 from the remaining allowed letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for common English words matching P _ U F Y:

- P B U F Y – not a word  
- P J U F Y – not a word  
- P Q U F Y – not a word  
- P W U F Y – not a word  
- P X U F Y – not a word  
- P Z U F Y – not a word  

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Let me re-examine:

From the feedback:
- P is correct in position 1
- F is correct in position 4
- U is in the word but not in position 2
- Y is in the word but not in position 5
- We already have P and F fixed in positions 1 and 4

So the word is P _ _ F _ with U and Y somewhere in positions 2,3,5.

But U can’t be in position 2, and Y can’t be in position 5.

So:
- If U is in position 3, then Y must be in position 5, but then the word would be P _ U F Y. As noted, no such English word exists.
- If U is in position 5, then Y must be in position 2 or 3. But position 5 is already U, so Y would have to be in position 2 or 3.

Looking at P Y _ F U or P _ Y F U

Possible words:
- PYGMY – but M is out
- PYXID – but I and D are out
- PYGMY – M out
- PYXID – I, D out

Looking back at the remaining letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- P B Y F U – no such word
- P J Y F U – no such word
- P W Y F U – no such word
- P X Y F U – no such word
- P Z Y F U – no such word

This suggests that my assumption that all five letters must be used may be impossible with the remaining letters. However, we know the word must contain P, F, U, Y. With P and F fixed, the remaining letters are B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

So the word must be P _ _ F _ with U and Y in positions 2,3,5, but respecting the constraints.

Let me list all possible permutations of P, U, Y in positions 2,3,5 with the remaining letters:

Positions:
1: P
2: can be U or Y
3: can be U or Y
4: F
5: can be U or Y, but U can't be here (because U can't be in position 2, and position 5 is allowed for U, but we have no info)

Wait, let me re-express the constraints properly:

Word structure: P _ _ F _

Letters to place: U, Y, plus one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Constraints:
- U cannot be in position 2
- Y cannot be in position 5
- Positions 2,3,5 must use U and Y plus one more letter from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Let’s enumerate:

Case 1: U in position 3
Then word is P _ U F _
Y must go in position 2 or 5.
- If Y=2: P Y U F _ → need a letter for position 5 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. No valid English word.
- If Y=5: P _ U F Y → need a letter for position 2 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P B U F Y – but that’s not a word. P J U F Y – no. P W U F Y – no. P X U F Y – no. P Z U F Y – no.

Case 2: U in position 5
Then word is P _ _ F U
Y must go in position 2 or 3.
- If Y=2: P Y _ F U → need a letter for position 3 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P Y B F U – no. P Y J F U – no. P Y W F U – no. P Y X F U – no. P Y Z F U – no.
- If Y=3: P _ Y F U → need a letter for position 2 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. The only valid word is P B Y F U – no. P J Y F U – no. P W Y F U – no. P X Y F U – no. P Z Y F U – no.

This seems impossible with the remaining letters. But we know the word must contain P, F, U, Y. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

Looking back at the feedback for PUFFY:
- P(✓) – correct in position 1
- U(-) – in word but not in position 2
- F(-) – in word but not in position 3
- F(✓) – correct in position 4
- Y(-) – in word but not in position 5

So the word contains P, F, U, Y and must have F in position 4.

Structure: P _ _ F _

With U and Y needing to go in positions 2,3,5 (but respecting the Y≠5 and U≠2 constraints).

Let me try a different approach: list all valid English words matching P _ _ F _ that contain U and Y and use only letters from the allowed set.

Valid words fitting P _ _ F _:
- PUFFY – already tried, M, I, N, K, S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D are out
- PYGMY – M out
- PYXID – I, D out
- PUGGY – G out
- PIVOT – O, T out
- PABUL – L out
- PABBY – B twice, but B is allowed
- PABUL – L out
- PABBY – B twice, but let’s see: P A B B L – but L is out. Wait, P A B B Y – but Y is in position 5 which is disallowed.

Looking at remaining letters: B, J, Q, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word P _ _ F _ with U and Y in positions 2,3,5.

Let’s try:
- P B U F Y – no such word
- P B Y F U – no such word
- P J U F Y – no
- P J Y F U – no
- P W U F Y – no
- P W Y F U – no
- P X U F Y – no
- P X Y F U – no
- P Z U F Y – no
- P Z Y F U – no

This is problematic. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps the word is P Y _ F U (Y in 2, then U in 5). Then position 3 must be from B, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for PY _ F U:
- PYGMY – G out
- PYXID – I out
- PYBB – B twice, but B is allowed
- PYBFF – F twice, but F is already in position 4
- PYBFF – but position 3 would be B, position 5 would be F, but we need F in position 4. So PYBFF would be P Y B F F – but this has F in position 4 and 5, but position 5 is U, which is allowed (U can be in position 5). But PYBFF is a valid word.

Let me check if PYBFF uses only allowed letters:
P, Y, B, F, F
- P is allowed (position 1 confirmed)
- Y is allowed (must be in word)
- B is allowed (still legal)
- F is allowed (position 4 confirmed)
- F is allowed (position 5)
- No letters from the banned set are used.

Thus, PYBFF is a valid next guess.

But wait, let me check if there’s a simpler word. Let me try P Y U F _ – but then we need a letter for position 5 from B, J, Q, W, X, Z. No valid word fits.

Thus, PYBFF seems the only plausible remaining word that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check: is there any other word?  
- P B U F Y – no  
- P W U F Y – no  
- P X U F Y – no  
- P Z U F Y – no  

All these are invalid. Therefore, PYBFF is the correct next guess.

However, let me think again: perhaps P B Y F U – but that’s not a word.  

Upon reflection, PYBFF appears to be the only valid English word left that fits all constraints. Therefore, I will proceed with that.

But wait, let me check one more thing: is there a word P _ _ F _ with U and Y somewhere else?

Looking at P _ _ F _ with U and Y:

Possible word: P B Y F U – no  
P W Y F U – no  
P X Y F U – no  
P Z Y F U – no  

This suggests PYBFF is the only possible combination. However, I want to make sure I didn’t miss a word.

After careful consideration, PYBFF seems the only valid next guess.

But let me think of another: P Y _ F U  
The only valid word fitting this is PYGMY – but G is out.

Similarly, P W _ F U – no  
P X _ F U – no  
P Z _ F U – no  

This is extremely restrictive. Let me try PYBFF.

Thus, the next guess is PYBFF.After eliminating all previously tested letters, the only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is:",Guess 6: PYBFF -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) Y(✓) B(x) F(✓) F(✓),FAIL
