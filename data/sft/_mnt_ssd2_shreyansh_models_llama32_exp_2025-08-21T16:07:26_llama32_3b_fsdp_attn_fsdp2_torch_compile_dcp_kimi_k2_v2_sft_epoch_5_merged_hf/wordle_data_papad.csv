For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate:
- T is a common consonant not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (different from first guess).
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- N is a common consonant not yet tested.
- T is repeated to test it twice efficiently.

However, ""TAINT"" uses T twice - to maximize information, we can try a word with more distinct letters. ""PLANT"" is another good option:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2.

But ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good. To test more vowels, ""FAINT"" could work:
- F is common, A is in position 2, I is a new vowel, N and T are common.

Actually, let's try ""PLANT"" as it tests more consonants and keeps A in a new position.

Wait - ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is good. But let me think of a word that tests more distinct letters. ""CHALK"" is good but uses K which is less common. ""BLAND"" is good but uses B,L,N,D.

""PLANT"" seems solid - P, L, N, T are all common and not yet ruled out, and A is in position 2.

But to maximize information, let's try ""SLANT"":
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

""CLAMP"":
- C, L, M, P are good, A is in position 2.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, N, D are good, A is in position 2.

""BLAND"" is good too.

I think ""PLANT"" is a strong choice as it tests P, L, N, T, and keeps A in position 2.

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far: A (wrong at pos 1), P (wrong at pos 5)
- So the word contains A and P, but:
  – A is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and CLAMP)
  – P is not in position 4 or 5 (from CLAMP)
- Therefore:
  – A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
  – P must be in position 1, 2, or 3
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, 5)
2. Place P in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 3)
3. Introduce as many new common letters as possible
4. Avoid any ruled-out letters (R, O, S, E, C, L, M)

Let’s try “APHID”:
- A is in position 2 – but we know A can’t be in position 2 (from CLAMP feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “PAINT”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 – but A can’t be in position 2. Invalid.

- A is in position 2 – invalid as above.

Try “PANIC” – C is ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate:
- T is a common consonant not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (different from first guess).
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- N is a common consonant not yet tested.
- T is repeated to test it twice efficiently.

However, ""TAINT"" uses T twice - to maximize information, we can try a word with more distinct letters. ""PLANT"" is another good option:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2.

But ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good. To test more vowels, ""FAINT"" could work:
- F is common, A is in position 2, I is a new vowel, N and T are common.

Actually, let's try ""PLANT"" as it tests more consonants and keeps A in a new position.

Wait - ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is good. But let me think of a word that tests more distinct letters. ""CHALK"" is good but uses K which is less common. ""BLAND"" is good but uses B,L,N,D.

""PLANT"" seems solid - P, L, N, T are all common and not yet ruled out, and A is in position 2.

But to maximize information, let's try ""SLANT"":
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

""CLAMP"":
- C, L, M, P are good, A is in position 2.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, N, D are good, A is in position 2.

""BLAND"" is good too.

I think ""PLANT"" is a strong choice as it tests P, L, N, T, and keeps A in position 2.

But to test more vowels, let's try ""FAINT"" - but this repeats T which we haven't tested yet. Actually, better to avoid repeating letters now.

""CLAMP"" seems good - C, L, M, P are new, A is in position 2.

Let's go with ""CLAMP"".

<guess>CLAMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP → C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far: A (wrong at pos 1), P (wrong at pos 5)
- So the word contains A and P, but:
  – A is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and CLAMP)
  – P is not in position 4 or 5 (from CLAMP)
- Therefore:
  – A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
  – P must be in position 1, 2, or 3
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, 5)
2. Place P in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 3)
3. Introduce as many new common letters as possible
4. Avoid any ruled-out letters (R, O, S, E, C, L, M)

Let’s try “APHID”:
- A is in position 2 – but we know A can’t be in position 2 (from CLAMP feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “PAINT”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 – but A can’t be in position 2. Invalid.

Try “Piano” – but O is ruled out.

Try “FAPID” – but this is not a valid English word.

Try “GAPID” – not valid.

Try “HAPPY” – P is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “TAPIR” – R is ruled out.

Try “BANKS” – S is ruled out.

Try “DAMPY” – M is ruled out.

Try “FAINT”:
- F is new
- A is in position 2 – invalid as above.

Try “PANIC” – C is ruled out.

Try “PAINT” again – A in position 2, invalid.

Try “PAVING” – G is new, but P is in position 1 (ok), A in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PANDA” – A in position 4 (ok), P in position 1 (ok), N and D are new.

This seems valid:
- PANDA: P(1), A(4), N(2), D(3), A(5)
- Tests P in position 1, A in position 4 and 5, and introduces N, D.

Let’s go with PANDA.

From the new feedback on PANDA:

P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct first position.

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).  

So far we know:
- Word starts with PA _ _ _
- Contains D (not in position 4) and A (not in position 5)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M, N
- Still need to test other common letters: B, F, G, H, I, T, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with PA
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can't be 4)
3. Contains A somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's consider possible positions:
- If D is in position 3: PA _ D _ → then A must be in position 4
- If D is in position 5: PA _ _ D → then A must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words:
- PADID – but I is untested and D is in position 3, A in position 4. This fits all constraints.
- PABID – not a valid word.
- PADGE – G is new, but E is ruled out.
- PAVID – V is new, I is new, D in position 3, A in position 4. Fits all constraints.

Between PADID and PAVID, both fit. PADID is more common, but PAVID is also valid. I'll go with PADID as it tests I (new vowel) and D in position 3.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D (allowed)
- Position 4: A (allowed)
- Position 5: D (but D can't be in position 4, and already in position 3)
Actually PADID has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 4 (already ok here).

But PADID is P A D I D – positions: P(1)A(2)D(3)I(4)D(5). This satisfies all constraints.

Another option: PABID – invalid.
PAVID: P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2 already, but A is allowed in position 2 here (but we know A is in position 2 from PANDA feedback). Wait PAVID has A in position 2 – but PANDA said A is in position 2 (✓), so PAVID's A in position 2 is consistent.

But PADID seems more straightforward with D in position 3 and 5.

Actually looking back: P A D I D has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 5 (since D(-) in PANDA meant D is in word but wrong position, and position 5 was D's position in PANDA – but PANDA had D in position 4, and D(-) meant D is in word but not position 4. So D can be in position 3 or 5. In PANDA, D was in position 4 (but marked wrong position), so D can be in 3 or 5.

PAVID: P A V I D – D is in position 5. PAVID is valid.

PADID: P A D I D – D is in position 3 and 5. This is also valid.

Between PAVID and PADID, PADID seems better as it tests I (new vowel).

But let's check: PAVID has V (new), I (new), D in position 5 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). This is a good test.

However, PADID also has D in position 3 – but we don't know if D is in position 3 yet. The feedback from PANDA only told us D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is still open.

So PADID is a strong candidate.

But actually looking back: PANDA's D was in position 4 (marked -), so D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is open, and position 5 is open.

PAVID has D in position 5 (ok), A in position 2 (ok).

Another good option: P A I D _ – but we need 5 letters.

PAVID is P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2.

 PADID is P A D I D – fits PA _ D _ with A in position 2.

Both fit. PADID tests I (new vowel), PAVID tests V (new vowel).

I'll go with PADID.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

This is acceptable because:
- D can be in position 3 or 5
- A is in position 2 (ok)
- No ruled-out letters used

So PADID is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate:
- T is a common consonant not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (different from first guess).
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- N is a common consonant not yet tested.
- T is repeated to test it twice efficiently.

However, ""TAINT"" uses T twice - to maximize information, we can try a word with more distinct letters. ""PLANT"" is another good option:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2.

But ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good. To test more vowels, ""FAINT"" could work:
- F is common, A is in position 2, I is a new vowel, N and T are common.

Actually, let's try ""PLANT"" as it tests more consonants and keeps A in a new position.

Wait - ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is good. But let me think of a word that tests more distinct letters. ""CHALK"" is good but uses K which is less common. ""BLAND"" is good but uses B,L,N,D.

""PLANT"" seems solid - P, L, N, T are all common and not yet ruled out, and A is in position 2.

But to maximize information, let's try ""SLANT"":
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

""CLAMP"":
- C, L, M, P are good, A is in position 2.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, N, D are good, A is in position 2.

""BLAND"" is good too.

I think ""PLANT"" is a strong choice as it tests P, L, N, T, and keeps A in position 2.

But to test more vowels, let's try ""FAINT"" - but this repeats T which we haven't tested yet. Actually, better to avoid repeating letters now.

""CLAMP"" seems good - C, L, M, P are new, A is in position 2.

Let's go with ""CLAMP"".

<guess>CLAMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP → C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far: A (wrong at pos 1), P (wrong at pos 5)
- So the word contains A and P, but:
  – A is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and CLAMP)
  – P is not in position 4 or 5 (from CLAMP)
- Therefore:
  – A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
  – P must be in position 1, 2, or 3
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, 5)
2. Place P in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 3)
3. Introduce as many new common letters as possible
4. Avoid any ruled-out letters (R, O, S, E, C, L, M)

Let’s try “APHID”:
- A is in position 2 – but we know A can’t be in position 2 (from CLAMP feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “PAINT”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 – but A can’t be in position 2. Invalid.

Try “Piano” – but O is ruled out.

Try “FAPID” – but this is not a valid English word.

Try “GAPID” – not valid.

Try “HAPPY” – P is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “TAPIR” – R is ruled out.

Try “BANKS” – S is ruled out.

Try “DAMPY” – M is ruled out.

Try “FAINT”:
- F is new
- A is in position 2 – invalid as above.

Try “PANIC” – C is ruled out.

Try “PAINT” again – A in position 2, invalid.

Try “PAVING” – G is new, but P is in position 1 (ok), A in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PANDA” – A in position 4 (ok), P in position 1 (ok), N and D are new.

This seems valid:
- PANDA: P(1), A(4), N(2), D(3), A(5)
- Tests P in position 1, A in position 4 and 5, and introduces N, D.

Let’s go with PANDA.

<guess>PANDA</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)
Guess 3: PANDA -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(-) A(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on PANDA:

P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct first position.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct second position.  
N(x) – N is not in the word.  
D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).  

So far we know:
- Word starts with PA _ _ _
- Contains D (not in position 4) and A (not in position 5)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M, N
- Still need to test other common letters: B, F, G, H, I, T, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with PA
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can't be 4)
3. Contains A somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's consider possible positions:
- If D is in position 3: PA _ D _ → then A must be in position 4
- If D is in position 5: PA _ _ D → then A must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words:
- PADID – but I is untested and D is in position 3, A in position 4. This fits all constraints.
- PABID – not a valid word.
- PADGE – G is new, but E is ruled out.
- PAVID – V is new, I is new, D in position 3, A in position 4. Fits all constraints.

Between PADID and PAVID, both fit. PADID is more common, but PAVID is also valid. I'll go with PADID as it tests I (new vowel) and D in position 3.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D (allowed)
- Position 4: A (allowed)
- Position 5: D (but D can't be in position 4, and already in position 3)
Actually PADID has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 4 (already ok here).

But PADID is P A D I D – positions: P(1)A(2)D(3)I(4)D(5). This satisfies all constraints.

Another option: PABID – invalid.
PAVID: P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2 already, but A is allowed in position 2 here (but we know A is in position 2 from PANDA feedback). Wait PAVID has A in position 2 – but PANDA said A is in position 2 (✓), so PAVID's A in position 2 is consistent.

But PADID seems more straightforward with D in position 3 and 5.

Actually looking back: P A D I D has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 5 (since D(-) in PANDA meant D is in word but wrong position, and position 5 was D's position in PANDA – but PANDA had D in position 4, and D(-) meant D is in word but not position 4. So D can be in position 3 or 5. In PANDA, D was in position 4 (but marked wrong position), so D can be in 3 or 5.

PAVID: P A V I D – D is in position 5. PAVID is valid.

PADID: P A D I D – D is in position 3 and 5. This is also valid.

Between PAVID and PADID, PADID seems better as it tests I (new vowel).

But let's check: PAVID has V (new), I (new), D in position 5 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). This is a good test.

However, PADID also has D in position 3 – but we don't know if D is in position 3 yet. The feedback from PANDA only told us D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is still open.

So PADID is a strong candidate.

But actually looking back: PANDA's D was in position 4 (marked -), so D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is open, and position 5 is open.

PAVID has D in position 5 (ok), A in position 2 (ok).

Another good option: P A I D _ – but we need 5 letters.

PAVID is P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2.

 PADID is P A D I D – fits PA _ D _ with A in position 2.

Both fit. PADID tests I (new vowel), PAVID tests V (new vowel).

I'll go with PADID.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

This is acceptable because:
- D can be in position 3 or 5
- A is in position 2 (ok)
- No ruled-out letters used

So PADID is a strong next guess.

From the new feedback on PADID:

P(✓) – P is correct in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.  
D(-) – D is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in PADID).  
I(x) – I is not in the word.  
D(✓) – D is correct in position 5.

So the word is: P A _ _ D, and must also contain D somewhere else (since the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in the word but not in position 3). But we already have D in position 5, so there must be another D in positions 3 or 4.

But the word is only 5 letters and we know:
- Positions 1: P
- Positions 2: A
- Positions 5: D
- Additional D must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words: P A _ _ D with an extra D in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, D is in position 3 and 4 (but we don't know if Y is allowed yet)
- P A D _ D – but position 4 must be D, which would make it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters
- P A _ D D – but position 3 must be D, which would make it P A _ D D – but position 4 must be D, which is already handled.

Wait, the structure is: P A _ _ D with an additional D in position 3 or 4.

Looking at P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, which would be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Actually, the word must be P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, and D is in position 3 and 4. This is acceptable as long as Y is allowed (not ruled out yet).
- P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, making it P A D D D – this is valid.

Between these, P A D D Y is more common as a word (meaning to pause or stop).

Let's check: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But wait: the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3. We already have D in position 5, so the other D must be in position 3 or 4. In PADDY, the D is in position 3 and 4 – position 3 is allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4 (from PANDA), but position 3 is open.

But we have P A _ _ D and another D in position 3 or 4.

P A D D Y fits this perfectly: P A D (position 3), D (position 4), Y (new letter).

Alternatively, P A D _ D – but this would require position 4 to be D, making it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

P A D D Y is the only valid word fitting P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

Let's go with PADDY.

But wait – in PADDY:
- Position 3: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Position 4: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Y is new (not ruled out)

This seems correct.

Actually, let me verify: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But the feedback on D in PANDA was D(-) (in position 4), and in PADID D(-) was in position 3. So D cannot be in position 3 or 4? No, the feedback was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3 (from PADID D in position 3) and D(-) in PANDA was position 4. So D cannot be in position 4, but can be in 3 or 5. We have D in 5, so the other D must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Wait, the structure is P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid word: P A D D Y – but this is P A D (3) D (4) Y (5), which fits P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

But looking at P A D D Y:
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
This is acceptable as it tests Y (new vowel) and places D in positions 3 and 4.

Alternatively, P A _ D D – but position 3 must be D, making it P A D D D.

PADDY is the only valid word fitting this.

Let's go with PADDY.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with PA _ _ D
- It must also contain another D, placed in position 3 or 4
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M, N, I

The only valid English word fitting PA _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4 is PADDY.

<guess>PADDY</guess>",PADDY,"From the new feedback on PADID:

P(✓) – P is correct in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.  
D(-) – D is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in PADID).  
I(x) – I is not in the word.  
D(✓) – D is correct in position 5.

So the word is: P A _ _ D, and must also contain D somewhere else (since the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in the word but not in position 3). But we already have D in position 5, so there must be another D in positions 3 or 4.

But the word is only 5 letters and we know:
- Positions 1: P
- Positions 2: A
- Positions 5: D
- Additional D must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words: P A _ _ D with an extra D in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, D is in position 3 and 4 (but we don't know if Y is allowed yet)
- P A D _ D – but position 4 must be D, which would make it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters
- P A _ D D – but position 3 must be D, which would make it P A _ D D – but position 4 must be D, which is already handled.

Wait, the structure is: P A _ _ D with an additional D in position 3 or 4.

Looking at P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, which would be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Actually, the word must be P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, and D is in position 3 and 4. This is acceptable as long as Y is allowed (not ruled out yet).
- P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, making it P A D D D – this is valid.

Between these, P A D D Y is more common as a word (meaning to pause or stop).

Let's check: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But wait: the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3. We already have D in position 5, so the other D must be in position 3 or 4. In PADDY, the D is in position 3 and 4 – position 3 is allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4 (from PANDA), but position 3 is open.

But we have P A _ _ D and another D in position 3 or 4.

P A D D Y fits this perfectly: P A D (position 3), D (position 4), Y (new letter).

Alternatively, P A D _ D – but this would require position 4 to be D, making it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

P A D D Y is the only valid word fitting P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

Let's go with PADDY.

But wait – in PADDY:
- Position 3: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Position 4: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Y is new (not ruled out)

This seems correct.

Actually, let me verify: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But the feedback on D in PANDA was D(-) (in position 4), and in PADID D(-) was in position 3. So D cannot be in position 3 or 4? No, the feedback was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3 (from PADID D in position 3) and D(-) in PANDA was position 4. So D cannot be in position 4, but can be in 3 or 5. We have D in 5, so the other D must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Wait, the structure is P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid word: P A D D Y – but this is P A D (3) D (4) Y (5), which fits P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

But looking at P A D D Y:
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
This is acceptable as it tests Y (new vowel) and places D in positions 3 and 4.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. If the guess is not successful, we can adjust our strategy based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate:
- T is a common consonant not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2 (different from first guess).
- I is another common vowel not yet tested.
- N is a common consonant not yet tested.
- T is repeated to test it twice efficiently.

However, ""TAINT"" uses T twice - to maximize information, we can try a word with more distinct letters. ""PLANT"" is another good option:
- P, L, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- A is placed in position 2.

But ""PLANT"" uses N and T which are good. To test more vowels, ""FAINT"" could work:
- F is common, A is in position 2, I is a new vowel, N and T are common.

Actually, let's try ""PLANT"" as it tests more consonants and keeps A in a new position.

Wait - ""PLANT"" has A in position 2, which is good. But let me think of a word that tests more distinct letters. ""CHALK"" is good but uses K which is less common. ""BLAND"" is good but uses B,L,N,D.

""PLANT"" seems solid - P, L, N, T are all common and not yet ruled out, and A is in position 2.

But to maximize information, let's try ""SLANT"":
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

""CLAMP"":
- C, L, M, P are good, A is in position 2.

""GLAND"":
- G, L, N, D are good, A is in position 2.

""BLAND"" is good too.

I think ""PLANT"" is a strong choice as it tests P, L, N, T, and keeps A in position 2.

But to test more vowels, let's try ""FAINT"" - but this repeats T which we haven't tested yet. Actually, better to avoid repeating letters now.

""CLAMP"" seems good - C, L, M, P are new, A is in position 2.

Let's go with ""CLAMP"".

<guess>CLAMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP → C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions so far: A (wrong at pos 1), P (wrong at pos 5)
- So the word contains A and P, but:
  – A is not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and CLAMP)
  – P is not in position 4 or 5 (from CLAMP)
- Therefore:
  – A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
  – P must be in position 1, 2, or 3
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A in one of the allowed positions (3, 4, 5)
2. Place P in one of the allowed positions (1, 2, 3)
3. Introduce as many new common letters as possible
4. Avoid any ruled-out letters (R, O, S, E, C, L, M)

Let’s try “APHID”:
- A is in position 2 – but we know A can’t be in position 2 (from CLAMP feedback). So this is invalid.

Try “PAINT”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 – but A can’t be in position 2. Invalid.

Try “Piano” – but O is ruled out.

Try “FAPID” – but this is not a valid English word.

Try “GAPID” – not valid.

Try “HAPPY” – P is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (invalid).

Try “TAPIR” – R is ruled out.

Try “BANKS” – S is ruled out.

Try “DAMPY” – M is ruled out.

Try “FAINT”:
- F is new
- A is in position 2 – invalid as above.

Try “PANIC” – C is ruled out.

Try “PAINT” again – A in position 2, invalid.

Try “PAVING” – G is new, but P is in position 1 (ok), A in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PANDA” – A in position 4 (ok), P in position 1 (ok), N and D are new.

This seems valid:
- PANDA: P(1), A(4), N(2), D(3), A(5)
- Tests P in position 1, A in position 4 and 5, and introduces N, D.

Let’s go with PANDA.

<guess>PANDA</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)
Guess 3: PANDA -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(-) A(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on PANDA:

P(✓) – P is in the word and in the correct first position.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct second position.  
N(x) – N is not in the word.  
D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).  

So far we know:
- Word starts with PA _ _ _
- Contains D (not in position 4) and A (not in position 5)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M, N
- Still need to test other common letters: B, F, G, H, I, T, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with PA
2. Contains D somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it can't be 4)
3. Contains A somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be 2 or 5)
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's consider possible positions:
- If D is in position 3: PA _ D _ → then A must be in position 4
- If D is in position 5: PA _ _ D → then A must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words:
- PADID – but I is untested and D is in position 3, A in position 4. This fits all constraints.
- PABID – not a valid word.
- PADGE – G is new, but E is ruled out.
- PAVID – V is new, I is new, D in position 3, A in position 4. Fits all constraints.

Between PADID and PAVID, both fit. PADID is more common, but PAVID is also valid. I'll go with PADID as it tests I (new vowel) and D in position 3.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D (allowed)
- Position 4: A (allowed)
- Position 5: D (but D can't be in position 4, and already in position 3)
Actually PADID has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 4 (already ok here).

But PADID is P A D I D – positions: P(1)A(2)D(3)I(4)D(5). This satisfies all constraints.

Another option: PABID – invalid.
PAVID: P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2 already, but A is allowed in position 2 here (but we know A is in position 2 from PANDA feedback). Wait PAVID has A in position 2 – but PANDA said A is in position 2 (✓), so PAVID's A in position 2 is consistent.

But PADID seems more straightforward with D in position 3 and 5.

Actually looking back: P A D I D has D in position 3 and 5 – but D can't be in position 5 (since D(-) in PANDA meant D is in word but wrong position, and position 5 was D's position in PANDA – but PANDA had D in position 4, and D(-) meant D is in word but not position 4. So D can be in position 3 or 5. In PANDA, D was in position 4 (but marked wrong position), so D can be in 3 or 5.

PAVID: P A V I D – D is in position 5. PAVID is valid.

PADID: P A D I D – D is in position 3 and 5. This is also valid.

Between PAVID and PADID, PADID seems better as it tests I (new vowel).

But let's check: PAVID has V (new), I (new), D in position 5 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed). This is a good test.

However, PADID also has D in position 3 – but we don't know if D is in position 3 yet. The feedback from PANDA only told us D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is still open.

So PADID is a strong candidate.

But actually looking back: PANDA's D was in position 4 (marked -), so D is in word but not position 4. Position 3 is open, and position 5 is open.

PAVID has D in position 5 (ok), A in position 2 (ok).

Another good option: P A I D _ – but we need 5 letters.

PAVID is P A V I D – fits PA _ _ D with A in position 2.

 PADID is P A D I D – fits PA _ D _ with A in position 2.

Both fit. PADID tests I (new vowel), PAVID tests V (new vowel).

I'll go with PADID.

But wait – in PADID:
- Position 3: D
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D

This is acceptable because:
- D can be in position 3 or 5
- A is in position 2 (ok)
- No ruled-out letters used

So PADID is a strong next guess.

<guess>PADID</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(-) M(x) P(-)

Guess 4: PADID -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) D(-) I(x) D(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on PADID:

P(✓) – P is correct in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.  
D(-) – D is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in PADID).  
I(x) – I is not in the word.  
D(✓) – D is correct in position 5.

So the word is: P A _ _ D, and must also contain D somewhere else (since the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in the word but not in position 3). But we already have D in position 5, so there must be another D in positions 3 or 4.

But the word is only 5 letters and we know:
- Positions 1: P
- Positions 2: A
- Positions 5: D
- Additional D must be in position 3 or 4

Looking at valid English words: P A _ _ D with an extra D in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, D is in position 3 and 4 (but we don't know if Y is allowed yet)
- P A D _ D – but position 4 must be D, which would make it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters
- P A _ D D – but position 3 must be D, which would make it P A _ D D – but position 4 must be D, which is already handled.

Wait, the structure is: P A _ _ D with an additional D in position 3 or 4.

Looking at P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, which would be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Actually, the word must be P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- P A D D Y – but Y is new, and D is in position 3 and 4. This is acceptable as long as Y is allowed (not ruled out yet).
- P A D _ D – but then position 4 must be D, making it P A D D D – this is valid.

Between these, P A D D Y is more common as a word (meaning to pause or stop).

Let's check: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But wait: the feedback on D in PADID was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3. We already have D in position 5, so the other D must be in position 3 or 4. In PADDY, the D is in position 3 and 4 – position 3 is allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4 (from PANDA), but position 3 is open.

But we have P A _ _ D and another D in position 3 or 4.

P A D D Y fits this perfectly: P A D (position 3), D (position 4), Y (new letter).

Alternatively, P A D _ D – but this would require position 4 to be D, making it P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

P A D D Y is the only valid word fitting P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

Let's go with PADDY.

But wait – in PADDY:
- Position 3: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Position 4: D (allowed since D(-) only ruled out position 4)
- Y is new (not ruled out)

This seems correct.

Actually, let me verify: P A D D Y
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
But the feedback on D in PANDA was D(-) (in position 4), and in PADID D(-) was in position 3. So D cannot be in position 3 or 4? No, the feedback was -, meaning D is in word but not position 3 (from PADID D in position 3) and D(-) in PANDA was position 4. So D cannot be in position 4, but can be in 3 or 5. We have D in 5, so the other D must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be P A D D D – but this is 5 letters.

Wait, the structure is P A _ _ D with D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4.

Valid word: P A D D Y – but this is P A D (3) D (4) Y (5), which fits P A _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4.

But looking at P A D D Y:
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(new)
This is acceptable as it tests Y (new vowel) and places D in positions 3 and 4.

Alternatively, P A _ D D – but position 3 must be D, making it P A D D D.

PADDY is the only valid word fitting this.

Let's go with PADDY.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with PA _ _ D
- It must also contain another D, placed in position 3 or 4
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, C, L, M, N, I

The only valid English word fitting PA _ _ D with D in position 3 and 4 is PADDY.

""BLAND"" is good but uses B,L,N,D.\n\n""PLANT"" seems solid - P, L, N, T are all common and not yet ruled out, and A is in position 2.\n\nBut to maximize information, let\'s try ""SLANT"":\n- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.\n\n""CLAMP"":\n- C, L, M, P are good, A is in position 2.\n\n""GLAND"":\n- G, L, N, D are good, A is in position 2.\n\n""BLAND"" is good too.\n\nI think ""PLANT"" is a strong choice as it tests P, L, N, T, and keeps A in position 2.\n\nBut to test more vowels, let\'s try ""FAINT"" - but this repeats T which we haven\'t tested yet.

From the new feedback on PADDY:

P(✓) – P is correct in position 1.

D(-) – D is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in PADDY).  
D(-) – second D is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in PADDY).  
Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So the word is: P A _ _ D, and must also contain another D, but since D(-) in PADDY said D is not in position 3 or 4, this implies the word must contain D in position 5 and another D in position 3 or 4. But the only positions left are 3 and 4, and D(-) says D is not in 3 or 4. This is a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

PADDY feedback:
P(✓) – P correct in position 1
A(✓) – A correct in position 2
D(-) – D is in word but not position 3
D(-) – second D is in word but not position 4
Y(x) – Y not in word

So the word has:
- P A _ _ D (D in position 5)
- Another D must be in position 3 or 4
- But D(-) in position 3 (from PADDY) says D is not in position 3
- Therefore the other D must be in position 4

Thus the word must be: P A _ D D

Valid 5-letter words fitting P A _ D D:
- P A V D D – but V is untested

- P A N D D – N is ruled out
- P A D D Y – Y is ruled out
- P A B D D – B is untested
- P A G D D – G is untested

Looking at these, P A B D D is a valid word (means to hit or strike).

Let's check: P A B D D
- P(✓) A(✓) B(new) D(-) D(✓)
But wait: D(-) in position 4 (from PADDY) says D is not in position 4. But in PADDY, D was in position 4 and marked -, so D is not in position 4. Thus the word must have D in position 5 and another D in position 3.

Thus the word is P A D D D.

Let's verify:
- P A D D D
- P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) D(✓)
The first D(-) means D is not in position 3 (which is ok, since D is in position 5)
The second D(-) means D is not in position 4 (which is also ok, since D is in position 5)

This is consistent with all feedback.
