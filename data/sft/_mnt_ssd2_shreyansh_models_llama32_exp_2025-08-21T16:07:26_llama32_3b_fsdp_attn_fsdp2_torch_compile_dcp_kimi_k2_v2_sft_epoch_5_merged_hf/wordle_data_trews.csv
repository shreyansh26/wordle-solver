### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 5.
   - A and O are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - T is now fixed in position 1.
   - R is fixed in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: R
- Positions that must contain S and E somewhere:
  - S cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 3
  - E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 3 or 4, but 3 is already S, so E must be in 4
- Therefore positions so far: T R S E _

The last letter must be in position 5, and it must be a new letter we haven't tried yet (since A, O, I are out). Common consonants left: N, L, D, C, etc.

But wait: we have T R S E _. The only 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""TREES"". Let's check:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 3: ✓ (allowed, since S can't be in 4 or 5)
- E in 4: ✓ (allowed, since E can't be in 4 or 5 – but wait, this is impossible: E would be in 4, but feedback said E is not in 4 in TRIES. This suggests an inconsistency.

Ah! I made a mistake: the feedback says E(-) in TRIES, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E could still be in position 5. The word must be T R S E _ with E in position 5. Then the last letter must be new and not A, O, I. Possible: N, L, D, C, etc. The only common word fitting is ""TREES"". Let's verify:
- T(✓) R(✓) S(✓) E(-) s(-) would indeed give us T R S E s, but the feedback shows S(-) in TRIES, meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. This is consistent with ""TREES"" because S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

But looking back at the feedback:
- Guess 2: TRIES → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
  - E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4. Position 4 is the only remaining spot, so E must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be ""TREES"". Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 3: wait, no – the feedback said S(-) in TRIES, meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. In ""TREES"", S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

But looking back at AROSE: S(-) meant S is in the word but not in position 4. TRIES had S in position 3, and the feedback was S(-), so S is not in position 3. Thus S must be in position 5, making the word ""TREES"".

However, ""TREES"" has E in position 4 and 5, but the feedback from TRIES shows E(-) in position 4, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. This is consistent with E being in position 5.

Thus the word must be ""TREES"". But wait – the feedback from TRIES shows:
- T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (position 4 is I in this feedback, but the main feedback is E(-) meaning E is not in position 4). This implies E must be in position 5.

Therefore the word is ""TREES"". Let's confirm:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 5: allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- E in 5: allowed (not in 4)
- Last letter: E is in the word and must be in position 5.

Thus the word is ""TREES"".

Based on the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. The alternative is to use ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Position 2 = R
- The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- The word does NOT contain A or O

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Include S and E in new positions
3. Avoid A and O
4. Introduce new common letters to test

Possible letters left to try: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.

A strong candidate is ""TRIES"":
- Keeps R in position 2
- Moves S to position 3 (new position)
- Moves E to position 4 (new position)
- Introduces T and I which are common and haven't been tested yet

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 5.
   - A and O are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - T is now fixed in position 1.
   - R is fixed in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is somewhere, but not in position 4.
   - S is somewhere, but not in position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: R
- Positions that must contain S and E somewhere:
  - S cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 3
  - E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 3 or 4, but 3 is already S, so E must be in 4
- Therefore positions so far: T R S E _

The last letter must be in position 5, and it must be a new letter we haven't tried yet (since A, O, I are out). Common consonants left: N, L, D, C, etc.

But wait: we have T R S E _. The only 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""TREES"". Let's check:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 3: ✓ (allowed, since S can't be in 4 or 5)
- E in 4: ✓ (allowed, since E can't be in 4 or 5 – but wait, this is impossible: E would be in 4, but feedback said E is not in 4 in TRIES. This suggests an inconsistency.

Ah! I made a mistake: the feedback says E(-) in TRIES, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E could still be in position 5. The word must be T R S E _ with E in position 5. Then the last letter must be new and not A, O, I. Possible: N, L, D, C, etc. The only common word fitting is ""TREES"". Let's verify:
- T(✓) R(✓) S(✓) E(-) s(-) would indeed give us T R S E s, but the feedback shows S(-) in TRIES, meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. This is consistent with ""TREES"" because S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

But looking back at the feedback:
- Guess 2: TRIES → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
  - E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4. Position 4 is the only remaining spot, so E must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be ""TREES"". Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 3: wait, no – the feedback said S(-) in TRIES, meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. In ""TREES"", S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

But looking back at AROSE: S(-) meant S is in the word but not in position 4. TRIES had S in position 3, and the feedback was S(-), so S is not in position 3. Thus S must be in position 5, making the word ""TREES"".

However, ""TREES"" has E in position 4 and 5, but the feedback from TRIES shows E(-) in position 4, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. This is consistent with E being in position 5.

Thus the word must be ""TREES"". But wait – the feedback from TRIES shows:
- T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (position 4 is I in this feedback, but the main feedback is E(-) meaning E is not in position 4). This implies E must be in position 5.

Therefore the word is ""TREES"". Let's confirm:
- T in 1: ✓
- R in 2: ✓
- S in 5: allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- E in 5: allowed (not in 4)
- Last letter: E is in the word and must be in position 5.

Thus the word is ""TREES"".Based on the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1
- R is fixed in position 2
- S must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 3 or 4)
- E must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4)
- The only remaining letter to test is position 4, but position 4 must be a new letter not yet tried (A, O, I are out). The word must be ""TREES"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

However, ""TREES"" has E in position 4 and 5, but the feedback from TRIES shows E(-) in position 4, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. This is consistent with E being in position 5.

   - R is fixed in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. TREES → T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(-) S(✓)
   - T is fixed in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - R is fixed in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - E is fixed in position 3 (✓).
   - The second E(-) means the second E is not in position 4, which is already satisfied since we have E in position 3.
   - S is fixed in position 5 (✓).

So the current pattern is: T R E _ S

We need a 5-letter word that starts with T R E and ends with S. The only letter missing is position 4. 

Letters already ruled out: A, O, I

Common remaining consonants for position 4: N, L, D, C, etc.

The only common word fitting T R E _ S is ""TREKS"". Let's check:
- T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) K(s) S(✓)
- K hasn't been tried yet and is a valid letter.

Thus the word must be ""TREKS"".

From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A and O are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is fixed in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. TREES → T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(-) S(✓)
   - T and R confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
   - E is fixed in position 3 (✓).
   - The second E(-) means the fourth letter is not E (position 4), which is already satisfied since we have E in position 3.
   - S is fixed in position 5 (✓).

4. TREKS → T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) K(x) S(✓)
   - T, R, E, S all confirmed in positions 1,2,3,5.
   - K is not in the word.

So the pattern is now: T R E _ S with position 4 still unknown.

Letters ruled out so far: A, O, I, K.

Common remaining consonants for position 4: N, L, D, C, etc.

The only common word fitting T R E _ S is ""TRENS"" (but ""TRENS"" is not a valid English word), or ""TREDS"" (invalid), ""TRECS"" (invalid), etc.

Valid English word: ""TREES"" – but we already had E in position 3 confirmed, and the feedback from TREES showed E(-) for position 4, meaning E is not in position 4, which is already satisfied.

Wait – the only valid word fitting T R E _ S is actually ""TREES"", but we have T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) _ S, and the fourth letter must be E, but feedback from TREES showed E(-) for position 4, meaning E is not in position 4. This implies the word must be T R E _ S with the fourth letter being something else.

But looking back at the feedback: TREES had E in position 3 (✓) and E(-) for position 4, which is consistent because E is already placed in position 3. The fourth letter must be a new consonant.

The valid word is actually ""TREWS"" – but W hasn't been tried yet. Let's check:
- T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) W(_) S(✓)
- W is a new letter not yet tested.

Another possibility: ""TRENS"" – but that's not a valid word.
""TREDS"" – invalid
""TRECS"" – invalid

The only valid word is ""TREWS"".

Thus the word must be ""TREWS"".
