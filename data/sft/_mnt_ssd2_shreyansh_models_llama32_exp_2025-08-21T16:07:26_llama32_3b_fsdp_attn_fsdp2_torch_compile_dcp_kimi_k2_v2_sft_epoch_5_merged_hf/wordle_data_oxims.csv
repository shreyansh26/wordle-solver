### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re confirmed).
2. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
3. Tests new common letters (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.) while placing O and S in new positions.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 4th spot).
- T tests a new common letter.
- O is moved to position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 in AROSE; here we’re putting it in position 3 again, which would automatically be wrong. Oops.)

Let me reconsider: O cannot be in position 3. 

Better word: “SOUND”
- S is now in position 1 (allowed).
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3rd spot).
- U, N, D are new letters.

That seems safe.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): O, S  
3. Position constraints:
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND).  
   - S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must:

- not contain A, R, E, U, N, D  
- have O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- have S in positions 2, 3, 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, L, C, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the more common ones).

Let’s build a valid word:
- O must be in one of positions 1, 4, 5  
- S must be in one of positions 2, 3, 5  

Try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2: _ S _ O _  
We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, U, N, D, S, O.  
Good candidates: T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: T, S, I, O, P – “STOIP” is invalid (not a real word).  
“STOIC” uses C and T, both allowed, and is a valid word.  
Check positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re confirmed).
2. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
3. Tests new common letters (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.) while placing O and S in new positions.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 4th spot).
- T tests a new common letter.
- O is moved to position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 in AROSE; here we’re putting it in position 3 again, which would automatically be wrong. Oops.)

Let me reconsider: O cannot be in position 3. 

Better word: “SOUND”
- S is now in position 1 (allowed).
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3rd spot).
- U, N, D are new letters.

That seems safe.

- contain O and S  
- not contain A, R, E, U, N, D  
- have O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- have S in positions 2, 3, 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, L, C, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the more common ones).

Let’s build a valid word:
- O must be in one of positions 1, 4, 5  
- S must be in one of positions 2, 3, 5  

Try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2: _ S _ O _  
We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, U, N, D, S, O.  
Good candidates: T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: T, S, I, O, P – “STOIP” is invalid (not a real word).  
“STOIC” uses C and T, both allowed, and is a valid word.  
Check positions:
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- T (new letter)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  
- I (new letter)  
- C (new letter)

No forbidden letters, and both O and S are present.  
Let’s go with STOIC.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word (– feedback):
- O – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 3 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STOIC).  
- S – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND) or 2 (from STOIC).  

So the word must:
1. Contain both O and S.
2. O can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S can only be in positions 3 or 5.
4. May not use any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J.

Let’s map possible positions for O and S:

Case 1: O in position 1  
   Word pattern: O _ _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: O _ S _ _  → need two more letters, none forbidden.  
   - If S is 5: O _ _ _ S  → need two more letters, none forbidden.

Case 2: O in position 2  
   Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: _ O S _ _  → need two more letters.  
   - If S is 5: _ O _ _ S  → need two more letters.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ O  
   S must go in 3: _ _ S _ O  (only possible, since 5 is taken by O).

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit any of these patterns, using only allowed letters.

Try Case 1: O _ S _ _  
   Possible word: O L S I M  → “OLSIM” – not valid.  
   “OPISM” – invalid.  
   “OSLMI” – invalid.  
   None of these seem to form a valid English word.

Try Case 2: _ O S _ _  
   Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, from allowed set.  
   Try M and L: M O S L _ – but we need a 5th letter.  
   “MOSL_” – nothing valid.

Try Case 3: _ _ S _ O  
   Positions 1 and 2: choose from allowed letters.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – “LISMO” – invalid.  
   Try M and I: M I S C O – but C is ruled out.  
   Try B and I: B I S C O – C is ruled out.  
   Try F and I: F I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try H and I: H I S M O – “HISMO” – invalid.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – invalid.  
   Try P and I: P I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try V and I: V I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try W and I: W I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try B and L: B L S I O – “BLSIO” – invalid.  
   Try G and L: G L S I O – invalid.  
   Try M and L: M L S I O – invalid.  
   Try P and L: P L S I O – invalid.  
   Try F and L: F L S I O – invalid.

   Try K and L: K L S I O – invalid.  
   Try V and L: V L S I O – invalid.  
   Try Y and L: Y L S I O – invalid.

None of these combinations seem to yield a valid English word.

Let’s try Case 1 with different letters.  
Try O L I S M – “OLISM” – invalid.  
Try O L K S M – invalid.  
Try O P I S M – invalid.  
Try O M I S L – invalid.

Wait, let’s instead try Case 2: _ O _ _ S  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
   Try M and I: M O I _ S – need a 4th letter.  
   “MOI_S” – try M O I L S – “MOILS” – valid word!  
   Check constraints:  
   - Contains O and S.  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
   - Letters M, O, I, L, S – none of M, O, I, L are ruled out.  
   - No forbidden letters.

“MOILS” satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next guess is MOILS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re confirmed).
2. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
3. Tests new common letters (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.) while placing O and S in new positions.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 4th spot).
- T tests a new common letter.
- O is moved to position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 in AROSE; here we’re putting it in position 3 again, which would automatically be wrong. Oops.)

Let me reconsider: O cannot be in position 3. 

Better word: “SOUND”
- S is now in position 1 (allowed).
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3rd spot).
- U, N, D are new letters.

That seems safe.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): O, S  
3. Position constraints:
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND).  
   - S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must:
- contain O and S  
- not contain A, R, E, U, N, D  
- have O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- have S in positions 2, 3, 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, L, C, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the more common ones).

Let’s build a valid word:
- O must be in one of positions 1, 4, 5  
- S must be in one of positions 2, 3, 5  

Try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2: _ S _ O _  
We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, U, N, D, S, O.  
Good candidates: T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: T, S, I, O, P – “STOIP” is invalid (not a real word).  
“STOIC” uses C and T, both allowed, and is a valid word.  
Check positions:
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- T (new letter)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  
- I (new letter)  
- C (new letter)

No forbidden letters, and both O and S are present.  
Let’s go with STOIC.

<guess>STOIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word (– feedback):
- O – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 3 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STOIC).  
- S – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND) or 2 (from STOIC).  

So the word must:
1. Contain both O and S.
2. O can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S can only be in positions 3 or 5.
4. May not use any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J.

Let’s map possible positions for O and S:

Case 1: O in position 1  
   Word pattern: O _ _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: O _ S _ _  → need two more letters, none forbidden.  
   - If S is 5: O _ _ _ S  → need two more letters, none forbidden.

Case 2: O in position 2  
   Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: _ O S _ _  → need two more letters.  
   - If S is 5: _ O _ _ S  → need two more letters.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ O  
   S must go in 3: _ _ S _ O  (only possible, since 5 is taken by O).

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit any of these patterns, using only allowed letters.

Try Case 1: O _ S _ _  
   Possible word: O L S I M  → “OLSIM” – not valid.  
   “OPISM” – invalid.  
   “OSLMI” – invalid.  
   None of these seem to form a valid English word.

Try Case 2: _ O S _ _  
   Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, from allowed set.  
   Try M and L: M O S L _ – but we need a 5th letter.  
   “MOSL_” – nothing valid.

Try Case 3: _ _ S _ O  
   Positions 1 and 2: choose from allowed letters.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – “LISMO” – invalid.  
   Try M and I: M I S C O – but C is ruled out.  
   Try B and I: B I S C O – C is ruled out.  
   Try F and I: F I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try H and I: H I S M O – “HISMO” – invalid.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – invalid.  
   Try P and I: P I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try V and I: V I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try W and I: W I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try B and L: B L S I O – “BLSIO” – invalid.  
   Try G and L: G L S I O – invalid.  
   Try M and L: M L S I O – invalid.  
   Try P and L: P L S I O – invalid.  
   Try F and L: F L S I O – invalid.  
   Try H and L: H L S I O – invalid.  
   Try K and L: K L S I O – invalid.  
   Try V and L: V L S I O – invalid.  
   Try Y and L: Y L S I O – invalid.

Let’s try Case 1 with different letters.  
Try O L I S M – “OLISM” – invalid.  
Try O L K S M – invalid.  
Try O P I S M – invalid.  
Try O M I S L – invalid.

Wait, let’s instead try Case 2: _ O _ _ S  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
   Try M and I: M O I _ S – need a 4th letter.  
   “MOI_S” – try M O I L S – “MOILS” – valid word!  
   Check constraints:  
   - Contains O and S.  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
   - Letters M, O, I, L, S – none of M, O, I, L are ruled out.  
   - No forbidden letters.

“MOILS” satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next guess is MOILS.

Let’s update our knowledge after the four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C, L

Letters that ARE in the word (– or ✓ feedback):
- I – correct in position 3 (✓)
- S – correct in position 5 (✓)
- O – in the word but wrong position so far (–)
- M – in the word but wrong position (–)

Current confirmed pattern:
_ _ I _ S

Constraints on O:
- Cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- Cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND)
- Cannot be in position 4 (from STOIC)
- Cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS)  — newly added

So O can only be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
This is impossible, which means our previous deduction must be wrong.

Re-examine MOILS feedback:
M(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(✓)

- M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) means I is correct in position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in the word.
- S(✓) means S is correct in position 5.

So the word must:
- Have I in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contain M and O, but:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND) and cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS).
  - M cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS).

Possible positions:
_ _ I _ S
O must be in 2 or 4 (but 2 is disallowed by SOUND feedback), so O must be in 4.
Thus the word looks like: _ _ I O S

Now M must fit somewhere. The only remaining spot is position 1 or 2.

Valid words fitting _ _ I O S:
- M _ I O S  → need a letter for position 2. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  “MISOS” – invalid (duplicate S).  
  “MIOSS” – invalid.  
  “MISKO” – not a word.  
  “MISGA” – invalid.  
  “MISPY” – not a word.  
  “MISHL” – not a word.  
  “MISUM” – U is ruled out.  
  “MISIA” – A is ruled out.  
  “MISIL” – L is ruled out.  
  “MISKS” – K is allowed. “MISKS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains M, I, O, S.
- I in 3, S in 5.
- O in 4 (allowed).
- M in 1 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 1 in MOILS, but here it’s in 1 again – wait, that’s not allowed. In MOILS, M was in 1 and got “-”, so M cannot be in 1. Therefore M must be in position 2.)

Thus the word must be: _ M I O S

Only the first letter remains. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out) for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English word: “FMIOS” – invalid. “GMIOS” – invalid. “HMIOS” – invalid. “KMIOS” – invalid. “PMIOS” – invalid. “VMIOS” – invalid.  
The only real word fitting _ M I O S is “EMIOS” – but E is ruled out.

Wait, let’s list all possible letters for position 1 that haven’t been ruled out:
Allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words of the form ? M I O S:

- HMIOS – invalid
- KMIOS – invalid
- PMIOS – invalid
- VMIOS – invalid
- WMIOS – invalid

Real word: “MISKO” – not a word.  
“MISIA” – A is ruled out.  
“MISIL” – L is ruled out.  
“MISUM” – U is ruled out.  
“MISKS” – valid word!  
“MISKS” is the only valid candidate.

Check constraints:
- Contains M, I, O, S, K.
- I in 3, S in 5.
- O in 4 (allowed).
- M in 2 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 1).
- K is new and allowed.

Therefore the next guess is MISKS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not A, R, or E.
- O is not in the 3rd position.
- S is not in the 4th position.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S (since they’re confirmed).
2. Avoids A, R, E entirely.
3. Tests new common letters (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.) while placing O and S in new positions.

A good candidate is “STOIC”:
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from 4th spot).
- T tests a new common letter.
- O is moved to position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 in AROSE; here we’re putting it in position 3 again, which would automatically be wrong. Oops.)

Let me reconsider: O cannot be in position 3. 

Better word: “SOUND”
- S is now in position 1 (allowed).
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3rd spot).
- U, N, D are new letters.

That seems safe.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): O, S  
3. Position constraints:
   - O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND).  
   - S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOUND).

So the word must:
- contain O and S  
- not contain A, R, E, U, N, D  
- have O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- have S in positions 2, 3, 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, L, C, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the more common ones).

Let’s build a valid word:
- O must be in one of positions 1, 4, 5  
- S must be in one of positions 2, 3, 5  

Try placing O in position 4 and S in position 2: _ S _ O _  
We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, U, N, D, S, O.  
Good candidates: T, L, I, C, M, P, etc.

A simple word that fits: T, S, I, O, P – “STOIP” is invalid (not a real word).  
“STOIC” uses C and T, both allowed, and is a valid word.  
Check positions:
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- T (new letter)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  
- I (new letter)  
- C (new letter)

No forbidden letters, and both O and S are present.  
Let’s go with STOIC.

Guess 3: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C

Letters that ARE in the word (– feedback):
- O – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 3 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STOIC).  
- S – must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from SOUND) or 2 (from STOIC).  

So the word must:
1. Contain both O and S.
2. O can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. S can only be in positions 3 or 5.
4. May not use any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, I, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, Q, J.

Let’s map possible positions for O and S:

Case 1: O in position 1  
   Word pattern: O _ _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: O _ S _ _  → need two more letters, none forbidden.  
   - If S is 5: O _ _ _ S  → need two more letters, none forbidden.

Case 2: O in position 2  
   Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
   S must go in 3 or 5.  
   - If S is 3: _ O S _ _  → need two more letters.  
   - If S is 5: _ O _ _ S  → need two more letters.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ O  
   S must go in 3: _ _ S _ O  (only possible, since 5 is taken by O).

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit any of these patterns, using only allowed letters.

Try Case 1: O _ S _ _  
   Possible word: O L S I M  → “OLSIM” – not valid.  
   “OPISM” – invalid.  
   “OSLMI” – invalid.  
   None of these seem to form a valid English word.

Try Case 2: _ O S _ _  
   Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, from allowed set.  
   Try M and L: M O S L _ – but we need a 5th letter.  
   “MOSL_” – nothing valid.

Try Case 3: _ _ S _ O  
   Positions 1 and 2: choose from allowed letters.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – “LISMO” – invalid.  
   Try M and I: M I S C O – but C is ruled out.  
   Try B and I: B I S C O – C is ruled out.  
   Try F and I: F I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try H and I: H I S M O – “HISMO” – invalid.  
   Try L and I: L I S M O – invalid.  
   Try P and I: P I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try V and I: V I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try W and I: W I S C O – C ruled out.  
   Try B and L: B L S I O – “BLSIO” – invalid.  
   Try G and L: G L S I O – invalid.  
   Try M and L: M L S I O – invalid.  
   Try P and L: P L S I O – invalid.  
   Try F and L: F L S I O – invalid.  
   Try H and L: H L S I O – invalid.  
   Try K and L: K L S I O – invalid.  
   Try V and L: V L S I O – invalid.  
   Try Y and L: Y L S I O – invalid.

None of these combinations seem to yield a valid English word.

Let’s try Case 1 with different letters.  
Try O L I S M – “OLISM” – invalid.  
Try O L K S M – invalid.  
Try O P I S M – invalid.  
Try O M I S L – invalid.

Wait, let’s instead try Case 2: _ O _ _ S  
   Need letters for positions 1 and 3.  
   Try M and I: M O I _ S – need a 4th letter.  
   “MOI_S” – try M O I L S – “MOILS” – valid word!  
   Check constraints:  
   - Contains O and S.  
   - O is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
   - Letters M, O, I, L, S – none of M, O, I, L are ruled out.  
   - No forbidden letters.

“MOILS” satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next guess is MOILS.

<guess>MOILS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) I(-) C(x)
Guess 4: MOILS -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update our knowledge after the four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C, L

Letters that ARE in the word (– or ✓ feedback):
- I – correct in position 3 (✓)
- S – correct in position 5 (✓)
- O – in the word but wrong position so far (–)
- M – in the word but wrong position (–)

Current confirmed pattern:
_ _ I _ S

Constraints on O:
- Cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- Cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND)
- Cannot be in position 4 (from STOIC)
- Cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS)  — newly added

So O can only be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
This is impossible, which means our previous deduction must be wrong.

Re-examine MOILS feedback:
M(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(✓)

- M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) means I is correct in position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in the word.
- S(✓) means S is correct in position 5.

So the word must:
- Have I in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contain M and O, but:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from SOUND) and cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS).
  - M cannot be in position 1 (from MOILS).

Possible positions:
_ _ I _ S
O must be in 2 or 4 (but 2 is disallowed by SOUND feedback), so O must be in 4.
Thus the word looks like: _ _ I O S

Now M must fit somewhere. The only remaining spot is position 1 or 2.

Valid words fitting _ _ I O S:
- M _ I O S  → need a letter for position 2. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  “MISOS” – invalid (duplicate S).  
  “MIOSS” – invalid.  
  “MISKO” – not a word.  
  “MISGA” – invalid.  
  “MISPY” – not a word.  
  “MISHL” – not a word.  
  “MISUM” – U is ruled out.  
  “MISIA” – A is ruled out.  
  “MISIL” – L is ruled out.  
  “MISKS” – K is allowed. “MISKS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains M, I, O, S.
- I in 3, S in 5.
- O in 4 (allowed).
- M in 1 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 1 in MOILS, but here it’s in 1 again – wait, that’s not allowed. In MOILS, M was in 1 and got “-”, so M cannot be in 1. Therefore M must be in position 2.)

Thus the word must be: _ M I O S

Only the first letter remains. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out) for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English word: “FMIOS” – invalid. “GMIOS” – invalid. “HMIOS” – invalid. “KMIOS” – invalid. “PMIOS” – invalid. “VMIOS” – invalid.  
The only real word fitting _ M I O S is “EMIOS” – but E is ruled out.

Wait, let’s list all possible letters for position 1 that haven’t been ruled out:
Allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words of the form ? M I O S:
- BMIOS – invalid
- FMIOS – invalid
- GMIOS – invalid
- HMIOS – invalid
- KMIOS – invalid
- PMIOS – invalid
- VMIOS – invalid
- WMIOS – invalid
- XMIOS – invalid
- YMIOS – invalid
- ZMIOS – invalid

Real word: “MISKO” – not a word.  
“MISIA” – A is ruled out.  
“MISIL” – L is ruled out.  
“MISUM” – U is ruled out.  
“MISKS” – valid word!  
“MISKS” is the only valid candidate.

Check constraints:
- Contains M, I, O, S, K.
- I in 3, S in 5.
- O in 4 (allowed).
- M in 2 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 1).
- K is new and allowed.

Therefore the next guess is MISKS.

Let’s update the state after the five guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, U, N, D, T, C, L, K

Letters that ARE in the word (– or ✓ feedback):
- I – correctly placed in position 3 (✓)
- S – correctly placed in position 5 (✓)
- O – present but position unknown (–)  
- M – present but position unknown (–)

Current fixed pattern:
_ _ I _ S

Letters still needed:
- O must appear once (since it was marked “present” twice, but never sit in the right spot).  
- M must appear once (marked “present” twice, but never sit in the right spot).

Positions already filled:
3 = I, 5 = S

Positions that can still take O and M:
- O can be in 1 or 2 (it cannot be 3, 4, 5).  
- M can be in 1, 2, or 4 (it cannot be 1, 3, 5).

We have two open slots: 1 and 2 or 1 and 4.

To satisfy both O and M, we must place one of them in 1 or 2 and the other in 1 or 4, while avoiding duplicate letters and forbidden letters.

Possible distributions:
- O in 1, M in 2 → O M I _ S  
  Need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

None of these combinations form valid English words.

Let’s try O in position 4 and M in position 2:
_ M I O S  
First letter: choose from allowed set.  
“BMIOS” – invalid.  
“FMIOS” – invalid.  
“GMIOS” – invalid.  
“HMIOS” – invalid.  
“JMIOS” – invalid.  
“PMIOS” – invalid.  
“VMIOS” – invalid.  
“WMIOS” – invalid.  
“XMIOS” – invalid.  
“YMIOS” – invalid.  
“ZMIOS” – invalid.

No valid words.

Next idea: maybe both O and M are in positions 1 and 2, but we already tried that and no word formed.

Realization: the only way to satisfy both O and M while using allowed letters is to have O in position 1 and M in position 4:
O _ I M S  
Need a letter for position 2.  
Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
“OPIMS” – invalid.  
“OGIM” – invalid.  
“OPIMS” – invalid.  
“OVIM” – invalid.  
“OWIMS” – invalid.  
“OXIMS” – invalid.  
“OYIMS” – invalid.  
“OZIMS” – invalid.

Still nothing.

Alternative: maybe the word has only one O and one M, and the “present” feedback simply confirms both are in the word (even if we don’t see their spots). But the feedback has always been clear: O and M must appear, but their exact spots are not known until the word is solved.

Let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

From all feedback:
- I is fixed at 3.  
- S is fixed at 5.  
- O must appear once, not in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – wait, that’s impossible; O must appear somewhere.  
  Re-read the feedback:  
  Guess 4: MOILS → M(-) O(-) I(✓) L(x) S(✓)  
  Guess 5: MISKS → M(-) I(-) S(-) K(x) S(✓)  
  The “S(-)” for MISKS means S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (which we already knew).  
  The “M(-)” for MISKS means M is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
  The “I(-)” for MISKS means I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which we already knew).  

  So the word must:
  - Have I in 3, S in 5.  
  - Contain both O and M.  
  - O cannot be in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – but that’s impossible; O must be somewhere.  
  This contradiction means our only possible interpretation is that the word contains **exactly one O and one M**, and the “present” feedback simply confirms they are in the word (while their exact positions remain unknown).

  Therefore the word must be of the form: _ _ I _ S, contain O and M, and O can only be in position 2 (since 1,3,4,5 are excluded).

  So the word must be: _ O I _ S  
  But position 4 must be filled by M (since O is in 2).  
  So the word is: _ O I M S  

  First letter: choose from allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  “BOIMS” – invalid.  
  “FOIMS” – invalid.

  “WOIMS” – invalid.  
  “XOIMS” – invalid.  
  “YOIMS” – invalid.  
  “ZOIMS” – invalid.

  No valid words.

  Realization: the only remaining possibility is that the word is “IMPS” – but that’s 5 letters and contains I, M, P, S.  
  Check constraints:
  - I in 3, S in 5.  
  - Contains M and the required O.  
  - O is in position 2 (allowed).  
  - M is in position 1 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 1 in MOILS, but here it’s in 1 again – wait, that’s not allowed; in MOILS, M was in 1 and got “-”, so M cannot be in 1.  

  Therefore the only possible layout is:  
  O must be in position 2, and M must be in position 4.  
  So the word is: _ O I M S  

  As before, the first letter must be from the still-allowed set.  
  “B O I M S” – invalid.

  Real valid word: “HOMIS” – but it’s not standard.

  Let’s try O in position 5, but O cannot be in 5 (from MOILS feedback: O(-) in position 2 of MOILS implies O is not in 2, but no restriction on 5).  
  Wait, MOILS had O in position 2 and got “-”, so O cannot be in 2.  
  From STOIC: O(-) in position 3.  
  From AROSE: O(-) in position 3.  
  From SOUND: O(-) in position 2.  
  From MOILS: O(-) in position 2.  
  From STOIC: O(-) in position 3.  
  From MISKS: O not shown.  
  So O can only be in position 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are excluded).

  And M must be in 1,2, or 4, but:
  - In MOILS: M in 1 → M(-) ⇒ M not in 1.  
  - In MISKS: M in 1 → M(-) ⇒ M not in 1.  
  This confirms M cannot be in 1.

  Therefore M must be in 2 or 4.

  Case A: M in 2  
  Pattern: _ M I _ S  
  O must be in 1 or 4.  
  O in 1: O M I _ S → need letter for position 4.
