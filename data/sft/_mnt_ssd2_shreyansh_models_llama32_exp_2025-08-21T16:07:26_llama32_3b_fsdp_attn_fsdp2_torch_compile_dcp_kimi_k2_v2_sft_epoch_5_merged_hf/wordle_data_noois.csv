For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5). We also want to avoid A, R, and E.

A good next guess would be something like “CLOUD” but that has no S. “SPOIL” has S in position 1 and O in position 3, and uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (P, I, L). Let’s try that.

However, “SPOIL” might be too obscure. Another option is “STOCK” – but it has R which we know is not in the word. “SOUND” has R too. “SLOTH” has H which is untested but let’s see if there’s a better option.

Actually, “SPOIL” seems fine – it’s a valid word, uses new letters (P, I, L), and fits the constraints. But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (but H is less common). “SPOIL” is a better choice.

Wait, let me think of a word with more common remaining consonants. “SPOIL” is okay, but let’s try “SPOIL” or “SLOSH”. 

Another option: “SPOIL” is valid, but let’s also consider “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”. 

Actually, “SPOIL” is good, but let me look for a word with S not in position 4 and O in position 3. 

A better word might be “SPOIL” (S-P-O-I-L), but let me think of another. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Let’s go with “SPOIL” as it uses P, I, L – all new letters.

But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (S-L-O-S-H). This has S in position 1 and 4, but we know S can’t be in position 4 (from feedback). So that’s out.

So “SPOIL” seems best.

But let me think of another word. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Actually, let me try “SPOIL” as it’s valid and fits.

But to be more objective, let me look up valid 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. 

“SPOIL” is valid (meaning to rip out or a wedge). It fits the constraints: O in position 3, S in position 1 (not 4), and uses new letters (P, I, L).

So I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
3. The word contains an I (✓ in SPOIL), but we don’t yet know what letter is in position 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ I

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 is excluded and 3 is taken by O).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has I in position 4 or 5.
- Has S in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, P, L).

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

- S _ O _ I: but S can’t be in position 1 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
- _ S O _ I: possible. Example: “CHOIR” has C, H, O, I, R – but R is excluded. “FROST” – R excluded. “TOXIC” – X, C allowed. But we don’t know about X yet.
- _ _ O S I: possible. Example: “MOSIS” – but S is in position 4, and I is in position 5. Is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common. “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D and S are allowed, but double S is unusual.
- _ _ O _ S: possible. Example: “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. T, N, I, S allowed. Is “TIONS” valid? It’s a variant spelling, but may not be common.

Another approach: look for common words. 

A common word fitting: “TOXIC” – but we haven’t tested T, X, C yet. Let’s see if it fits: T, O, X, I, C. O is in 3, I is in 4, and S is missing. Wait, we need S. 

Another common word: “FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T. F, I, S, T allowed. S is in position 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). I is in position 3, but O must be in position 3. So “FOIST” is invalid because I is in position 3, not 4.

Another: “WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is excluded. 

“MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. This fits: S not in 1 (ok), O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. M, O, S, I, S. 

But is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common.

Another: “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D allowed, O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. Valid word.

Between “MOSIS” and “DOSIS”, “DOSIS” is more common (referring to radiation therapy).

But let me try “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. O in 3, I in 2 (but we thought I is in 4 or 5 from SPOIL). Wait, SPOIL had I in 4 (✓), so in “TIONS” I is in 2, which conflicts. So “TIONS” is invalid because I must be in 4 or 5.

So possible words:
- _ S O _ I: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4. Example: “CHOIR” – R excluded, C, H allowed. “CHOIR” is valid, but R is excluded. So invalid.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid.
- _ _ O _ S: S in 5, O in 3, I in 2 or 4. Example: “TOXIC” – but I is in 4, O in 3, but S is missing. Wait, “TOXIC” is T, O, X, I, C – no S. So invalid.

Another: “FROST” – R excluded.

“DOSIS” is the best fit so far: D, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. D, O, S, I, S. All letters allowed (D, O, S, I, S), and S is in 2 and 5 (not 4), which is allowed.

But let me try “MOSIS” to test M and N.

Actually, “DOSIS” is more common, so let’s go with that.

But wait, “DOSIS” has S in 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). But in “DOSIS” S is in 4, which is fine. However, we have S in 5 in “MOSIS”, but that would conflict with SPOIL feedback (S not in 4, but can be in 5). 

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SPOIL: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1. From AROSE: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4. So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

From SPOIL: I(✓) means I is in word and in position 4. So position 4 is I.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O I _ or _ _ O _ I, with S in 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- _ S O I _: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. But we have two S’s, which is allowed. Example: “VSOS” – but V, S, O, S, O. Not matching.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid word.

Another: “LOSIS” – L excluded.

“NOSIS” – N, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“GOSIS” – G, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“HOSIS” – not a word.

“MOSIS” – valid (as in mos Eis, but not common).

“NOSIS” is more common.

Let me choose “NOSIS”.

Check:
- N, O, S, I, S.
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓ (from SPOIL feedback)
- S in 2 and 5: allowed (S not in 1 or 4)
- Letters used: N, O, S, I, S – all allowed (N, O, S, I, S), and no excluded letters.

Thus, “NOSIS” is a valid guess.
</think>

<guess>NOSIS</guess>",NOSIS,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
3. The word contains an I (✓ in SPOIL), but we don’t yet know what letter is in position 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ I

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 is excluded and 3 is taken by O).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has I in position 4 or 5.
- Has S in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, P, L).

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

- S _ O _ I: but S can’t be in position 1 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
- _ S O _ I: possible. Example: “CHOIR” has C, H, O, I, R – but R is excluded. “FROST” – R excluded. “TOXIC” – X, C allowed. But we don’t know about X yet.
- _ _ O S I: possible. Example: “MOSIS” – but S is in position 4, and I is in position 5. Is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common. “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D and S are allowed, but double S is unusual.
- _ _ O _ S: possible. Example: “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. T, N, I, S allowed. Is “TIONS” valid? It’s a variant spelling, but may not be common.

Another approach: look for common words. 

A common word fitting: “TOXIC” – but we haven’t tested T, X, C yet. Let’s see if it fits: T, O, X, I, C. O is in 3, I is in 4, and S is missing. Wait, we need S. 

Another common word: “FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T. F, I, S, T allowed. S is in position 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). I is in position 3, but O must be in position 3. So “FOIST” is invalid because I is in position 3, not 4.

Another: “WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is excluded. 

“MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. This fits: S not in 1 (ok), O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. M, O, S, I, S. 

But is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common.

Another: “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D allowed, O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. Valid word.

Between “MOSIS” and “DOSIS”, “DOSIS” is more common (referring to radiation therapy).

But let me try “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. O in 3, I in 2 (but we thought I is in 4 or 5 from SPOIL). Wait, SPOIL had I in 4 (✓), so in “TIONS” I is in 2, which conflicts. So “TIONS” is invalid because I must be in 4 or 5.

So possible words:
- _ S O _ I: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4. Example: “CHOIR” – R excluded, C, H allowed. “CHOIR” is valid, but R is excluded. So invalid.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid.
- _ _ O _ S: S in 5, O in 3, I in 2 or 4. Example: “TOXIC” – but I is in 4, O in 3, but S is missing. Wait, “TOXIC” is T, O, X, I, C – no S. So invalid.

Another: “FROST” – R excluded.

“DOSIS” is the best fit so far: D, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. D, O, S, I, S. All letters allowed (D, O, S, I, S), and S is in 2 and 5 (not 4), which is allowed.

But let me try “MOSIS” to test M and N.

Actually, “DOSIS” is more common, so let’s go with that.

But wait, “DOSIS” has S in 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). But in “DOSIS” S is in 4, which is fine. However, we have S in 5 in “MOSIS”, but that would conflict with SPOIL feedback (S not in 4, but can be in 5). 

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SPOIL: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1. From AROSE: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4. So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

From SPOIL: I(✓) means I is in word and in position 4. So position 4 is I.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O I _ or _ _ O _ I, with S in 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- _ S O I _: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. But we have two S’s, which is allowed. Example: “VSOS” – but V, S, O, S, O. Not matching.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid word.

Another: “LOSIS” – L excluded.

“NOSIS” – N, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“GOSIS” – G, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“HOSIS” – not a word.

“MOSIS” – valid (as in mos Eis, but not common).

“NOSIS” is more common.

- S in 2 and 5: allowed (S not in 1 or 4)
- Letters used: N, O, S, I, S – all allowed (N, O, S, I, S), and no excluded letters.

Thus, “NOSIS” is a valid guess.",Guess 3: NOSIS -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) S(-) I(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5). We also want to avoid A, R, and E.

A good next guess would be something like “CLOUD” but that has no S. “SPOIL” has S in position 1 and O in position 3, and uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (P, I, L). Let’s try that.

However, “SPOIL” might be too obscure. Another option is “STOCK” – but it has R which we know is not in the word. “SOUND” has R too. “SLOTH” has H which is untested but let’s see if there’s a better option.

Actually, “SPOIL” seems fine – it’s a valid word, uses new letters (P, I, L), and fits the constraints. But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (but H is less common). “SPOIL” is a better choice.

Wait, let me think of a word with more common remaining consonants. “SPOIL” is okay, but let’s try “SPOIL” or “SLOSH”. 

Another option: “SPOIL” is valid, but let’s also consider “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”. 

Actually, “SPOIL” is good, but let me look for a word with S not in position 4 and O in position 3. 

A better word might be “SPOIL” (S-P-O-I-L), but let me think of another. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Let’s go with “SPOIL” as it uses P, I, L – all new letters.

But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (S-L-O-S-H). This has S in position 1 and 4, but we know S can’t be in position 4 (from feedback). So that’s out.

So “SPOIL” seems best.

But let me think of another word. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Actually, let me try “SPOIL” as it’s valid and fits.

But to be more objective, let me look up valid 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. 

“SPOIL” is valid (meaning to rip out or a wedge). It fits the constraints: O in position 3, S in position 1 (not 4), and uses new letters (P, I, L).

So I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

<guess>SPOIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(✓) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
3. The word contains an I (✓ in SPOIL), but we don’t yet know what letter is in position 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ I

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 is excluded and 3 is taken by O).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has I in position 4 or 5.
- Has S in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, P, L).

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

- S _ O _ I: but S can’t be in position 1 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
- _ S O _ I: possible. Example: “CHOIR” has C, H, O, I, R – but R is excluded. “FROST” – R excluded. “TOXIC” – X, C allowed. But we don’t know about X yet.
- _ _ O S I: possible. Example: “MOSIS” – but S is in position 4, and I is in position 5. Is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common. “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D and S are allowed, but double S is unusual.
- _ _ O _ S: possible. Example: “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. T, N, I, S allowed. Is “TIONS” valid? It’s a variant spelling, but may not be common.

Another approach: look for common words. 

A common word fitting: “TOXIC” – but we haven’t tested T, X, C yet. Let’s see if it fits: T, O, X, I, C. O is in 3, I is in 4, and S is missing. Wait, we need S. 

Another common word: “FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T. F, I, S, T allowed. S is in position 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). I is in position 3, but O must be in position 3. So “FOIST” is invalid because I is in position 3, not 4.

Another: “WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is excluded. 

“MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. This fits: S not in 1 (ok), O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. M, O, S, I, S. 

But is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common.

Another: “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D allowed, O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. Valid word.

Between “MOSIS” and “DOSIS”, “DOSIS” is more common (referring to radiation therapy).

But let me try “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. O in 3, I in 2 (but we thought I is in 4 or 5 from SPOIL). Wait, SPOIL had I in 4 (✓), so in “TIONS” I is in 2, which conflicts. So “TIONS” is invalid because I must be in 4 or 5.

So possible words:
- _ S O _ I: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4. Example: “CHOIR” – R excluded, C, H allowed. “CHOIR” is valid, but R is excluded. So invalid.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid.
- _ _ O _ S: S in 5, O in 3, I in 2 or 4. Example: “TOXIC” – but I is in 4, O in 3, but S is missing. Wait, “TOXIC” is T, O, X, I, C – no S. So invalid.

Another: “FROST” – R excluded.

“DOSIS” is the best fit so far: D, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. D, O, S, I, S. All letters allowed (D, O, S, I, S), and S is in 2 and 5 (not 4), which is allowed.

But let me try “MOSIS” to test M and N.

Actually, “DOSIS” is more common, so let’s go with that.

But wait, “DOSIS” has S in 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). But in “DOSIS” S is in 4, which is fine. However, we have S in 5 in “MOSIS”, but that would conflict with SPOIL feedback (S not in 4, but can be in 5). 

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SPOIL: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1. From AROSE: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4. So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

From SPOIL: I(✓) means I is in word and in position 4. So position 4 is I.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O I _ or _ _ O _ I, with S in 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- _ S O I _: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. But we have two S’s, which is allowed. Example: “VSOS” – but V, S, O, S, O. Not matching.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid word.

Another: “LOSIS” – L excluded.

“NOSIS” – N, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“GOSIS” – G, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“HOSIS” – not a word.

“MOSIS” – valid (as in mos Eis, but not common).

“NOSIS” is more common.

Let me choose “NOSIS”.

Check:
- N, O, S, I, S.
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓ (from SPOIL feedback)
- S in 2 and 5: allowed (S not in 1 or 4)
- Letters used: N, O, S, I, S – all allowed (N, O, S, I, S), and no excluded letters.

Wait, let me re-express:

- N in 1: ✓
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓

Wait, let me re-interpret:

NOSIS feedback:
N(✓) – N is correct in position 1.
O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.
S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3 (already O).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5). We also want to avoid A, R, and E.

A good next guess would be something like “CLOUD” but that has no S. “SPOIL” has S in position 1 and O in position 3, and uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (P, I, L). Let’s try that.

However, “SPOIL” might be too obscure. Another option is “STOCK” – but it has R which we know is not in the word. “SOUND” has R too. “SLOTH” has H which is untested but let’s see if there’s a better option.

Actually, “SPOIL” seems fine – it’s a valid word, uses new letters (P, I, L), and fits the constraints. But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (but H is less common). “SPOIL” is a better choice.

Wait, let me think of a word with more common remaining consonants. “SPOIL” is okay, but let’s try “SPOIL” or “SLOSH”. 

Another option: “SPOIL” is valid, but let’s also consider “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”. 

Actually, “SPOIL” is good, but let me look for a word with S not in position 4 and O in position 3. 

A better word might be “SPOIL” (S-P-O-I-L), but let me think of another. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Let’s go with “SPOIL” as it uses P, I, L – all new letters.

But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (S-L-O-S-H). This has S in position 1 and 4, but we know S can’t be in position 4 (from feedback). So that’s out.

So “SPOIL” seems best.

But let me think of another word. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Actually, let me try “SPOIL” as it’s valid and fits.

But to be more objective, let me look up valid 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. 

“SPOIL” is valid (meaning to rip out or a wedge). It fits the constraints: O in position 3, S in position 1 (not 4), and uses new letters (P, I, L).

So I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

<guess>SPOIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(✓) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
3. The word contains an I (✓ in SPOIL), but we don’t yet know what letter is in position 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ I

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 is excluded and 3 is taken by O).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has I in position 4 or 5.
- Has S in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, P, L).

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

- S _ O _ I: but S can’t be in position 1 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
- _ S O _ I: possible. Example: “CHOIR” has C, H, O, I, R – but R is excluded. “FROST” – R excluded. “TOXIC” – X, C allowed. But we don’t know about X yet.
- _ _ O S I: possible. Example: “MOSIS” – but S is in position 4, and I is in position 5. Is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common. “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D and S are allowed, but double S is unusual.
- _ _ O _ S: possible. Example: “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. T, N, I, S allowed. Is “TIONS” valid? It’s a variant spelling, but may not be common.

Another approach: look for common words. 

A common word fitting: “TOXIC” – but we haven’t tested T, X, C yet. Let’s see if it fits: T, O, X, I, C. O is in 3, I is in 4, and S is missing. Wait, we need S. 

Another common word: “FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T. F, I, S, T allowed. S is in position 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). I is in position 3, but O must be in position 3. So “FOIST” is invalid because I is in position 3, not 4.

Another: “WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is excluded. 

“MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. This fits: S not in 1 (ok), O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. M, O, S, I, S. 

But is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common.

Another: “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D allowed, O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. Valid word.

Between “MOSIS” and “DOSIS”, “DOSIS” is more common (referring to radiation therapy).

But let me try “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. O in 3, I in 2 (but we thought I is in 4 or 5 from SPOIL). Wait, SPOIL had I in 4 (✓), so in “TIONS” I is in 2, which conflicts. So “TIONS” is invalid because I must be in 4 or 5.

So possible words:
- _ S O _ I: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4. Example: “CHOIR” – R excluded, C, H allowed. “CHOIR” is valid, but R is excluded. So invalid.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid.
- _ _ O _ S: S in 5, O in 3, I in 2 or 4. Example: “TOXIC” – but I is in 4, O in 3, but S is missing. Wait, “TOXIC” is T, O, X, I, C – no S. So invalid.

Another: “FROST” – R excluded.

“DOSIS” is the best fit so far: D, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. D, O, S, I, S. All letters allowed (D, O, S, I, S), and S is in 2 and 5 (not 4), which is allowed.

But let me try “MOSIS” to test M and N.

Actually, “DOSIS” is more common, so let’s go with that.

But wait, “DOSIS” has S in 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). But in “DOSIS” S is in 4, which is fine. However, we have S in 5 in “MOSIS”, but that would conflict with SPOIL feedback (S not in 4, but can be in 5). 

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SPOIL: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1. From AROSE: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4. So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

From SPOIL: I(✓) means I is in word and in position 4. So position 4 is I.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O I _ or _ _ O _ I, with S in 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- _ S O I _: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. But we have two S’s, which is allowed. Example: “VSOS” – but V, S, O, S, O. Not matching.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid word.

Another: “LOSIS” – L excluded.

“NOSIS” – N, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“GOSIS” – G, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“HOSIS” – not a word.

“MOSIS” – valid (as in mos Eis, but not common).

“NOSIS” is more common.

Let me choose “NOSIS”.

Check:
- N, O, S, I, S.
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓ (from SPOIL feedback)
- S in 2 and 5: allowed (S not in 1 or 4)
- Letters used: N, O, S, I, S – all allowed (N, O, S, I, S), and no excluded letters.

Thus, “NOSIS” is a valid guess.

1. Position 3 must be O (✓ in both AROSE and NOSIS).
2. The word contains I (✓ in SPOIL and NOSIS).
3. The word contains S (S(-) in NOSIS means S is in the word but not in position 3; S(✓) in NOSIS means S is in position 5).
4. The word contains N (✓ in NOSIS).
5. Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, P, L, and also S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from S(-) in AROSE and NOSIS), and position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 5 (confirmed by S(✓) in NOSIS).
6. Current known pattern: N _ O I S (positions 1,3,4,5 determined: N(1), O(3), I(4), S(5)).

We need a 5-letter word matching N _ O I S. The only missing letter is position 2.

- NGOIS – not valid.
- NTOIS – not valid.
- NDOIS – not valid.
- NBOIS – not valid.

Wait, let me think of actual words. The only common word fitting N _ O I S is “NOVIS” – but V is untested and not excluded. However, “NOVIS” is a bit obscure.

Another possibility: “NDOIS” – not valid.

Actually, the only valid common word is “NOVIS” (meaning a visitation), but it’s rare. 

Let me double-check: is there another common word? 

Yes! “NORTH” – but R is excluded (from AROSE). 

“NOMIS” – not valid.

“NOCIS” – not valid.

“NAVIS” – not valid.

“NAPIS” – P excluded.

“NABIS” – B is allowed, but “NABIS” is not a common word.

“NADIS” – A excluded.

“NAVIS” – A excluded.

“NICOS” – C, O, S – but position 4 is I, so “NICOS” is N, I, C, O, S. This fits: N(1), I(2), C(3), O(4), S(5). But position 4 must be I (from NOSIS feedback), so “NICOS” is invalid because O must be in position 3, not 4.

Wait, let me re-express:

From NOSIS feedback: N(✓), O(✓), S(-), I(✓), S(✓). This means:
- N in 1: ✓
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓
- S in 5: ✓
- S in 2: not confirmed, but S(-) in NOSIS means S is in word but not in 3 (already O), so S must be in 5 (confirmed), and the other S in NOSIS (position 2) is not part of the main word, but rather a duplicate S indicating the word has two S’s. However, this seems unlikely.

Wait, let me re-interpret:

NOSIS feedback:
N(✓) – N is correct in position 1.
O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.
S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3 (already O).
I(✓) – I is correct in position 4.
S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word is: N _ O I S.

The only letter missing is position 2. 

Valid English words: “NOVIS” (rare), “NDOIS” (not valid), “NBOIS” (not valid), etc.

Actually, the only common word is “NOVIS”.

But let me think of another: “NICOS” – but O must be in 3, not 4.

Another: “NOCIS” – not valid.

“NAVIS” – not valid.

“NABIS” – not valid.

“NAPIS” – P excluded.

“NAVIS” – A excluded.

“NICOS” – invalid pattern.

“NDOIS” – not valid.

“NBOIS” – not valid.

“NHOIS” – not valid.

“NGOIS” – not valid.

“KOSIS” – K is allowed: K, O, S, I, S. But position 2 is K, and word is KOSIS – but this is “KOSIS”, which is a river in ancient Greece, but obscure.

“MOSIS” – M is allowed: M, O, S, I, S. But position 2 is M, and word is MOSIS – valid but rare.

“LOSIS” – L excluded.

“HOSIS” – not valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“TOXIS” – T, O, X, I, S. T is allowed, X is allowed. Word is TOXIS – valid.

“TOXIS” fits: T(1), O(3), X(2), I(4), S(5). But position 2 is X, which is allowed.

But is “TOXIS” the best?

Another: “DOXIS” – D is allowed: D, O, X, I, S. Word is DOXIS – valid.

“DOXIS” is a medical term.

“NOVIS” is also valid.

Between “DOXIS” and “NOVIS”, “DOXIS” is more medical, but “NOVIS” is more general.

“NOVIS” is the more common word.

Let me choose “NOVIS”.

But wait, let me check “NOVIS”:
N(✓) O(✓) V(new) I(✓) S(✓). This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “NOVIS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position and S somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5). We also want to avoid A, R, and E.

A good next guess would be something like “CLOUD” but that has no S. “SPOIL” has S in position 1 and O in position 3, and uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (P, I, L). Let’s try that.

However, “SPOIL” might be too obscure. Another option is “STOCK” – but it has R which we know is not in the word. “SOUND” has R too. “SLOTH” has H which is untested but let’s see if there’s a better option.

Actually, “SPOIL” seems fine – it’s a valid word, uses new letters (P, I, L), and fits the constraints. But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (but H is less common). “SPOIL” is a better choice.

Wait, let me think of a word with more common remaining consonants. “SPOIL” is okay, but let’s try “SPOIL” or “SLOSH”. 

Another option: “SPOIL” is valid, but let’s also consider “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”. 

Actually, “SPOIL” is good, but let me look for a word with S not in position 4 and O in position 3. 

A better word might be “SPOIL” (S-P-O-I-L), but let me think of another. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Let’s go with “SPOIL” as it uses P, I, L – all new letters.

But to maximize information, let’s also consider “SLOSH” (S-L-O-S-H). This has S in position 1 and 4, but we know S can’t be in position 4 (from feedback). So that’s out.

So “SPOIL” seems best.

But let me think of another word. 

How about “SPOIL” vs “SPOIL” vs “SLOSH”? 

Actually, let me try “SPOIL” as it’s valid and fits.

But to be more objective, let me look up valid 5-letter words with O in position 3 and S elsewhere. 

“SPOIL” is valid (meaning to rip out or a wedge). It fits the constraints: O in position 3, S in position 1 (not 4), and uses new letters (P, I, L).

So I’ll go with “SPOIL”.

<guess>SPOIL</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(✓) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. The word contains an S, but S is NOT in position 1 (from SPOIL feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
3. The word contains an I (✓ in SPOIL), but we don’t yet know what letter is in position 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ I

Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (since 1 is excluded and 3 is taken by O).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Has I in position 4 or 5.
- Has S in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, E, P, L).

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

- S _ O _ I: but S can’t be in position 1 (already excluded), so this is invalid.
- _ S O _ I: possible. Example: “CHOIR” has C, H, O, I, R – but R is excluded. “FROST” – R excluded. “TOXIC” – X, C allowed. But we don’t know about X yet.
- _ _ O S I: possible. Example: “MOSIS” – but S is in position 4, and I is in position 5. Is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common. “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D and S are allowed, but double S is unusual.
- _ _ O _ S: possible. Example: “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. T, N, I, S allowed. Is “TIONS” valid? It’s a variant spelling, but may not be common.

Another approach: look for common words. 

A common word fitting: “TOXIC” – but we haven’t tested T, X, C yet. Let’s see if it fits: T, O, X, I, C. O is in 3, I is in 4, and S is missing. Wait, we need S. 

Another common word: “FOIST” – F, O, I, S, T. F, I, S, T allowed. S is in position 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). I is in position 3, but O must be in position 3. So “FOIST” is invalid because I is in position 3, not 4.

Another: “WISPS” – W, I, S, P, S. P is excluded. 

“MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. This fits: S not in 1 (ok), O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. M, O, S, I, S. 

But is “MOSIS” valid? It’s a biological term, but may not be common.

Another: “DOSIS” – D, O, S, I, S. D allowed, O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. Valid word.

Between “MOSIS” and “DOSIS”, “DOSIS” is more common (referring to radiation therapy).

But let me try “TIONS” – T, I, O, N, S. O in 3, I in 2 (but we thought I is in 4 or 5 from SPOIL). Wait, SPOIL had I in 4 (✓), so in “TIONS” I is in 2, which conflicts. So “TIONS” is invalid because I must be in 4 or 5.

So possible words:
- _ S O _ I: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4. Example: “CHOIR” – R excluded, C, H allowed. “CHOIR” is valid, but R is excluded. So invalid.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid.
- _ _ O _ S: S in 5, O in 3, I in 2 or 4. Example: “TOXIC” – but I is in 4, O in 3, but S is missing. Wait, “TOXIC” is T, O, X, I, C – no S. So invalid.

Another: “FROST” – R excluded.

“DOSIS” is the best fit so far: D, O, S, I, S. O in 3, I in 4, S in 2 and 5. D, O, S, I, S. All letters allowed (D, O, S, I, S), and S is in 2 and 5 (not 4), which is allowed.

But let me try “MOSIS” to test M and N.

Actually, “DOSIS” is more common, so let’s go with that.

But wait, “DOSIS” has S in 4, which is allowed (S can be in 2, 4, 5). But in “DOSIS” S is in 4, which is fine. However, we have S in 5 in “MOSIS”, but that would conflict with SPOIL feedback (S not in 4, but can be in 5). 

Wait, let me re-examine:

From SPOIL: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 1. From AROSE: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4. So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

From SPOIL: I(✓) means I is in word and in position 4. So position 4 is I.

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O I _ or _ _ O _ I, with S in 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- _ S O I _: S in 2, O in 3, I in 4, S in 5. But we have two S’s, which is allowed. Example: “VSOS” – but V, S, O, S, O. Not matching.
- _ _ O S I: S in 4, O in 3, I in 5. Example: “MOSIS” – M, O, S, I, S. Valid word.

Another: “LOSIS” – L excluded.

“NOSIS” – N, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“GOSIS” – G, O, S, I, S. Valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“HOSIS” – not a word.

“MOSIS” – valid (as in mos Eis, but not common).

“NOSIS” is more common.

Let me choose “NOSIS”.

Check:
- N, O, S, I, S.
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓ (from SPOIL feedback)
- S in 2 and 5: allowed (S not in 1 or 4)
- Letters used: N, O, S, I, S – all allowed (N, O, S, I, S), and no excluded letters.

Thus, “NOSIS” is a valid guess.

<guess>NOSIS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: NOSIS -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) S(-) I(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 3 must be O (✓ in both AROSE and NOSIS).
2. The word contains I (✓ in SPOIL and NOSIS).
3. The word contains S (S(-) in NOSIS means S is in the word but not in position 3; S(✓) in NOSIS means S is in position 5).
4. The word contains N (✓ in NOSIS).
5. Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, P, L, and also S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from S(-) in AROSE and NOSIS), and position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 5 (confirmed by S(✓) in NOSIS).
6. Current known pattern: N _ O I S (positions 1,3,4,5 determined: N(1), O(3), I(4), S(5)).

We need a 5-letter word matching N _ O I S. The only missing letter is position 2. 

Valid English words matching N _ O I S:
- NFOIS – not valid.
- NGOIS – not valid.
- NTOIS – not valid.
- NDOIS – not valid.
- NBOIS – not valid.
- NHOIS – not valid.

Wait, let me think of actual words. The only common word fitting N _ O I S is “NOVIS” – but V is untested and not excluded. However, “NOVIS” is a bit obscure.

Another possibility: “NDOIS” – not valid.

Actually, the only valid common word is “NOVIS” (meaning a visitation), but it’s rare. 

Let me double-check: is there another common word? 

Yes! “NORTH” – but R is excluded (from AROSE). 

“NOMIS” – not valid.

“NOCIS” – not valid.

“NAVIS” – not valid.

“NAPIS” – P excluded.

“NABIS” – B is allowed, but “NABIS” is not a common word.

“NADIS” – A excluded.

“NAVIS” – A excluded.

“NICOS” – C, O, S – but position 4 is I, so “NICOS” is N, I, C, O, S. This fits: N(1), I(2), C(3), O(4), S(5). But position 4 must be I (from NOSIS feedback), so “NICOS” is invalid because O must be in position 3, not 4.

Wait, let me re-express:

From NOSIS feedback: N(✓), O(✓), S(-), I(✓), S(✓). This means:
- N in 1: ✓
- O in 3: ✓
- I in 4: ✓
- S in 5: ✓
- S in 2: not confirmed, but S(-) in NOSIS means S is in word but not in 3 (already O), so S must be in 5 (confirmed), and the other S in NOSIS (position 2) is not part of the main word, but rather a duplicate S indicating the word has two S’s. However, this seems unlikely.

Wait, let me re-interpret:

NOSIS feedback:
N(✓) – N is correct in position 1.
O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.
S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3 (already O).
I(✓) – I is correct in position 4.
S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word is: N _ O I S.

The only letter missing is position 2. 

Valid English words: “NOVIS” (rare), “NDOIS” (not valid), “NBOIS” (not valid), etc.

Actually, the only common word is “NOVIS”.

But let me think of another: “NICOS” – but O must be in 3, not 4.

Another: “NOCIS” – not valid.

“NAVIS” – not valid.

“NABIS” – not valid.

“NAPIS” – P excluded.

“NAVIS” – A excluded.

“NICOS” – invalid pattern.

“NDOIS” – not valid.

“NBOIS” – not valid.

“NHOIS” – not valid.

“NGOIS” – not valid.

“KOSIS” – K is allowed: K, O, S, I, S. But position 2 is K, and word is KOSIS – but this is “KOSIS”, which is a river in ancient Greece, but obscure.

“MOSIS” – M is allowed: M, O, S, I, S. But position 2 is M, and word is MOSIS – valid but rare.

“LOSIS” – L excluded.

“HOSIS” – not valid.

“POSIS” – P excluded.

“TOXIS” – T, O, X, I, S. T is allowed, X is allowed. Word is TOXIS – valid.

“TOXIS” fits: T(1), O(3), X(2), I(4), S(5). But position 2 is X, which is allowed.

But is “TOXIS” the best?

Another: “DOXIS” – D is allowed: D, O, X, I, S. Word is DOXIS – valid.

“DOXIS” is a medical term.

“NOVIS” is also valid.

Between “DOXIS” and “NOVIS”, “DOXIS” is more medical, but “NOVIS” is more general.

“NOVIS” is the more common word.

Let me choose “NOVIS”.

But wait, let me check “NOVIS”:
N(✓) O(✓) V(new) I(✓) S(✓). This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “NOVIS”.

<guess>NOVIS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: NOSIS -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) S(-) I(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: NOVIS -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) V(x) I(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback:

1. Positions known:
   - 1: N (✓)
   - 3: O (✓)
   - 4: I (✓)
   - 5: S (✓)

   So the word is: N _ O I S

2. Letters excluded so far:
   A, R, E, P, L, V (from NOVIS feedback: V(x))

3. Position 2 is the only unknown; it must be a letter not yet tested and not excluded.

4. Valid English words matching N _ O I S:
   - NOVIS (but V is excluded)
   - NDOIS (not valid)
   - NBOIS (not valid)
   - NHOIS (not valid)
   - NGOIS (not valid)
   - NTOIS (not valid)
   - NFOIS (not valid)

5. Remaining common letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, W, etc.

6. The only common valid word left is “NICOS”, but position 4 must be I (✓), and C would go in position 2: N I C O S. However, this conflicts because position 4 is I, not O. So “NICOS” is invalid for position 2.

7. Re-examining: the word must be N _ O I S with position 2 being a new letter not yet excluded.

8. Valid word: “NDOIS” – but not valid.
   “NBOIS” – not valid.
   “NHOIS” – not valid.
   “NGOIS” – not valid.
   “KOSIS” – obscure.
   “MOSIS” – obscure.
   “TOXIS” – T is allowed: T, O, X, I, S. Word is TOXIS – valid.

9. “TOXIS” fits: T(1), O(3), X(2), I(4), S(5). All letters are allowed (T, O, X, I, S), and V is excluded.

10. Therefore, the next guess is “TOXIS”.

From all feedback:

Known pattern: N _ O I S  
(Positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed as N-O-I-S)

Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, P, L, V, T, X  

Therefore the only remaining letter is position 2.  
Valid English words with N _ O I S:
- NDOIS – invalid  
- NBOIS – invalid  
- NHOIS – invalid  
- NGOIS – invalid  
- NTOIS – invalid  
- NFOIS – invalid  

The only common remaining consonant is “D”, giving “NDOIS” – which is not valid.  
Looking again, the only valid common word left is “NICOS”, but it would require C in position 2, conflicting with the I in position 4.

Realization: the only remaining valid common word is “NICOS”, but it would force position 2 to C, yet position 4 must be I. Therefore no common word remains under the given constraints. 

However, recalling the definition of “NDOIS” (a medical term), it is valid. 

Given that all other common options are excluded, “NDOIS” is the only remaining possibility.

Thus, the next guess is “NDOIS”.
