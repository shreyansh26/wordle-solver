### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some good candidates are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the new feedback on LEAST:
- L is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word looks like: _ E A _ _
- Contains S (not in position 4) and T (not in position 5).
- Does not contain R, O, L.

Letters already confirmed: E (pos 2), A (pos 3), S, T.
Letters to avoid: R, O, L.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1 or 5).
Possible positions for T: positions 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is E, so 1 or 4).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet used (avoiding R, O, L). Common remaining letters: N, I, C, D, P, etc.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If S is in position 1: S E A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ E A _ S

For S E A _ _, we need a letter for position 4 and 5. Common endings could be ""SEABS"" but that's not a word. ""SEAMS"" but that repeats S. ""SEATS"" but T is already confirmed not in position 5. ""SEAMY"" but Y is uncommon. 

For _ E A _ S, we need a letter for position 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (but T is in position 1, and we need to confirm if T can be in position 1 - feedback said T is in the word but wrong position, so T cannot be in position 5 but could be 1). However, ""TEAMS"" has T in 1 and 5s. 

Wait, T is confirmed not in position 5, so ""TEAMS"" would have T in 1 and 5 - possible but let's see better.

Better candidates:
- ""SEATS"" - but T is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""SEAMS"" - M is new, but S is already in position 1.
- ""PEASE"" - but E is already in position 2.
- ""CEST"" is only 4 letters.
- ""DEASH"" - but H is uncommon and not confirmed.

Looking at common 5-letter words: ""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used). ""SEATS"" invalid (T in 5). ""SEAMS"" invalid (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3, M in 4, S in 5 - but S can't be in 5).

Alternative approach: S must be in 1 or 5, T in 1 or 4.

If S E A _ _:
- Position 4 and 5 need T and another letter. Could be ""SEATS"" but T can't be in 5.
- ""SEAMY"" - Y possible.
- ""SEAP"" is 4 letters.

If _ E A _ S:
- Position 1 and 4 need letters. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But T is confirmed in the word but wrong position, so T in 1 is possible. Also, M is new.

""TEAMS"" fits:
- T in 1 (possible, since T is in the word but wrong position was 5).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (but S can't be in 5 from feedback - wait, feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, and in AROSE S was 4th, so 5th is possible). 

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback: S was 4th, feedback ""-"" means wrong position, so S can be 1,2,3,5. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 5.

Similarly, T was 5th in AROSE with feedback ""-"", so T can be 1,2,3,4. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 4.

So possible patterns:
1. S E A _ _ (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3)
2. _ E A _ S (E in 2, A in 3, S in 5)

For pattern 1: need letters for 4 and 5. Could be ""SEAMS"" (but S repeats). ""SEATS"" (T in 5 invalid). ""SEAMY"" (Y possible). 

For pattern 2: need letters for 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But S in 5 is allowed (only 4 was wrong before). Also, T in 1 is allowed (was 5 before).

""TEAMS"" seems valid:
- T in 1 (was 5 before, so possible).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, but 5 is new).

Let's check if ""TEAMS"" violates any rules: no, it uses T, E, A, M, S - all allowed letters, and positions T and S which were wrong before.

But wait, in AROSE, S was 4th with ""-"", so 5th is possible. T was 5th with ""-"", so 1st is possible. 

Another candidate: ""SEATS"" - but T in 5 is invalid.
""SEAMS"" - S repeats.

""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used).

""CEST"" is 4 letters.

""DEASH"" - H is uncommon.

""KEATS"" - K is possible, but T in 5 invalid.

""MEATS"" - M in 1, E in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. This fits:
- M new letter.
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, so 5 is new).

""MEATS"" seems good.

Let's verify:
- Letters: M, E, A, T, S.
- E in 2 (correct from feedback).
- A in 3 (correct from feedback).
- S in 5 (new position, allowed).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- No R, O, L.

Yes, ""MEATS"" is a valid guess.

Similarly, T was 5th in AROSE with feedback ""-"", so T can be 1,2,3,4. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 4.

So possible patterns:
1. S E A _ _ (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3)
2. _ E A _ S (E in 2, A in 3, S in 5)

For pattern 1: need letters for 4 and 5. Could be ""SEAMS"" (but S repeats). ""SEATS"" (T in 5 invalid). ""SEAMY"" (Y possible). 

For pattern 2: need letters for 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But S in 5 is allowed (only 4 was wrong before). Also, T in 1 is allowed (was 5 before).

""TEAMS"" seems valid:
- T in 1 (was 5 before, so possible).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, but 5 is new).

Let's check if ""TEAMS"" violates any rules: no, it uses T, E, A, M, S - all allowed letters, and positions T and S which were wrong before.

But wait, in AROSE, S was 4th with ""-"", so 5th is possible. T was 5th with ""-"", so 1st is possible. 

Another candidate: ""SEATS"" - but T in 5 is invalid.
""SEAMS"" - S repeats.

""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used).

""CEST"" is 4 letters.

""DEASH"" - H is uncommon.

""KEATS"" - K is possible, but T in 5 invalid.

""MEATS"" - M in 1, E in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. This fits:
- M new letter.
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, so 5 is new).

""MEATS"" seems good.

Let's verify:
- Letters: M, E, A, T, S.
- E in 2 (correct from feedback).
- A in 3 (correct from feedback).
- S in 5 (new position, allowed).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- No R, O, L.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some good candidates are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, S, E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids R and O entirely.
3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

Possible new letters to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Good candidates:
- STEAL (uses S, E, A but in new positions, and adds T, L)
- SEATS (but S is in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we want to test new positions for A, S, E)
- TASER (but contains R which is invalid)
- LEAST (uses A, S, E in new positions, adds L, T)

I'll go with ""LEAST"" as it uses A, S, E in new positions (A not first, S not fourth, E not fifth) and introduces L and T which are common letters.

<guess>LEAST</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(-) T(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LEAST:
- L is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word looks like: _ E A _ _
- Contains S (not in position 4) and T (not in position 5).
- Does not contain R, O, L.

Letters already confirmed: E (pos 2), A (pos 3), S, T.
Letters to avoid: R, O, L.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1 or 5).
Possible positions for T: positions 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is E, so 1 or 4).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet used (avoiding R, O, L). Common remaining letters: N, I, C, D, P, etc.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If S is in position 1: S E A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ E A _ S

For S E A _ _, we need a letter for position 4 and 5. Common endings could be ""SEABS"" but that's not a word. ""SEAMS"" but that repeats S. ""SEATS"" but T is already confirmed not in position 5. ""SEAMY"" but Y is uncommon. 

For _ E A _ S, we need a letter for position 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (but T is in position 1, and we need to confirm if T can be in position 1 - feedback said T is in the word but wrong position, so T cannot be in position 5 but could be 1). However, ""TEAMS"" has T in 1 and 5s. 

Wait, T is confirmed not in position 5, so ""TEAMS"" would have T in 1 and 5 - possible but let's see better.

Better candidates:
- ""SEATS"" - but T is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""SEAMS"" - M is new, but S is already in position 1.
- ""PEASE"" - but E is already in position 2.
- ""CEST"" is only 4 letters.
- ""DEASH"" - but H is uncommon and not confirmed.

Looking at common 5-letter words: ""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used). ""SEATS"" invalid (T in 5). ""SEAMS"" invalid (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3, M in 4, S in 5 - but S can't be in 5).

Alternative approach: S must be in 1 or 5, T in 1 or 4.

If S E A _ _:
- Position 4 and 5 need T and another letter. Could be ""SEATS"" but T can't be in 5.
- ""SEAMY"" - Y possible.
- ""SEAP"" is 4 letters.

If _ E A _ S:
- Position 1 and 4 need letters. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But T is confirmed in the word but wrong position, so T in 1 is possible. Also, M is new.

""TEAMS"" fits:
- T in 1 (possible, since T is in the word but wrong position was 5).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (but S can't be in 5 from feedback - wait, feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, and in AROSE S was 4th, so 5th is possible). 

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback: S was 4th, feedback ""-"" means wrong position, so S can be 1,2,3,5. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 5.

Similarly, T was 5th in AROSE with feedback ""-"", so T can be 1,2,3,4. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 4.

So possible patterns:
1. S E A _ _ (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3)
2. _ E A _ S (E in 2, A in 3, S in 5)

For pattern 1: need letters for 4 and 5. Could be ""SEAMS"" (but S repeats). ""SEATS"" (T in 5 invalid). ""SEAMY"" (Y possible). 

For pattern 2: need letters for 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But S in 5 is allowed (only 4 was wrong before). Also, T in 1 is allowed (was 5 before).

""TEAMS"" seems valid:
- T in 1 (was 5 before, so possible).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, but 5 is new).

Let's check if ""TEAMS"" violates any rules: no, it uses T, E, A, M, S - all allowed letters, and positions T and S which were wrong before.

But wait, in AROSE, S was 4th with ""-"", so 5th is possible. T was 5th with ""-"", so 1st is possible. 

Another candidate: ""SEATS"" - but T in 5 is invalid.
""SEAMS"" - S repeats.

""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used).

""CEST"" is 4 letters.

""DEASH"" - H is uncommon.

""KEATS"" - K is possible, but T in 5 invalid.

""MEATS"" - M in 1, E in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. This fits:
- M new letter.
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, so 5 is new).

""MEATS"" seems good.

Let's verify:
- Letters: M, E, A, T, S.
- E in 2 (correct from feedback).
- A in 3 (correct from feedback).
- S in 5 (new position, allowed).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- No R, O, L.

Yes, ""MEATS"" is a valid guess.

1. Uses A, S, E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids R and O entirely.
3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

Possible new letters to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Good candidates:
- STEAL (uses S, E, A but in new positions, and adds T, L)
- SEATS (but S is in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we want to test new positions for A, S, E)
- TASER (but contains R which is invalid)
- LEAST (uses A, S, E in new positions, adds L, T)

I'll go with ""LEAST"" as it uses A, S, E in new positions (A not first, S not fourth, E not fifth) and introduces L and T which are common letters.

<guess>LEAST</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(-) T(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LEAST:
- L is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word looks like: _ E A _ _
- Contains S (not in position 4) and T (not in position 5).
- Does not contain R, O, L.

Letters already confirmed: E (pos 2), A (pos 3), S, T.
Letters to avoid: R, O, L.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1 or 5).
Possible positions for T: positions 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is E, so 1 or 4).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet used (avoiding R, O, L). Common remaining letters: N, I, C, D, P, etc.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If S is in position 1: S E A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ E A _ S

For S E A _ _, we need a letter for position 4 and 5. Common endings could be ""SEABS"" but that's not a word. ""SEAMS"" but that repeats S. ""SEATS"" but T is already confirmed not in position 5. ""SEAMY"" but Y is uncommon. 

For _ E A _ S, we need a letter for position 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (but T is in position 1, and we need to confirm if T can be in position 1 - feedback said T is in the word but wrong position, so T cannot be in position 5 but could be 1). However, ""TEAMS"" has T in 1 and 5s. 

Wait, T is confirmed not in position 5, so ""TEAMS"" would have T in 1 and 5 - possible but let's see better.

Better candidates:
- ""SEATS"" - but T is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""SEAMS"" - M is new, but S is already in position 1.
- ""PEASE"" - but E is already in position 2.
- ""CEST"" is only 4 letters.
- ""DEASH"" - but H is uncommon and not confirmed.

Looking at common 5-letter words: ""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used). ""SEATS"" invalid (T in 5). ""SEAMS"" invalid (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3, M in 4, S in 5 - but S can't be in 5).

Alternative approach: S must be in 1 or 5, T in 1 or 4.

If S E A _ _:
- Position 4 and 5 need T and another letter. Could be ""SEATS"" but T can't be in 5.
- ""SEAMY"" - Y possible.
- ""SEAP"" is 4 letters.

If _ E A _ S:
- Position 1 and 4 need letters. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But T is confirmed in the word but wrong position, so T in 1 is possible. Also, M is new.

""TEAMS"" fits:
- T in 1 (possible, since T is in the word but wrong position was 5).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (but S can't be in 5 from feedback - wait, feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, and in AROSE S was 4th, so 5th is possible). 

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback: S was 4th, feedback ""-"" means wrong position, so S can be 1,2,3,5. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 5.

Similarly, T was 5th in AROSE with feedback ""-"", so T can be 1,2,3,4. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 4.

So possible patterns:
1. S E A _ _ (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3)
2. _ E A _ S (E in 2, A in 3, S in 5)

For pattern 1: need letters for 4 and 5. Could be ""SEAMS"" (but S repeats). ""SEATS"" (T in 5 invalid). ""SEAMY"" (Y possible). 

For pattern 2: need letters for 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But S in 5 is allowed (only 4 was wrong before). Also, T in 1 is allowed (was 5 before).

""TEAMS"" seems valid:
- T in 1 (was 5 before, so possible).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, but 5 is new).

Let's check if ""TEAMS"" violates any rules: no, it uses T, E, A, M, S - all allowed letters, and positions T and S which were wrong before.

But wait, in AROSE, S was 4th with ""-"", so 5th is possible. T was 5th with ""-"", so 1st is possible. 

Another candidate: ""SEATS"" - but T in 5 is invalid.
""SEAMS"" - S repeats.

""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used).

""CEST"" is 4 letters.

""DEASH"" - H is uncommon.

""KEATS"" - K is possible, but T in 5 invalid.

""MEATS"" - M in 1, E in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. This fits:
- M new letter.
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, so 5 is new).

""MEATS"" seems good.

Let's verify:
- Letters: M, E, A, T, S.
- E in 2 (correct from feedback).
- A in 3 (correct from feedback).
- S in 5 (new position, allowed).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- No R, O, L.

Yes, ""MEATS"" is a valid guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(-) T(-)
Guess 3: MEATS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on MEATS:
- M is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So the secret word is now fully determined: _ E A T S.

We just need to find the first letter. Letters already used or confirmed: E, A, T, S. Letters not used yet that are allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words ending in EATS:
- BEATS
- FEATS
- HEATS
- NEATS
- PEATS
- SEATS (but S is already at 5)
- TEATS
- WAITS (but I is possible)

Looking at these, ""BEATS"" is a common word and fits:
- B is new and allowed.
- E, A, T, S are already confirmed in their positions.

No conflicts with previous feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Some good candidates are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, S, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, S, E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids R and O entirely.
3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

Possible new letters to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

Good candidates:
- STEAL (uses S, E, A but in new positions, and adds T, L)
- SEATS (but S is in position 1 which was not ruled out, but we want to test new positions for A, S, E)
- TASER (but contains R which is invalid)
- LEAST (uses A, S, E in new positions, adds L, T)

I'll go with ""LEAST"" as it uses A, S, E in new positions (A not first, S not fourth, E not fifth) and introduces L and T which are common letters.

Guess 2: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(-) T(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LEAST:
- L is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word looks like: _ E A _ _
- Contains S (not in position 4) and T (not in position 5).
- Does not contain R, O, L.

Letters already confirmed: E (pos 2), A (pos 3), S, T.
Letters to avoid: R, O, L.

Possible positions for S: positions 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1 or 5).
Possible positions for T: positions 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is E, so 1 or 4).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet used (avoiding R, O, L). Common remaining letters: N, I, C, D, P, etc.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If S is in position 1: S E A _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ E A _ S

For S E A _ _, we need a letter for position 4 and 5. Common endings could be ""SEABS"" but that's not a word. ""SEAMS"" but that repeats S. ""SEATS"" but T is already confirmed not in position 5. ""SEAMY"" but Y is uncommon. 

For _ E A _ S, we need a letter for position 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (but T is in position 1, and we need to confirm if T can be in position 1 - feedback said T is in the word but wrong position, so T cannot be in position 5 but could be 1). However, ""TEAMS"" has T in 1 and 5s. 

Wait, T is confirmed not in position 5, so ""TEAMS"" would have T in 1 and 5 - possible but let's see better.

Better candidates:
- ""SEATS"" - but T is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""SEAMS"" - M is new, but S is already in position 1.
- ""PEASE"" - but E is already in position 2.
- ""CEST"" is only 4 letters.
- ""DEASH"" - but H is uncommon and not confirmed.

Looking at common 5-letter words: ""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used). ""SEATS"" invalid (T in 5). ""SEAMS"" invalid (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3, M in 4, S in 5 - but S can't be in 5).

Alternative approach: S must be in 1 or 5, T in 1 or 4.

If S E A _ _:
- Position 4 and 5 need T and another letter. Could be ""SEATS"" but T can't be in 5.
- ""SEAMY"" - Y possible.
- ""SEAP"" is 4 letters.

If _ E A _ S:
- Position 1 and 4 need letters. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But T is confirmed in the word but wrong position, so T in 1 is possible. Also, M is new.

""TEAMS"" fits:
- T in 1 (possible, since T is in the word but wrong position was 5).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (but S can't be in 5 from feedback - wait, feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, and in AROSE S was 4th, so 5th is possible). 

Wait, let me re-examine AROSE feedback: S was 4th, feedback ""-"" means wrong position, so S can be 1,2,3,5. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 5.

Similarly, T was 5th in AROSE with feedback ""-"", so T can be 1,2,3,4. But 2 is E, 3 is A, so 1 or 4.

So possible patterns:
1. S E A _ _ (S in 1, E in 2, A in 3)
2. _ E A _ S (E in 2, A in 3, S in 5)

For pattern 1: need letters for 4 and 5. Could be ""SEAMS"" (but S repeats). ""SEATS"" (T in 5 invalid). ""SEAMY"" (Y possible). 

For pattern 2: need letters for 1 and 4. Could be ""TEAMS"" (T in 1, M in 4, S in 5). But S in 5 is allowed (only 4 was wrong before). Also, T in 1 is allowed (was 5 before).

""TEAMS"" seems valid:
- T in 1 (was 5 before, so possible).
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- M in 4 (new letter).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, but 5 is new).

Let's check if ""TEAMS"" violates any rules: no, it uses T, E, A, M, S - all allowed letters, and positions T and S which were wrong before.

But wait, in AROSE, S was 4th with ""-"", so 5th is possible. T was 5th with ""-"", so 1st is possible. 

Another candidate: ""SEATS"" - but T in 5 is invalid.
""SEAMS"" - S repeats.

""PEASE"" is invalid (E already used).

""CEST"" is 4 letters.

""DEASH"" - H is uncommon.

""KEATS"" - K is possible, but T in 5 invalid.

""MEATS"" - M in 1, E in 2, A in 3, T in 4, S in 5. This fits:
- M new letter.
- E in 2 (correct).
- A in 3 (correct).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- S in 5 (was 4 before, so 5 is new).

""MEATS"" seems good.

Let's verify:
- Letters: M, E, A, T, S.
- E in 2 (correct from feedback).
- A in 3 (correct from feedback).
- S in 5 (new position, allowed).
- T in 4 (was 5 before, so possible).
- No R, O, L.

Yes, ""MEATS"" is a valid guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: MEATS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on MEATS:
- M is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So the secret word is now fully determined: _ E A T S.

We just need to find the first letter. Letters already used or confirmed: E, A, T, S. Letters not used yet that are allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words ending in EATS:
- BEATS
- FEATS
- HEATS
- NEATS
- PEATS
- SEATS (but S is already at 5)
- TEATS
- WAITS (but I is possible)

Looking at these, ""BEATS"" is a common word and fits:
- B is new and allowed.
- E, A, T, S are already confirmed in their positions.

No conflicts with previous feedback.

From the latest feedback on BEATS:
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- E, A, T, S are all in their correct positions (✓).

So the word is now: _ E A T S

We know:
- Position 1 cannot be B, M, R, O, L (from previous guesses).
- Other letters already used/confirmed: E, A, T, S.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E A T S where ? is not B, M, R, O, L.

Common letters left for position 1: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, T, W, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ E A T S:
- CEATS (not a word)
- DEATS (not a word)
- FEATS (valid word)
- HEATS (valid word)
- NEATS (valid word)
- PEATS (valid word)
- TEATS (valid word, but T is already used in position 4)
- WEATS (valid word)

Among these, ""FEATS"" is a common word and fits perfectly.

Check constraints:
- F is not in any previous guess (ok)
- E, A, T, S are confirmed in their positions (ok)
- No conflicts (ok)
