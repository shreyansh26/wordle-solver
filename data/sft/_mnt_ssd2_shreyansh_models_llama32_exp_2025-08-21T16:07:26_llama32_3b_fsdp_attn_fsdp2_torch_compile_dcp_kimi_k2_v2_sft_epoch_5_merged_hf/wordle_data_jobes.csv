For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A or R.

- S can’t be in position 4.
- E can’t be in position 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but this violates the feedback since S can’t be in position 4). So “HOUSE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

This seems valid. Let me double-check:
- P, O, S, E, D – no A or R.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – ok.
- S is in position 2 (not 4) – ok.
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

""SONIC"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S
We need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 2, E in position 4, S in position 5, and the third letter in position 3 being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: BOGES (invalid), COGES (invalid), FOGES (invalid), GOSES (invalid), HOSES (valid), JOGES (invalid), KOGES (invalid), LOGES (invalid), MOGES (invalid), NOGES (invalid), TOGES (invalid), VOGES (invalid), WOGES (invalid), XOGES (invalid), YOGES (invalid), ZOGES (invalid).

- O: correct position 2.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since original S was in position 4 and marked wrong-position, position 5 is fine).
- E: correct position 4.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A or R.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O can’t be in position 3.
- S can’t be in position 4.
- E can’t be in position 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but this violates the feedback since S can’t be in position 4). So “HOUSE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

This seems valid. Let me double-check:
- P, O, S, E, D – no A or R.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – ok.
- S is in position 2 (not 4) – ok.
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

“POSED” is a valid guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern _ O _ E _ (with O in position 2 and E in position 4).
2. The letters A, R, P, D are NOT in the word.
3. The letters S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in both guesses), so S must be in position 1 or 5.
4. We still need one more letter (besides O, S, E), which must be from the remaining unused letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (if S is in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (if S is in position 5)

Let's explore these patterns.

Pattern 1: S O _ E _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SO, with E in position 4, and the third letter being one of the remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words: SOBBE (invalid), SOUCE (invalid), SOFIE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid), SOLDE (invalid), SONIC (valid), SOUCE (invalid), SOWEE (invalid), SOXIE (invalid), SOYEE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid).

""SONIC"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S
We need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 2, E in position 4, S in position 5, and the third letter in position 3 being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: BOGES (invalid), COGES (invalid), FOGES (invalid), GOSES (invalid), HOSES (valid), JOGES (invalid), KOGES (invalid), LOGES (invalid), MOGES (invalid), NOGES (invalid), TOGES (invalid), VOGES (invalid), WOGES (invalid), XOGES (invalid), YOGES (invalid), ZOGES (invalid).

""HOSES"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Let's verify ""HOSES"":
- H: new letter, not used before.
- O: correct position 2.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since original S was in position 4 and marked wrong-position, position 5 is fine).
- E: correct position 4.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since we can have S in position 5).

This seems valid.

Another candidate for pattern 1: ""SONIC"" is already found to be valid, and it fits all constraints.

Let's go with ""SONIC"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A or R.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O can’t be in position 3.
- S can’t be in position 4.
- E can’t be in position 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but this violates the feedback since S can’t be in position 4). So “HOUSE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

This seems valid. Let me double-check:
- P, O, S, E, D – no A or R.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – ok.
- S is in position 2 (not 4) – ok.
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

“POSED” is a valid guess.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern _ O _ E _ (with O in position 2 and E in position 4).
2. The letters A, R, P, D are NOT in the word.
3. The letters S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in both guesses), so S must be in position 1 or 5.
4. We still need one more letter (besides O, S, E), which must be from the remaining unused letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (if S is in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (if S is in position 5)

Let's explore these patterns.

Pattern 1: S O _ E _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SO, with E in position 4, and the third letter being one of the remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words: SOBBE (invalid), SOUCE (invalid), SOFIE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid), SOLDE (invalid), SONIC (valid), SOUCE (invalid), SOWEE (invalid), SOXIE (invalid), SOYEE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid).

""SONIC"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S
We need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 2, E in position 4, S in position 5, and the third letter in position 3 being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: BOGES (invalid), COGES (invalid), FOGES (invalid), GOSES (invalid), HOSES (valid), JOGES (invalid), KOGES (invalid), LOGES (invalid), MOGES (invalid), NOGES (invalid), TOGES (invalid), VOGES (invalid), WOGES (invalid), XOGES (invalid), YOGES (invalid), ZOGES (invalid).

""HOSES"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Let's verify ""HOSES"":
- H: new letter, not used before.
- O: correct position 2.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since original S was in position 4 and marked wrong-position, position 5 is fine).
- E: correct position 4.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since we can have S in position 5).

This seems valid.

Another candidate for pattern 1: ""SONIC"" is already found to be valid, and it fits all constraints.

Let's go with ""SONIC"".

<guess>SONIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: SONIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(x) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on SONIC:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correctly placed in position 2.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.

Summary of everything we now know:
1. Pattern so far: _ O _ E _
2. Letters in the word: O (fixed at 2), E (fixed at 4), S (somewhere else).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D, N, I, C.
4. S must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was wrong-positioned in positions 1 and 4).
   - In SONIC, S was in position 1 and got (-), so S ≠ position 1.
   - In POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S ≠ position 3.
   - Therefore, S must be in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ O _ E S

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ E S, with:
- Third letter (position 3) taken from the remaining unused letters (B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- First letter (position 1) and fourth letter (position 4) already fixed as _ O _ E S.

Possible valid words:

- LOYAL (invalid – A is out)
- MOXIE (invalid – I is out)
- TOXES (invalid – X ok, but word not common)
- VOGES (invalid – G ok, but word not common)

The most common and likely valid word here is ""HOMES"":
- H: new letter, not used before.
- O: fixed at 2.
- M: new letter.
- E: fixed at 4.
- S: fixed at 5.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A or R.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- O can’t be in position 3.
- S can’t be in position 4.
- E can’t be in position 5.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but this violates the feedback since S can’t be in position 4). So “HOUSE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “POSED”
- Contains O, S, E.
- Doesn’t contain A or R.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since original S was in position 4).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since original E was in position 5).

This seems valid. Let me double-check:
- P, O, S, E, D – no A or R.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – ok.
- S is in position 2 (not 4) – ok.
- E is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

“POSED” is a valid guess.

<guess>POSED</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern _ O _ E _ (with O in position 2 and E in position 4).
2. The letters A, R, P, D are NOT in the word.
3. The letters S is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in both guesses), so S must be in position 1 or 5.
4. We still need one more letter (besides O, S, E), which must be from the remaining unused letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (if S is in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (if S is in position 5)

Let's explore these patterns.

Pattern 1: S O _ E _
We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SO, with E in position 4, and the third letter being one of the remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words: SOBBE (invalid), SOUCE (invalid), SOFIE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid), SOLDE (invalid), SONIC (valid), SOUCE (invalid), SOWEE (invalid), SOXIE (invalid), SOYEE (invalid), SOKEE (invalid).

""SONIC"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S
We need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 2, E in position 4, S in position 5, and the third letter in position 3 being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: BOGES (invalid), COGES (invalid), FOGES (invalid), GOSES (invalid), HOSES (valid), JOGES (invalid), KOGES (invalid), LOGES (invalid), MOGES (invalid), NOGES (invalid), TOGES (invalid), VOGES (invalid), WOGES (invalid), XOGES (invalid), YOGES (invalid), ZOGES (invalid).

""HOSES"" is a valid word fitting this pattern.

Let's verify ""HOSES"":
- H: new letter, not used before.
- O: correct position 2.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since original S was in position 4 and marked wrong-position, position 5 is fine).
- E: correct position 4.
- S: position 5 (allowed, since we can have S in position 5).

This seems valid.

Another candidate for pattern 1: ""SONIC"" is already found to be valid, and it fits all constraints.

Let's go with ""SONIC"".

<guess>SONIC</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: SONIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(x) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on SONIC:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correctly placed in position 2.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.

Summary of everything we now know:
1. Pattern so far: _ O _ E _
2. Letters in the word: O (fixed at 2), E (fixed at 4), S (somewhere else).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D, N, I, C.
4. S must be in position 3 or 5 (since it was wrong-positioned in positions 1 and 4).
   - In SONIC, S was in position 1 and got (-), so S ≠ position 1.
   - In POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S ≠ position 3.
   - Therefore, S must be in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ O _ E S

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ E S, with:
- Third letter (position 3) taken from the remaining unused letters (B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- First letter (position 1) and fourth letter (position 4) already fixed as _ O _ E S.

Possible valid words:
- BOGES (invalid – G is ok, but word not common)
- FOYER (invalid – R is out)
- HOMES (valid)
- JOKES (valid)
- LOYAL (invalid – A is out)
- MOXIE (invalid – I is out)
- TOXES (invalid – X ok, but word not common)
- VOGES (invalid – G ok, but word not common)

The most common and likely valid word here is ""HOMES"":
- H: new letter, not used before.
- O: fixed at 2.
- M: new letter.
- E: fixed at 4.
- S: fixed at 5.

This fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback on JOKES:
- J(✓) – J is correctly placed in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correctly placed in position 2.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is correctly placed in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is correctly placed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: J O _ E S

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form J O _ E S, with the third letter (position 3) taken from the remaining unused letters (B, F, G, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking at common English words:
- JOUES (not a word)
- JONES (valid – name of a person)
- JOLES (not common)
- JOKES (already tried, K is out)
- JOVES (not common)
- JOXES (not common)

""JONES"" is a valid word and fits perfectly.

Since this is the 6th and final guess, we can't go wrong with the most common remaining candidate.
