### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.

- S is now in position 1 (allowed because S must be somewhere except position 4).
- T, I, C are new common letters.
- It avoids A, R, E as required.

This will give us feedback on S, T, I, C and confirm the O placement.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid A, R, E and try new common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong second guess that keeps the known O in position 3 and introduces new common letters while respecting the S constraint, is “STOIC”:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed because S must be somewhere except position 4).
- T, I, C are new common letters.
- It avoids A, R, E as required.

This will give us feedback on S, T, I, C and confirm the O placement.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (it was “-” in both AROSE and STOIC).
3. The letters A, R, E, T, I, C are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
4. Letters already tested and ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C.

So far the word looks like: _ _ O _ _
- S must appear in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: N, L, D, H, M, P, U, B, G, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s choose a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places S in position 2 (since we have only two possibilities left).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 is now allowed because we only know S is not in 1 or 4 from previous feedback; we haven’t tested it in position 1 yet.
- O in position 3 is correct.
- U, N, D are new letters we haven’t tried yet and are all common.

This will give us feedback on S in position 1, U, N, D and confirm O in position 3.

Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:
- Position 3 is O (✓ in all guesses).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from AROSE, STOIC, SOUND).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C, U, N, D.

So the word pattern is: _ _ O _ S

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, H, M, P, B, G, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need two more consonants (positions 1 & 2) and a vowel (position 4) from the unused pool.

A good choice that tests several new letters while fitting _ _ O _ S is “FLOWS”:
- F and L are new consonants.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- W is a new letter.
- S is in position 5 (consistent with feedback).

This will confirm the positions of F, L, and W while ensuring S is in the correct spot.

- O(✓)  → O is correctly placed in position 3.
- W(x)  → W is NOT in the word.
- S(✓)  → S is correctly placed in position 5.

So the word now looks like: _ _ O _ S, with:
- S fixed at position 5.
- F must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters still ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C, U, N, D, L, W.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: M, P, B, G, H, K, V, Y, etc.

We need to place F in either position 2 or 4, and fill the remaining open spot with another allowed letter.

Possibilities:
- If F is in position 2: _ F O _ S
- If F is in position 4: _ _ O F S

Let’s test the pattern _ F O _ S with F in position 2. We need a consonant for position 1 and 4 from the still-allowed set.

Good candidates:

- Position 4: M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

The word “HFOGS” isn’t valid, but “HPOKS” isn’t either. Let’s pick a real word: “PHOCS” – but C is already ruled out.  
“BOGUS” – but U is ruled out.  
“VOGUS” – U is ruled out.  
“BOGS” – too short.  
“BOGUS” – invalid.

Real word: “FOGIS” – invalid.

- F must be in 2 or 4. Here F is in 2, which is allowed (only position 1 is ruled out for F).

So “HOMOS” fits all constraints.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S somewhere except position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- Remaining letters to test should avoid A, R, E and try new common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A strong second guess that keeps the known O in position 3 and introduces new common letters while respecting the S constraint, is “STOIC”:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed because S must be somewhere except position 4).
- T, I, C are new common letters.
- It avoids A, R, E as required.

This will give us feedback on S, T, I, C and confirm the O placement.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (✓ in both guesses).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (it was “-” in both AROSE and STOIC).
3. The letters A, R, E, T, I, C are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
4. Letters already tested and ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C.

So far the word looks like: _ _ O _ _
- S must appear in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: N, L, D, H, M, P, U, B, G, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s choose a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places S in position 2 (since we have only two possibilities left).
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 is now allowed because we only know S is not in 1 or 4 from previous feedback; we haven’t tested it in position 1 yet.
- O in position 3 is correct.
- U, N, D are new letters we haven’t tried yet and are all common.

This will give us feedback on S in position 1, U, N, D and confirm O in position 3.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current constraints:
- Position 3 is O (✓ in all guesses).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from AROSE, STOIC, SOUND).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C, U, N, D.

So the word pattern is: _ _ O _ S

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, H, M, P, B, G, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need two more consonants (positions 1 & 2) and a vowel (position 4) from the unused pool.

A good choice that tests several new letters while fitting _ _ O _ S is “FLOWS”:
- F and L are new consonants.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- W is a new letter.
- S is in position 5 (consistent with feedback).

This will confirm the positions of F, L, and W while ensuring S is in the correct spot.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 4: FLOWS -> FEEDBACK: F(-) L(x) O(✓) W(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on FLOWS:
- F(-)  → F is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x)  → L is NOT in the word.
- O(✓)  → O is correctly placed in position 3.
- W(x)  → W is NOT in the word.
- S(✓)  → S is correctly placed in position 5.

So the word now looks like: _ _ O _ S, with:
- S fixed at position 5.
- F must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters still ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C, U, N, D, L, W.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: M, P, B, G, H, K, V, Y, etc.

We need to place F in either position 2 or 4, and fill the remaining open spot with another allowed letter.

Possibilities:
- If F is in position 2: _ F O _ S
- If F is in position 4: _ _ O F S

Let’s test the pattern _ F O _ S with F in position 2. We need a consonant for position 1 and 4 from the still-allowed set.

Good candidates:
- Position 1: B, H, M, P, V, Y, etc.
- Position 4: M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

The word “HFOGS” isn’t valid, but “HPOKS” isn’t either. Let’s pick a real word: “PHOCS” – but C is already ruled out.  
“BOGUS” – but U is ruled out.  
“VOGUS” – U is ruled out.  
“BOGS” – too short.  
“BOGUS” – invalid.

Better real word: “PHLOM” – but O is already in 3.  
Real word: “FOGIS” – invalid.

Let’s try “FOGUS” – invalid.

Real word: “HOMOS” – O is in 3, S in 5, and fits _ _ O _ S.  
But H is new and allowed.

Check constraints:
- H is new, allowed.
- O in 3, S in 5 correct.
- F must be in 2 or 4. Here F is in 2, which is allowed (only position 1 is ruled out for F).

So “HOMOS” fits all constraints.

But wait: is “HOMOS” a valid English word? Yes, it is (homo-sapiens).

Let’s use that.
