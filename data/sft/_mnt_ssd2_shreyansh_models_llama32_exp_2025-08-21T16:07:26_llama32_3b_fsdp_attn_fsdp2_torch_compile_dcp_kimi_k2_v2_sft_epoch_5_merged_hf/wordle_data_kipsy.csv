### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is fixed in the 4th position.  
   – Letters A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. LUNGS → L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)  
   – L, U, N, G are not in the word.  
   – S appears again, but this time it is NOT in the 4th position (the feedback is “-”).  
   – This seems like a contradiction at first glance: the previous feedback said S(✓) in position 4, yet here we’re told S is “-” in position 4.  
   – The only way both can be true is if the secret word has exactly one S and it is in position 4, and the word itself is only four letters long.  
   – However, most 5-letter words have two S’s (one at position 4 and one elsewhere), so the feedback likely intends to confirm S is in position 4 and not elsewhere (since S(-) would indicate S is not in position 4 in this guess, but we already know it is in position 4 from the first guess).  
   – Interpreting strictly: the feedback means S is not in position 4 in LUNGS, but we already know S is in position 4 from AROSE. This seems impossible—likely the feedback for LUNGS was meant as S(✓) to re-affirm S is in position 4.  
   – Given the contradiction, I’ll assume the feedback intends: S(✓) in position 4, and the word does not contain L, U, N, G.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G

Remaining common letters to test: T, I, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping S in position 4.

Let’s list what we now know for certain.

1. Position 4 is S (from AROSE feedback).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G, C, H.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I, P, S (but S is already locked at position 4).
4. Therefore the word contains I and P somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is S).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ S _ and the remaining letters to place are I and P (plus any other letters not yet ruled out).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels already have A, O, E, U ruled out; I is the only vowel confirmed inside.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I and P somewhere in the first three positions, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words that fit:
- TIPSY – but Y is allowed, T, I, P, S, Y  
- PIVOTS – but O, T, S – O is out, so discard  
- PISPY – P, I, S, P, Y – double P, but allowed  
- WIPSY – W, I, P, S, Y – allowed  
- MISPY – M, I, S, P, Y – allowed  

Among these, “MISPY” looks good: it places I and P in new positions and tests M, Y.

But let’s double-check:  
M, I, S, P, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
S is in position 4, I and P are present, so it satisfies the “-” feedback from earlier (meaning I and P are in the word but not in their previous spots).

So the next guess is MISPY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ S _

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps S in the 4th position.
2. Uses entirely new letters (since A, R, O, E are out).
3. Uses common consonants and vowels not yet tried.

Good candidate letters to test now: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like ""HUMPS"" would fit, but let's go with ""LUNGS"" to test L, U, N, G while keeping S in place.

Guess 2: LUNGS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is fixed in the 4th position.  
   – Letters A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. LUNGS → L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)  
   – L, U, N, G are not in the word.  
   – S appears again, but this time it is NOT in the 4th position (the feedback is “-”).  
   – This seems like a contradiction at first glance: the previous feedback said S(✓) in position 4, yet here we’re told S is “-” in position 4.  
   – The only way both can be true is if the secret word has exactly one S and it is in position 4, and the word itself is only four letters long.  
   – However, most 5-letter words have two S’s (one at position 4 and one elsewhere), so the feedback likely intends to confirm S is in position 4 and not elsewhere (since S(-) would indicate S is not in position 4 in this guess, but we already know it is in position 4 from the first guess).  
   – Interpreting strictly: the feedback means S is not in position 4 in LUNGS, but we already know S is in position 4 from AROSE. This seems impossible—likely the feedback for LUNGS was meant as S(✓) to re-affirm S is in position 4.  
   – Given the contradiction, I’ll assume the feedback intends: S(✓) in position 4, and the word does not contain L, U, N, G.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G

Remaining common letters to test: T, I, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping S in position 4.  
“CHIPS” uses C, H, I, P (all new) and keeps S in the 4th slot.  
But C, H, I, P are all fine—no conflict.

Let’s extract the hard facts from all feedback so far:

1. Position 4 is **S** (from AROSE).  
2. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G, C, H, M  
3. Letters **confirmed** in the word (with their current status):
   - I – now fixed in **position 2** (✓)  
   - S – must appear **once** (already in position 4)  
   - P – in the word but **not** in position 3 or 4 (so P ∈ {1, 2, 5})  
   - Y – in the word and **correctly placed at position 5** (✓)

So the pattern is now:
  _  I  _  S  Y

and we still have P somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are taken).

Therefore the word must be one of these two skeletons:
  P  I  P  S  Y   or   _  I  P  S  Y

But the two P’s cannot both be in position 3 (would need two P’s).  
So the only viable combinations are:
- P I _ S Y   (P in 1)  
- _ I P S Y   (P in 3)

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits either pattern.

Pattern 1: P I _ S Y  
Possible letters for the blank (must not be any of the already-excluded letters):  
B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

A quick scan yields “PIVSY” (invalid), “PIKSY” (invalid), “PABSY” (invalid).  
The only real word here is **PIVOT**, but O is already excluded.

Pattern 2: _ I P S Y  
Need a consonant in position 1 that is still allowed.  
Scanning the remaining set: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
“TIPSY” is a real English word and fits every constraint:
  T (allowed), I (fixed), P (must appear, now in position 3), S (fixed), Y (fixed).

Let’s verify:
- T, I, P, S, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
- S is in position 4 (✓)  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- Y is in position 5 (✓)  
- P is now in position 3 for the first time, so it satisfies the “-” feedback from earlier (it was previously “-” in position 3 in CHIPS).

Hence “TIPSY” is the logical next guess.

  T (allowed), I (fixed), P (must appear, now in position 3), S (fixed), Y (fixed).

Let’s verify:
- T, I, P, S, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
- S is in position 4 (✓)  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- Y is in position 5 (✓)  
- P is now in position 3 for the first time, so it satisfies the “-” feedback from earlier (it was previously “-” in position 3 in CHIPS).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ S _

Next, I want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps S in the 4th position.
2. Uses entirely new letters (since A, R, O, E are out).
3. Uses common consonants and vowels not yet tried.

Good candidate letters to test now: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like ""HUMPS"" would fit, but let's go with ""LUNGS"" to test L, U, N, G while keeping S in place.

<guess>LUNGS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNGS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is fixed in the 4th position.  
   – Letters A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. LUNGS → L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)  
   – L, U, N, G are not in the word.  
   – S appears again, but this time it is NOT in the 4th position (the feedback is “-”).  
   – This seems like a contradiction at first glance: the previous feedback said S(✓) in position 4, yet here we’re told S is “-” in position 4.  
   – The only way both can be true is if the secret word has exactly one S and it is in position 4, and the word itself is only four letters long.  
   – However, most 5-letter words have two S’s (one at position 4 and one elsewhere), so the feedback likely intends to confirm S is in position 4 and not elsewhere (since S(-) would indicate S is not in position 4 in this guess, but we already know it is in position 4 from the first guess).  
   – Interpreting strictly: the feedback means S is not in position 4 in LUNGS, but we already know S is in position 4 from AROSE. This seems impossible—likely the feedback for LUNGS was meant as S(✓) to re-affirm S is in position 4.  
   – Given the contradiction, I’ll assume the feedback intends: S(✓) in position 4, and the word does not contain L, U, N, G.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G

Remaining common letters to test: T, I, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping S in position 4.  
“CHIPS” uses C, H, I, P (all new) and keeps S in the 4th slot.  
But C, H, I, P are all fine—no conflict.

Let’s try “CHIPS”.

<guess>CHIPS</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNGS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)
Guess 3: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s list what we now know for certain.

1. Position 4 is S (from AROSE feedback).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G, C, H.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: I, P, S (but S is already locked at position 4).
4. Therefore the word contains I and P somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is S).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ S _ and the remaining letters to place are I and P (plus any other letters not yet ruled out).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels already have A, O, E, U ruled out; I is the only vowel confirmed inside.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I and P somewhere in the first three positions, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words that fit:
- TIPSY – but Y is allowed, T, I, P, S, Y  
- PIVOTS – but O, T, S – O is out, so discard  
- PISPY – P, I, S, P, Y – double P, but allowed  
- WIPSY – W, I, P, S, Y – allowed  
- MISPY – M, I, S, P, Y – allowed  

Among these, “MISPY” looks good: it places I and P in new positions and tests M, Y.

But let’s double-check:  
M, I, S, P, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
S is in position 4, I and P are present, so it satisfies the “-” feedback from earlier (meaning I and P are in the word but not in their previous spots).

So the next guess is MISPY.

<guess>MISPY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNGS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(x) N(x) G(x) S(-)
Guess 3: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)
Guess 4: MISPY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) S(-) P(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s extract the hard facts from all feedback so far:

1. Position 4 is **S** (from AROSE).  
2. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, E, L, U, N, G, C, H, M  
3. Letters **confirmed** in the word (with their current status):
   - I – now fixed in **position 2** (✓)  
   - S – must appear **once** (already in position 4)  
   - P – in the word but **not** in position 3 or 4 (so P ∈ {1, 2, 5})  
   - Y – in the word and **correctly placed at position 5** (✓)

So the pattern is now:
  _  I  _  S  Y

and we still have P somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are taken).

Therefore the word must be one of these two skeletons:
  P  I  P  S  Y   or   _  I  P  S  Y

But the two P’s cannot both be in position 3 (would need two P’s).  
So the only viable combinations are:
- P I _ S Y   (P in 1)  
- _ I P S Y   (P in 3)

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits either pattern.

Pattern 1: P I _ S Y  
Possible letters for the blank (must not be any of the already-excluded letters):  
B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

A quick scan yields “PIVSY” (invalid), “PIKSY” (invalid), “PABSY” (invalid).  
The only real word here is **PIVOT**, but O is already excluded.

Pattern 2: _ I P S Y  
Need a consonant in position 1 that is still allowed.  
Scanning the remaining set: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
“TIPSY” is a real English word and fits every constraint:
  T (allowed), I (fixed), P (must appear, now in position 3), S (fixed), Y (fixed).

Let’s verify:
- T, I, P, S, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear.  
- S is in position 4 (✓)  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- Y is in position 5 (✓)  
- P is now in position 3 for the first time, so it satisfies the “-” feedback from earlier (it was previously “-” in position 3 in CHIPS).

Hence “TIPSY” is the logical next guess.
