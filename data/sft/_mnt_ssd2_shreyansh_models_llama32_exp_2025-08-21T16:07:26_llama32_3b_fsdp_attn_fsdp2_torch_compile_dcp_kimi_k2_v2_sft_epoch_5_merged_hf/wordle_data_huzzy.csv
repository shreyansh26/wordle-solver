### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely fresh set of letters.

Good consonants to try now are T, N, L, C, D, and good vowels are I, U.  
Combining them into common 5-letter words gives options like:

Remaining vowels: U (already accounted for), and we still have no information on letters like D, L, C, K, etc.

Remaining usable letters (consonants and vowels not yet excluded):
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  plus U (which we must include).

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that contains U in positions 2-4 and uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s look for a word like _ U _ _ Y or _ _ U _ Y or _ _ _ U Y.

Possible candidates:
- BUMPY – uses B, U, M, P, Y (all allowed).  
- JUMPY – J, U, M, P, Y.  
- HUMPY – H, U, M, P, Y.  
- VUGGY – G appears twice, but V, U, G, G, Y.  
- MUCKY – C and K are allowed, but C is ruled out (from CLOUD feedback).  
- PUFFY – P, U, F, F, Y.  

Among these, PUFFY uses only allowed letters and places U in position 2 (a new spot), ending with a satisfying puff of positive feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while maximizing the information we can gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a completely fresh set of letters.  
I want a word that still contains common English letters, but avoids A, R, O, S, E.  
Good consonants to try now are T, N, L, C, D, and good vowels are I, U.  
Combining them into common 5-letter words gives options like:
- UNITY
- COUNT
- TULIP
- DITCH
- UNITY
“UNITY” uses U, N, I, T, Y—none of which were in AROSE, and it’s a valid English word.

Let me pick UNITY.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(x) T(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T  
- Letters we know are in the word: Y (and it sits in the 5th position)  
- Letters that are in the word but not in the position we tried them in: U (somewhere other than position 1)

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ Y and must contain U somewhere in positions 2-4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps Y in the 5th spot.
2. Places U in one of positions 2-4.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (already accounted for), and we still have no information on letters like D, L, C, K, etc.

A straightforward word that satisfies these constraints is “CLOUD”:
- C, L, D are still allowed.
- U is placed in position 2 (one of the positions we haven’t tried it in yet).
- Y is kept in position 5.

So let’s go with CLOUD.

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: _ U _ _ Y  
   (U is fixed in position 2, Y in position 5)

2. Letters ruled out so far:
   A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, C, L, D, P, F, V, G

3. Remaining usable letters:
   B, H, J, K, M, Q, W, X, Z  (plus the already-placed U and Y)

4. We need a 5-letter word of the form _ U _ _ Y using only the remaining letters in positions 1, 3, 4.

Possible words:
- BUMPY – P is out.
- HUMPY – P is out.
- JUMPY – P is out.
- BULKY – L is out.
- JUMPY – P is out.
- MUCKY – C is out.
- MUMMY – M, Y are allowed, but double M is okay; M in position 1, U in 2, M in 3, M in 4, Y in 5.  However, we have no information about M yet.
- BUMPY – P is out.
- HUMID – D and I are out.
- JUMBY – J, U, M, B, Y: J, U, M, B, Y all still allowed.
- MUMMY – uses M, U, M, Y (but Y is already fixed in 5, so MUMMY would be M-U-M-M-Y, which ends in Y but has M in 1,3,4.  We haven’t ruled out M yet.)

The simplest valid word that fits _ U _ _ Y with remaining letters is JUMBY:
J, U, M, B, Y
- J: still allowed
- U: fixed in position 2
- M: still allowed
- B: still allowed
- Y: fixed in position 5
