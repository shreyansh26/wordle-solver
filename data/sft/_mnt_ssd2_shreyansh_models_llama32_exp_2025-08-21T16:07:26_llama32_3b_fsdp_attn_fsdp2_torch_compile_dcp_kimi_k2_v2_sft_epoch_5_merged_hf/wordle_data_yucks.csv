### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about multiple common letters in the word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C somewhere, but not at the start.
- Does NOT contain R, A, N, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes C, but not as the first letter.
2. Excludes R, A, N, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that fits: ""SOUTH""
- S, O, U, T, H – none of R, A, N, E appear, and C is not used (but we know C is in the word).  
Wait, that violates rule 1: C must be present but not in position 1.

Re-evaluate: ""POUCH""
- P, O, U, C, H – C is in position 4, which is allowed.
- No R, A, N, E present.

This satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

Remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V.
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O are out, and U is already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and U.
- Places C in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Places U in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses none of the excluded letters R, A, N, E, P, O, H.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Candidate: ""SUCKY"" – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out several common letters.
Candidate: ""MUCKY"" – same issue.
Candidate: ""LUCID"" – but D is allowed, I is allowed, but we need C and U together.
Candidate: ""CUBIC"" – C is first (invalid, C cannot be first).
Candidate: ""SUCID"" – not a valid word.
Candidate: ""DUCIS"" – not valid.

A valid word that fits: ""SUCID"" is not valid, but ""SUCKE"" is not valid either.

Another approach: list valid 5-letter words with C and U, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid words:
- ""CUPID"" – C is 1st (invalid, C cannot be 1st).
- ""CUBBY"" – B is allowed, but C is 1st (invalid).
- ""CUT UP"" – invalid.
- ""LUCID"" – L, U, C, I, D. This has C in 3rd (allowed) and U in 2nd (allowed). Letters: L, U, C, I, D. None of the excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

""LUCID"" is a valid word, fits all constraints:
- Contains C (3rd) and U (2nd).
- No R, A, N, E, P, O, H.
- C is not in 1st or 4th or 5th (it's 3rd), U is not in 3rd (it's 2nd).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about multiple common letters in the word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C somewhere, but not at the start.
- Does NOT contain R, A, N, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes C, but not as the first letter.
2. Excludes R, A, N, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that fits: ""SOUTH""
- S, O, U, T, H – none of R, A, N, E appear, and C is not used (but we know C is in the word).  
Wait, that violates rule 1: C must be present but not in position 1.

Re-evaluate: ""POUCH""
- P, O, U, C, H – C is in position 4, which is allowed.
- No R, A, N, E present.

This satisfies all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. POUCH → P(x) O(x) U(-) C(-) H(x)
   - P, O, H are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and already not in 1).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, P, O, H.
- Letters definitely in the word: C (positions 2,3,5) and U (positions 1,2,4,5, but not 3).

Remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V.
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O are out, and U is already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and U.
- Places C in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Places U in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses none of the excluded letters R, A, N, E, P, O, H.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Candidate: ""SUCKY"" – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out several common letters.

A valid word that fits: ""SUCID"" is not valid, but ""SUCKE"" is not valid either.

From the latest feedback on SUCKY:

- U is correctly in position 2 (✓).
- C is correctly in position 3 (✓).
- K is correctly in position 4 (✓).
- Y is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fifth; must be 1,2,3, or 4).

So the secret word looks like: _ U C K _

Letters known to be in the word: S, Y, U, C, K.
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, A, N, E, P, O, H, L, I, D.

We need to determine positions 1 and 5.  
Position 1 can be S or Y (since both are in the word and position 5 can’t hold Y because Y is currently fifth and failed, so Y must be in position 1).

Thus the word must be Y U C K _.

Actually feedback says Y is in word but wrong position (it was fifth), so Y could be in position 1 (already confirmed) and then any other letter in position 5. But we have no info against Y repeating.

However, ""YUCKY"" is a valid word meaning ""bad-tasting,"" and it fits:

But let’s verify: does YUCKY have any excluded letters? No R, A, N, E, P, O, H, L, I, D – all good. And positions: Y(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). This satisfies all feedback.

Alternatively, ""YUCKY"" is the only common word fitting _ U C K _. Other possibilities like ""JUCKY"" or ""UCKY"" are invalid (J not tried, but K is already in 4). ""YUCKY"" is the only valid choice here.

Thus, the next guess is ""YUCKY"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about multiple common letters in the word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C somewhere, but not at the start.
- Does NOT contain R, A, N, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes C, but not as the first letter.
2. Excludes R, A, N, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that fits: ""SOUTH""
- S, O, U, T, H – none of R, A, N, E appear, and C is not used (but we know C is in the word).  
Wait, that violates rule 1: C must be present but not in position 1.

Re-evaluate: ""POUCH""
- P, O, U, C, H – C is in position 4, which is allowed.
- No R, A, N, E present.

This satisfies all constraints.

<guess>POUCH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POUCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) U(-) C(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. POUCH → P(x) O(x) U(-) C(-) H(x)
   - P, O, H are not in the word.
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (and already not in 1).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, N, E, P, O, H.
- Letters definitely in the word: C (positions 2,3,5) and U (positions 1,2,4,5, but not 3).

Remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V.
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O are out, and U is already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both C and U.
- Places C in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Places U in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses none of the excluded letters R, A, N, E, P, O, H.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Candidate: ""SUCKY"" – but Y is less common and we’ve already ruled out several common letters.
Candidate: ""MUCKY"" – same issue.
Candidate: ""LUCID"" – but D is allowed, I is allowed, but we need C and U together.
Candidate: ""CUBIC"" – C is first (invalid, C cannot be first).
Candidate: ""SUCID"" – not a valid word.
Candidate: ""DUCIS"" – not valid.

A valid word that fits: ""SUCID"" is not valid, but ""SUCKE"" is not valid either.

Another approach: list valid 5-letter words with C and U, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid words:
- ""CUPID"" – C is 1st (invalid, C cannot be 1st).
- ""CUBBY"" – B is allowed, but C is 1st (invalid).
- ""CUT UP"" – invalid.
- ""LUCID"" – L, U, C, I, D. This has C in 3rd (allowed) and U in 2nd (allowed). Letters: L, U, C, I, D. None of the excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

""LUCID"" is a valid word, fits all constraints:
- Contains C (3rd) and U (2nd).
- No R, A, N, E, P, O, H.
- C is not in 1st or 4th or 5th (it's 3rd), U is not in 3rd (it's 2nd).

<guess>LUCID</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: LUCID -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) C(✓) I(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on LUCID:
- L is not in the word (x).
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) (✓).
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) (✓).
- I is not in the word (x).
- D is not in the word (x).

So far we have:
- Positions: ? U C ? ?
- Letters not in the word: R, A, N, E, P, O, H, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: S, T, M, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V.
Remaining vowels: none (A, E, O, I are out, U is already placed).

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters not yet excluded.
We must use C in position 3 and U in position 2.

Possible word structure: _ U C _ _

Let’s pick a word that fits this pattern and uses common remaining letters.

Candidate: ""SUCKY"" – but Y is less common and K is allowed, but we have C in 3rd, U in 2nd. ""SUCKY"" would be S U C K Y, which fits _ U C _ _.

Check letters:
- S: allowed (not excluded).
- U: correct position 2.
- C: correct position 3.
- K: allowed.
- Y: allowed.

""SUCKY"" is a valid 5-letter word, fits all constraints.

Another candidate: ""MUCKY"" – but M is allowed, but we have C in 3rd, U in 2nd. ""MUCKY"" is also valid.

Between ""SUCKY"" and ""MUCKY"", both fit. I'll go with ""SUCKY"" first.

From the feedback on YUCKY:
- Y(✓) – Y is in position 1 and correct.
- U(✓) – U is in position 2 and correct.
- C(✓) – C is in position 3 and correct.
- K(✓) – K is in position 4 and correct.
- Y(-) – the final Y is in the word but in the wrong position. Since Y is already in position 1, the secret word must contain another Y in position 5.

Thus the word is Y U C K Y.

Check constraints:
- Contains all required letters: Y, U, C, K.
- No excluded letters (R, A, N, E, P, O, H, L, I, D) are used.
- Positions match feedback: Y(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5).
- The final Y in position 5 is allowed because feedback only said Y is in the word but wrong position in previous guesses (it was position 5 in SUCKY and YUCKY), so a Y in position 5 is acceptable.

Therefore, the only possible word is YUCKY.
