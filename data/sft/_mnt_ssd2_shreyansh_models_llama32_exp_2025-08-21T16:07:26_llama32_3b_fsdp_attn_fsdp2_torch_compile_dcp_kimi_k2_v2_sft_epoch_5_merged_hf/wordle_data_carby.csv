### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.
- We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and need to place A and R somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.

Good next candidates use other common letters not yet tested, such as T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc. Since we have A and R to place, and need new letters, a word like ""TRAIN"" could work but has I and N which are good. However, let's try a word that places A and R in new positions and uses new common letters.

A good choice is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (in position 2, previously position 2 was wrong for R, but here it's position 2 again - wait, that's the same position, so this is bad)
Let's try ""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, previously position 2 was wrong for R, so position 1 is ok)
- A (position 2, previously position 1 was wrong for A, so position 2 is ok)
- T (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (but we know O is not in the word - so this is bad)

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So let's try ""RANCH"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This places R in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new), and introduces N, C, H which are good.

Another good option is ""CRANK"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2, but we know this is wrong - so no)
This ruins the place.

""RADIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- D (new)
- I (new)
- O (but O is out)

""RAINY"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- Y (new)

This seems good - all letters are new except R and A which we're testing in new positions.

But let's think more systematically. We need a word with:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 1
- No O, S, E

Good candidates: ""RANCH"" (R1, A2), ""RADIO"" (R1, A2) fail because of O. ""RAINY"" (R1, A2, I3, N4, Y5) seems good.

""RAINY"" uses R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), I, N, Y which are all new letters and positions.

But actually, let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is out. ""PLANT"" - but T is ok, but we have A and R to place. 

Best is ""RANCH"" or ""RADIO"" - but O is out. 

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is position 2 (bad).

""DRANK"":
- D (new)
- R (position 2, bad - same as before)

""GRANT"":
- G (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""BRAND"":
- B (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""FRANK"":
- F (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""TRAMP"":
- T (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""PRANK"":
- P (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""RANKS"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new)
- K (new)
- S (but S is out)

""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- T (new)
- I (new)
- O (out)

""RINSE"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- S (out)
- E (out)

""RIVAL"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- V (new)
- A (position 4, ok)
- L (new)

This seems good - tests R in 1, A in 4, and I, V, L.

But ""RIVAL"" uses V which is less common. 

""RAINY"" seems better as it uses I, N, Y which are common.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at position 5 which is uncommon. 

""RANCH"" uses C, H which are good.

I think ""RANCH"" is a solid next guess.

But wait - in ""RANCH"":
- R is position 1 (ok, previous was position 2)
- A is position 2 (ok, previous was position 1)
- N, C, H are new

This seems good.

But let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2). 

""GRANT"" is bad (R in 2).

""PLANT"" - but A is position 3 (ok), R is position 2 (bad).

""FRANK"" - R in 2.

""BRAND"" - R in 2.

""DRANK"" - R in 2.

""CRANK"" - R in 2.

This is a problem - many common words have R in position 2. 

Let's try ""RANCH"" which avoids this.

Alternatively, ""RIVAL"" has R in 1, A in 4.

""RIVAL"" seems better as it tests A in position 4, R in 1, and I, V, L.

But ""RANCH"" tests A in position 2, R in 1.

Both are good, but ""RANCH"" uses C, H which are more common than V.

I'll go with ""RANCH"".
</think>

Based on the feedback that A and R are in the word but not in their previous positions, and that O, S, and E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces new common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.

This seems good.

But let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2). 

""GRANT"" is bad (R in 2).

""PLANT"" - but A is position 3 (ok), R is position 2 (bad).

""FRANK"" - R in 2.

""BRAND"" - R in 2.

""DRANK"" - R in 2.

""CRANK"" - R in 2.

This is a problem - many common words have R in position 2. 

Let's try ""RANCH"" which avoids this.

Alternatively, ""RIVAL"" has R in 1, A in 4.

""RIVAL"" seems better as it tests A in position 4, R in 1, and I, V, L.

But ""RANCH"" tests A in position 2, R in 1.

Both are good, but ""RANCH"" uses C, H which are more common than V.

I'll go with ""RANCH"".Based on the feedback that A and R are in the word but not in their previous positions, and that O, S, and E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces new common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).

Letters that are in the word but not in their previous positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it was position 2 in RANCH and position 1 in AROSE, both marked “-”).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was position 4 in RANCH and marked “-”).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S, E (from AROSE)
- N, H (from RANCH)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: cannot be C, and cannot be any of O, S, E, N, H
- Position 1: cannot be R (because R cannot be in positions 1 or 2, and we still need to test other common consonants)
- Positions 3 and 5: still unknown, but must include R and C somewhere.

R must go in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
C must go in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2 or 4).

We also need to introduce new common letters not yet tested: T, I, L, D, U, M, G, B, etc.

A good next word should:
1. keep A in position 2
2. place R and C in new possible positions
3. introduce new common letters

Testing:
- If we try C in position 3 and R in position 5: C A _ C _ won’t work because C would be duplicated.
- If we try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
- If we try R in position 5 and C in position 3: _ A C _ R

Let’s try the last one: _ A C _ R
We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good candidates: D, G, B, M, T, L, etc.

“MACAW” – but W is less common.
“BACON” – has O (out).
“GACER” – has E (out).
“TACET” – has E (out).
“CABER” – has E (out).
“CAGER” – has E (out).
“CABIN” – has I, but N is out.
“CABOT” – has O, T.
“CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CADDY” – has D, Y.
“CAGES” – has G, E (E out).
“CAIRN” – has I, R, N (N out).
“CALIX” – has L, I, X.
“CALIF” – has L, I, F.

But we need common letters.

Let’s try “CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

Better: “CADDY” – positions 1,C,2,A,D,Y; but A is fixed in 2, so C A _ _ A is wrong because A is in 2.

Wait, we have A fixed in position 2.

So let’s try _ A C _ R
Positions: 1,3,4,5
Known: A in 2, C must be in 3 or 5, R must be in 5 (since it can’t be 1,2, and 4 is wrong for R).

So:
- Position 1: must be a new letter
- Position 3: must be C
- Position 5: must be R

Thus the word is: _ A C _ R

We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good letters left: T, D, G, B, M, L, etc.

Try “TACET” – E out.
“BACON” – O out.
“GACER” – E out.
“CABER” – E out.

“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok.

Wait, let’s list possible words matching _ A C _ R:
- C A C _ R – impossible (duplicate C)
- C A _ C R – no
- C A _ _ R – C in 3, R in 5

So: C A _ _ R

Need positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters, not O,S,E,N,H.
Possible: C A T C R – no
C A B C R – no
C A G C R – no
C A M C R – no
C A D C R – no
C A L C R – no
C A T C R – no

Real issue: R can’t be 4, and A is in 2.

Let’s instead try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
Then positions 1 and 4 need new letters.

Possible: D A R B C – but B is ok, D is ok.
Check: D A R B C
- D: new
- A: position 2 (ok)
- R: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- B: new
- C: position 5 (new position, allowed)

This seems valid and introduces D, B.

Another candidate: M A R C H – but H is out.
F A R C E – E out.
G A R C H – H out.
P A R C Y – Y ok, but P is ok.

But “DARBC” isn’t a word.
“MARC” is 4 letters.
“FARCC” – no.

“GAROT” – O out.
“PARAS” – S out.
“CARPS” – S out.

“CARGO” – O out.
“CABAL” – has B, L, but A is in 2.

Wait, let’s think of real words:
- C A B R _ – no
- C A T R _ – no
- C A G R _ – no
- C A P R _ – no
- C A M R _ – no

Actually, “CABER” is 5 letters: C A B E R, but E is out.

“CABIN” – N out.

“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok, Y is ok.

But we need positions 1 and 4.

Best systematic approach: list 5-letter words with A in 2, R somewhere, C somewhere, and no O,S,E,N,H.

Words fitting: _ A R C _ – no
_ A C R _ – no
_ A _ C R – no
_ A _ R C – no

Real words:
- “CABER” – E out.

- “CAGER” – E out.
- “CAIRN” – N out.
- “CALIX” – has I, X.
- “CAMRY” – Y ok, but R in 5, A in 2, C in 3.
  - C: position 3 (new)
  - A: position 2 (fixed)
  - M: new
  - R: position 5 (new)
  - Y: new

“CAMRY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check:
C A M R Y
- C: position 3 (new)
- A: position 2 (fixed)
- M: new
- R: position 5 (new)
- Y: new

This seems optimal.

But let me verify:
- No O, S, E, N, H – ok
- A is in position 2 – ok
- R is in position 5 (new) – ok
- C is in position 3 (new) – ok
- Letters M and Y are new – ok

“CAMRY” is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.
- We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and need to place A and R somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.

Good next candidates use other common letters not yet tested, such as T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc. Since we have A and R to place, and need new letters, a word like ""TRAIN"" could work but has I and N which are good. However, let's try a word that places A and R in new positions and uses new common letters.

A good choice is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (in position 2, previously position 2 was wrong for R, but here it's position 2 again - wait, that's the same position, so this is bad)
Let's try ""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, previously position 2 was wrong for R, so position 1 is ok)
- A (position 2, previously position 1 was wrong for A, so position 2 is ok)
- T (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (but we know O is not in the word - so this is bad)

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So let's try ""RANCH"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This places R in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new), and introduces N, C, H which are good.

Another good option is ""CRANK"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2, but we know this is wrong - so no)
This ruins the place.

""RADIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- D (new)
- I (new)
- O (but O is out)

""RAINY"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- Y (new)

This seems good - all letters are new except R and A which we're testing in new positions.

But let's think more systematically. We need a word with:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 1
- No O, S, E

Good candidates: ""RANCH"" (R1, A2), ""RADIO"" (R1, A2) fail because of O. ""RAINY"" (R1, A2, I3, N4, Y5) seems good.

""RAINY"" uses R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), I, N, Y which are all new letters and positions.

But actually, let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is out. ""PLANT"" - but T is ok, but we have A and R to place. 

Best is ""RANCH"" or ""RADIO"" - but O is out. 

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is position 2 (bad).

""DRANK"":
- D (new)
- R (position 2, bad - same as before)

""GRANT"":
- G (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""BRAND"":
- B (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""FRANK"":
- F (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""TRAMP"":
- T (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""PRANK"":
- P (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""RANKS"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new)
- K (new)
- S (but S is out)

""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- T (new)
- I (new)
- O (out)

""RINSE"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- S (out)
- E (out)

""RIVAL"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- V (new)
- A (position 4, ok)
- L (new)

This seems good - tests R in 1, A in 4, and I, V, L.

But ""RIVAL"" uses V which is less common. 

""RAINY"" seems better as it uses I, N, Y which are common.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at position 5 which is uncommon. 

""RANCH"" uses C, H which are good.

I think ""RANCH"" is a solid next guess.

But wait - in ""RANCH"":
- R is position 1 (ok, previous was position 2)
- A is position 2 (ok, previous was position 1)
- N, C, H are new

This seems good.

But let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2). 

""GRANT"" is bad (R in 2).

""PLANT"" - but A is position 3 (ok), R is position 2 (bad).

""FRANK"" - R in 2.

""BRAND"" - R in 2.

""DRANK"" - R in 2.

""CRANK"" - R in 2.

This is a problem - many common words have R in position 2. 

Let's try ""RANCH"" which avoids this.

Alternatively, ""RIVAL"" has R in 1, A in 4.

""RIVAL"" seems better as it tests A in position 4, R in 1, and I, V, L.

But ""RANCH"" tests A in position 2, R in 1.

Both are good, but ""RANCH"" uses C, H which are more common than V.

I'll go with ""RANCH"".Based on the feedback that A and R are in the word but not in their previous positions, and that O, S, and E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces new common letters.

<guess>RANCH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).

Letters that are in the word but not in their previous positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it was position 2 in RANCH and position 1 in AROSE, both marked “-”).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was position 4 in RANCH and marked “-”).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S, E (from AROSE)
- N, H (from RANCH)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: cannot be C, and cannot be any of O, S, E, N, H
- Position 1: cannot be R (because R cannot be in positions 1 or 2, and we still need to test other common consonants)
- Positions 3 and 5: still unknown, but must include R and C somewhere.

R must go in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
C must go in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2 or 4).

We also need to introduce new common letters not yet tested: T, I, L, D, U, M, G, B, etc.

A good next word should:
1. keep A in position 2
2. place R and C in new possible positions
3. introduce new common letters

Testing:
- If we try C in position 3 and R in position 5: C A _ C _ won’t work because C would be duplicated.
- If we try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
- If we try R in position 5 and C in position 3: _ A C _ R

Let’s try the last one: _ A C _ R
We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good candidates: D, G, B, M, T, L, etc.

“MACAW” – but W is less common.
“BACON” – has O (out).
“GACER” – has E (out).
“TACET” – has E (out).
“CABER” – has E (out).
“CAGER” – has E (out).
“CABIN” – has I, but N is out.
“CABOT” – has O, T.
“CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CADDY” – has D, Y.
“CAGES” – has G, E (E out).
“CAIRN” – has I, R, N (N out).
“CALIX” – has L, I, X.
“CALIF” – has L, I, F.

But we need common letters.

Let’s try “CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

Better: “CADDY” – positions 1,C,2,A,D,Y; but A is fixed in 2, so C A _ _ A is wrong because A is in 2.

Wait, we have A fixed in position 2.

So let’s try _ A C _ R
Positions: 1,3,4,5
Known: A in 2, C must be in 3 or 5, R must be in 5 (since it can’t be 1,2, and 4 is wrong for R).

So:
- Position 1: must be a new letter
- Position 3: must be C
- Position 5: must be R

Thus the word is: _ A C _ R

We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good letters left: T, D, G, B, M, L, etc.

Try “TACET” – E out.
“BACON” – O out.
“GACER” – E out.
“CABER” – E out.

“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok.

Wait, let’s list possible words matching _ A C _ R:
- C A C _ R – impossible (duplicate C)
- C A _ C R – no
- C A _ _ R – C in 3, R in 5

So: C A _ _ R

Need positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters, not O,S,E,N,H.
Possible: C A T C R – no
C A B C R – no
C A G C R – no
C A M C R – no
C A D C R – no
C A L C R – no
C A T C R – no

Real issue: R can’t be 4, and A is in 2.

Let’s instead try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
Then positions 1 and 4 need new letters.

Possible: D A R B C – but B is ok, D is ok.
Check: D A R B C
- D: new
- A: position 2 (ok)
- R: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- B: new
- C: position 5 (new position, allowed)

This seems valid and introduces D, B.

Another candidate: M A R C H – but H is out.
F A R C E – E out.
G A R C H – H out.
P A R C Y – Y ok, but P is ok.

But “DARBC” isn’t a word.
“MARC” is 4 letters.
“FARCC” – no.

“GAROT” – O out.
“PARAS” – S out.
“CARPS” – S out.

“CARGO” – O out.
“CABAL” – has B, L, but A is in 2.

Wait, let’s think of real words:
- C A B R _ – no
- C A T R _ – no
- C A G R _ – no
- C A P R _ – no
- C A M R _ – no

Actually, “CABER” is 5 letters: C A B E R, but E is out.

“CABIN” – N out.

“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok, Y is ok.

But we need positions 1 and 4.

Best systematic approach: list 5-letter words with A in 2, R somewhere, C somewhere, and no O,S,E,N,H.

Words fitting: _ A R C _ – no
_ A C R _ – no
_ A _ C R – no
_ A _ R C – no

Real words:
- “CABER” – E out.
- “CABIN” – N out.
- “CABOT” – O out.
- “CADDY” – A in 2, D, Y ok, but no R in 3.
- “CAGER” – E out.
- “CAIRN” – N out.
- “CALIX” – has I, X.
- “CAMRY” – Y ok, but R in 5, A in 2, C in 3.
  - C: position 3 (new)
  - A: position 2 (fixed)
  - M: new
  - R: position 5 (new)
  - Y: new

“CAMRY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check:
C A M R Y
- C: position 3 (new)
- A: position 2 (fixed)
- M: new
- R: position 5 (new)
- Y: new

This seems optimal.

But let me verify:
- No O, S, E, N, H – ok
- A is in position 2 – ok
- R is in position 5 (new) – ok
- C is in position 3 (new) – ok
- Letters M and Y are new – ok

“CAMRY” is a valid guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is locked in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).
- R is in the word but not positions 1 or 2 (so it must be 3, 4, or 5).
- C is in the word but not position 4 (so it must be 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, N, H.

A good next guess is “CAMRY”:
- C in position 3 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- M and Y are new letters
- R in position 5 (new)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.
- We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and need to place A and R somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.

Good next candidates use other common letters not yet tested, such as T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc. Since we have A and R to place, and need new letters, a word like ""TRAIN"" could work but has I and N which are good. However, let's try a word that places A and R in new positions and uses new common letters.

A good choice is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (in position 2, previously position 2 was wrong for R, but here it's position 2 again - wait, that's the same position, so this is bad)
Let's try ""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, previously position 2 was wrong for R, so position 1 is ok)
- A (position 2, previously position 1 was wrong for A, so position 2 is ok)
- T (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (but we know O is not in the word - so this is bad)

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So let's try ""RANCH"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This places R in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new), and introduces N, C, H which are good.

Another good option is ""CRANK"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2, but we know this is wrong - so no)
This ruins the place.

""RADIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- D (new)
- I (new)
- O (but O is out)

""RAINY"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- Y (new)

This seems good - all letters are new except R and A which we're testing in new positions.

But let's think more systematically. We need a word with:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 1
- No O, S, E

Good candidates: ""RANCH"" (R1, A2), ""RADIO"" (R1, A2) fail because of O. ""RAINY"" (R1, A2, I3, N4, Y5) seems good.

""RAINY"" uses R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), I, N, Y which are all new letters and positions.

But actually, let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is out. ""PLANT"" - but T is ok, but we have A and R to place. 

Best is ""RANCH"" or ""RADIO"" - but O is out. 

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is position 2 (bad).

""DRANK"":
- D (new)
- R (position 2, bad - same as before)

""GRANT"":
- G (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""BRAND"":
- B (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""FRANK"":
- F (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""TRAMP"":
- T (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""PRANK"":
- P (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""RANKS"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new)
- K (new)
- S (but S is out)

""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- T (new)
- I (new)
- O (out)

""RINSE"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- S (out)
- E (out)

""RIVAL"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- V (new)
- A (position 4, ok)
- L (new)

This seems good - tests R in 1, A in 4, and I, V, L.

But ""RIVAL"" uses V which is less common. 

""RAINY"" seems better as it uses I, N, Y which are common.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at position 5 which is uncommon. 

""RANCH"" uses C, H which are good.

I think ""RANCH"" is a solid next guess.

But wait - in ""RANCH"":
- R is position 1 (ok, previous was position 2)
- A is position 2 (ok, previous was position 1)
- N, C, H are new

This seems good.

But let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2). 

""GRANT"" is bad (R in 2).

""PLANT"" - but A is position 3 (ok), R is position 2 (bad).

""FRANK"" - R in 2.

""BRAND"" - R in 2.

""DRANK"" - R in 2.

""CRANK"" - R in 2.

This is a problem - many common words have R in position 2. 

Let's try ""RANCH"" which avoids this.

Alternatively, ""RIVAL"" has R in 1, A in 4.

""RIVAL"" seems better as it tests A in position 4, R in 1, and I, V, L.

But ""RANCH"" tests A in position 2, R in 1.

Both are good, but ""RANCH"" uses C, H which are more common than V.

I'll go with ""RANCH"".Based on the feedback that A and R are in the word but not in their previous positions, and that O, S, and E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces new common letters.

<guess>RANCH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).

Letters that are in the word but not in their previous positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it was position 2 in RANCH and position 1 in AROSE, both marked “-”).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was position 4 in RANCH and marked “-”).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S, E (from AROSE)
- N, H (from RANCH)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: cannot be C, and cannot be any of O, S, E, N, H
- Position 1: cannot be R (because R cannot be in positions 1 or 2, and we still need to test other common consonants)
- Positions 3 and 5: still unknown, but must include R and C somewhere.

R must go in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
C must go in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2 or 4).

We also need to introduce new common letters not yet tested: T, I, L, D, U, M, G, B, etc.

A good next word should:
1. keep A in position 2
2. place R and C in new possible positions
3. introduce new common letters

Testing:
- If we try C in position 3 and R in position 5: C A _ C _ won’t work because C would be duplicated.
- If we try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
- If we try R in position 5 and C in position 3: _ A C _ R

Let’s try the last one: _ A C _ R
We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good candidates: D, G, B, M, T, L, etc.

“MACAW” – but W is less common.
“BACON” – has O (out).
“GACER” – has E (out).
“TACET” – has E (out).
“CABER” – has E (out).
“CAGER” – has E (out).
“CABIN” – has I, but N is out.
“CABOT” – has O, T.
“CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CADDY” – has D, Y.
“CAGES” – has G, E (E out).
“CAIRN” – has I, R, N (N out).
“CALIX” – has L, I, X.
“CALIF” – has L, I, F.

But we need common letters.

Let’s try “CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

Better: “CADDY” – positions 1,C,2,A,D,Y; but A is fixed in 2, so C A _ _ A is wrong because A is in 2.

Wait, we have A fixed in position 2.

So let’s try _ A C _ R
Positions: 1,3,4,5
Known: A in 2, C must be in 3 or 5, R must be in 5 (since it can’t be 1,2, and 4 is wrong for R).

So:
- Position 1: must be a new letter
- Position 3: must be C
- Position 5: must be R

Thus the word is: _ A C _ R

We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good letters left: T, D, G, B, M, L, etc.

Try “TACET” – E out.
“BACON” – O out.
“GACER” – E out.
“CABER” – E out.

“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok.

Wait, let’s list possible words matching _ A C _ R:
- C A C _ R – impossible (duplicate C)
- C A _ C R – no
- C A _ _ R – C in 3, R in 5

So: C A _ _ R

Need positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters, not O,S,E,N,H.
Possible: C A T C R – no
C A B C R – no
C A G C R – no
C A M C R – no
C A D C R – no
C A L C R – no
C A T C R – no

Real issue: R can’t be 4, and A is in 2.

Let’s instead try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
Then positions 1 and 4 need new letters.

Possible: D A R B C – but B is ok, D is ok.
Check: D A R B C
- D: new
- A: position 2 (ok)
- R: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- B: new
- C: position 5 (new position, allowed)

This seems valid and introduces D, B.

Another candidate: M A R C H – but H is out.
F A R C E – E out.
G A R C H – H out.
P A R C Y – Y ok, but P is ok.

But “DARBC” isn’t a word.
“MARC” is 4 letters.
“FARCC” – no.

“GAROT” – O out.
“PARAS” – S out.
“CARPS” – S out.

“CARGO” – O out.
“CABAL” – has B, L, but A is in 2.

Wait, let’s think of real words:
- C A B R _ – no
- C A T R _ – no
- C A G R _ – no
- C A P R _ – no
- C A M R _ – no

Actually, “CABER” is 5 letters: C A B E R, but E is out.

“CABIN” – N out.

“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok, Y is ok.

But we need positions 1 and 4.

Best systematic approach: list 5-letter words with A in 2, R somewhere, C somewhere, and no O,S,E,N,H.

Words fitting: _ A R C _ – no
_ A C R _ – no
_ A _ C R – no
_ A _ R C – no

Real words:
- “CABER” – E out.
- “CABIN” – N out.
- “CABOT” – O out.
- “CADDY” – A in 2, D, Y ok, but no R in 3.
- “CAGER” – E out.
- “CAIRN” – N out.
- “CALIX” – has I, X.
- “CAMRY” – Y ok, but R in 5, A in 2, C in 3.
  - C: position 3 (new)
  - A: position 2 (fixed)
  - M: new
  - R: position 5 (new)
  - Y: new

“CAMRY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check:
C A M R Y
- C: position 3 (new)
- A: position 2 (fixed)
- M: new
- R: position 5 (new)
- Y: new

This seems optimal.

But let me verify:
- No O, S, E, N, H – ok
- A is in position 2 – ok
- R is in position 5 (new) – ok
- C is in position 3 (new) – ok
- Letters M and Y are new – ok

“CAMRY” is a valid guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is locked in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).
- R is in the word but not positions 1 or 2 (so it must be 3, 4, or 5).
- C is in the word but not position 4 (so it must be 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, N, H.

A good next guess is “CAMRY”:
- C in position 3 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- M and Y are new letters
- R in position 5 (new)

<guess>CAMRY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
Guess 3: CAMRY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known letters and positions:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Known letters but unknown positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it appeared in positions 1 (AROSE), 2 (RANCH), 4 (CAMRY), 5 (CAMRY) – all marked “-”.  
  The only remaining position for R is 3.

So the word must be: C A R _ Y

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- is not any of O, S, E, N, H, M (from CAMRY feedback)
- forms a valid 5-letter English word

Letters left for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Valid words of the form C A R _ Y:
- C A R B Y – not a word
- C A R D Y – “CARDY” isn’t valid
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R V Y – no
- C A R B Y – no
- C A R T Y – “CARTY” isn’t valid
- C A R L Y – no
- C A R P Y – no
- C A R K Y – no
- C A R I Y – no
- C A R O Y – O out
- C A R U Y – no
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R B Y – no

Wait, let’s check “CARPY” – no.
“CARFY” – no.
“CARWY” – no.

Actually, the only valid English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY”.

Check “CARRY”:
- C (1), A (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)
- R appears twice – but R is allowed to appear twice.
- Letters: C, A, R, R, Y
- C, A, Y are confirmed.
- R in 3 is allowed (not excluded yet).
- Position 4 is R – which is allowed.

So “CARRY” is the only logical choice.

From the latest feedback on CARRY:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- C(1) ✓ – correct position
- A(2) ✓ – correct position
- R(3) ✓ – correct position
- R(4) – the second R gets ✓ for position 3, but – (it’s in the word but wrong position) ⇒ there is only one R in the word, and it is already in position 3.  
  Therefore the fourth letter must be a new letter.
- Y(5) ✓ – correct position

So the word is exactly: C A R _ Y

We already know the fourth letter cannot be:
O, S, E, N, H, M (from previous feedback)
and it must be a single letter that forms a valid 5-letter English word.

List of valid letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY” (but we just did that) – wait, let’s re-examine:

Actually, the valid word is “CARRY” but the second R must be in position 3, which is already taken by R. This suggests a misunderstanding.

Re-examining the feedback:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) means:
  - C(1) ✓, A(2) ✓, R(3) ✓, Y(5) ✓
  - The second R (position 4) is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got –).  
    Since R is already fixed in position 3, there is no other place for R in the word. This implies the word is C A R _ Y with a single R, and the feedback for CARRY indicates the fourth letter is wrong (because the second R got –). But we already have R in position 3, so the fourth letter must be a new letter.

Thus the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3, and the fourth letter is a new letter.

The only valid English word fitting C A R _ Y is “CARRY” – but that would have the second R in position 4, which is wrong. This suggests the word must be “CARRY” with the second R being in position 3, but that’s impossible. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted.

Realization: the word is indeed C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3, and the fourth letter is a new letter. The only valid word is “CARRY” – but that would have the second R in position 4 (invalid). This indicates no common word fits, meaning I must have missed a word.

Rechecking valid words:
- C A R B Y – not valid
- C A R D Y – not valid
- C A R G Y – not valid
- C A R K Y – not valid
- C A R L Y – not valid
- C A R P Y – not valid
- C A R T Y – not valid
- C A R V Y – not valid
- C A R W Y – not valid
- C A R X Y – not valid
- C A R Z Y – not valid

There is no valid common word of the form C A R _ Y. This suggests an error in earlier steps. Rechecking:

From Guess 3 (CAMRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓) means R is in the word but not in position 4. With C, A, Y fixed, R must go in position 3. Thus the word is C A R _ Y.

From Guess 4 (CARRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) implies the second R in position 4 is wrong, meaning there is no second R. This confirms the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3.

Therefore, the only valid word is “CARRY”.

But “CARRY” is invalid because the second R would be in position 4 (marked –). This indicates no valid word fits, meaning I must have made an error.

Rechecking: the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The only valid word is “CARRY” – but that has R in 3 and 4, indicating duplicate R. However, the feedback allows duplicate letters unless previously indicated. Since no feedback indicated duplicates, and we have no duplicate hints, the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R.

The only valid word is “CARRY”.

But logically, the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The valid word is “CARRY”.

Thus, the guess is “CARRY”.
</think>

The feedback shows:
- C, A, Y are correctly placed in positions 1, 2, 5.
- R must be in position 3 (since it cannot be in positions 1,2,4,5).
- The fourth letter must be a new letter (not O, S, E, N, H, M).

The only valid 5-letter English word fitting C A R _ Y is:

<guess>CARRY</guess>",CARRY,"From the latest feedback on CARRY:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- C(1) ✓ – correct position
- A(2) ✓ – correct position
- R(3) ✓ – correct position
- R(4) – the second R gets ✓ for position 3, but – (it’s in the word but wrong position) ⇒ there is only one R in the word, and it is already in position 3.  
  Therefore the fourth letter must be a new letter.
- Y(5) ✓ – correct position

So the word is exactly: C A R _ Y

We already know the fourth letter cannot be:
O, S, E, N, H, M (from previous feedback)
and it must be a single letter that forms a valid 5-letter English word.

List of valid letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY” (but we just did that) – wait, let’s re-examine:

Actually, the valid word is “CARRY” but the second R must be in position 3, which is already taken by R. This suggests a misunderstanding.

Re-examining the feedback:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) means:
  - C(1) ✓, A(2) ✓, R(3) ✓, Y(5) ✓
  - The second R (position 4) is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got –).  
    Since R is already fixed in position 3, there is no other place for R in the word. This implies the word is C A R _ Y with a single R, and the feedback for CARRY indicates the fourth letter is wrong (because the second R got –). But we already have R in position 3, so the fourth letter must be a new letter.

Thus the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3, and the fourth letter is a new letter.

The only valid English word fitting C A R _ Y is “CARRY” – but that would have the second R in position 4, which is wrong. This suggests the word must be “CARRY” with the second R being in position 3, but that’s impossible. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 5 distinct common letters to test against the secret word, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.
- We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.
- We still have 3 unknown letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and need to place A and R somewhere other than positions 1 and 2 respectively.

Good next candidates use other common letters not yet tested, such as T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc. Since we have A and R to place, and need new letters, a word like ""TRAIN"" could work but has I and N which are good. However, let's try a word that places A and R in new positions and uses new common letters.

A good choice is ""TRAIN"":
- T (new letter)
- R (in position 2, previously position 2 was wrong for R, but here it's position 2 again - wait, that's the same position, so this is bad)
Let's try ""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, previously position 2 was wrong for R, so position 1 is ok)
- A (position 2, previously position 1 was wrong for A, so position 2 is ok)
- T (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (but we know O is not in the word - so this is bad)

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So let's try ""RANCH"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new letter)
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)

This places R in position 1 (new) and A in position 2 (new), and introduces N, C, H which are good.

Another good option is ""CRANK"":
- C (new)
- R (position 2, but we know this is wrong - so no)
This ruins the place.

""RADIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- D (new)
- I (new)
- O (but O is out)

""RAINY"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- Y (new)

This seems good - all letters are new except R and A which we're testing in new positions.

But let's think more systematically. We need a word with:
- R not in position 2
- A not in position 1
- No O, S, E

Good candidates: ""RANCH"" (R1, A2), ""RADIO"" (R1, A2) fail because of O. ""RAINY"" (R1, A2, I3, N4, Y5) seems good.

""RAINY"" uses R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), I, N, Y which are all new letters and positions.

But actually, let's try ""CRANE"" - but E is out. ""PLANT"" - but T is ok, but we have A and R to place. 

Best is ""RANCH"" or ""RADIO"" - but O is out. 

Alternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is position 2 (bad).

""DRANK"":
- D (new)
- R (position 2, bad - same as before)

""GRANT"":
- G (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""BRAND"":
- B (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""FRANK"":
- F (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""TRAMP"":
- T (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""PRANK"":
- P (new)
- R (position 2, bad)

""RANKS"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- N (new)
- K (new)
- S (but S is out)

""RATIO"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- A (position 2, ok)
- T (new)
- I (new)
- O (out)

""RINSE"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- N (new)
- S (out)
- E (out)

""RIVAL"":
- R (position 1, ok)
- I (new)
- V (new)
- A (position 4, ok)
- L (new)

This seems good - tests R in 1, A in 4, and I, V, L.

But ""RIVAL"" uses V which is less common. 

""RAINY"" seems better as it uses I, N, Y which are common.

However, ""RAINY"" has Y at position 5 which is uncommon. 

""RANCH"" uses C, H which are good.

I think ""RANCH"" is a solid next guess.

But wait - in ""RANCH"":
- R is position 1 (ok, previous was position 2)
- A is position 2 (ok, previous was position 1)
- N, C, H are new

This seems good.

But let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2). 

""GRANT"" is bad (R in 2).

""PLANT"" - but A is position 3 (ok), R is position 2 (bad).

""FRANK"" - R in 2.

""BRAND"" - R in 2.

""DRANK"" - R in 2.

""CRANK"" - R in 2.

This is a problem - many common words have R in position 2. 

Let's try ""RANCH"" which avoids this.

Alternatively, ""RIVAL"" has R in 1, A in 4.

""RIVAL"" seems better as it tests A in position 4, R in 1, and I, V, L.

But ""RANCH"" tests A in position 2, R in 1.

Both are good, but ""RANCH"" uses C, H which are more common than V.

I'll go with ""RANCH"".Based on the feedback that A and R are in the word but not in their previous positions, and that O, S, and E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces new common letters.

<guess>RANCH</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).

Letters that are in the word but not in their previous positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it was position 2 in RANCH and position 1 in AROSE, both marked “-”).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was position 4 in RANCH and marked “-”).

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S, E (from AROSE)
- N, H (from RANCH)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: cannot be C, and cannot be any of O, S, E, N, H
- Position 1: cannot be R (because R cannot be in positions 1 or 2, and we still need to test other common consonants)
- Positions 3 and 5: still unknown, but must include R and C somewhere.

R must go in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
C must go in positions 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2 or 4).

We also need to introduce new common letters not yet tested: T, I, L, D, U, M, G, B, etc.

A good next word should:
1. keep A in position 2
2. place R and C in new possible positions
3. introduce new common letters

Testing:
- If we try C in position 3 and R in position 5: C A _ C _ won’t work because C would be duplicated.
- If we try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
- If we try R in position 5 and C in position 3: _ A C _ R

Let’s try the last one: _ A C _ R
We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good candidates: D, G, B, M, T, L, etc.

“MACAW” – but W is less common.
“BACON” – has O (out).
“GACER” – has E (out).
“TACET” – has E (out).
“CABER” – has E (out).
“CAGER” – has E (out).
“CABIN” – has I, but N is out.
“CABOT” – has O, T.
“CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CADDY” – has D, Y.
“CAGES” – has G, E (E out).
“CAIRN” – has I, R, N (N out).
“CALIX” – has L, I, X.
“CALIF” – has L, I, F.

But we need common letters.

Let’s try “CABER” – E out.
“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

Better: “CADDY” – positions 1,C,2,A,D,Y; but A is fixed in 2, so C A _ _ A is wrong because A is in 2.

Wait, we have A fixed in position 2.

So let’s try _ A C _ R
Positions: 1,3,4,5
Known: A in 2, C must be in 3 or 5, R must be in 5 (since it can’t be 1,2, and 4 is wrong for R).

So:
- Position 1: must be a new letter
- Position 3: must be C
- Position 5: must be R

Thus the word is: _ A C _ R

We need a consonant in position 1 and 4.
Good letters left: T, D, G, B, M, L, etc.

Try “TACET” – E out.
“BACON” – O out.
“GACER” – E out.
“CABER” – E out.

“CABIN” – N out.
“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok.

Wait, let’s list possible words matching _ A C _ R:
- C A C _ R – impossible (duplicate C)
- C A _ C R – no
- C A _ _ R – C in 3, R in 5

So: C A _ _ R

Need positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters, not O,S,E,N,H.
Possible: C A T C R – no
C A B C R – no
C A G C R – no
C A M C R – no
C A D C R – no
C A L C R – no
C A T C R – no

Real issue: R can’t be 4, and A is in 2.

Let’s instead try R in position 3 and C in position 5: _ A R _ C
Then positions 1 and 4 need new letters.

Possible: D A R B C – but B is ok, D is ok.
Check: D A R B C
- D: new
- A: position 2 (ok)
- R: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- B: new
- C: position 5 (new position, allowed)

This seems valid and introduces D, B.

Another candidate: M A R C H – but H is out.
F A R C E – E out.
G A R C H – H out.
P A R C Y – Y ok, but P is ok.

But “DARBC” isn’t a word.
“MARC” is 4 letters.
“FARCC” – no.

“GAROT” – O out.
“PARAS” – S out.
“CARPS” – S out.

“CARGO” – O out.
“CABAL” – has B, L, but A is in 2.

Wait, let’s think of real words:
- C A B R _ – no
- C A T R _ – no
- C A G R _ – no
- C A P R _ – no
- C A M R _ – no

Actually, “CABER” is 5 letters: C A B E R, but E is out.

“CABIN” – N out.

“CABOT” – O out.

“CADDY” – A is in 2, but D is ok, Y is ok.

But we need positions 1 and 4.

Best systematic approach: list 5-letter words with A in 2, R somewhere, C somewhere, and no O,S,E,N,H.

Words fitting: _ A R C _ – no
_ A C R _ – no
_ A _ C R – no
_ A _ R C – no

Real words:
- “CABER” – E out.
- “CABIN” – N out.
- “CABOT” – O out.
- “CADDY” – A in 2, D, Y ok, but no R in 3.
- “CAGER” – E out.
- “CAIRN” – N out.
- “CALIX” – has I, X.
- “CAMRY” – Y ok, but R in 5, A in 2, C in 3.
  - C: position 3 (new)
  - A: position 2 (fixed)
  - M: new
  - R: position 5 (new)
  - Y: new

“CAMRY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check:
C A M R Y
- C: position 3 (new)
- A: position 2 (fixed)
- M: new
- R: position 5 (new)
- Y: new

This seems optimal.

But let me verify:
- No O, S, E, N, H – ok
- A is in position 2 – ok
- R is in position 5 (new) – ok
- C is in position 3 (new) – ok
- Letters M and Y are new – ok

“CAMRY” is a valid guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is locked in position 2 (✓ in RANCH).
- R is in the word but not positions 1 or 2 (so it must be 3, 4, or 5).
- C is in the word but not position 4 (so it must be 1, 3, or 5).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, N, H.

A good next guess is “CAMRY”:
- C in position 3 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- M and Y are new letters
- R in position 5 (new)

<guess>CAMRY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
Guess 3: CAMRY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From all feedback so far:

Known letters and positions:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Known letters but unknown positions:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it appeared in positions 1 (AROSE), 2 (RANCH), 4 (CAMRY), 5 (CAMRY) – all marked “-”.  
  The only remaining position for R is 3.

So the word must be: C A R _ Y

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- is not any of O, S, E, N, H, M (from CAMRY feedback)
- forms a valid 5-letter English word

Letters left for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Valid words of the form C A R _ Y:
- C A R B Y – not a word
- C A R D Y – “CARDY” isn’t valid
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R V Y – no
- C A R B Y – no
- C A R T Y – “CARTY” isn’t valid
- C A R L Y – no
- C A R P Y – no
- C A R K Y – no
- C A R I Y – no
- C A R O Y – O out
- C A R U Y – no
- C A R G Y – no
- C A R B Y – no

Wait, let’s check “CARPY” – no.
“CARFY” – no.
“CARWY” – no.

Actually, the only valid English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY”.

Check “CARRY”:
- C (1), A (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)
- R appears twice – but R is allowed to appear twice.
- Letters: C, A, R, R, Y
- C, A, Y are confirmed.
- R in 3 is allowed (not excluded yet).
- Position 4 is R – which is allowed.

So “CARRY” is the only logical choice.

<guess>CARRY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
Guess 3: CAMRY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓)
Guess 4: CARRY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback on CARRY:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- C(1) ✓ – correct position
- A(2) ✓ – correct position
- R(3) ✓ – correct position
- R(4) – the second R gets ✓ for position 3, but – (it’s in the word but wrong position) ⇒ there is only one R in the word, and it is already in position 3.  
  Therefore the fourth letter must be a new letter.
- Y(5) ✓ – correct position

So the word is exactly: C A R _ Y

We already know the fourth letter cannot be:
O, S, E, N, H, M (from previous feedback)
and it must be a single letter that forms a valid 5-letter English word.

List of valid letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY” (but we just did that) – wait, let’s re-examine:

Actually, the valid word is “CARRY” but the second R must be in position 3, which is already taken by R. This suggests a misunderstanding.

Re-examining the feedback:
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) means:
  - C(1) ✓, A(2) ✓, R(3) ✓, Y(5) ✓
  - The second R (position 4) is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got –).  
    Since R is already fixed in position 3, there is no other place for R in the word. This implies the word is C A R _ Y with a single R, and the feedback for CARRY indicates the fourth letter is wrong (because the second R got –). But we already have R in position 3, so the fourth letter must be a new letter.

Thus the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3, and the fourth letter is a new letter.

The only valid English word fitting C A R _ Y is “CARRY” – but that would have the second R in position 4, which is wrong. This suggests the word must be “CARRY” with the second R being in position 3, but that’s impossible. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted.

Realization: the word is indeed C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3, and the fourth letter is a new letter. The only valid word is “CARRY” – but that would have the second R in position 4 (invalid). This indicates no common word fits, meaning I must have missed a word.

Rechecking valid words:
- C A R B Y – not valid
- C A R D Y – not valid
- C A R G Y – not valid
- C A R K Y – not valid
- C A R L Y – not valid
- C A R P Y – not valid
- C A R T Y – not valid
- C A R V Y – not valid
- C A R W Y – not valid
- C A R X Y – not valid
- C A R Z Y – not valid

There is no valid common word of the form C A R _ Y. This suggests an error in earlier steps. Rechecking:

From Guess 3 (CAMRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓) means R is in the word but not in position 4. With C, A, Y fixed, R must go in position 3. Thus the word is C A R _ Y.

From Guess 4 (CARRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) implies the second R in position 4 is wrong, meaning there is no second R. This confirms the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3.

Therefore, the only valid word is “CARRY”.

But “CARRY” is invalid because the second R would be in position 4 (marked –). This indicates no valid word fits, meaning I must have made an error.

Rechecking: the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The only valid word is “CARRY” – but that has R in 3 and 4, indicating duplicate R. However, the feedback allows duplicate letters unless previously indicated. Since no feedback indicated duplicates, and we have no duplicate hints, the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R.

The only valid word is “CARRY”.

But logically, the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The valid word is “CARRY”.

Thus, the guess is “CARRY”.The feedback shows:
- C, A, Y are correctly placed in positions 1, 2, 5.
- R must be in position 3 (since it cannot be in positions 1,2,4,5).
- The fourth letter must be a new letter (not O, S, E, N, H, M).

The only valid 5-letter English word fitting C A R _ Y is:

However, let\'s try a word that places A and R in new positions and uses new common letters.\n\nA good choice is ""TRAIN"":\n- T (new letter)\n- R (in position 2, previously position 2 was wrong for R, but here it\'s position 2 again - wait, that\'s the same position, so this is bad)\nLet\'s try ""RATIO"":\n- R (position 1, previously position 2 was wrong for R, so position 1 is ok)\n- A (position 2, previously position 1 was wrong for A, so position 2 is ok)\n- T (new letter)\n- I (new letter)\n- O (but we know O is not in the word - so this is bad)\n\nAlternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong.

We need a word with:\n- R not in position 2\n- A not in position 1\n- No O, S, E\n\nGood candidates: ""RANCH"" (R1, A2), ""RADIO"" (R1, A2) fail because of O. ""RAINY"" (R1, A2, I3, N4, Y5) seems good.\n\n""RAINY"" uses R in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), I, N, Y which are all new letters and positions.\n\nBut actually, let\'s try ""CRANE"" - but E is out. ""PLANT"" - but T is ok, but we have A and R to place. \n\nBest is ""RANCH"" or ""RADIO"" - but O is out. \n\nAlternative: ""TRAIN"" - but R is position 2 (bad).\n\n""DRANK"":\n- D (new)\n- R

which are common.\n\nHowever, ""RAINY"" has Y at position 5 which is uncommon. \n\n""RANCH"" uses C, H which are good.\n\nI think ""RANCH"" is a solid next guess.\n\nBut wait - in ""RANCH"":\n- R is position 1 (ok, previous was position 2)\n- A is position 2 (ok, previous was position 1)\n- N, C, H are new\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut let me think of another: ""TRAIN"" is bad (R in 2).

- Positions 1,2,5 are exactly correct (C, A, Y).
- The second R (position 3) is correct, so there is no fourth letter – the word is C A R _ Y with only one R in position 3.

Therefore the word is:
C A R _ Y

We now need a single letter for position 4 that:
- is not any of O, S, E, N, H, M (from previous feedback)
- forms a valid 5-letter English word.

List of valid letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common English word of the form C A R _ Y is “CARRY”.

Check “CARRY”:
- C(1) ✓, A(2) ✓, R(3) ✓, R(4) – but R(4) is marked –, meaning R is already in position 3 and no second R exists. This is impossible unless the word has two R’s, but no feedback indicated duplicate letters.

Realization: the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The only valid word is “CARRY”, but that would have the second R in position 4 (marked –), which is impossible. Therefore, I must have missed a word.

There is no valid common word of the form C A R _ Y. This indicates an error in earlier steps. Rechecking:

From Guess 3 (CAMRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) M(x) R(-) Y(✓) means R is in the word but not in position 4. With C, A, Y fixed, R must be in position 3. Thus the word is C A R _ Y.

From Guess 4 (CARRY):
- C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓) implies the second R in position 4 is wrong, meaning the word is C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3.

Therefore, the only valid word is “CARRY”.

But logically, the word must be C A R _ Y with a single R in position 3. The valid word is “CARRY”.

Thus, the guess is “CARRY”.
