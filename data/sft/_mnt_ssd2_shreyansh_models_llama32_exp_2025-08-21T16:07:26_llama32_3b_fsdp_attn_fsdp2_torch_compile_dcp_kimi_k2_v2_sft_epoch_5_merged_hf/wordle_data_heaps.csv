### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers very common letters including S, L, A, T, E. This provides a good balance of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

Between these two, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's highly effective at testing common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (currently third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fifth; must be 1,2,3, or 4).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters to include: S, E, A (A is already fixed in position 3)
- Letters to exclude: L, T
- S cannot be in position 1
- E cannot be in position 5

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 3
2. Contains S somewhere (positions 2,3,4, or 5 - but 3 is already A, so 2,4, or 5)
3. Contains E somewhere (positions 1,2,3, or 4 - but 3 is A, so 1,2, or 4)
4. Does not contain L or T

Possible candidates: 
- EASEL (but has L which is excluded)
- CASES (but has C and S twice)
- BASES (but has B and S twice)
- FASCI (but has C and I)
- MASEL (but has L which is excluded)
- RATES (but has T which is excluded)
- WASHY (but has Y which is uncommon)
- PASEN (but has N which is uncommon)
- GASSY (but has S twice and Y)

A good candidate is ""GASSY"" but it has S twice which might not be ideal. Another option is ""PASEN"" but N is less common. ""WASHY"" is possible but Y is uncommon.

A better option is ""MARES"" - but E is in position 4 which is allowed, S is in position 5 which is allowed, and M,A,R,E,S are all allowed letters. However, A must be in position 3, so this would be _ _ A _ _ with S in position 5, E in position 4. This works: M A R E S has A in 2 which is allowed, but I need A in position 3.

Wait, ""MARES"" has A in position 2, not 3. Need A in position 3.

Let me think differently: _ _ A _ _ with S and E somewhere. S must be in 2,4, or 5; E must be in 1,2, or 4.

Possible words:
- E S A _ _ (but S is first which is invalid)
- _ E A S _ (E in 2, S in 4)
- _ _ A E S (E in 4, S in 5)
- S must not be in 1

Considering ""BEADS"":
- B E A D S - has A in 3, S in 5, E in 2. But D is allowed, B is allowed. This works.

Another option: ""FEARS"":
- F E A R S - A in 3, S in 5, E in 2. F, E, A, R, S are all allowed.

Between ""BEADS"" and ""FEARS"", both are valid. I'll choose ""FEARS"" as it tests F and R which are common letters.

Wait, but A must be in position 3. In ""FEARS"" A is in position 3 - that's correct. And E is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed), F and R are new tests.

So ""FEARS"" fits all constraints:
- F E A R S
- A is in position 3 ✓
- E is in word, not position 5 ✓
- S is in word, not position 1 ✓
- No L or T ✓

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
   - A is in position 3 and is correct.
   - S is in the word but not position 1.
   - E is in the word but not position 5.
   - L and T are not in the word.

2. FEARS → F(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(x) S(✓)
   - E is in position 2 and is correct.
   - A is in position 3 and is correct (confirms earlier info).
   - S is in position 5 and is correct.
   - F and R are not in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ E A _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: E (position 2), A (position 3), S (position 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, T, F, R
- S is already in position 5, so no other S needed.
- We still need positions 1 and 4 filled with letters not yet excluded.

Possible letters left (excluding L, T, F, R): B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word matching _ E A _ S where:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter

Looking for common words fitting this pattern:
- BEADS: but D is allowed, B is allowed. Pattern _ E A _ S → BEADS fits _ E A _ S but has D in 4 and B in 1. However, we know S is in position 5, so BEADS would be B E A D S which fits. But we have S in position 5 confirmed, so BEADS is valid as long as S is last.
- MEANS: M E A N S → fits _ E A _ S with M in 1 and N in 4.
- PEASE: but has E in position 4 which conflicts with E already in position 2.
- NEADS: N E A D S → fits _ E A _ S with N in 1 and D in 4.
- YEAST: but S is last, A is in 3, E in 2 - Y E A S T but S is 4, not 5. Doesn't fit.
- DEASH (not common)
- HEAPS: H E A P S → but S is 5, E is 2 - H E A P S fits _ E A _ S with H in 1 and P in 4.

HEAPS fits perfectly:
- H E A P S
- E is in position 2 (correct)
- A is in position 3 (correct)
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- H and P are new letters not yet tested.
