- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (each somewhere other than their positions in AROSE) and does NOT contain A.

To pick a good second guess, I want to:
1. Keep R, O, S, E but move them to new positions.
2. Add a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet (ideally common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid A entirely.

A strong candidate is “TROPE”:
- T, P are new letters.
- R, O, E are re-used but in different positions than before.

Let’s check the positions:
- R will be in position 1 (was 2 before).
- O will be in position 2 (was 3 before).
- E will be in position 3 (was 5 before).
- S will be in position 4 (was 4 before) – oops, that’s the same position, so S should move.

Another candidate: “STORE”:
- S moves to position 1.
- T is new.
- O moves to position 2.
- R moves to position 3.
- E moves to position 4.

This looks better: all four known letters are in new positions, and we add T.

- From both guesses we also know:
  – R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (each somewhere other than their positions in AROSE) and does NOT contain A.

To pick a good second guess, I want to:
1. Keep R, O, S, E but move them to new positions.
2. Add a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet (ideally common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid A entirely.

A strong candidate is “TROPE”:
- T, P are new letters.
- R, O, E are re-used but in different positions than before.

Let’s check the positions:
- R will be in position 1 (was 2 before).
- O will be in position 2 (was 3 before).
- E will be in position 3 (was 5 before).
- S will be in position 4 (was 4 before) – oops, that’s the same position, so S should move.

Another candidate: “STORE”:
- S moves to position 1.
- T is new.
- O moves to position 2.
- R moves to position 3.
- E moves to position 4.

This looks better: all four known letters are in new positions, and we add T.

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE → S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

Key deductions so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, T
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, O, S, E
- From both guesses we also know:
  – R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)
  – O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from STORE) – so O ≠ 3
  – S is not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from STORE)
  – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)

So possible positions so far:
R: allowed in 1, 3, 5
O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 3

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first attempt to maximize vowel coverage early on.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word contains the letters R, O, S, E (each somewhere other than their positions in AROSE) and does NOT contain A.

To pick a good second guess, I want to:
1. Keep R, O, S, E but move them to new positions.
2. Add a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet (ideally common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid A entirely.

A strong candidate is “TROPE”:
- T, P are new letters.
- R, O, E are re-used but in different positions than before.

Let’s check the positions:
- R will be in position 1 (was 2 before).
- O will be in position 2 (was 3 before).
- E will be in position 3 (was 5 before).
- S will be in position 4 (was 4 before) – oops, that’s the same position, so S should move.

Another candidate: “STORE”:
- S moves to position 1.
- T is new.
- O moves to position 2.
- R moves to position 3.
- E moves to position 4.

This looks better: all four known letters are in new positions, and we add T.

<guess>STORE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE → S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

Key deductions so far:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, T
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, O, S, E
- From both guesses we also know:
  – R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)
  – O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from STORE) – so O ≠ 3
  – S is not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from STORE)
  – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from STORE)

So possible positions so far:
R: allowed in 1, 3, 5
O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
S: allowed in 2, 3, 5
E: allowed in 1, 2, 3

We still need to test a fifth letter. Good untested common consonants include N, L, C, D, etc.  
Let’s try to place R, O, S, E into new slots and add one of those consonants.

Candidate word: “NORMS”
- N is new.
- O in position 2 (new).
- R in position 3 (new).
- M is new.
- S in position 5 (new).

This uses four of the known letters in fresh positions and introduces N and M.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: NORMS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) R(-) M(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback:

NORMS → N(x) O(✓) R(-) M(x) S(✓)

Key updates:
- O is now fixed in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 5.
- R is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (and we already knew it’s not in 2, 4, 5).
  So R must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is now ruled out, so R must be in position 1.
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: A, T, N, M.

So the word looks like: R _ O _ S and we still need two more letters for positions 3 and 4.

Letters still available (common ones we haven’t ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

We want high-frequency consonants or vowels that haven’t been used. Good candidates: C, D, L, P, I, U.

Let’s try a word that fills positions 3 and 4 with common remaining letters. A good choice is “ROIPS”:
- R in position 1 (must be).
- O in position 2 (fixed).
- I in position 3 (new, common).
- P in position 4 (new, common).
- S in position 5 (fixed).

This uses four known/controlled positions and introduces I and P.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: NORMS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) R(-) M(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: ROIPS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) I(x) P(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the latest feedback:

ROIPS → R(✓) O(✓) I(x) P(x) S(✓)

Fixed so far:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: S

Letters we now know are NOT in the word at all: A, T, N, M, I, P

So the word has the pattern: R O _ _ S

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Available letters (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y

High-frequency consonants: C, D, L, G, H, K, B, F

Let’s form a valid 5-letter word fitting R O _ _ S with these letters.

Possible combinations:
- R O C K S → “ROCKS” (but we already know S is fixed at 5, and double S might be unlikely)
- R O C K S → “ROCKS” is valid
- R O D E S → but E is already ruled out (from AROSE feedback)
- R O C K S is the only common word that fits.

Check: R, O, C, K, S – none of C or K has been ruled out yet. This seems valid.

Alternative: R O U G S → “ROUGH” but that ends with H, not S.
So “ROCKS” is the only clear candidate.

Let me verify no other obvious words:  
- R O U G S – no.  
- R O D E S – no (E excluded).  
- R O B L S – no.  
Thus, “ROCKS” is the strongest next guess.
