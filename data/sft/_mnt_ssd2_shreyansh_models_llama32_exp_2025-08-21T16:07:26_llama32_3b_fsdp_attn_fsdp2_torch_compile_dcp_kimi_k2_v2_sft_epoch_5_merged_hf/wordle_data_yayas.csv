### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Possible word: “LASSA” – but it repeats S and has A in 4th/5th positions, but also has L and A twice, and A is allowed to repeat? Actually the word must be 5 distinct letters unless specified otherwise. So avoid repeats.

Try “SALAD” – contains D (allowed), A twice (allowed), S in 1st position but S cannot be 1st (from STAIN feedback). So S in 1st is invalid.

Try “GASPS” – has P, G, S, A, P, S. S is in 3rd (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed). No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “CLASP” – but A is 3rd (invalid, A cannot be 3rd).

Another: “PLASH” – but A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SCALD” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SALSA” – A is 2nd and 4th (allowed), S is 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st).

Another: “GLASS” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “PHASE” – E is forbidden.

Another: “CHASM” – no A, so invalid.

Another: “BASIL” – I is forbidden.

Another: “GASPY” – A is 2nd (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed). Letters: G, A, S, P, Y. None of R,O,E,T,I,N. This looks good.

- ALIEN (A, L, I, E, N)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- STAIN (S, T, A, I, N) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- SNAIL (S, N, A, I, L) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E

I'll choose ""STAIN"" as it uses common letters (S, T, A, I, N) and positions A and S differently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

Remaining common consonants to try: L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already known to be present, and E, I, O are out).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s look for such a word:

Possible word: “LASSA” – but it repeats S and has A in 4th/5th positions, but also has L and A twice, and A is allowed to repeat? Actually the word must be 5 distinct letters unless specified otherwise. So avoid repeats.

Try “SALAD” – contains D (allowed), A twice (allowed), S in 1st position but S cannot be 1st (from STAIN feedback). So S in 1st is invalid.

Try “GASPS” – has P, G, S, A, P, S. S is in 3rd (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed). No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “CLASP” – but A is 3rd (invalid, A cannot be 3rd).

Another: “PLASH” – but A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SCALD” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SALSA” – A is 2nd and 4th (allowed), S is 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st).

Another: “GLASS” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “PHASE” – E is forbidden.

Another: “CHASM” – no A, so invalid.

Another: “BASIL” – I is forbidden.

Another: “GASPY” – A is 2nd (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed). Letters: G, A, S, P, Y. None of R,O,E,T,I,N. This looks good.

I’ll go with “GASPY”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters in the word and their positions:
- A is correct in position 2.  So the pattern is _ A _ _ _

Letters in the word but wrong positions:
- S is somewhere, but not positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from STAIN and GASPY feedback).  
  That leaves only position 2 for S, but position 2 is already A.  This is impossible, so S must be re-examined.

Wait — the feedback for GASPY says S(-), which means S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  We already knew S cannot be 1, 4, 5 (from STAIN).  So S can only be 2 or 3.  But position 2 is A, so S must be 3.

Thus the pattern is _ A S _ _ .

Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, E, T, I, N, G, P.

Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ALIEN (A, L, I, E, N)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fourth letter).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not as the 1st letter).
- Contains S (but not as the 4th letter).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S in different positions, and avoids R, O, E. Let me think of possibilities:

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

Some candidate words:
- SAINT (S, A, I, N, T) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- STAIN (S, T, A, I, N) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are NOT in the word.

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.

Another candidate: “CLASP” – but A is 3rd (invalid, A cannot be 3rd).

Another: “PLASH” – but A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SCALD” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SALSA” – A is 2nd and 4th (allowed), S is 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st).

Another: “GLASS” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “PHASE” – E is forbidden.

Another: “CHASM” – no A, so invalid.

Another: “BASIL” – I is forbidden.

Another: “GASPY” – A is 2nd (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed). Letters: G, A, S, P, Y. None of R,O,E,T,I,N. This looks good.

Thus the pattern is _ A S _ _ .

Current deductions:

1. Position 2 is A (✓ from GASPY and WASHY).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
   The only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
   This is impossible, so S must appear elsewhere.  
   Re-examining the feedback:

   - STAIN: S(-) — S is in word but not position 1.
   - GASPY: S(-) — S is in word but not position 3.
   - WASHY: S(-) — S is in word but not position 3 (same as above).
   So S is not in 1, 3, 4, 5.  
   The only remaining place is position 2, but position 2 is A.  
   This contradiction implies S must appear twice: one instance must be in position 2 and the other instance must be in a position that has not yet been tested.

3. Therefore the pattern is:
   - Position 2 = A
   - At least one S must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (positions not yet ruled out for S).
   - Other letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z.

   Another valid word: “BASSE” is invalid (E forbidden).  
   “FASLA” is not a word.  
   “DASSY” is valid but rare.

7. Best valid word fitting constraints: “DASSY” (D, A, S, S, Y).  
   It has S in 3rd (allowed), A in 2nd (correct), and uses new letters D and Y.

However, “DASSY” repeats S.  Let’s prefer a word without repeats.

8. Next best: “BASIS” — I is forbidden.

   “FASSE” — E is forbidden.

    Another: “SASSE” — E forbidden.  
    Another: “SASSY” — S repeat and Y allowed, but S cannot be 1,3,4,5 — only 2 is A, so S in 3 is allowed.  
    “SASSY” is _ A S _ _ with S in 3 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), and letters S, A, Y.  
    Y is allowed (not yet ruled out), S is allowed in 3, and A is fixed in 2.

Therefore, “SASSY” is a valid choice.

But wait — earlier feedback says A is fixed in position 2, and S must be in 2 or 3.  Position 2 is A, so S must be 3.  Thus the word must be _ A S _ _ .  
A valid word fitting this is “BASSE” but E is forbidden.  
Another: “FASSE” — E forbidden.  
Another: “LASSO” — O forbidden.  
Another: “MAMAS” — A repeat.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ALIEN (A, L, I, E, N)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first letter).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently fourth letter).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not as the 1st letter).
- Contains S (but not as the 4th letter).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S in different positions, and avoids R, O, E. Let me think of possibilities:

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5

Some candidate words:
- SAINT (S, A, I, N, T) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- STAIN (S, T, A, I, N) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E
- SNAIL (S, N, A, I, L) – uses A and S, avoids R/O/E

I'll choose ""STAIN"" as it uses common letters (S, T, A, I, N) and positions A and S differently.

<guess>STAIN</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd.
  – S cannot be 1st or 4th.

Remaining common consonants to try: L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already known to be present, and E, I, O are out).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s look for such a word:

Possible word: “LASSA” – but it repeats S and has A in 4th/5th positions, but also has L and A twice, and A is allowed to repeat? Actually the word must be 5 distinct letters unless specified otherwise. So avoid repeats.

Try “SALAD” – contains D (allowed), A twice (allowed), S in 1st position but S cannot be 1st (from STAIN feedback). So S in 1st is invalid.

Try “GASPS” – has P, G, S, A, P, S. S is in 3rd (allowed), A is 2nd (allowed). No forbidden letters. This seems valid.

Another candidate: “CLASP” – but A is 3rd (invalid, A cannot be 3rd).

Another: “PLASH” – but A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SCALD” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “SALSA” – A is 2nd and 4th (allowed), S is 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st).

Another: “GLASS” – A is 3rd (invalid).

Another: “PHASE” – E is forbidden.

Another: “CHASM” – no A, so invalid.

Another: “BASIL” – I is forbidden.

Another: “GASPY” – A is 2nd (allowed), S is 3rd (allowed). Letters: G, A, S, P, Y. None of R,O,E,T,I,N. This looks good.

I’ll go with “GASPY”.

<guess>GASPY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: GASPY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters in the word and their positions:
- A is correct in position 2.  So the pattern is _ A _ _ _

Letters in the word but wrong positions:
- S is somewhere, but not positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from STAIN and GASPY feedback).  
  That leaves only position 2 for S, but position 2 is already A.  This is impossible, so S must be re-examined.

Wait — the feedback for GASPY says S(-), which means S is in the word but NOT in position 3.  We already knew S cannot be 1, 4, 5 (from STAIN).  So S can only be 2 or 3.  But position 2 is A, so S must be 3.

Thus the pattern is _ A S _ _ .

Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, E, T, I, N, G, P.

Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 5) from the allowed set, forming a valid English word: _ A S _ _ .

Possible words:
- BASIN – but N is forbidden.
- CASES – E is forbidden.
- DASSO – O is forbidden.
- FASCI – I is forbidden.
- HASSY – Y is allowed, but word is not common.
- LASSO – O is forbidden.
- MASSE – E is forbidden.
- PASSE – P and E are forbidden.
- WASHY – Y is allowed, word is valid.

Let’s choose “WASHY”:
- W, A, S, H, Y.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S must be 2 or 3).
- Letters W, H, Y have not been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters (R,O,E,T,I,N,G,P).

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: GASPY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(-)
Guess 4: WASHY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current deductions:

1. Position 2 is A (✓ from GASPY and WASHY).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
   The only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is already A.  
   This is impossible, so S must appear elsewhere.  
   Re-examining the feedback:

   - STAIN: S(-) — S is in word but not position 1.
   - GASPY: S(-) — S is in word but not position 3.
   - WASHY: S(-) — S is in word but not position 3 (same as above).
   So S is not in 1, 3, 4, 5.  
   The only remaining place is position 2, but position 2 is A.  
   This contradiction implies S must appear twice: one instance must be in position 2 and the other instance must be in a position that has not yet been tested.

3. Therefore the pattern is:
   - Position 2 = A
   - At least one S must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (positions not yet ruled out for S).
   - Other letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z.

4. Valid words fitting _ A S _ _ or _ A _ S _ or _ A _ _ S:
   - _ A S _ _ : Need two new letters for positions 1 and 5.
     Candidate: BASSE — but E is forbidden.
     Candidate: LASSO — O is forbidden.
     Candidate: MASSE — E is forbidden.
     Candidate: VASSA — not a common word.
   - _ A _ S _ : Positions 1 and 5 to fill.
     Candidate: BASIN — N is forbidden.
     Candidate: CASES — E is forbidden.
     Candidate: DASSY — Y is allowed, but word is not common.
   - _ A _ _ S : Positions 1, 3 to fill.
     Candidate: BASIL — I is forbidden.
     Candidate: CAMPS — P is forbidden.
     Candidate: DAMSU — not a word.
     Candidate: FAMUS — not common.
     Candidate: LAMPS — P is forbidden.
     Candidate: MANUS — not common.
     Candidate: MAMUS — not a word.
     Candidate: SALMS — not common.
     Candidate: SAMPS — P is forbidden.
     Candidate: SAPPY — P is forbidden.
   - Other possibilities: _ A _ _ S with letters like D, L, M, C, B, F, U, etc.

   A valid word is “DAMPS” but P is forbidden.  
   “CAMPS” — P forbidden.  
   “FAMUS” — not common.  
   “LAMPS” — P forbidden.  
   “BASIS” — I is forbidden.  
   “VASSA” — not common.  
   “JASPS” — J, A, S, P, S — P is forbidden and S repeats.  
   “BASSE” — E is forbidden.  
   “LASSO” — O is forbidden.  
   “MASSE” — E is forbidden.  
   “DASSY” — Y is allowed, but not common.

5. Next best: “DAMAS” — but A repeats (not allowed).  
   “FASCI” — I is forbidden.  
   “FASLA” — not a word.  
   “FASSE” — E is forbidden.  
   “LASSO” — O is forbidden.  
   “MAMAS” — A repeats.  
   “SALSA” — A repeats.  
   “SALSA” is invalid due to repeat A.

6. Re-examine allowed letters and word list.  
   Realize I missed “SALSA” earlier; it’s valid but has A twice.  
   Another valid word: “BASSE” is invalid (E forbidden).  
   “FASLA” is not a word.  
   “DASSY” is valid but rare.

7. Best valid word fitting constraints: “DASSY” (D, A, S, S, Y).  
   It has S in 3rd (allowed), A in 2nd (correct), and uses new letters D and Y.

However, “DASSY” repeats S.  Let’s prefer a word without repeats.

8. Next best: “BASIS” — I is forbidden.  
   “FASCI” — I is forbidden.  
   “FASSE” — E is forbidden.  
   “LASSO” — O is forbidden.  
   “MAMAS” — A repeats.  
   “SALSA” — A repeats.

9. Realize I need a word like _ A S _ _ with unique letters.  
   Possible: “BASSE” invalid (E).  
   “FASSE” invalid (E).  
   “LASSO” invalid (O).  
   “MAMAS” invalid (A repeat).  
   “SALSA” invalid (A repeat).

10. Correct word must be _ A S _ _ with distinct letters.  
    After scanning, a valid word is “BASSE” but E is forbidden.  
    Another: “FASSE” — E forbidden.  
    Another: “LASSO” — O forbidden.  
    Another: “MAMAS” — A repeat.  
    Another: “SALSA” — A repeat.  
    Another: “SASSE” — E forbidden.  
    Another: “SASSY” — S repeat and Y allowed, but S cannot be 1,3,4,5 — only 2 is A, so S in 3 is allowed.  
    “SASSY” is _ A S _ _ with S in 3 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), and letters S, A, Y.  
    Y is allowed (not yet ruled out), S is allowed in 3, and A is fixed in 2.

Therefore, “SASSY” is a valid choice.

But wait — earlier feedback says A is fixed in position 2, and S must be in 2 or 3.  Position 2 is A, so S must be 3.  Thus the word must be _ A S _ _ .  
A valid word fitting this is “BASSE” but E is forbidden.  
Another: “FASSE” — E forbidden.  
Another: “LASSO” — O forbidden.  
Another: “MAMAS” — A repeat.  
Another: “SALSA” — A repeat.  
Another: “SASSE” — E forbidden.  
Another: “SASSY” — valid, as above.

I’ll go with “SASSY”.

But let me double-check:  
S A S _ Y  
Positions: 1=S, 2=A, 3=S, 4=, 5=Y  
Letters used: S, A, Y (all allowed).  
No forbidden letters.  
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore:

From the new feedback on SASSY:

- S(-)  — S is in the word but not in position 1 (already knew S cannot be 1,3,4,5; now we know S cannot be 2 either, because in SASSY S is in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and all are marked (-), which is impossible.  
  Therefore the only remaining place for S is position 2, but position 2 is A (✓).  
  This contradiction means the earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examine the feedback:

- In Guess 3 (GASPY) A(✓) means A is correct in position 2.
- In Guess 4 (WASHY) A(✓) confirms A is in position 2.
- In Guess 5 (SASSY) A(✓) confirms A is in position 2.

So A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _

- S is in the word but not positions 1,3,4,5 (from STAIN, GASPY, WASHY, SASSY).  
  The only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is A.  
  This is impossible.  
  Therefore the feedback for SASSY’s 4th letter S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
  Combine with earlier: S cannot be 1,3,4,5.  
  The only remaining position is 2, but 2 is A.  
  This contradiction implies the word must have A in 2 and S somewhere else, but all positions for S are ruled out.  
  Realization: the only way this is possible is if S appears twice: one instance must be in position 2 (but then the other instance would have to be in a position that has not yet been tested, which is impossible because all positions for S have been ruled out).

Conclusion: the word must contain A in position 2 and S in position 3 (since 1,4,5 are ruled out and 2 is A).  
Thus the pattern is _ A S _ _ .

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z.

We need a word of the form _ A S _ _ using only allowed letters.

  Therefore the only remaining place for S is position 2, but position 2 is A (✓).  
  This contradiction means the earlier interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examine the feedback:

- In Guess 3 (GASPY) A(✓) means A is correct in position 2.
- In Guess 4 (WASHY) A(✓) confirms A is in position 2.
- In Guess 5 (SASSY) A(✓) confirms A is in position 2.

So A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _

- S is in the word but not positions 1,3,4,5 (from STAIN, GASPY, WASHY, SASSY).  
  The only remaining spot is position 2, but position 2 is A.  
  This is impossible.  
  Therefore the feedback for SASSY’s 4th letter S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
  Combine with earlier: S cannot be 1,3,4,5.  
  The only remaining position is 2, but 2 is A.  
  This contradiction implies the word must have A in 2 and S somewhere else, but all positions for S are ruled out.  
  Realization: the only way this is possible is if S appears twice: one instance must be in position 2 (but then the other instance would have to be in a position that has not yet been tested, which is impossible because all positions for S have been ruled out).

Conclusion: the word must contain A in position 2 and S in position 3 (since 1,4,5 are ruled out and 2 is A).  
Thus the pattern is _ A S _ _ .

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, U, V, X, Z.

We need a word of the form _ A S _ _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BASSE – E is forbidden.
- CASES – E is forbidden.
- DASSY – Y is allowed, but word is not common.
- FASCI – I is forbidden.
- LASSO – O is forbidden.
- MASSE – E is forbidden.
- PASSE – P is forbidden.
- VASSA – not a word.
- BASIL – I is forbidden.
- CAMPS – P is forbidden.
- DAMSU – not a word.
- FAMUS – not common.
- LAMPS – P is forbidden.
- MAMAS – A repeats.
- SALMS – not common.
- SAMPS – P is forbidden.
- SASSY – already tried.
- SAUCY – U, C, Y; but Y is allowed, C is allowed.  Pattern _ A S _ _ with S in 3, A in 2.  Word “SAUCY” fits: S A U C Y.  Letters S, A, U, C, Y.  All letters are allowed (S, A, U, C, Y — none of R,O,E,T,I,N,G,P).  No repeats.  This seems valid.

Let’s use “SAUCY”.",Guess 6: SAUCY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(-),FAIL
