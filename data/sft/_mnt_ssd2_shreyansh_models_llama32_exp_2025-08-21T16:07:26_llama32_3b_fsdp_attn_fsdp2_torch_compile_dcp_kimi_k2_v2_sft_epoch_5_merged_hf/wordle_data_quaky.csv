### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the new feedback on BADLY:
- B, D, L are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it moved from ✓ to -).  
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is now _ _ _ _ Y.

- Pattern: _ _ _ _ Y

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ A _ _ _.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A in the second position.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters left that are common and haven’t been ruled out: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I’ll look for a word with A in position 2 and try to include as many of the still-valid common letters as possible.

Some candidates:
- SALTY – contains S, A, L, T, Y (but Y is less common).
- PATIO – contains P, A, T, I, O (but O and I are good).
- BLOAT – contains B, L, O, A, T (but O and L are good).
- STAMP – contains S, T, A, M, P.

""STAMP"" uses S, T, A, M, P – all common and none of the excluded letters. It has A in the right spot and gives us info on S, T, M, P.

Let’s go with STAMP.

<guess>STAMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- The word has A in position 2 (second letter).
- Letters that have been ruled out: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P.

Still-valid common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern _ A _ _ _ and none of the excluded letters.

Good candidates:
- BAGGY – but G is repeated and Y is less common.
- BADLY – uses B, A, D, L, Y. All letters are still valid.
- HABIT – but T is excluded (not in HABIT, so okay).
- GAVEL – but E is excluded.
- FABLE – but E is excluded.
- VAULT – but T is excluded.
- LAITY – but Y is less common and L, A, I, T, Y: T is excluded.
- BALKY – but K and Y are okay, B, A, L, K, Y. All letters are valid.

""BALKY"" uses B, A, L, K, Y – none of the excluded letters and A is in the correct spot. It also gives us info on B, L, K, Y.

Another good option is ""BADLY"" (B, A, D, L, Y). Between these, ""BADLY"" seems slightly better because D is a mid-frequency consonant we haven't tested yet.

Let's go with BADLY.

2. Uses only letters not yet excluded.

The only valid 5-letter word I can find that meets all constraints is “FOGAY,” but that’s not a recognized English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ A _ _ _.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A in the second position.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters left that are common and haven’t been ruled out: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I’ll look for a word with A in position 2 and try to include as many of the still-valid common letters as possible.

Some candidates:
- SALTY – contains S, A, L, T, Y (but Y is less common).
- PATIO – contains P, A, T, I, O (but O and I are good).
- BLOAT – contains B, L, O, A, T (but O and L are good).
- STAMP – contains S, T, A, M, P.

""STAMP"" uses S, T, A, M, P – all common and none of the excluded letters. It has A in the right spot and gives us info on S, T, M, P.

Let’s go with STAMP.

<guess>STAMP</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So far we know:
- The word has A in position 2 (second letter).
- Letters that have been ruled out: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P.

Still-valid common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern _ A _ _ _ and none of the excluded letters.

Good candidates:
- BAGGY – but G is repeated and Y is less common.
- BADLY – uses B, A, D, L, Y. All letters are still valid.
- HABIT – but T is excluded (not in HABIT, so okay).
- GAVEL – but E is excluded.
- FABLE – but E is excluded.
- VAULT – but T is excluded.
- LAITY – but Y is less common and L, A, I, T, Y: T is excluded.
- BALKY – but K and Y are okay, B, A, L, K, Y. All letters are valid.

""BALKY"" uses B, A, L, K, Y – none of the excluded letters and A is in the correct spot. It also gives us info on B, L, K, Y.

Another good option is ""BADLY"" (B, A, D, L, Y). Between these, ""BADLY"" seems slightly better because D is a mid-frequency consonant we haven't tested yet.

Let's go with BADLY.

<guess>BADLY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: BADLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on BADLY:
- B, D, L are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it moved from ✓ to -).  
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is now _ _ _ _ Y.

Combining with earlier rules:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ Y
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, B, D, L
- Still-valid common letters: F, G, H, I, K, O, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y that:
1. Has A somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since A is no longer in position 2).
2. Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible A positions:
- A _ _ _ Y
- _ _ A _ Y
- _ _ _ A Y

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns, using only allowed letters:

- A _ _ _ Y: AFOUL (but O, U are allowed), AGGY (G repeated, Y at end), etc. AGGY uses A, G, G, Y – G is allowed.
- _ _ A _ Y: FOGAY (not a word), COGAY (not a word), VOGAY (not a word). None seem valid.
- _ _ _ A Y: FOGAY (not valid), COGAY (not valid), VOGAY (not valid). None seem valid.

The most promising valid word fitting all constraints is AGGY:
- A in position 1 (new position for A)
- G, G, Y all allowed (G not yet excluded)
- Ends with Y (correct position)

Let’s verify:
- A in position 1: new info on A’s position.
- G, G, Y: none of these letters have been ruled out.

Thus, AGGY is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
Guess 3: BADLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: AGGY -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The feedback on AGGY says it’s “Model answer is not five letters,” so AGGY is not considered a 5-letter word for this puzzle.  
I must pick a 5-letter word that:
- ends with Y  
- has A in position 1, 3, or 4  
- contains none of the already-excluded letters (C, R, N, E, S, T, M, P, B, D, L)

Still-valid common letters: F, G, H, I, K, O, U, V, W.

Looking for words that fit _ _ _ _ Y with A in positions 1, 3, or 4:

A _ _ _ Y  →  AFOGY? (not a word)  
_ A _ _ Y  →  COGAY (not valid)  
_ _ A _ Y  →  VOGAY (not valid)  
_ _ _ A Y  →  FOGAY (not valid)

The only valid 5-letter word I can find that meets all constraints is “FOGAY,” but that’s not a recognized English word.  
Another check: “WACKY” – W, A, C, K, Y. C is already excluded.  
“VAGUE” – ends with E, excluded.  
“HAPPY” – P is excluded.  
“GAMBY” – M, B excluded.  
“FAIRY” – R excluded.  
“KAITY” – T excluded.  
“GAUDY” – D, U, Y allowed? D is excluded.  
“GAFFE” – F, F, E excluded.  
“GAHUY” – not a word.  
“GAJFY” – not a word.  
“GAMBY” – M, B excluded.  
“GAVIN” – N excluded.  
“GAYLE” – E, L excluded.  
“GAYOR” – R excluded.  
“GAYY” – Y repeated, but Y is allowed.  
“GAYY” is a recognized 5-letter word (a slang term for “gay” or “happy”), uses only G, A, Y, and Y is allowed.

Therefore, “GAYY” satisfies every constraint.
