### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- S + E + E + E (but double E might be unlikely)
- S + E + consonant + E
- S + consonant + E + E
- S + E + E + consonant

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with S that fit:
- SIREN (S ✓, I, R, E, N - E in 4th position)
- SWEET (but has two E's, and we don't know if E is doubled)
- SPREE (double E is possible but less likely)
- SNEER (S, N, E, E, R - E appears twice)
- SWORD (S, W, O, R, D - no E, so invalid)
- SKEET (S, K, E, E, T - but T is excluded)

SIREN seems like the best choice: it uses E in the 4th position (not 5th), starts with S, and avoids L, A, T.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1.

   - R is NOT in position 3 (from SIREN).
   - N is NOT in position 5 (from SIREN).
3. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, I.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _
with E, R, N somewhere in positions 2–5 (and E not in 4 or 5).

Possible positions for E, R, N:
- E can be 2 or 3
- R can be 2, 4, or 5
- N can be 2, 3, or 4

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses E, R, N in new positions
- Introduces one or two new common consonants (like D, C, H, M, etc.)

Candidate words:
- S _ _ _ _ with E, R, N, and two new letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- SNEER – but we already saw N and E and R are in the word; however, the second E and the second R would be in positions 3 and 5 respectively, which could be useful.
- SCREW – but W is less common and we’ve already ruled out T and L.
- SHERD – but D is okay, H is okay, and E is in position 3, R in 4, N in 5. This uses E, R, N in new spots.
- SNEAK – but A is already ruled out.
- SWORD – but O and D are okay, and R is in 4, N in 5, E in 2. This looks good: S W O R D uses only allowed letters and places E in position 2, R in 4, N in 5.

Let me check SWORD:
- S ✓ (position 1)

- O (new letter)  
- R (in position 4, not tried before)  
- D (new letter)  

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

   - E is NOT in position 5 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 4 (from SIREN).
   - R is NOT in position 3 (from SIREN).
   - N is NOT in position 5 (from SIREN).
3. Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, I.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _
with E, R, N somewhere in positions 2–5 (and E not in 4 or 5).

Possible positions for E, R, N:
- E can be 2 or 3
- R can be 2, 4, or 5
- N can be 2, 3, or 4

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Uses E, R, N in new positions
- Introduces one or two new common consonants (like D, C, H, M, etc.)

Candidate words:
- S _ _ _ _ with E, R, N, and two new letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- SNEER – but we already saw N and E and R are in the word; however, the second E and the second R would be in positions 3 and 5 respectively, which could be useful.
- SCREW – but W is less common and we’ve already ruled out T and L.
- SHERD – but D is okay, H is okay, and E is in position 3, R in 4, N in 5. This uses E, R, N in new spots.
- SNEAK – but A is already ruled out.
- SWORD – but O and D are okay, and R is in 4, N in 5, E in 2. This looks good: S W O R D uses only allowed letters and places E in position 2, R in 4, N in 5.

Let me check SWORD:
- S ✓ (position 1)  
- W (new letter)  
- O (new letter)  
- R (in position 4, not tried before)  
- D (new letter)  

This seems optimal.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. The word must contain E, R, N (they all appeared as ""-"" or ""✓"" in earlier positions).
3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - E: not 4, not 5 (from SLATE and SIREN/SWORD)
   - R: not 3 (from SIREN), not 4 (from SWORD)
   - N: not 5 (from SIREN), not 4 (from SWORD)

So the actual positions that remain possible for each are:
- E: 2 or 3
- R: 2 or 5
- N: 2 or 3

Also, we also know:
- Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, I, W, D

So the word must look like:
S _ _ _ _
with E, R, N occupying positions 2, 3, 5 (since those are the only remaining slots for them).

Let’s list the only possible permutations of E, R, N in positions 2, 3, 5:

- Position 2: E or N
- Position 3: E or N
- Position 5: R

The only valid permutations are:
1. S N E R _
2. S E N R _
3. S N _ E R
4. S E _ N R
5. S _ N E R
6. S _ E N R

But we must check which of these form real 5-letter words starting with S, containing only allowed letters.

Checking valid English words:
- S N E R _ → SNERR (invalid)
- S E N R _ → SENR_ (invalid)
- S N _ E R → SN_ER → ""SNGER"" (invalid)
- S E _ N R → SE_NR → ""SENGR"" (invalid)
- S _ N E R → S_N ER → ""SONER"" (invalid)
- S _ E N R → S_E_N R → ""S E N R"" → ""SENOR"" (valid word!)

""SENOR"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Contains E, N, R
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: S, E, N, O, R – but we already ruled out T, L, A, I, W, D, so O is still possible (it was marked ""-"" in SWORD, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3). However, we didn’t use O yet, so it’s allowed.

Thus, ""SENOR"" is the only plausible remaining word.
