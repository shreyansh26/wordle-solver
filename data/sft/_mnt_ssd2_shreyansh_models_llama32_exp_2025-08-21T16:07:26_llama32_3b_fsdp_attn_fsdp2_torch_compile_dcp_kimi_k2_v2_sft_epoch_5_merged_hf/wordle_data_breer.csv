### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

- G R E B → uses B twice → but B is allowed; pattern matches  
- G R E E D → uses D (eliminated) → invalid  
- P R E E N → uses P (eliminated) → invalid

Let’s choose “GREEN”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, while also covering many potential letters in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _ with an E somewhere else (positions 1,3,4 or 5).

To explore common consonants and keep the E while avoiding the eliminated letters (A,O,S), I'll try ""TREAD"":
- T and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- E is kept but moved to position 4.
- This also tests the new letters T and D.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R E _ _  (R is fixed in 2nd, E is fixed in 3rd)
- Eliminated letters: A, O, S, T, D
- Still available letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more consonants (positions 1 and 5) from the available pool, and one vowel (position 4) from the available vowels (only E is already confirmed in the word; other vowels might still be possible).

A good next probe should test common consonants and possibly the vowel I (since E is already placed). Let’s try “CREPE”:
- C and P are common consonants.
- I is an untested vowel.
- This fits the pattern _ R E _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Guess 3: CREPE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) E(✓) P(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ R E _ _  (R in 2nd, E in 3rd)
- Letters eliminated so far: A, O, S, T, D, C, P
- E appears at least twice: one in the 3rd position and possibly another in another position (since the second E in CREPE was marked “-”, i.e., letter exists but is not in 5th spot).

Available letters to try:
Consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U  (E is already known to be present)

We need a word that fits _ R E _ _ and uses only still-allowed letters, while also testing new consonants and possibly the vowel I or U.

Candidate words:
- B R E A K → uses A (eliminated) → invalid  
- F R E S H → uses S (eliminated) → invalid  
- G R E B → uses B twice → but B is allowed; pattern matches  
- G R E E D → uses D (eliminated) → invalid  
- P R E E N → uses P (eliminated) → invalid  
- G R E E N → uses N → matches pattern, tests G, N, and confirms E placement.

Let’s choose “GREEN”:
- G and N are new consonants.
- E is confirmed in 3rd position.
- This also tests the vowel E in 4th position (but we already know E is in 3rd, so this is fine).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _ with an E somewhere else (positions 1,3,4 or 5).

To explore common consonants and keep the E while avoiding the eliminated letters (A,O,S), I'll try ""TREAD"":
- T and D are common consonants not yet tested.
- E is kept but moved to position 4.
- This also tests the new letters T and D.

Available letters to try:
Consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U  (E is already known to be present)

We need a word that fits _ R E _ _ and uses only still-allowed letters, while also testing new consonants and possibly the vowel I or U.

Candidate words:
- B R E A K → uses A (eliminated) → invalid  
- F R E S H → uses S (eliminated) → invalid  
- G R E B → uses B twice → but B is allowed; pattern matches  
- G R E E D → uses D (eliminated) → invalid  
- P R E E N → uses P (eliminated) → invalid  
- G R E E N → uses N → matches pattern, tests G, N, and confirms E placement.

Let’s choose “GREEN”:
