For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate should also try new common consonants to maximize information. The word ""SAINT"" uses S and A, avoids the excluded letters, and places S in position 1 and A in position 2 (new positions). It also introduces new consonants N and T to test.

Let’s update what we now know:

Positions 1 and 2 are fixed: S A _ _ _

Letters already ruled out entirely: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, D

Letters that appeared in SCALD but were only partially correct:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it moved from ✓ to –).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it moved from – to –).

So the pattern is S A _ _ _, and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 3-5, while avoiding all eliminated letters.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-known A and L.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “SA” and uses L somewhere in positions 3-5, and fills the remaining spots with untested letters.

Possible candidates:
- S A L _ _  → need two more letters; e.g., SALTY (but T is out), SALSA (but S is already used), SALVO (O is out), SALSA (again, S already used).
- S A _ L _  → e.g., SAMPL (but P and M are still allowed), SABLY (but Y is still allowed), SAGLY (not a word), SAMPY (not a word).
- S A _ _ L  → e.g., SABBL (not a word), SAMBL (not a word), SAPPY (Y is allowed), SAUGL (not a word), SAVEL (E is out).

A real word that fits is “SALTY” but T is eliminated. Another is “SALSA” but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if repeats are allowed, and A is already in position 2. Another is “SALVO” but O is eliminated.

Looking again, a valid word is “SABLY”:
- S A B L Y
- Letters used: S, A, B, L, Y
- All letters are still allowed (B, Y are new; L is in a new position)
- Positions: S(1)✓, A(2)✓, B(new), L(new position), Y(new)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the most common letters efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1)
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions. A good candidate should also try new common consonants to maximize information. The word ""SAINT"" uses S and A, avoids the excluded letters, and places S in position 1 and A in position 2 (new positions). It also introduces new consonants N and T to test.

Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on SAINT:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word and in the correct second position (✓).
- I, N, T are not in the word at all (x).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word so far: S (pos 1), A (pos 2)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T
- Still need 3 more letters for positions 3-5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the eliminated letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides A already used)

I’ll look for a word that keeps S and A in positions 1-2, uses new letters for 3-5, and tries common consonants to narrow things down quickly. A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- S and A stay in positions 1-2.
- C, L, D are new letters not yet tested.
- All letters are still allowed and we haven’t had any positive feedback on these letters yet, so this is a safe next guess.

I’ll look for a word that keeps S and A in positions 1-2, uses new letters for 3-5, and tries common consonants to narrow things down quickly. A good candidate is “SCALD”:
- S and A stay in positions 1-2.
- C, L, D are new letters not yet tested.
- All letters are still allowed and we haven’t had any positive feedback on these letters yet, so this is a safe next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SCALD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(-) L(-) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let’s update what we now know:

Positions 1 and 2 are fixed: S A _ _ _

Letters already ruled out entirely: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, D

Letters that appeared in SCALD but were only partially correct:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it moved from ✓ to –).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it moved from – to –).

So the pattern is S A _ _ _, and the remaining letters must include A and L somewhere in positions 3-5, while avoiding all eliminated letters.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-known A and L.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “SA” and uses L somewhere in positions 3-5, and fills the remaining spots with untested letters.

Possible candidates:
- S A L _ _  → need two more letters; e.g., SALTY (but T is out), SALSA (but S is already used), SALVO (O is out), SALSA (again, S already used).
- S A _ L _  → e.g., SAMPL (but P and M are still allowed), SABLY (but Y is still allowed), SAGLY (not a word), SAMPY (not a word).
- S A _ _ L  → e.g., SABBL (not a word), SAMBL (not a word), SAPPY (Y is allowed), SAUGL (not a word), SAVEL (E is out).

A real word that fits is “SALTY” but T is eliminated. Another is “SALSA” but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if repeats are allowed, and A is already in position 2. Another is “SALVO” but O is eliminated.

Looking again, a valid word is “SABLY”:
- S A B L Y
- Letters used: S, A, B, L, Y
- All letters are still allowed (B, Y are new; L is in a new position)
- Positions: S(1)✓, A(2)✓, B(new), L(new position), Y(new)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Guess 4: SABLY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) B(x) L(-) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Current knowledge:
- Fixed: S A _ _ _
- Letters confirmed in word: S (pos 1), A (pos 2), L (somewhere in 3-5, but not 4)
- Letters ruled out: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, D, B, Y

So the word is S A _ _ _ and must include L in position 3 or 5 (since L is not in 4).

Remaining letters to try: F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, plus L in either 3rd or 5th.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SA, containing L, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- S A L _ _  (L in 3rd)
- S A _ _ L  (L in 5th)

Looking for real words:
- SALAD: uses D (eliminated) – invalid
- SALSA: uses S (already in 1) and A (already in 2) twice – possible but let’s see
- SALTY: T eliminated – invalid
- SALVO: O eliminated – invalid
- SAPPY: P, Y (Y eliminated) – invalid
- SAMPL: M, P, L – all allowed, L in 5th – valid word
- SAGLY: G, L, Y (Y eliminated) – invalid
- SALSH: S already in 1, H allowed – but S is already used in 1, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed

The word ""SAMPL"" fits perfectly:
- S A M P L
- L is in position 5 (new position)
- M, P are new letters not yet tested
- All letters are still allowed
