### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

I'll try a word that uses common remaining letters and places S and E in new positions. ""STEIN"" is a good option because:
- Contains S and E
- Uses common consonants T and N
- Uses I (another common vowel)
- Places S in position 1 (new position)

   - T, I, N are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in: S, E
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: only E (since A, O, I are out, U is still possible)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, I, N
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place S and E while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S in position 1 is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1), so let’s avoid S in position 1.
- Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2 or 3.

Another candidate: “BENCH” – but N is out.
“LUMPY” – no S.
“GUESS” – has S twice and G, U.
“GUESS” is valid, contains S and E, and introduces G, U.

But let’s try a simpler word first: “SWEET” – but T is out.
“SHELF” – S in position 1 is bad.
“PESTY” – P, E, S, T, Y – T is out.
“FLESH” – F, L, E, S, H – all letters are allowed, and S is in position 4 (allowed), E in position 3 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 3).

So E cannot be in position 3. Let’s avoid that.

Try “SPELK” – but K is uncommon.
Try “SLEEK” – E in position 3 (forbidden).
Try “SHELF” – S in 1 (forbidden).
Try “PESTY” – T is out.

Let’s try “GUESS”:
- G, U, S, S, E
- S is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)
- E is in position 5 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 5)
So “GUESS” is bad.

Try “WELSH”:
- W, E, L, S, H
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (W, E, L, S, H – none are out)
This seems good.

Let’s go with “WELSH”.

Check:
- Letters: W, E, L, S, H – none of A, R, O, T, I, N

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 (was in position 4 in AROSE)
- E is not in position 5 (was in position 5 in AROSE)

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E
2. Does not include A, R, O
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5

Good candidate letters to try next: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I'll try a word that uses common remaining letters and places S and E in new positions. ""STEIN"" is a good option because:
- Contains S and E
- Uses common consonants T and N
- Uses I (another common vowel)
- Places S in position 1 (new position)
- Places E in position 3 (new position)

This should help us learn more about the remaining letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in: S, E
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: only E (since A, O, I are out, U is still possible)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, I, N
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place S and E while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S in position 1 is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1), so let’s avoid S in position 1.
- Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2 or 3.

Another candidate: “BENCH” – but N is out.
“LUMPY” – no S.
“GUESS” – has S twice and G, U.
“GUESS” is valid, contains S and E, and introduces G, U.

But let’s try a simpler word first: “SWEET” – but T is out.
“SHELF” – S in position 1 is bad.
“PESTY” – P, E, S, T, Y – T is out.
“FLESH” – F, L, E, S, H – all letters are allowed, and S is in position 4 (allowed), E in position 3 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 3).

So E cannot be in position 3. Let’s avoid that.

Try “SPELK” – but K is uncommon.
Try “SLEEK” – E in position 3 (forbidden).
Try “SHELF” – S in 1 (forbidden).
Try “PESTY” – T is out.

Let’s try “GUESS”:
- G, U, S, S, E
- S is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)
- E is in position 5 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 5)
So “GUESS” is bad.

Try “FLESH”:
- F, L, E, S, H
- E in position 3 (forbidden).
Bad.

Try “WELSH”:
- W, E, L, S, H
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (W, E, L, S, H – none are out)
This seems good.

Let’s go with “WELSH”.

Check:
- Letters: W, E, L, S, H – none of A, R, O, T, I, N
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- All new letters introduced: W, L, H

This should be efficient.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)

- Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already E.
- This is impossible, which means our previous assumption was wrong.

Let’s re-examine:
- From WELSH: S was in position 4 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 4.
- From PESKY: S was in position 3 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 3.

Thus, S must be in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is E. Therefore, S must be in position 5.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 21 Aug 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 (was in position 4 in AROSE)
- E is not in position 5 (was in position 5 in AROSE)

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E
2. Does not include A, R, O
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5

Good candidate letters to try next: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I'll try a word that uses common remaining letters and places S and E in new positions. ""STEIN"" is a good option because:
- Contains S and E
- Uses common consonants T and N
- Uses I (another common vowel)
- Places S in position 1 (new position)
- Places E in position 3 (new position)

This should help us learn more about the remaining letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are out.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in: S, E
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: only E (since A, O, I are out, U is still possible)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, I, N
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to place S and E while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “SHELF”:
- S in position 1 is forbidden (feedback says S is not in position 1), so let’s avoid S in position 1.
- Let’s try “E” in position 1 and S in position 2 or 3.

Another candidate: “BENCH” – but N is out.
“LUMPY” – no S.
“GUESS” – has S twice and G, U.
“GUESS” is valid, contains S and E, and introduces G, U.

But let’s try a simpler word first: “SWEET” – but T is out.
“SHELF” – S in position 1 is bad.
“PESTY” – P, E, S, T, Y – T is out.
“FLESH” – F, L, E, S, H – all letters are allowed, and S is in position 4 (allowed), E in position 3 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 3).

So E cannot be in position 3. Let’s avoid that.

Try “SPELK” – but K is uncommon.
Try “SLEEK” – E in position 3 (forbidden).
Try “SHELF” – S in 1 (forbidden).
Try “PESTY” – T is out.

Let’s try “GUESS”:
- G, U, S, S, E
- S is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)
- E is in position 5 (forbidden, feedback says E is not in position 5)
So “GUESS” is bad.

Try “FLESH”:
- F, L, E, S, H
- E in position 3 (forbidden).
Bad.

Try “WELSH”:
- W, E, L, S, H
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 4 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (W, E, L, S, H – none are out)
This seems good.

Let’s go with “WELSH”.

Check:
- Letters: W, E, L, S, H – none of A, R, O, T, I, N
- S is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- All new letters introduced: W, L, H

This should be efficient.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: WELSH -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(✓) L(x) S(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on WELSH:
- W, L, H are out.
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pos 2 = E
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from AROSE and WELSH feedback)
- Therefore S must be in position 3
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N, W, L, H
- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Now the word looks like: _ E S _ _
We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with allowed letters.

Good candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, Y

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining letters and fits _ E S _ _.

Possible words:
- BESOM – O is out
- CESAR – A, R out
- DESKY – Y is allowed, K is allowed
- FESNY – Y, F, N – N is out
- GESHO – O, H out
- JESSE – S twice, but E is already in position 2
- KESSE – same issue
- MESSY – Y allowed, S again
- PESKY – K, Y allowed
- UESNY – not a word
- VESPY – P, Y allowed
- XESAR – A, R out
- YES, PESKY, VESPY are all valid 5-letter words.

Among these, ""PESKY"" uses P, K, Y – all still allowed and common.

Let’s go with PESKY.

Check:
- P, E, S, K, Y
- E is in position 2 (correct)
- S is in position 3 (correct)
- P, K, Y are new letters
- No forbidden letters

<guess>PESKY</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Guess 4: PESKY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

From the new feedback on PESKY:
- P, K, Y are out.
- E is correctly in position 2.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from previous feedback)
- Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already E.
- This is impossible, which means our previous assumption was wrong.

Let’s re-examine:
- From WELSH: S was in position 4 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 4.
- From PESKY: S was in position 3 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 3.
- From AROSE: S was in position 4 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 4.
- From STEIN: S was in position 1 and feedback was “-” (wrong position). So S is NOT in position 1.
- From PESKY: S was in position 3 again and still “-”, confirming S is NOT in position 3.

Thus, S must be in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is E. Therefore, S must be in position 5.

Current known pattern: _ E _ _ S

Letters definitely out: A, R, O, T, I, N, W, L, H, P, K, Y

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ E _ _ S where the blanks are from the remaining letters.

Possible words:
- B E _ _ S
- C E _ _ S
- D E _ _ S
- F E _ _ S
- G E _ _ S
- M E _ _ S

Looking for valid words:
- BESOM – O is out
- CESAR – A, R out
- DEWES – W is out
- FESKY – K, Y are out
- GESHO – O, H out
- JESSE – S twice but second S would be in position 5, which is already taken by another S in AROSE (but that’s okay as letters can repeat, though feedback didn’t indicate repetition yet)
- MESSY – Y is out
- VESPY – Y is out
- XESAR – A, R out
- ZESLA – A, L out

Actually, let’s think systematically:

- G, M are new and allowed
- E is correct in position 2
- S is correct in position 5
- No forbidden letters
