### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and provides useful information for future guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _.
2. It contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Includes S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does not include A, R, or E.

Possible candidates:
- ""FOSSA"" – but A is excluded.
- ""COYS"" – but needs 5 letters.
- ""GOSSIP"" – too long.
- ""BOSS"" – too short.
- ""DOSS"" – too short.
- ""MOSS"" – too short.
- ""POSS"" – too short.
- ""COBOS"" – but B and C are allowed, but O is already in position 3.
- ""COBOS"" is 5 letters, has O in position 3, includes S, and no A, R, E.

But ""COBOS"" might not be a valid word. Let me think of better options.

Another approach: use common consonants and S in positions 1, 2, 5.

Possible words:
- ""CLOPS"" – C, L, P, S, O. O is in position 4, but we need it in position 3. So this is invalid.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid because O is in position 4, not 3.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ _. So positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are open.

Let me think of words with O in position 3:
- ""CLOPS"" – O is position 3? No, ""CLOPS"" is C L O P S – O is position 3. Yes, this is valid.
- ""CLOPS"" has C, L, O, P, S. O is in position 3, S is in position 5 (so not position 4), and no A, R, E. This seems valid.

Another option: ""GLOBS"" – but O is position 3, S is position 5, no A, R, E. This is valid.

Between ""CLOPS"" and ""GLOBS"", ""CLOPS"" might be better because P is a common consonant.

But let me check if ""CLOPS"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""CLOPS"" is a valid word (the sound a horse makes).

So I'll go with ""CLOPS"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. O is fixed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it was marked “-” when it appeared in those positions).  
   Therefore S must be in position 1 or 2.
3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, C, L, P.

So the word has the pattern:
- S _ O _ _  or  _ S O _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains O in position 3.
- Contains S in position 1 or 2.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters: A, R, E, C, L, P.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

Pattern S _ O _ _  
- S B O N ?  → “SONGS” is invalid (G already used in SONGS, but we haven’t seen G yet).  
- S H O U ?  → “SHOUL” is not a word.  
- S H O R ?  → “SHOR” is not 5 letters.  
- S H O U L → “SHOUL” again.  
- S M O K E → E is eliminated.  
- S M O K Y → Y is allowed, but “SMOKY” is 5 letters and valid.  
- S M O K Y → contains S, M, O, K, Y.  No banned letters.  O is in position 3, S is in position 1.  This fits all constraints.

Pattern _ S O _ _  
- B S O N ?  → “BSO” is not a word.  
- D S O N ?  → “DSO” is not a word.  
- F S O N ?  → “FSO” is not a word.  
- G S O N ?  → “GSO” is not a word.  
- H S O N ?  → “HSO” is not a word.  
- M S O N ?  → “MSO” is not a word.  
- N S O N ?  → “NSO” is not a word.  
- V S O N ?  → “VS” is not a word.  
- W S O N ?  → “WSO” is not a word.  
- Y S O N ?  → “YSO” is not a word.  

So the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “SMOKY”.

Let’s check:
- SMOKY is a valid 5-letter word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 4 and 5).
- Letters used: S, M, O, K, Y.  None of A, R, E, C, L, P appear.  All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next guess is SMOKY.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and provides useful information for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _.
2. It contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Includes S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does not include A, R, or E.

Possible candidates:
- ""FOSSA"" – but A is excluded.
- ""COYS"" – but needs 5 letters.
- ""GOSSIP"" – too long.
- ""BOSS"" – too short.
- ""DOSS"" – too short.
- ""MOSS"" – too short.
- ""POSS"" – too short.
- ""COBOS"" – but B and C are allowed, but O is already in position 3.
- ""COBOS"" is 5 letters, has O in position 3, includes S, and no A, R, E.

But ""COBOS"" might not be a valid word. Let me think of better options.

Another approach: use common consonants and S in positions 1, 2, 5.

Possible words:
- ""CLOPS"" – C, L, P, S, O. O is in position 4, but we need it in position 3. So this is invalid.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid because O is in position 4, not 3.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid.
- ""CLOPS"" is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ _. So positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are open.

Let me think of words with O in position 3:
- ""CLOPS"" – O is position 3? No, ""CLOPS"" is C L O P S – O is position 3. Yes, this is valid.
- ""CLOPS"" has C, L, O, P, S. O is in position 3, S is in position 5 (so not position 4), and no A, R, E. This seems valid.

Another option: ""GLOBS"" – but O is position 3, S is position 5, no A, R, E. This is valid.

Between ""CLOPS"" and ""GLOBS"", ""CLOPS"" might be better because P is a common consonant.

But let me check if ""CLOPS"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""CLOPS"" is a valid word (the sound a horse makes).

So I'll go with ""CLOPS"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. O is fixed in position 3 ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it was marked “-” when it appeared in those positions).  
   Therefore S must be in position 1 or 2.
3. Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, C, L, P.

So the word has the pattern:
- S _ O _ _  or  _ S O _ _

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains O in position 3.
- Contains S in position 1 or 2.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters: A, R, E, C, L, P.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

Pattern S _ O _ _  
- S B O N ?  → “SONGS” is invalid (G already used in SONGS, but we haven’t seen G yet).  
- S H O U ?  → “SHOUL” is not a word.  
- S H O R ?  → “SHOR” is not 5 letters.  
- S H O U L → “SHOUL” again.  
- S M O K E → E is eliminated.  
- S M O K Y → Y is allowed, but “SMOKY” is 5 letters and valid.  
- S M O K Y → contains S, M, O, K, Y.  No banned letters.  O is in position 3, S is in position 1.  This fits all constraints.

Pattern _ S O _ _  
- B S O N ?  → “BSO” is not a word.  
- D S O N ?  → “DSO” is not a word.  
- F S O N ?  → “FSO” is not a word.  
- G S O N ?  → “GSO” is not a word.  
- H S O N ?  → “HSO” is not a word.  
- M S O N ?  → “MSO” is not a word.  
- N S O N ?  → “NSO” is not a word.  
- V S O N ?  → “VS” is not a word.  
- W S O N ?  → “WSO” is not a word.  
- Y S O N ?  → “YSO” is not a word.  

So the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “SMOKY”.

Let’s check:
- SMOKY is a valid 5-letter word.
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of positions 4 and 5).
- Letters used: S, M, O, K, Y.  None of A, R, E, C, L, P appear.  All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next guess is SMOKY.

- S N O O Y – N and O, but ""NOOY"" is not valid

The two valid words are ""SHOWY"" and ""STONY"". Between these, ""STONY"" is more common and uses N and Y, which are still allowed. Let’s check:
- S T O N Y
- S: position 1 (✓)
- T: new letter
- O: position 3 (✓)
- N: new letter
- Y: position 5 (✓)
- Uses none of the eliminated letters
- Valid word

Therefore, the next guess is ""STONY"".
