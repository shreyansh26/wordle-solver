For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)

2. LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
     (This contradicts the first feedback, which said L is in the correct position 1.  
     Therefore the feedback must mean L is in the word and in the correct position 1.)

3. LICON → L(-) I(x) C(-) O(-) N(x)

   – N is not in the word.

Consistent facts:

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing C and O, with C in position 2 or 3 and O in positions 2, 3, or 4, using only allowed letters.

   – C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so skip.

5. C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so no.

6. C in 5 → L _ _ _ C  
   – C in 5 is allowed (feedback only said C is not in 4).  
   – O must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Re-examine feedback interpretation.

Re-reading feedback:
Guess 2: LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
The “-” on L means L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
But first feedback said L is in the correct position 1.  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as L is in the word but not in position 1 (overriding the first feedback).  
Therefore, L is NOT in position 1.  
So the word does NOT start with L.  
This resolves the contradiction.

Now facts:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- C is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Pattern: _ _ _ C _ with L and O somewhere in positions 2-4, and position 5 not O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- C in position 4  
- L and O in positions 1-3 or 5 (but O not 5)  
- No S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, plus C already used in position 4.

Possible structure:

- Position 4: C  
- Position 5: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y (but not O)

We need L and O in positions 1-3, with O not in 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → so the word starts with L
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word looks like: L _ _ _ _

I need a 5-letter word that starts with L and does NOT contain S, A, T, or E.  
Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

A strong next guess is “LURCH” because:
- It starts with L (confirmed)
- Uses common remaining letters: U, R, C, H
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Contains two vowels (U) to test vowel positions

2. LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (contradicts earlier feedback – so L must be in position 1 and the feedback must mean “L is in the word and in the correct position” as before)
   - U, R, H are not in the word
   - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)

So the pattern is: L _ _ C _

Letters ruled out so far: S, A, T, E, U, R, H
Remaining common consonants: N, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, ending with C, and using only allowed letters. Common endings for L _ _ C _:
- L I C O N
- L I C K S (but S is ruled out)
- L O C K S (but starts with L)
- L I C H E (but H and E are ruled out)
- L I C O N seems valid.

Check: L I C O N – letters I, O, N are allowed, no ruled-out letters used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   – Word starts with L (position 1).  
   – No S, A, T, E.

2. LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
     (This contradicts the first feedback, which said L is in the correct position 1.  
     Therefore the feedback must mean L is in the word and in the correct position 1.)  
   – C is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
   – U, R, H are not in the word.

3. LICON → L(-) I(x) C(-) O(-) N(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
     (Again contradicts first feedback.  
     So the feedback must mean L is in the word and in the correct position 1.)  
   – I is not in the word.  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   – N is not in the word.

Consistent facts:
- Pattern: L _ _ _ _  (L in position 1)
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 → must be in position 2 or 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 → could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  
- Remaining common consonants: D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
- Remaining vowels: O (already known), plus none left (A, E, I, U ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing C and O, with C in position 2 or 3 and O in positions 2, 3, or 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible structures:
- L C _ O _  (C in 2, O in 4)
- L _ C O _  (C in 3, O in 4)
- L _ _ C O  (C in 4, but feedback says C is not in 4 → invalid)

Check dictionary:
- L C _ O _ :  
  - L C K O N → N ruled out  
  - L C U O N → U ruled out  
  - L C B O K → not a word  
  - L C D O N → N ruled out  
  - L C M O N → N ruled out  
  - L C P O N → N ruled out  

- L _ C O _ :  
  - L _ C O _ → need a consonant in position 2 and any allowed letter in position 5.  
  - L D C O N → N ruled out  
  - L M C O N → N ruled out  
  - L P C O N → N ruled out  
  - L G C O N → N ruled out  
  - L B C O N → N ruled out  
  - L V C O N → N ruled out  

- L _ _ C O :  
  – C is not in position 4 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Wait – let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with L, containing both C and O, avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  
Allowed letters: L (fixed at 1), C, O, plus D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y

We need C and O somewhere in positions 2-5, with C not in 4 and O not in 5.

Possible placements:
- C in 2, O in 3 or 4  
- C in 3, O in 2 or 4  

Check each:
1. C in 2, O in 3 → L C O _ _  
   – L C O _ _ :  
     L C O D _ → need 5th letter from allowed: D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
     L C O D K → not a word  
     L C O D Y → not a word  
     L C O M _ → L C O M _ : L C O M B → not a word  
     L C O M P → L C O M P → “lcomp” not valid  
     L C O M B → not valid  
     L C O D Y → not valid  

2. C in 2, O in 4 → L C _ O _  
   – L C _ O _ :  
     L C B O N → N ruled out  
     L C D O N → N ruled out  
     L C F O N → N ruled out  
     L C K O N → N ruled out  
     L C M O N → N ruled out  
     L C P O N → N ruled out  
     L C V O N → N ruled out  
     L C W O N → N ruled out  

3. C in 3, O in 2 → L _ C O _  
   – L _ C O _ :  
     L D C O N → N ruled out  
     L M C O N → N ruled out  
     L P C O N → N ruled out  
     L G C O N → N ruled out  
     L B C O N → N ruled out  
     L V C O N → N ruled out  

4. C in 3, O in 4 → L _ _ C O  
   – C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so skip.

5. C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so no.

6. C in 5 → L _ _ _ C  
   – C in 5 is allowed (feedback only said C is not in 4).  
   – O must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
   – L _ _ _ C with O in 2, 3, or 4:  
     – O in 2 → L O _ _ C  
       L O D D C → not a word  
       L O B B C → not a word  
       L O G G C → not a word  
       L O M M C → not a word  
       L O P P C → not a word  
       L O W W C → not a word  
     – O in 3 → L _ O _ C  
       L D O C C → not a word  
       L M O C C → not a word  
       L B O C C → not a word  
       L G O C C → not a word  
       L V O C C → not a word  
     – O in 4 → L _ _ O C  
       L D M O C → not a word  
       L B M O C → not a word  
       L G M O C → not a word  
       L V M O C → not a word  

Seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Re-examine feedback interpretation.

Re-reading feedback:
Guess 2: LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
The “-” on L means L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
But first feedback said L is in the correct position 1.  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as L is in the word but not in position 1 (overriding the first feedback).  
Therefore, L is NOT in position 1.  
So the word does NOT start with L.  
This resolves the contradiction.

Now facts:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- C is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Pattern: _ _ _ C _ with L and O somewhere in positions 2-4, and position 5 not O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- C in position 4  
- L and O in positions 1-3 or 5 (but O not 5)  
- No S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, plus C already used in position 4.

Possible structure:  
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
- Position 2: same  
- Position 3: same  
- Position 4: C  
- Position 5: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y (but not O)

We need L and O in positions 1-3, with O not in 5.

Possible combinations:
- O in 1, L in 2 or 3 → O _ L C _  
  – O B L C _ → O B L C _ : O B L C D → “oblcd” not a word  
  – O D L C _ → not a word  
  – O M L C _ → not a word  
  – O P L C _ → not a word  

- O in 2, L in 1 or 3 → L O _ C _ or _ O L C _  
  – L O _ C _ : L O B C _ → L O B C K → “lobck” not a word  
  – _ O L C _ : B O L C _ → B O L C K → “bolck” not a word  
  – D O L C _ → D O L C K → “dolck” not a word  

- O in 3, L in 1 or 2 → L _ O C _ or _ L O C _  
  – L _ O C _ : L B O C _ → L B O C K → “lboc k” not a word  
  – _ L O C _ : B L O C _ → B L O C K → “block” is a valid word  
    – Check letters: B, L, O, C, K  
    – All allowed (B, L, O, C, K not ruled out)  
    – C is in position 4 (matches feedback)  
    – L is in position 2 (allowed, since L not in position 1)  
    – O is in position 3 (allowed, since O not in 5)  
    – No ruled-out letters used  

“BLOCK” fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → so the word starts with L
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word looks like: L _ _ _ _

I need a 5-letter word that starts with L and does NOT contain S, A, T, or E.  
Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

A strong next guess is “LURCH” because:
- It starts with L (confirmed)
- Uses common remaining letters: U, R, C, H
- Avoids S, A, T, E
- Contains two vowels (U) to test vowel positions

Guess 2: LURCH -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with L (position 1)
   - No S, A, T, E anywhere

2. LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (contradicts earlier feedback – so L must be in position 1 and the feedback must mean “L is in the word and in the correct position” as before)
   - U, R, H are not in the word
   - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)

So the pattern is: L _ _ C _

Letters ruled out so far: S, A, T, E, U, R, H
Remaining common consonants: N, D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, ending with C, and using only allowed letters. Common endings for L _ _ C _:
- L I C O N
- L I C K S (but S is ruled out)
- L O C K S (but starts with L)
- L I C H E (but H and E are ruled out)
- L I C O N seems valid.

Check: L I C O N – letters I, O, N are allowed, no ruled-out letters used.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   – Word starts with L (position 1).  
   – No S, A, T, E.

2. LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
     (This contradicts the first feedback, which said L is in the correct position 1.  
     Therefore the feedback must mean L is in the word and in the correct position 1.)  
   – C is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
   – U, R, H are not in the word.

3. LICON → L(-) I(x) C(-) O(-) N(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
     (Again contradicts first feedback.  
     So the feedback must mean L is in the word and in the correct position 1.)  
   – I is not in the word.  
   – C is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   – N is not in the word.

Consistent facts:
- Pattern: L _ _ _ _  (L in position 1)
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 → must be in position 2 or 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 → could be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  
- Remaining common consonants: D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
- Remaining vowels: O (already known), plus none left (A, E, I, U ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing C and O, with C in position 2 or 3 and O in positions 2, 3, or 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible structures:
- L C _ O _  (C in 2, O in 4)
- L _ C O _  (C in 3, O in 4)
- L _ _ C O  (C in 4, but feedback says C is not in 4 → invalid)

Check dictionary:
- L C _ O _ :  
  - L C K O N → N ruled out  
  - L C U O N → U ruled out  
  - L C B O K → not a word  
  - L C D O N → N ruled out  
  - L C M O N → N ruled out  
  - L C P O N → N ruled out  

- L _ C O _ :  
  - L _ C O _ → need a consonant in position 2 and any allowed letter in position 5.  
  - L D C O N → N ruled out  
  - L M C O N → N ruled out  
  - L P C O N → N ruled out  
  - L G C O N → N ruled out  
  - L B C O N → N ruled out  
  - L V C O N → N ruled out  

- L _ _ C O :  
  – C is not in position 4 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Wait – let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with L, containing both C and O, avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  
Allowed letters: L (fixed at 1), C, O, plus D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y

We need C and O somewhere in positions 2-5, with C not in 4 and O not in 5.

Possible placements:
- C in 2, O in 3 or 4  
- C in 3, O in 2 or 4  

Check each:
1. C in 2, O in 3 → L C O _ _  
   – L C O _ _ :  
     L C O D _ → need 5th letter from allowed: D, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
     L C O D K → not a word  
     L C O D Y → not a word  
     L C O M _ → L C O M _ : L C O M B → not a word  
     L C O M P → L C O M P → “lcomp” not valid  
     L C O M B → not valid  
     L C O D Y → not valid  

2. C in 2, O in 4 → L C _ O _  
   – L C _ O _ :  
     L C B O N → N ruled out  
     L C D O N → N ruled out  
     L C F O N → N ruled out  
     L C K O N → N ruled out  
     L C M O N → N ruled out  
     L C P O N → N ruled out  
     L C V O N → N ruled out  
     L C W O N → N ruled out  

3. C in 3, O in 2 → L _ C O _  
   – L _ C O _ :  
     L D C O N → N ruled out  
     L M C O N → N ruled out  
     L P C O N → N ruled out  
     L G C O N → N ruled out  
     L B C O N → N ruled out  
     L V C O N → N ruled out  

4. C in 3, O in 4 → L _ _ C O  
   – C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so skip.

5. C in 4 is invalid (from feedback), so no.

6. C in 5 → L _ _ _ C  
   – C in 5 is allowed (feedback only said C is not in 4).  
   – O must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
   – L _ _ _ C with O in 2, 3, or 4:  
     – O in 2 → L O _ _ C  
       L O D D C → not a word  
       L O B B C → not a word  
       L O G G C → not a word  
       L O M M C → not a word  
       L O P P C → not a word  
       L O W W C → not a word  
     – O in 3 → L _ O _ C  
       L D O C C → not a word  
       L M O C C → not a word  
       L B O C C → not a word  
       L G O C C → not a word  
       L V O C C → not a word  
     – O in 4 → L _ _ O C  
       L D M O C → not a word  
       L B M O C → not a word  
       L G M O C → not a word  
       L V M O C → not a word  

Seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Re-examine feedback interpretation.

Re-reading feedback:
Guess 2: LURCH → L(-) U(x) R(x) C(✓) H(x)  
The “-” on L means L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
But first feedback said L is in the correct position 1.  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as L is in the word but not in position 1 (overriding the first feedback).  
Therefore, L is NOT in position 1.  
So the word does NOT start with L.  
This resolves the contradiction.

Now facts:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- C is in the word and in the correct position 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Pattern: _ _ _ C _ with L and O somewhere in positions 2-4, and position 5 not O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- C in position 4  
- L and O in positions 1-3 or 5 (but O not 5)  
- No S, A, T, E, U, R, H, I, N  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, plus C already used in position 4.

Possible structure:  
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
- Position 2: same  
- Position 3: same  
- Position 4: C  
- Position 5: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y (but not O)

We need L and O in positions 1-3, with O not in 5.

Possible combinations:
- O in 1, L in 2 or 3 → O _ L C _  
  – O B L C _ → O B L C _ : O B L C D → “oblcd” not a word  
  – O D L C _ → not a word  
  – O M L C _ → not a word  
  – O P L C _ → not a word  

- O in 2, L in 1 or 3 → L O _ C _ or _ O L C _  
  – L O _ C _ : L O B C _ → L O B C K → “lobck” not a word  
  – _ O L C _ : B O L C _ → B O L C K → “bolck” not a word  
  – D O L C _ → D O L C K → “dolck” not a word  

- O in 3, L in 1 or 2 → L _ O C _ or _ L O C _  
  – L _ O C _ : L B O C _ → L B O C K → “lboc k” not a word  
  – _ L O C _ : B L O C _ → B L O C K → “block” is a valid word  
    – Check letters: B, L, O, C, K  
    – All allowed (B, L, O, C, K not ruled out)  
    – C is in position 4 (matches feedback)  
    – L is in position 2 (allowed, since L not in position 1)  
    – O is in position 3 (allowed, since O not in 5)  
    – No ruled-out letters used  

“BLOCK” fits all constraints.
