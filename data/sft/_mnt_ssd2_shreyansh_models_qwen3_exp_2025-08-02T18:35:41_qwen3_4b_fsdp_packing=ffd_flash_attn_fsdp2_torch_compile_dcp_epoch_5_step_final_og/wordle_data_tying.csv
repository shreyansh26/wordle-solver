For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word early on. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that:
1. Keeps T in a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the eliminated letters S, L, A, E.

A strong candidate is “TRION”:
- T is now in position 1.
- R, I, O, N are new letters we haven’t tested.
- It avoids all the eliminated letters (S, L, A, E).

Another solid option would be “TURNO” or “TROIK”, but “TRION” feels balanced and common enough to be a valid guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Fixed: T is the first letter (✓).
2. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word: I and N (from “I(✓)” and “N(-)” in TRION, and “N(-)” and “I(-)” in TUNIC).  
   – I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from TRION and TUNIC feedback).
   – N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from TRION and TUNIC feedback).

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, R, O, U, C.

So the pattern is:  
T _ _ _ _  
with I and N somewhere in positions 2,4,5 (since 3 is ruled out for both), and no other letters from the banned list.

Possible positions:
- I can be in 2 or 5 (since 3 and 4 are out).
- N can be in 2,4 (since 3 and 5 are out).

Let’s try to place them:
- If I is in position 2, then N must be in 4.
- If I is in position 5, then N must be in 2 or 4.

We need to pick a word that fits these constraints and uses only allowed letters.  
Let’s try: T I N _ _ → but we need a 5-letter word.  
Possible: T I N _ _ → TIN_ _ → but we already have T, I, N in place.  
A valid word: T I N G _ → but G is allowed, but we need 5 letters.  
Wait, let’s list valid combinations:

Option 1: I in 2, N in 4 → T I _ N _  
We need a letter for position 3. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A common word: T I M N _ → TIMNY? Not valid.  
T I G N _ → TIGER? But R is banned.  
T I D N _ → TIDAN? Not valid.  
T I B N _ → TIBER? R is banned.  
T I P N _ → TIPNY? Not valid.  
T I V N _ → TIVOL? Not valid.  
Hmm, let’s try N in 2, I in 5 → T N _ _ I  
We need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
T N _ _ I → T N D G I → TNDGI? Not valid.  
T N D Y I → TNDYI? Not valid.  
T N G H I → TNGHI? Not valid.  
T N I _ _ is invalid because I is in 3 which is banned.  
T N _ I _ is invalid because I is in 4 which is banned.  
Let’s try I in 5, N in 4 → T _ _ N I  
Then position 2 and 3 can be filled with allowed letters.  
T _ _ N I → T B A N I? A is banned.  
T B D N I → TBDNI? Not valid.  
T B G N I → TBGNI? Not valid.  
T B H N I → TBHNI? Not valid.  
T B J N I → TBJNI? Not valid.

T B W N I → TBWNI? Not valid.  
T B Y N I → TBYNI? Not valid.  
T B Z N I → TBZNI? Not valid.  
This seems hard. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let’s list possible positions for I and N:
- I can be in 2 or 5.
- N can be in 2,4.

Case 1: I in 2, N in 4 → T I _ N _  
We need a letter for position 3.  
Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A valid word: T I M N _ → TIMNY? Not valid.  
T I G N _ → TIGER? R is banned.  
T I P N _ → TIPNY? Not valid.  
T I V N _ → TIVOL? Not valid.  
T I D N _ → TIDAN? Not valid.  
T I B N _ → TIBER? R is banned.  
T I K N _ → TIKN_? Not valid.  
T I H N _ → TIHNI? Not valid.  
This seems problematic.

Case 2: I in 5, N in 2 → T N _ _ I  
We need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
T N _ _ I → T N D G I → TNDGI? Not valid.  
T N G H I → TNGHI? Not valid.  
T N B D I → TNBDI? Not valid.  
T N P H I → TNPHI? Not valid.  
T N V Y I → TNVYI? Not valid.  
This also seems problematic.

Case 3: I in 5, N in 4 → T _ _ N I  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3.  
T _ _ N I → T B A N I? A is banned.  
T B D N I → TBDNI? Not valid.

T B W N I → TBWNI? Not valid.  
T B Y N I → TBYNI? Not valid.  
T B Z N I → TBZNI? Not valid.  
This is also problematic.

Let’s try I in 2, N in 5 → T I _ _ N  
But N is banned from position 5 (from TRION feedback: N(-) means N is not in 5). So this is invalid.

Let’s try I in 5, N in 2 → T N _ _ I  
We need letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A valid word: T N D Y I → TNDYI? Not valid.  
T N G H I → TNGHI? Not valid.  
T N B D I → TNBDI? Not valid.  
T N P H I → TNPHI? Not valid.  
T N V Y I → TNVYI? Not valid.  
This seems impossible. Maybe I need to try a different combination.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word early on. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that:
1. Keeps T in a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the eliminated letters S, L, A, E.

A strong candidate is “TRION”:
- T is now in position 1.
- R, I, O, N are new letters we haven’t tested.
- It avoids all the eliminated letters (S, L, A, E).

Another solid option would be “TURNO” or “TROIK”, but “TRION” feels balanced and common enough to be a valid guess.

<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on TRION:
- T is now in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R and O are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with T.
2. Contains I and N, but I is not in 3rd position and N is not in 5th position.
3. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, R, O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T.
- Has I and N somewhere, but I not in 3rd, N not in 5th.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so far: S,L,A,E,R,O are out).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place I and N in new spots while keeping T fixed at position 1.

Option: T _ _ _ _ with I and N in positions 2,3,4,5 (but I≠3, N≠5).

A good candidate is “TUNIC”:
- T in 1st position (✓).
- U, N, I, C are new letters.
- N is in 3rd position (allowed since N≠5).
- I is in 4th position (allowed since I≠3).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Another candidate could be “TINNY” but Y is less common and we already have N in 3rd. “TUNIC” seems better.

Let’s go with TUNIC.

From the feedback so far:

1. T is locked in position 1 (✓).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from TRION and TUNIC).
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from TRION and TUNIC).
4. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, R, O, U, C.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T.
- Contains both I and N.
- I must be in position 3 or 5.
- N must be in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- T N I _ _ (N in 2, I in 3)
- T I _ N _ (I in 2, N in 4) – but I can't be in 2 (from TUNIC), so this is invalid.
- T _ N I _ (N in 3, I in 4) – but I can't be in 4 (from TRION), so this is invalid.
- T _ I N _ (I in 3, N in 4) – this fits all constraints.

So the only viable pattern is T _ I N _.

We need a letter for position 2 and 5, using remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words:
- T W I N _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending in a valid letter.
- T H I N _ – ""THING"" is 5 letters, but G is allowed.
- T B I N _ – ""TBING"" is not valid.
- T F I N _ – ""TFING"" is not valid.
- T H I N G – ""THING"" is valid and uses G (not eliminated).

Let's check:
- T (✓)
- H (new)
- I (must be in 3, it is)
- N (must be in 4, it is)
- G (new, not eliminated)

""THING"" fits all constraints.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter T, but not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that:
1. Keeps T in a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the eliminated letters S, L, A, E.

A strong candidate is “TRION”:
- T is now in position 1.
- R, I, O, N are new letters we haven’t tested.
- It avoids all the eliminated letters (S, L, A, E).

Another solid option would be “TURNO” or “TROIK”, but “TRION” feels balanced and common enough to be a valid guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRION -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(x) I(✓) O(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TRION:
- T is now in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R and O are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with T.
2. Contains I and N, but I is not in 3rd position and N is not in 5th position.
3. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, R, O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T.
- Has I and N somewhere, but I not in 3rd, N not in 5th.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so far: S,L,A,E,R,O are out).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place I and N in new spots while keeping T fixed at position 1.

Option: T _ _ _ _ with I and N in positions 2,3,4,5 (but I≠3, N≠5).

A good candidate is “TUNIC”:
- T in 1st position (✓).
- U, N, I, C are new letters.
- N is in 3rd position (allowed since N≠5).
- I is in 4th position (allowed since I≠3).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

Another candidate could be “TINNY” but Y is less common and we already have N in 3rd. “TUNIC” seems better.

Let’s go with TUNIC.

From the feedback so far:

1. T is locked in position 1 (✓).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from TRION and TUNIC).
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from TRION and TUNIC).
4. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, E, R, O, U, C.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T.
- Contains both I and N.
- I must be in position 3 or 5.
- N must be in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- T N I _ _ (N in 2, I in 3)
- T I _ N _ (I in 2, N in 4) – but I can't be in 2 (from TUNIC), so this is invalid.
- T _ N I _ (N in 3, I in 4) – but I can't be in 4 (from TRION), so this is invalid.
- T _ I N _ (I in 3, N in 4) – this fits all constraints.

So the only viable pattern is T _ I N _.

We need a letter for position 2 and 5, using remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words:
- T W I N _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending in a valid letter.
- T H I N _ – ""THING"" is 5 letters, but G is allowed.
- T B I N _ – ""TBING"" is not valid.
- T F I N _ – ""TFING"" is not valid.
- T H I N G – ""THING"" is valid and uses G (not eliminated).

Let's check:
- T (✓)
- H (new)
- I (must be in 3, it is)
- N (must be in 4, it is)
- G (new, not eliminated)

""THING"" fits all constraints.
