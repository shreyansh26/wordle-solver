### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, so the feedback should be very informative

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions (to test if they can move).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (especially since O, S, E are ruled out).
3. Avoids the letters we know are out (O, S, E).

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N are all new letters except for R and A (which we know are present).
- R will be in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the first guess), so this tests R in a new spot.
- A will be in position 3 (testing a new spot).
- Introduces T, I, N which are common letters.

But wait, let me think of a better word that shifts A and R to new positions while introducing more new letters. ""RAINY"" would put R in position 1 (but A is not in position 1), but Y is less common. ""FRANK"" would put R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful. 

A better choice is ""RATIO"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R).
- A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests T, I, O. But O is ruled out, so this is bad.

""RAISE"" is invalid because S and E are ruled out. ""RADIO"" is invalid because O is ruled out. ""CRANE"" is invalid because E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

""TRAIN"" seems better:
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) – not helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

Wait, let me try ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal: shifts both known letters to new positions and introduces new common letters (I, N, Y).

But ""RAINY"" has Y which is less common. A better word is ""RATIO"" but O is ruled out. 

Another option: ""RANCH"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- N, C, H are new letters.

This seems good: tests R and A in new positions and introduces N, C, H.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, so the feedback should be very informative

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions (to test if they can move).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (especially since O, S, E are ruled out).
3. Avoids the letters we know are out (O, S, E).

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N are all new letters except for R and A (which we know are present).
- R will be in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the first guess), so this tests R in a new spot.
- A will be in position 3 (testing a new spot).
- Introduces T, I, N which are common letters.

But wait, let me think of a better word that shifts A and R to new positions while introducing more new letters. ""RAINY"" would put R in position 1 (but A is not in position 1), but Y is less common. ""FRANK"" would put R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful. 

A better choice is ""RATIO"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R).
- A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests T, I, O. But O is ruled out, so this is bad.

""RAISE"" is invalid because S and E are ruled out. ""RADIO"" is invalid because O is ruled out. ""CRANE"" is invalid because E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

""TRAIN"" seems better:
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) – not helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

Wait, let me try ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal: shifts both known letters to new positions and introduces new common letters (I, N, Y).

But ""RAINY"" has Y which is less common. A better word is ""RATIO"" but O is ruled out. 

Another option: ""RANCH"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- N, C, H are new letters.

This seems good: tests R and A in new positions and introduces N, C, H.

But ""RANCH"" is a valid word and covers good new letters. Let me go with this.

   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - N, C, H are not in the word.

Summary so far:
- A is in position 2.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, N, C, H.
- Letters still allowed: A (fixed at pos 2), R (somewhere else), plus any other letters not yet tested.

We need a word with:
- A in position 2.
- R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- No O, S, E, N, C, H.

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

Possible skeletons:
- _ A _ _ _ (with R in 3, 4, or 5)
- _ A _ R _
- _ A _ _ R

Letters left to try (common ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses new common letters in the remaining positions.

A good candidate is ""BARDY"":
- B, A, R, D, Y.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- R in position 3 (new position for R).
- B and D are new letters, Y is a bit less common but acceptable.

Another candidate is ""FARMS"" but S is ruled out.
""PARIS"" has S ruled out.
""BARDS"" has S ruled out.
""GRAFT"" has C ruled out.

""BARDY"" seems the best so far.

Let me verify:
- B: new letter
- A: correct position
- R: new position (3)
- D: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests 3 new letters (B, D, Y) while confirming R's position and A's position.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ranch → R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - N, C, H are not in the word.

Summary so far:
- A is in position 2.
- R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, N, C, H.
- Letters still allowed: A (fixed at pos 2), R (somewhere else), plus any other letters not yet tested.

We need a word with:
- A in position 2.
- R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- No O, S, E, N, C, H.

Let’s list possible words fitting this pattern:

Possible skeletons:
- _ A _ _ _ (with R in 3, 4, or 5)
- _ A _ R _
- _ A _ _ R

Letters left to try (common ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses new common letters in the remaining positions.

A good candidate is ""BARDY"":
- B, A, R, D, Y.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- R in position 3 (new position for R).
- B and D are new letters, Y is a bit less common but acceptable.

Another candidate is ""FARMS"" but S is ruled out.
""PARIS"" has S ruled out.
""BARDS"" has S ruled out.
""GRAFT"" has C ruled out.

""BARDY"" seems the best so far.

Let me verify:
- B: new letter
- A: correct position
- R: new position (3)
- D: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests 3 new letters (B, D, Y) while confirming R's position and A's position.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

   - R is in position 3 and is correct.

Summary:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, N, C, H, B, D, Y
- Letters still allowed: A (fixed at pos 2), R (fixed at pos 3), plus any other letters not yet tested (common remaining: F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- R in position 3
- No O, S, E, N, C, H, B, D, Y

Possible words fitting _ A R _ _:
- F A R _ _
- G A R _ _
- I A R _ _
- K A R _ _
- L A R _ _
- M A R _ _
- P A R _ _
- T A R _ _
- V A R _ _
- W A R _ _

Looking at common English words:
- F A R M S – S is ruled out.
- G A R R I – not a valid word.
- I A R M S – S is ruled out.
- K A R M A – A is already used in position 2, but KARMA is valid.
- L A R G E – E is ruled out.
- M A R V Y – Y is ruled out.
- P A R K S – S is ruled out.
- T A R D I – D is ruled out.
- V A R I E – E is ruled out.
- W A R N S – N and S are ruled out.

The only valid word that fits is K A R M A:
- K: new letter
- A: correct position
- R: correct position
- M: new letter
- A: second A is allowed since we only know one A is in position 2, but KARMA has two A's – we need to check if double A is possible. However, we have no information against it.

But let's think of another word: F A R M S is invalid due to S. L A R G E is invalid due to E. T A R D I is invalid due to D. 

Actually, K A R M A is valid and fits the pattern. Let's use it.

But wait, let me think again. We have:
- _ A R _ _
- Letters allowed: F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not ruled out).

Another valid word: F A R M S is invalid. G A R R I is invalid. I A R M S is invalid. K A R M A is valid. L A R G E is invalid. M A R V Y is invalid. P A R K S is invalid. T A R D I is invalid. 

K A R M A seems to be the only valid word left. Let's use it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, so the feedback should be very informative

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions (to test if they can move).
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (especially since O, S, E are ruled out).
3. Avoids the letters we know are out (O, S, E).

A good candidate is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N are all new letters except for R and A (which we know are present).
- R will be in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the first guess), so this tests R in a new spot.
- A will be in position 3 (testing a new spot).
- Introduces T, I, N which are common letters.

But wait, let me think of a better word that shifts A and R to new positions while introducing more new letters. ""RAINY"" would put R in position 1 (but A is not in position 1), but Y is less common. ""FRANK"" would put R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful. 

A better choice is ""RATIO"":
- R in position 1 (new position for R).
- A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests T, I, O. But O is ruled out, so this is bad.

""RAISE"" is invalid because S and E are ruled out. ""RADIO"" is invalid because O is ruled out. ""CRANE"" is invalid because E is ruled out.

""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) which isn't helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

""TRAIN"" seems better:
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R in position 2 (same as before) – not helpful.
- A in position 3 (new position).

Wait, let me try ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal: shifts both known letters to new positions and introduces new common letters (I, N, Y).

But ""RAINY"" has Y which is less common. A better word is ""RATIO"" but O is ruled out. 

Another option: ""RANCH"":
- R in position 1 (new position).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- N, C, H are new letters.

This seems good: tests R and A in new positions and introduces N, C, H.

But ""RANCH"" is a valid word and covers good new letters. Let me go with this.

Letters left to try (common ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses new common letters in the remaining positions.

A good candidate is ""BARDY"":
- B, A, R, D, Y.
- A in position 2 (✓).
- R in position 3 (new position for R).
- B and D are new letters, Y is a bit less common but acceptable.

Another candidate is ""FARMS"" but S is ruled out.
""PARIS"" has S ruled out.
""BARDS"" has S ruled out.
""GRAFT"" has C ruled out.

""BARDY"" seems the best so far.

Let me verify:
- B: new letter
- A: correct position
- R: new position (3)
- D: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests 3 new letters (B, D, Y) while confirming R's position and A's position.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ranch → R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - N, C, H are not in the word.

3. bardy → B(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - R is in position 3 and is correct.
   - B, D, Y are not in the word.

Summary:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, N, C, H, B, D, Y
- Letters still allowed: A (fixed at pos 2), R (fixed at pos 3), plus any other letters not yet tested (common remaining: F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- R in position 3
- No O, S, E, N, C, H, B, D, Y

Possible words fitting _ A R _ _:
- F A R _ _
- G A R _ _
- I A R _ _
- K A R _ _
- L A R _ _
- M A R _ _
- P A R _ _
- T A R _ _
- V A R _ _
- W A R _ _

Looking at common English words:
- F A R M S – S is ruled out.
- G A R R I – not a valid word.
- I A R M S – S is ruled out.
- K A R M A – A is already used in position 2, but KARMA is valid.
- L A R G E – E is ruled out.
- M A R V Y – Y is ruled out.
- P A R K S – S is ruled out.
- T A R D I – D is ruled out.
- V A R I E – E is ruled out.
- W A R N S – N and S are ruled out.

The only valid word that fits is K A R M A:
- K: new letter
- A: correct position
- R: correct position
- M: new letter
- A: second A is allowed since we only know one A is in position 2, but KARMA has two A's – we need to check if double A is possible. However, we have no information against it.

But let's think of another word: F A R M S is invalid due to S. L A R G E is invalid due to E. T A R D I is invalid due to D. 

Actually, K A R M A is valid and fits the pattern. Let's use it.

But wait, let me think again. We have:
- _ A R _ _
- Letters allowed: F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not ruled out).

Another valid word: F A R M S is invalid. G A R R I is invalid. I A R M S is invalid. K A R M A is valid. L A R G E is invalid. M A R V Y is invalid. P A R K S is invalid. T A R D I is invalid. 

K A R M A seems to be the only valid word left. Let's use it.

From the latest feedback on KARMA:
- K(x) → K is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- R(✓) → R is in position 3 (confirmed again).
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 5 (confirmed).

So the word pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown (but not any of the ruled-out letters)
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: unknown (but not any of the ruled-out letters)
- Position 5: A

Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, N, C, H, B, D, Y, K, M.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4: F, G, I, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with the pattern _ A R _ A.

Possible words:
- F A R I A (FARIA is a valid word, meaning a type of car or a surname)
- G A R R A (GARRA is a type of fish, but is it 5 letters? GARRA is 4 letters)
- L A R G A (not a valid word)
- P A R G A (not a valid word)
- T A R P A (not a valid word)
- V A R I A (VARI A is not a standard word)
- W A R N A (N is ruled out)
- F A R I A seems to be the only valid option.

Let's verify:
- F A R I A: positions 1=F, 2=A, 3=R, 4=I, 5=A.
- F is not ruled out.
- I is not ruled out.
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be FARIA.
