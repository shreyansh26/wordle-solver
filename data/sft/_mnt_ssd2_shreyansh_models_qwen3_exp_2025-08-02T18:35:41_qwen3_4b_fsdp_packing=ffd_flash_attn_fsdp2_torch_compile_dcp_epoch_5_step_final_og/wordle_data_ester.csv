### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Common starting strategies include using words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage.

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: S, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, T, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively)
2. Does NOT contain L or A
3. Uses other letters that haven't been tested yet

Possible positions for S, T, E:
- S can be in positions 2,3,4,5
- T can be in positions 1,2,3,5
- E can be in positions 1,2,3,4

Let's try to place them:
- S cannot be in position 1 (already tried), so let's try S in position 2 or 3
- T cannot be in position 4 (already tried), so let's try T in position 1, 2, 3, or 5
- E cannot be in position 5 (already tried), so let's try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let's try a word that moves S to position 2, T to position 3, and E to position 1:
- E _ S T _

Now we need two more letters that are not L or A. Common unused letters: R, N, I, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""ESTER"":
- E in position 1 (new position)
- S in position 2 (new position)
- T in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (new position)
- R in position 5 (unused letter)

Check constraints:
- Contains S, T, E (all in new positions)
- Does not contain L or A
- Uses R (new letter)

""ESTER"" seems valid.
