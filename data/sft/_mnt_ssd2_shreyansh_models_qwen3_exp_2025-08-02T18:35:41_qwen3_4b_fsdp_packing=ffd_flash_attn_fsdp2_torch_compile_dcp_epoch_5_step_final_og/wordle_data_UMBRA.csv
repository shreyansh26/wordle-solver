For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help reveal many letters at once. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a strong opening word that covers common letters and their positions.

- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A and R but moves them away from positions 1 and 2.  
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, I, N, L, C, H, etc.).  
3. Avoids O, S, E entirely.  

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T and I and N are new letters.  
- R is now in position 2 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2 in the original word, but here it’s moving to position 2, so that’s fine).  
- A is now in position 4 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  

This should help narrow down positions for A and R while testing new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help reveal many letters at once. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a strong opening word that covers common letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.  

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A and R but moves them away from positions 1 and 2.  
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, I, N, L, C, H, etc.).  
3. Avoids O, S, E entirely.  

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T and I and N are new letters.  
- R is now in position 2 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2 in the original word, but here it’s moving to position 2, so that’s fine).  
- A is now in position 4 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  

This should help narrow down positions for A and R while testing new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 3.
   - R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 2 (redundant, same spot).  
     So R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   O, S, E, T, I, N.

3. Remaining unused common letters: C, L, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
- Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.

A good candidate is “CARGO” but G and O are allowed? Wait, O is eliminated. So scratch that.

Another candidate: “CARDS” – S is eliminated.

“DARMS” – S eliminated.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, but not sure.

“LARGE” – E eliminated.

“MARRY” – Y is allowed, but R is repeated and we don’t know if double letters are possible.

“PARCH” – H and C allowed, but P is allowed, A is allowed, R is allowed.

Actually, let’s try “CARGO” again – O is eliminated, so no.

“CARDS” – S eliminated.

“DARMS” – S eliminated.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, but G is allowed.

But we need to avoid O, S, E, T, I, N.

A better word is “CARGO” but O is out.

“DARMS” – S is out.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, G is allowed.

“LARGE” – E is out.

“MARRY” – Y is allowed, but R is repeated.

“PARCH” – P, A, R, C, H are all allowed.

Let’s go with “PARCH”:
- P, A, R, C, H – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- Tests new letters P, C, H.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help reveal many letters at once. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a strong opening word that covers common letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.  

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps A and R but moves them away from positions 1 and 2.  
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, I, N, L, C, H, etc.).  
3. Avoids O, S, E entirely.  

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T and I and N are new letters.  
- R is now in position 2 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2 in the original word, but here it’s moving to position 2, so that’s fine).  
- A is now in position 4 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  

This should help narrow down positions for A and R while testing new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 3.
   - R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 2 (redundant, same spot).  
     So R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   O, S, E, T, I, N.

3. Remaining unused common letters: C, L, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
- Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.

A good candidate is “CARGO” but G and O are allowed? Wait, O is eliminated. So scratch that.

Another candidate: “CARDS” – S is eliminated.

“DARMS” – S eliminated.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, but not sure.

“LARGE” – E eliminated.

“MARRY” – Y is allowed, but R is repeated and we don’t know if double letters are possible.

“PARCH” – H and C allowed, but P is allowed, A is allowed, R is allowed.

Actually, let’s try “CARGO” again – O is eliminated, so no.

“CARDS” – S eliminated.

“DARMS” – S eliminated.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, but G is allowed.

But we need to avoid O, S, E, T, I, N.

A better word is “CARGO” but O is out.

“DARMS” – S is out.

“GARBL” – B and L are allowed, G is allowed.

“LARGE” – E is out.

“MARRY” – Y is allowed, but R is repeated.

“PARCH” – P, A, R, C, H are all allowed.

Let’s go with “PARCH”:
- P, A, R, C, H – none are eliminated.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- Tests new letters P, C, H.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are in the word but not in their current positions:
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 2 → A must be in position 4 or 5.
- R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3 → R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
O, S, E, T, I, N, P, C, H.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.
- Places A in position 4 or 5.
- Places R in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not conflicting with A’s placement).
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Candidate words:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R, _ _ _ R A
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A, _ _ _ _ A

Possible words:
- BARDS – D and S are out, S is out.
- GARBS – B is allowed, but S is out.
- DRAFT – T is out.
- GRADE – E is out.
- GRAIL – I is out.
- GRAVY – V and Y are allowed, but A is in position 4, R in position 3 (but R must be in 1,4,5).
- GRAVY: R is in position 3 – invalid (R must be in 1,4,5).
- GRAVY invalid because R is in position 3.

- BRAVO – O is out.
- BRAVY – V and Y allowed, but A is in position 4, R in position 1 – valid.
  BRAVY: B, R, A, V, Y – all allowed letters.
  R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 4 (allowed).

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternative: MARVY – M, A, R, V, Y – same letters, A in 4, R in 3 – invalid (R in 3).

From the latest feedback:

- A is now known to be in the correct position (position 5).
- R, U, M, B are all in the word but are NOT in the positions they were just tried (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).
- Therefore, the word is of the form: _ _ _ _ A
- R must move to positions 2, 3, or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded)
- U must move to positions 1, 3, or 4
- M must move to positions 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is A), so 1 or 2
- B must move to positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (5 is A), so 1, 2, or 3
- Letters already eliminated: O, S, E, T, I, N, P, C, H, V, Y
- Remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out: D, F, G, K, L, W

We need to place R, U, M, B into positions 1-4 without conflicts, and fill the remaining spot with an allowed letter.

Let’s list possible positions for each:
- Position 1: could be M, U, or a new letter (D, F, G, K, L, W)
- Position 2: could be R, M, B, or a new letter
- Position 3: could be R, U, B, or a new letter
- Position 4: could be R, U, or a new letter

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1: M in position 1
- M _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4
- Need to place R, U, B into positions 2, 3, 4 without conflicts.

Possible arrangement:
- M U R B A → but is ""MURBA"" a valid word? No.
- M B R U A → ""MBRUA"" – invalid.
- M R U B A → ""MRUBA"" – invalid.

Option 2: U in position 1
- U _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3 (since 4 would conflict with R or U)
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- U M R B A → ""UMRBA"" – invalid.
- U B R M A → ""UBRMA"" – invalid.
- U R M B A → ""URMBA"" – invalid.

Option 3: Use a new letter in position 1
- D, F, G, K, L, W
Let’s try D in position 1:
- D _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- D M R U A → ""DMRUA"" – invalid.
- D B R U M – but M must be in 1,2,3,4 and already A is in 5, so this is invalid.
- D R U M B – but B must be in 1,2,3,4, and M must be in 1,2,3,4, but A is in 5. So ""DRUMB"" – but is ""DRUMB"" a word? No.

Option 4: Try L in position 1
- L _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- L M R U A → ""LMRUA"" – invalid.
- L R U M B – but A is in 5, so ""LRUMB"" – invalid.
- L B R U M – invalid.

Option 5: Try K in position 1
- K _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- K M R U A → ""KMRUA"" – invalid.
- K R U M B – invalid.

Option 6: Try F in position 1
- F _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- F M R U A → ""FM RUA"" – invalid.
- F R U M B – invalid.

Option 7: Try G in position 1
- G _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- G M R U A → ""GMRUA"" – invalid.
- G R U M B – invalid.

Option 8: Try W in position 1
- W _ _ _ A
- R must go to 2, 3, or 4
- U must go to 2, 3, or 4
- M must go to 2 or 3
- B must go to 2, 3, or 4

Possible arrangement:
- W M R U A → ""WMRUA"" – invalid.
- W R U M B – invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try a different approach: look for real 5-letter words ending in A that contain R, U, M, B, and have the letters in allowed positions.

Valid words ending in A that contain R, U, M, B:
- ""BURMA"" – but R is in position 2 (allowed), U in position 1 (allowed), M in position 3 (allowed), B in position 2 – but R and B would both be in position 2, which is impossible.
- ""MURBA"" – not a word.
- ""RUBMA"" – not a word.
- ""BRU MA"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s list possible valid words systematically:
- Must end in A.
- Must contain R, U, M, B.
- Must have R not in 1, U not in 2, M not in 4, B not in 4.

Possible permutations of R, U, M, B in positions 1-4:
- 1 2 3 4
- 1 2 4 3
- 1 3 2 4
- 1 3 4 2
- 1 4 2 3
- 1 4 3 2
- 2 1 3 4
- 2 1 4 3
- 2 3 1 4
- 2 3 4 1
- 2 4 1 3
- 2 4 3 1
- 3 1 2 4
- 3 1 4 2
- 3 2 1 4
- 3 2 4 1
- 3 4 1 2
- 3 4 2 1
- 4 1 2 3
- 4 1 3 2
- 4 2 1 3
- 4 2 3 1
- 4 3 1 2
- 4 3 2 1

Now apply constraints:
- R cannot be in 1 or 5 (but 5 is A), so R can be in 2,3,4
- U cannot be in 2,3,4 (from previous feedback), so U must be in 1
- M cannot be in 4, so M can be in 1,2,3
- B cannot be in 4, so B can be in 1,2,3

From this, U must be in position 1:
- Position 1: U
- Remaining letters to place: R, M, B in positions 2,3,4
- R must be in 2,3,4
- M must be in 2,3
- B must be in 2,3

Possible arrangements:
- U R M B A → ""URMBA"" – invalid
- U R B M A → ""URBMA"" – invalid
- U M R B A → ""UMRBA"" – invalid
- U M B R A → ""UMBRA"" – this is a valid word!

Check constraints:
- U in position 1 – allowed (U was in position 2 in RUMBA, so new position)
- M in position 2 – allowed (M was in position 3 in RUMBA, so new position)
- B in position 3 – allowed (B was in position 4 in RUMBA, so new position)
- R in position 4 – allowed (R was in position 1 in RUMBA, so new position)
- A in position 5 – correct
- All letters are allowed (no eliminated letters used)

""UMBRA"" fits all constraints.
