For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should provide good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N
- Letters that must appear: R, E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)

Good positions to try for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Good positions to try for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Doesn't contain C, A, N
3. Places R and E in new positions

Possible candidates:
- DRIVE: has D, R, I, V, E - but I and V are less common
- ERGOT: has E, R, G, O, T - but G, O, T are less common
- REBID: has R, E, B, I, D - but B, I, D are less common
- TREND: has T, R, E, N, D - but N is already excluded
- FERRE: has F, E, R, R, E - but double letters might not be optimal
- TOWER: has T, O, W, E, R - but O, W are less common

Looking at these, ""TOWER"" seems reasonable because it:
- Keeps R in a new position (5)
- Keeps E in a new position (4)
- Introduces T, O, W which are common enough
- Avoids C, A, N

However, ""TOWER"" has O and W which might be less informative. A better choice might be ""ERGOT"" or ""REBID"", but those have less common letters. 

Another option is ""DRIER"":
- D, R, I, E, R - but has double R and I is less common
- Doesn't avoid any letters

After reconsidering, ""TOWER"" seems the best among these options, even though it introduces O and W, because it moves R and E to new positions and introduces other common letters.

But wait, ""TOWER"" has O and W which are less common. Let me think of another word.

""ERGOT"" is better because:
- E in position 1 (new)
- R in position 2 (new)

This seems optimal.

- G is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

Summary of constraints:
Letters known to be in the word: R, E, O, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, N, G  
Positions ruled out:
- R ≠ 2
- E ≠ 5, E ≠ 1
- O ≠ 4
- T ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R, E, O, T (and one additional letter)
- avoids C, A, N, G
- respects the positional bans

Let's list possible positions:
R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 2, 3, 4  
O: 1, 2, 3, 5  
T: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place these four letters plus one more letter (must be from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let's try to build a valid word:
- Since E cannot be in 1 or 5, it must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- R cannot be in 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try placing E in position 2:
E _ _ _ _

Then O can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
T can be in 1, 3, 4.

Let's try O in position 1:
O E _ _ _

Now R and T must fit in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but T cannot be in 5, so R and T must be in 3 and 4 in some order, and the last position must be a new letter).

Possible:
O E R T X  (X is a new letter, but we need to check if this is a valid word)
O E T R X

But ""OERTX"" is not a valid word. Let's think of actual words.

Another approach: look for real words that contain R, E, O, T and fit the constraints.

Possible words:
- ""TROPE"": contains T, R, O, P, E. Let's check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2) → invalid
- ""TOWER"": contains T, O, W, E, R. Check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W is new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters (C, A, N, G)
  - All constraints satisfied!

This seems valid. Let's verify:
- Letters: T, O, W, E, R → contains R, E, O, T (good)
- Avoids C, A, N, G (good)
- Positions:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)

""TOWER"" fits all constraints.

Another approach: look for real words that contain R, E, O, T and fit the constraints.

Possible words:
- ""TROPE"": contains T, R, O, P, E. Let's check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2) → invalid
- ""TOWER"": contains T, O, W, E, R. Check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W is new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters (C, A, N, G)
  - All constraints satisfied!

This seems valid. Let's verify:
- Letters: T, O, W, E, R → contains R, E, O, T (good)
- Avoids C, A, N, G (good)
- Positions:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should provide good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N
- Letters that must appear: R, E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)

Good positions to try for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Good positions to try for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Doesn't contain C, A, N
3. Places R and E in new positions

Possible candidates:
- DRIVE: has D, R, I, V, E - but I and V are less common
- ERGOT: has E, R, G, O, T - but G, O, T are less common
- REBID: has R, E, B, I, D - but B, I, D are less common
- TREND: has T, R, E, N, D - but N is already excluded
- FERRE: has F, E, R, R, E - but double letters might not be optimal
- TOWER: has T, O, W, E, R - but O, W are less common

Looking at these, ""TOWER"" seems reasonable because it:
- Keeps R in a new position (5)
- Keeps E in a new position (4)
- Introduces T, O, W which are common enough
- Avoids C, A, N

However, ""TOWER"" has O and W which might be less informative. A better choice might be ""ERGOT"" or ""REBID"", but those have less common letters. 

Another option is ""DRIER"":
- D, R, I, E, R - but has double R and I is less common
- Doesn't avoid any letters

After reconsidering, ""TOWER"" seems the best among these options, even though it introduces O and W, because it moves R and E to new positions and introduces other common letters.

But wait, ""TOWER"" has O and W which are less common. Let me think of another word.

""ERGOT"" is better because:
- E in position 1 (new)
- R in position 2 (new)
- G, O, T are all common letters
- Avoids C, A, N

This seems optimal.

So my next guess is ""ERGOT"".

Guess 2: ERGOT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(-) G(x) O(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

From CRANE:
- C, A, N are NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

From ERGOT:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  (same info, just reconfirmed)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

Summary of constraints:
Letters known to be in the word: R, E, O, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, N, G  
Positions ruled out:
- R ≠ 2
- E ≠ 5, E ≠ 1
- O ≠ 4
- T ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R, E, O, T (and one additional letter)
- avoids C, A, N, G
- respects the positional bans

Let's list possible positions:
R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 2, 3, 4  
O: 1, 2, 3, 5  
T: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place these four letters plus one more letter (must be from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let's try to build a valid word:
- Since E cannot be in 1 or 5, it must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- R cannot be in 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try placing E in position 2:
E _ _ _ _

Then O can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
T can be in 1, 3, 4.

Let's try O in position 1:
O E _ _ _

Now R and T must fit in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but T cannot be in 5, so R and T must be in 3 and 4 in some order, and the last position must be a new letter).

Possible:
O E R T X  (X is a new letter, but we need to check if this is a valid word)
O E T R X

But ""OERTX"" is not a valid word. Let's think of actual words.

Another approach: look for real words that contain R, E, O, T and fit the constraints.

Possible words:
- ""TROPE"": contains T, R, O, P, E. Let's check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2) → invalid
- ""TOWER"": contains T, O, W, E, R. Check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W is new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters (C, A, N, G)
  - All constraints satisfied!

This seems valid. Let's verify:
- Letters: T, O, W, E, R → contains R, E, O, T (good)
- Avoids C, A, N, G (good)
- Positions:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)

""TOWER"" fits all constraints.

Letters that must NOT be in positions:

We still need one more letter (since we have 4 known letters).  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to place T and O in positions 1-3 (since positions 4 and 5 are taken by E and R), respecting the bans:
- T cannot be in position 1 → T must be in 2 or 3
- O cannot be in position 2 → O must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is E) → O must be in 1 or 3

Let’s list possible arrangements:

1. O _ T _ _  (O in 1, T in 3) → positions: O, ?, T, E, R
2. _ O T _ _  (O in 2 is banned, so invalid)
3. _ T O _ _  (T in 2, O in 3) → positions: ?, T, O, E, R

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Option 1: O _ T E R
Possible word: OATER – but A is excluded.
OTTER – contains T twice (allowed), but we already have T once.
OTTER is a valid word: O T T E R
Check constraints:
- T in 2 (allowed, since T only banned from 1)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 5 (matches)
- E in 4 (matches)
- No banned letters (C, A, N, G, W) – good.

Option 2: _ T O E R

""TOBER"" – B is allowed, but ""TOBER"" is not a valid English word.
""TOFER"" – not valid.
""TOYER"" – Y is allowed, but ""TOYER"" is not a standard word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 5 different common letters, which should provide good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N
- Letters that must appear: R, E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)

Good positions to try for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Good positions to try for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

I want a word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Doesn't contain C, A, N
3. Places R and E in new positions

Possible candidates:
- DRIVE: has D, R, I, V, E - but I and V are less common
- ERGOT: has E, R, G, O, T - but G, O, T are less common
- REBID: has R, E, B, I, D - but B, I, D are less common
- TREND: has T, R, E, N, D - but N is already excluded
- FERRE: has F, E, R, R, E - but double letters might not be optimal
- TOWER: has T, O, W, E, R - but O, W are less common

Looking at these, ""TOWER"" seems reasonable because it:
- Keeps R in a new position (5)
- Keeps E in a new position (4)
- Introduces T, O, W which are common enough
- Avoids C, A, N

However, ""TOWER"" has O and W which might be less informative. A better choice might be ""ERGOT"" or ""REBID"", but those have less common letters. 

Another option is ""DRIER"":
- D, R, I, E, R - but has double R and I is less common
- Doesn't avoid any letters

After reconsidering, ""TOWER"" seems the best among these options, even though it introduces O and W, because it moves R and E to new positions and introduces other common letters.

But wait, ""TOWER"" has O and W which are less common. Let me think of another word.

""ERGOT"" is better because:
- E in position 1 (new)
- R in position 2 (new)
- G, O, T are all common letters
- Avoids C, A, N

This seems optimal.

So my next guess is ""ERGOT"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ERGOT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(-) G(x) O(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

From CRANE:
- C, A, N are NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

From ERGOT:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  (same info, just reconfirmed)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

Summary of constraints:
Letters known to be in the word: R, E, O, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, A, N, G  
Positions ruled out:
- R ≠ 2
- E ≠ 5, E ≠ 1
- O ≠ 4
- T ≠ 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains R, E, O, T (and one additional letter)
- avoids C, A, N, G
- respects the positional bans

Let's list possible positions:
R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
E: 2, 3, 4  
O: 1, 2, 3, 5  
T: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need to place these four letters plus one more letter (must be from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let's try to build a valid word:
- Since E cannot be in 1 or 5, it must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- R cannot be in 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- T cannot be in 5, so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try placing E in position 2:
E _ _ _ _

Then O can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
T can be in 1, 3, 4.

Let's try O in position 1:
O E _ _ _

Now R and T must fit in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but T cannot be in 5, so R and T must be in 3 and 4 in some order, and the last position must be a new letter).

Possible:
O E R T X  (X is a new letter, but we need to check if this is a valid word)
O E T R X

But ""OERTX"" is not a valid word. Let's think of actual words.

Another approach: look for real words that contain R, E, O, T and fit the constraints.

Possible words:
- ""TROPE"": contains T, R, O, P, E. Let's check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2) → invalid
- ""TOWER"": contains T, O, W, E, R. Check:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W is new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)
  - No forbidden letters (C, A, N, G)
  - All constraints satisfied!

This seems valid. Let's verify:
- Letters: T, O, W, E, R → contains R, E, O, T (good)
- Avoids C, A, N, G (good)
- Positions:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed)
  - W new (allowed)
  - E in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)

""TOWER"" fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ERGOT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(-) G(x) O(-) T(-)
Guess 3: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TOWER:
- T(-): T is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- O(-): O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- W(x): W is NOT in the word  
- E(✓): E is in the word AND in position 4  
- R(✓): R is in the word AND in position 5  

So now we know:
Letters that must be in the word: R, E, O, T  
Letters that must be in positions:
- E = position 4
- R = position 5
Letters that must NOT be in positions:
- T ≠ 1
- O ≠ 2
- W is excluded
- Also exclude C, A, N, G from earlier

We still need one more letter (since we have 4 known letters).  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to place T and O in positions 1-3 (since positions 4 and 5 are taken by E and R), respecting the bans:
- T cannot be in position 1 → T must be in 2 or 3
- O cannot be in position 2 → O must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is E) → O must be in 1 or 3

Let’s list possible arrangements:

1. O _ T _ _  (O in 1, T in 3) → positions: O, ?, T, E, R
2. _ O T _ _  (O in 2 is banned, so invalid)
3. _ T O _ _  (T in 2, O in 3) → positions: ?, T, O, E, R

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Option 1: O _ T E R
Possible word: OATER – but A is excluded.
OTTER – contains T twice (allowed), but we already have T once.
OTTER is a valid word: O T T E R
Check constraints:
- T in 2 (allowed, since T only banned from 1)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 5 (matches)
- E in 4 (matches)
- No banned letters (C, A, N, G, W) – good.

Option 2: _ T O E R
Possible word: BTOER – invalid.
FT OER – invalid.
Need a valid word: ""T O O E R"" – invalid.
""DO E R"" – invalid.
""STOER"" – invalid.
""PROER"" – invalid.
""XTOER"" – invalid.
""FT OER"" – invalid.
Actually, ""TOGER"" – but G is excluded.
""TOBER"" – B is allowed, but ""TOBER"" is not a valid English word.
""TOFER"" – not valid.
""TOYER"" – Y is allowed, but ""TOYER"" is not a standard word.
""TOBER"" is obscure.

""OTTER"" seems the only common valid word fitting pattern 1.

Thus, the best next guess is OTTER.
