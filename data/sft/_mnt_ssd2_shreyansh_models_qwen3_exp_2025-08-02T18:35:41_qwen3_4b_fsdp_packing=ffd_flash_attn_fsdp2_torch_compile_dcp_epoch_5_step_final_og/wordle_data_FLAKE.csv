### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to test as many different letters as possible.

Looking at some of the most common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓)

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. A is somewhere in the first four positions.
3. The letters R, O, S are eliminated.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test are T, L, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. Since A is present and must be in positions 1-4, let's try a word that places A in a new spot and introduces new common consonants.

""ALONE"" is a good choice because:
- It keeps E in the last position (✓).
- It moves A to the second position.
- It introduces L, N, O. However, O is already ruled out, so this is bad.
""PLATE"" is another option:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 2.
- E is correct at 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to test as many different letters as possible.

Looking at some of the most common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓)

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. A is somewhere in the first four positions.
3. The letters R, O, S are eliminated.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test are T, L, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. Since A is present and must be in positions 1-4, let's try a word that places A in a new spot and introduces new common consonants.

""ALONE"" is a good choice because:
- It keeps E in the last position (✓).
- It moves A to the second position.
- It introduces L, N, O. However, O is already ruled out, so this is bad.
""PLATE"" is another option:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 2.
- E is correct at 5.
This seems better.

Let's go with ""PLATE"".

So the pattern we now have is:

We still need to test common consonants for the first and fourth positions. Good candidates are N, D, G, B, C, M, etc.

Let's try ""GLADE"":
- G for the first position (new letter)
- L, A, D, E fit the known pattern
- D is a common consonant we haven't tested yet

This seems like a good next guess to test G and D while confirming the pattern.

Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to test as many different letters as possible.\n\nLooking at some of the most common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 very common consonants (R, S)\n\nThis should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on ""arose"":\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- O is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓)\n\nSo far we know:\n1.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.\n\nGood next letters to test are T, L, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. Since A is present and must be in positions 1-4, let\'s try a word that places A in a new spot and introduces new common consonants.\n\n""ALONE"" is a good choice because:\n- It keeps E in the last position (✓).\n- It moves A to the second position.\n- It introduces L, N, O. However, O is already ruled out, so this is bad.\n""PLATE"" is another option:\n- P, L, T are new letters.\n- A is in position 2.\n- E is correct at 5.\nThis seems better.\n\nLet\'s go with ""PLATE"".\n\n<guess>plate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: plate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on ""plate"":\n- P is NOT in the word (x)\n- L is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → L is the second letter\n- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → A is the third letter\n- T is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → E is the fifth letter\n\nSo the pattern we now have is:\n_ L A _ E\n\nLetters already ruled out: R, O, S, P, T\n\nWe still need to test common consonants for the first and fourth positions.
