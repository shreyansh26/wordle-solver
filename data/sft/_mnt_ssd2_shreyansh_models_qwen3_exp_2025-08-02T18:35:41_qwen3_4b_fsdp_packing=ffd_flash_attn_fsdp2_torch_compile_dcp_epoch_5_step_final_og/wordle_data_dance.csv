### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the secret word
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P, L, T are not in the word.

3. MADGE → M(x) A(✓) D(-) G(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E in position 5 and A in position 2.
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - M and G are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word is _ A _ _ E
- Contains D but D is not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, P, L, T, M, G
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: B, C, F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus D (but D cannot be in position 3)

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Has D somewhere in positions 1 or 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- D A _ _ E (D in position 1)
- _ A _ D E (D in position 4)

Looking for common words:
- D A _ _ E: ""DA"" is a prefix, but common words like ""DANCE"" have C and N, but C is allowed. ""DANCE"" would fit: D A N C E
   - Check letters: D, A, N, C, E
   - All letters are allowed (N and C are not excluded)
   - D is in position 1 (allowed since D is in the word but position 3 is excluded)
   - A is in position 2 (correct)
   - E is in position 5 (correct)

This seems like a good candidate.
