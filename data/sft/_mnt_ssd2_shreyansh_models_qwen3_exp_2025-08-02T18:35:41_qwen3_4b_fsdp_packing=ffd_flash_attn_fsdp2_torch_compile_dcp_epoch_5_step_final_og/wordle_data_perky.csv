Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these is ""AROSE"". It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because of the high frequency of A, R, O, S, E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

- S (x) – S is not in the word at all.

- R is moved to position 1 (was wrong in 2).

- No A, O, S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these is ""AROSE"". It contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because of the high frequency of A, R, O, S, E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S (x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E (-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S.
- Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: R (not 2nd) and E (not 5th).

Next guess should:
1. Use R and E in different positions.
2. Avoid A, O, S.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “REIGN”:
- R is moved to position 1 (was wrong in 2).
- E is moved to position 2 (was wrong in 5).
- Introduces I, N, G – all common letters not yet tested.
- No A, O, S.

This should help narrow down positions and test new letters efficiently.

Guess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(✓) I(x) G(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
→ Letters to exclude: A, O, S  
→ R is in the word but not in position 2  
→ E is in the word but not in position 5  

Round 2 – REIGN  
R(-) E(✓) I(x) G(x) N(x)  
→ Letters to exclude: I, G, N  
→ R is in the word but not in position 1  
→ E is in the word and IS in position 2 (✓)

Current knowledge:
- Word contains E in position 2.
- Word contains R, but R is not in position 1 or 2 → R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters to exclude so far: A, O, S, I, G, N.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3-5
- No A, O, S, I, G, N

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should test several new common letters while placing E in position 2 and R in a new position.  
Candidate: “TREND” – but N is excluded.  
Candidate: “BREED” – but E is already known in position 2, and D is new.  
Candidate: “CREEK” – but K is less common.  
Candidate: “FRESH” – but S is excluded.  
Candidate: “DREEL” – but L is repeated and less common.  
Candidate: “TREND” – N excluded.  
Candidate: “WRECK” – C and K are okay, but K is less common.  
Candidate: “FRESH” – S excluded.  
Candidate: “BREED” – seems okay, but D is new and E repeats.  
Candidate: “CREED” – C and D are new, E repeats.  
Candidate: “TREED” – T and D are new, E repeats.  
Candidate: “DREAD” – D and A are okay, but A is excluded.  
Candidate: “FREAK” – F, K new, but A excluded.  
Candidate: “BREAD” – A excluded.  
Candidate: “CREPT” – C, P, T new, R in 3rd, E in 2nd.  
This seems good: C, R, E, P, T – all allowed, R in 3rd, E in 2nd.
