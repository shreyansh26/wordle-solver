### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains L, A, E

I need a new 5-letter word that uses L, A, E and avoids S and T. I should also try to place L, A, E in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REALM"":
- R: new letter, common
- E: in position 2 (was not in 5)
- A: in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in 3, so this might be bad)
Wait, A cannot be in 3, so REALM is bad.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, T, R, Y

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains L, A, E
- Does NOT contain S or T
- L is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that uses L, A, E and avoids S and T. I should also try to place L, A, E in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REALM"":
- R: new letter, common
- E: in position 2 (was not in 5)
- A: in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in 3, so this might be bad)
Wait, A cannot be in 3, so REALM is bad.

Another candidate: ""LEARN""
- L: position 1 (was not in 2, so possible)
- E: position 2 (possible)
- A: position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3)
No good.

""EARLY"":
- E: position 1 (possible)
- A: position 2 (possible)
- R: new
- L: position 4 (possible)
- Y: new
This seems valid: uses E, A, L; avoids S, T; positions are new.

But let me check if there's a better word. ""LEVER"" has two E's, but E is already known to be in the word. Maybe ""LEVER"" is good.

But ""EARLY"" seems better because it uses E, A, L in new positions and introduces new letters R and Y.

I'll go with EARLY.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, T, R, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E  
Positions that are NOT allowed for these letters:  
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- A must be in position 2 (because A(✓) in EARLY means it is correct there)  
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2)  
We still need to place L and E somewhere else, and introduce two new consonants (since we already used A, L, E).

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4  (but 2 is already A, so 3 or 4)  

Let’s try to build a word that fits:
- Position 2 is A
- Must contain L and E in allowed spots
- Must avoid S, T, R, Y

A good candidate is “BALMY”:
- B: new letter
- A: position 2 ✓
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- M: new letter
- Y: already ruled out → discard

Next candidate: “PALEO”:
- P: new

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains L, A, E
- Does NOT contain S or T
- L is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3
- E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that uses L, A, E and avoids S and T. I should also try to place L, A, E in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REALM"":
- R: new letter, common
- E: in position 2 (was not in 5)
- A: in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in 3, so this might be bad)
Wait, A cannot be in 3, so REALM is bad.

Another candidate: ""LEARN""
- L: position 1 (was not in 2, so possible)
- E: position 2 (possible)
- A: position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3)
No good.

""EARLY"":
- E: position 1 (possible)
- A: position 2 (possible)
- R: new
- L: position 4 (possible)
- Y: new
This seems valid: uses E, A, L; avoids S, T; positions are new.

But let me check if there's a better word. ""LEVER"" has two E's, but E is already known to be in the word. Maybe ""LEVER"" is good.

But ""EARLY"" seems better because it uses E, A, L in new positions and introduces new letters R and Y.

I'll go with EARLY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(x) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, T, R, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E  
Positions that are NOT allowed for these letters:  
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- A must be in position 2 (because A(✓) in EARLY means it is correct there)  
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  (A locked in position 2)  
We still need to place L and E somewhere else, and introduce two new consonants (since we already used A, L, E).

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4  (but 2 is already A, so 3 or 4)  

Let’s try to build a word that fits:
- Position 2 is A
- Must contain L and E in allowed spots
- Must avoid S, T, R, Y

A good candidate is “BALMY”:
- B: new letter
- A: position 2 ✓
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- M: new letter
- Y: already ruled out → discard

Next candidate: “PALEO”:
- P: new
- A: position 2 ✓
- L: position 3 ✓
- E: position 4 ✓
- O: new
This fits all constraints: uses L, A, E in correct positions, avoids forbidden letters, and introduces P and O.

Let’s go with PALEO.

Current confirmed facts:

- Letters that are in the word: A, L, E  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, P, O  
- A is fixed in position 2.  
- E is fixed in position 4.  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from EARLY, PALEO feedback).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:  
L A _ E _

We need one more letter for position 3.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any letter except S, T, R, Y, P, O.  
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant that forms a valid 5-letter word.  
Trying B: L A B E _ → LABEL is valid (means “to label”), but it repeats B and L.  
Trying N: L A N E _ → LANCE is valid.  
Trying M: L A M E _ → LAME? but needs 5 letters.  
Trying D: L A D E _ → LADEN is valid.  

LANCE is a common word and fits perfectly: L A N E C.

Let’s verify:
- L in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (fixed)  
- N is new and allowed  
- E in position 4 (fixed)  
- C is new and allowed  

No conflicts with previous feedback.

From the new feedback on LANCE:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)  

So the pattern is:  
L A _ _ E

Letters already ruled out: S, T, R, Y, P, O, N, C  
Letters known to be in the word: L, A, E  

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the ruled-out set).  
Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word that fits L A _ _ E.

Possible candidates:
- L A B E L → LABEL (valid, but repeats L)  
- L A D E D → LADED (valid)  
- L A G E D → LAGED (not a common word)  
- L A M E D → LAMED (valid)  
- L A G E N → LAHEN (not a word)  
- L A V E D → LAVED (not a word)  
- L A B E D → LABED (not a word)  
- L A F E D → LAFED (not a word)  

The two most common valid words are LAMED and LADED.  
Between them, LAMED is slightly more common in everyday usage.  
Let’s go with LAMED.
