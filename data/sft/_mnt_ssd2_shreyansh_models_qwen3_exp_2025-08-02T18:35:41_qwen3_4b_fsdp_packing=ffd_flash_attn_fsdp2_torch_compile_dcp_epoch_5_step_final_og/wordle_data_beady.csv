### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers A, D, I, E, U
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it includes very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and helps quickly identify vowels and consonants in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — it must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (since it was in position 5)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, I, or S
- Has A somewhere in positions 2,3,4 and E somewhere in positions 2,3,4

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

A strong next guess would be one that:
- Places A and E in new positions
- Introduces new common consonants
- Avoids R, I, S

Candidate words:
- TALEN: has T, A, L, E, N
- PLATE: has P, L, A, T, E
- CLADE: has C, L, A, D, E
- GLADE: has G, L, A, D, E

From the two pieces of feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: R, I, S
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: A, E

2. GLADE → G(x) L(x) A(✓) D(✓) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: G, L
   - Letters in the word and in the correct positions: A (position 3), D (position 4)
   - Letter in the word but in the wrong position: E

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 3
- Has D in position 4
- Has E somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it was in position 5 in RAISE and marked “-”, and now in position 5 in GLADE and still “-”, so E must be in position 2)
- Does NOT contain: R, I, S, G, L

Known pattern: _ E A D _

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ E A D _ and uses only letters not ruled out (no R, I, S, G, L).

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for common words fitting _ E A D _:
- BEADY: B, E, A, D, Y – fits pattern, uses allowed letters
- FEADY: not a valid word
- PEADY: not a valid word
- WEADY: not a valid word

“BEADY” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Check: B (new), E (must be in position 2), A (position 3), D (position 4), Y (new). No forbidden letters.

So next guess: BEADY
