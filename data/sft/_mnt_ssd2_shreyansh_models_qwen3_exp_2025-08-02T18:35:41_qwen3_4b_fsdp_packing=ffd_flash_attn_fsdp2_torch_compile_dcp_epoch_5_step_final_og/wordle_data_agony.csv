Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

1. Contains A but not in position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I also want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left are I, O, U.

From the two rounds of feedback:

   – N is in position 4 (✓).  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).  
   – C, R, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, K  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, N  
- Position of N: 4th letter (N _ _ N _ or _ _ N _ N, but the ✓ is on the 4th spot, so _ _ _ N _)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N.
- Has N in position 4.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, C, R, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “MADON”:
- Letters used: M, A, D, O, N  
- N is in position 4 (✓).  
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the earlier feedback).  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, C, R, K).

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, R, K, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
A, N, O  (each has appeared with “-” or “✓”, so they are in the word)

Positions we have information about:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because in MADON the N in position 5 also got “-”).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because it got “-” in both places).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got “-” there).

So the secret word:
- contains A, N, O
- A is not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- N is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5
- O is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

We also know the word has only 5 letters and uses no forbidden letters.

Let’s try to place A, N, O in possible spots while introducing new common letters.

A good candidate is “PAINT”:
- P, I, N, T.  Wait, T is forbidden (x in SLATE), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “NOAH” – too short.

Next: “POANO” – invalid (repeats O and N).

Next: “FOCAL” – C is forbidden.

Next: “HONAL” – L is forbidden.

Next: “GONAD” – D is forbidden.

Next: “VONAG” – G not tested yet, but let’s see.

Actually, let’s systematically list possible positions for A, N, O.

A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
O can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to pick a word that uses these letters in allowed positions and introduces new letters.

Let’s try “OCEAN” – but C is forbidden.

“ONION” – O, N, I, O, N.  Repeats O and N, and I is new but let’s see.

“ONION”:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- I in 3 (new)
- O in 4 (forbidden – O got “-” in 4)
So invalid.

“NOVIA” – A in 5 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), V and I new.  But A is in 5, N in 1, O in 2 – this seems valid.

But let’s check letters: N, O, V, I, A – none are forbidden.

This looks good.

So I’ll guess NOVIA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since A is in the word but not in the 3rd position, I need a new word that:
1. Contains A but not in position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I also want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left are I, O, U.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is present and not in position 3 (it's in position 2).
- No S, L, T, E.

This should give information about C, R, N, K and confirm the placement of A.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) K(x)  
   – N is in position 4 (✓).  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).  
   – C, R, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, K  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, N  
- Position of N: 4th letter (N _ _ N _ or _ _ N _ N, but the ✓ is on the 4th spot, so _ _ _ N _)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N.
- Has N in position 4.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, C, R, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “MADON”:
- Letters used: M, A, D, O, N  
- N is in position 4 (✓).  
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the earlier feedback).  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, C, R, K).  
- Introduces M, D, O which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

So I’ll guess MADON.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, R, K, M, D, V, I

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
A, N, O  (each has appeared with “-” or “✓”, so they are in the word)

Positions we have information about:
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (because in CRANK it was position 3 and got “-”, in MADON it was position 5 and got “-”, in NOVIA it was position 1 and got “-”).
  – So N can only be in position 3.

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (because it got “-” in those places).
  – So A can only be in position 1 or 4.

- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4 (because it got “-” in those places).
  – So O can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

But we already know N must be in position 3.  Therefore:
- A can be in 1 or 4.
- O can be in 2, 5 (since 3 is taken by N).

So the word structure is:
_ _ N _ _  (with N fixed in position 3)

Possible patterns:
A _ N _ _  or  _ _ N _ A

And O must fit into the remaining slots.

Let’s list possible combinations:

1. A _ N _ _  
   – O must be in position 2 or 5.  
   – Position 2: A O N _ _  
     – Need two more letters not yet used (forbidden list: S,L,T,E,C,R,K,M,D,V,I).  
     – Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
     – Valid word?  A O N B G – not a word.  A O N U M – invalid (M).  
     – Actually, “AON” is not a prefix.  Let’s think of real words.  
     – “AON” + “…” – nothing obvious.

2. _ _ N _ A  
   – O must be in position 2 or 5.  
   – Position 2: _ O N _ A  
     – Need first and fourth letters.  
     – Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z.  
     – Real word: B O N G A – not valid.  
     – F O N G A – not valid.  
     – P O N G A – not valid.  
     – H O N G A – not valid.  
     – U N O G A – no.  
     – Let’s try “P O N G A” – invalid.  
     – Actually, “PONGA” is a word (a type of machete), but it’s obscure.  

3. _ _ N _ A with O in 5:  
   – _ _ N _ O  – but A must be in 1 or 4, and we have A in 4.  
   – _ _ N A O – but O can’t be in 4.  
   – A _ N _ O – but A can be in 1, O can be in 5.  
     – A _ N _ O  
     – Need second and fourth letters.  
     – Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z.  
     – Real word: A B N G O – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since A is in the word but not in the 3rd position, I need a new word that:
1. Contains A but not in position 3.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

I also want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels left are I, O, U.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is present and not in position 3 (it's in position 2).
- No S, L, T, E.

This should give information about C, R, N, K and confirm the placement of A.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) K(x)  
   – N is in position 4 (✓).  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same as before).  
   – C, R, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, K  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, N  
- Position of N: 4th letter (N _ _ N _ or _ _ N _ N, but the ✓ is on the 4th spot, so _ _ _ N _)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N.
- Has N in position 4.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, C, R, K.

Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “MADON”:
- Letters used: M, A, D, O, N  
- N is in position 4 (✓).  
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the earlier feedback).  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, C, R, K).  
- Introduces M, D, O which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

So I’ll guess MADON.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, R, K, M, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
A, N, O  (each has appeared with “-” or “✓”, so they are in the word)

Positions we have information about:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because in MADON the N in position 5 also got “-”).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because it got “-” in both places).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got “-” there).

So the secret word:
- contains A, N, O
- A is not in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- N is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5
- O is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

We also know the word has only 5 letters and uses no forbidden letters.

Let’s try to place A, N, O in possible spots while introducing new common letters.

A good candidate is “PAINT”:
- P, I, N, T.  Wait, T is forbidden (x in SLATE), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “NOAH” – too short.

Next: “POANO” – invalid (repeats O and N).

Next: “FOCAL” – C is forbidden.

Next: “HONAL” – L is forbidden.

Next: “GONAD” – D is forbidden.

Next: “VONAG” – G not tested yet, but let’s see.

Actually, let’s systematically list possible positions for A, N, O.

A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.
O can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to pick a word that uses these letters in allowed positions and introduces new letters.

Let’s try “OCEAN” – but C is forbidden.

“ONION” – O, N, I, O, N.  Repeats O and N, and I is new but let’s see.

“ONION”:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- I in 3 (new)
- O in 4 (forbidden – O got “-” in 4)
So invalid.

“NOVIA” – A in 5 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), V and I new.  But A is in 5, N in 1, O in 2 – this seems valid.

But let’s check letters: N, O, V, I, A – none are forbidden.

This looks good.

So I’ll guess NOVIA.

Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, C, R, K, M, D, V, I

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
A, N, O  (each has appeared with “-”, so they are in the word)

Position constraints:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4).
  Therefore A must be in position 1 or 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from guesses 3, 4).
  Therefore N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from guesses 3, 4).
  Therefore O must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A, N, O exactly once each,
- has A in position 1 or 4,
- has N in position 1, 2, or 3,
- has O in position 1, 2, or 3,
- uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: A in position 1
Then N and O must be in positions 2 or 3 (but not both in the same spot).  
Possible patterns:
A N O _ _  (but then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with new letters not yet used)
A O N _ _

Case 2: A in position 4
Then N and O must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
Possible patterns:
_ _ _ A N  (but N must be in 1,2,3)
_ _ _ A O
_ _ N A _
_ _ O A _
N _ _ A _
O _ _ A _

Let’s try Case 1: A in position 1
Pattern: A N O _ _
We need two more letters not yet used.  
Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, K, M, D, V, I  
Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters from the available set.  
Let’s pick B and G.  
Word: A N O B G → ANOBG (invalid, not an English word)

Next: A N O G B → ANOG B (invalid)

Next: A N O P _ → A N O P _  
We need a valid English word.  
A N O P _ → ANOP_ – no valid words.

Next: A O N _ _  
A O N B G → AONBG (invalid)

Next: A O N P _ → AONP_ – invalid.

Case 2: A in position 4  
Pattern: _ _ N A _  
We need letters for positions 1, 2, 5.  
Possible: B, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try N in position 2, O in position 1:  
O N _ A _ → ON _ A _  
We need a letter for position 3 and 5.
