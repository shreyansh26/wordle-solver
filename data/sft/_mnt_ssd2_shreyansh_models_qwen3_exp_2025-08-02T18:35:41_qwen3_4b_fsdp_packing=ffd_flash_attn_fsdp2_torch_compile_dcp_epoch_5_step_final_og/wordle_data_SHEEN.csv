### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test their presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good letters to try next: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. ""STEIN"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not 4).
- E is in position 2 (not 5).
- T, I, N are new letters.
- No A, R, or O.

This seems like a strong next guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, E

2. STEIN → S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)
   - S is in the correct position (1st letter)
   - E is in the correct position (3rd letter)
   - N is in the correct position (5th letter)
   - T and I are not in the word

So we now know:
- Pattern: S _ E _ N
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T, I
- Remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits S _ E _ N and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCEN? (but C is allowed, but we need a valid word)
- SHEN? (but H is allowed)
- SPEEN? (but P is allowed, but double E might be an issue)
- SPEN? (but P is allowed)
- SHEN? (H is allowed)
- SCEN? (C is allowed)

Looking at valid words:
- SCENE (but E is already in 3rd position, and 5th is N, so SCENE would be S C E N E - but this has E in 5th which contradicts E being in 3rd)
- SPEEN (S P E E N - but E is in 3rd and 4th, which might not fit)
- SHEN? (not a valid word)
- SPEN? (not a valid word)
- SCEN? (not a valid word)

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is S _ E _ N. So positions 2 and 4 are unknown, but must be from the remaining letters.

Valid words fitting S _ E _ N:
- SLEEN? (but L is allowed)
- SPEEN (but double E might not be correct)
- SHEN? (not a word)
- SCEN? (not a word)
- SKEEN? (not a word)
- SPEN? (not a word)

Actually, ""SPEEN"" is a valid word (an old term for ""spend""), but it has double E. However, we know E is in 3rd position, so 4th letter could be E if the word allows it. But this seems unlikely.

Another valid word: ""SHEEN"" - but H is allowed and fits:
- S H E E N
Positions: S(1) H(2) E(3) E(4) N(5)
But we know E is in 3rd position, and 4th could be E if the word has two E's. However, the feedback didn't indicate anything about double letters, so this might be possible.

But let's check if there's a better word. Another possibility is ""SLEEN"" (but L is allowed):
- S L E E N
But again, double E.

Looking at the remaining letters, perhaps ""SKEEN"" isn't valid. Let me think of more common words.

Valid words fitting S _ E _ N:
- SLEEN (not common)
- SPEEN (valid but rare)
- SHEEN (valid, means shiny)
- SCENE (but E is in 3rd and 5th, which might not fit)
- SLEEN (not common)

""SHEEN"" seems the most plausible:
- S H E E N
Positions: S(1) H(2) E(3) E(4) N(5)
This fits the pattern S _ E _ N, and uses H which hasn't been tested yet.

Therefore, the next guess should be SHEEN.

Based on the feedback:
- S is correctly in position 1
- E is correctly in position 3
- N is correctly in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O are not in the word

The pattern is S _ E _ N. The missing letters (positions 2 and 4) must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, O, T, I).

A valid word fitting this pattern is SHEEN.
