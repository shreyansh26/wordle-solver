For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)

- E is the 5th letter.
- L and A are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were.
- S and T are not in the word at all.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
3. Does not contain S or T.

A good candidate is ""CLARE"":
- Ends with E (matches known position).
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (was in 2 before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is invalid because L can't be in 2).

Next candidate: ""GRAPE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 2) and P, G, R. But we need L somewhere.
- Doesn't contain L, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""ALONE"":

3. A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (it was wrong in both guesses).
4. S, T, O, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the word ends with E, contains both A and L somewhere in the first four positions, and avoids S, T, O, N.

Possible positions left for A: 2 or 4  
Possible positions left for L: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out)

We need a word that:

- Has A and L in allowed positions
- Uses only remaining common letters

A good candidate is ""PLAID"":

Let’s try ""GRAPE"" – no, lacks L.  
""CRANE"" – lacks A.  
""CLAVE"" – has A and L, ends with E, no forbidden letters.

Check CLAVE:
- C (1) – new
- L (2) – allowed (was wrong in position 2 before, but now we’re testing position 2 again; actually feedback said L is wrong in position 2 from ALONE, so L cannot be in position 2. So CLAVE is invalid because L is in position 2.)

A must be in 2 or 4.

L must be in 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out).

Case 1: A in 2, L in 1 → L A _ _ E
Case 2: A in 2, L in 4 → _ A _ L E
Case 3: A in 4, L in 1 → L _ _ A E
Case 4: A in 4, L in 4 → impossible (both can't be in 4)

So possible patterns:
L A _ _ E
_ A _ L E
L _ _ A E

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding S, T, O, N.

Pattern L A _ _ E:
- L A _ _ E – possible letters: L A R D E (not a word), L A M P E (not a word), L A R G E – ""large"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A in 2, L in 1. But ""large"" has R and G, which are allowed.

Check ""large"":
- L (1) – allowed
- A (2) – allowed
- R (3) – new
- G (4) – new
- E (5) – correct
No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- L is in 1 (was wrong in 2,3, so 1 is allowed)
- A is in 2 (was wrong in 1,3, so 2 is allowed)
- G and R are new
- No S, T, O, N
""large"" is a valid English word.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding S, T, O, N.

Pattern L A _ _ E:
- L A _ _ E – possible letters: L A R D E (not a word), L A M P E (not a word), L A R G E – ""large"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A in 2, L in 1. But ""large"" has R and G, which are allowed.

Check ""large"":
- L (1) – allowed
- A (2) – allowed
- R (3) – new
- G (4) – new
- E (5) – correct
No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- L is in 1 (was wrong in 2,3, so 1 is allowed)
- A is in 2 (was wrong in 1,3, so 2 is allowed)
- G and R are new
- No S, T, O, N

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
- E is the 5th letter.
- L and A are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were.
- S and T are not in the word at all.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
3. Does not contain S or T.

Possible letters to avoid: S, T
Possible positions to try: L could be 1,3,4; A could be 1,2,3,4 (but not 3 if it was in 3 before).

A good candidate is ""CLARE"":
- Ends with E (matches known position).
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (was in 2 before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is invalid because L can't be in 2).

Next candidate: ""GRAPE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 2) and P, G, R. But we need L somewhere.
- Doesn't contain L, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""ALONE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 1) and L (position 3).
- L was in position 2 before, so position 3 is new.
- A was in position 3 before, so position 1 is new.
- Doesn't contain S or T.
This seems valid.

Let's check: ALONE
- A (1) - new position
- L (3) - new position
- O (2) - new
- N (4) - new
- E (5) - correct

This should give us more information about L, A, and new letters.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. E is definitely in the 5th position.
2. L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (it was wrong in both guesses).
3. A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (it was wrong in both guesses).
4. S, T, O, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the word ends with E, contains both A and L somewhere in the first four positions, and avoids S, T, O, N.

Possible positions left for A: 2 or 4  
Possible positions left for L: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out)

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has A and L in allowed positions
- Uses only remaining common letters

A good candidate is ""PLAID"":
- Ends with D... wait, no, must end with E.  
Let’s try ""GRAPE"" – no, lacks L.  
""CRANE"" – lacks A.  
""CLAVE"" – has A and L, ends with E, no forbidden letters.

Check CLAVE:
- C (1) – new
- L (2) – allowed (was wrong in position 2 before, but now we’re testing position 2 again; actually feedback said L is wrong in position 2 from ALONE, so L cannot be in position 2. So CLAVE is invalid because L is in position 2.)

Next candidate: ""BLAME"":
- B (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid (was wrong here before)
""FLAME"":
- F (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""CLAVE"" invalid as above.

Next: ""PLUME"" – lacks A.

""PALE"" – too short.

""GLADE"":
- G (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""GLAZE"" – lacks A.

""BLADE"":
- B (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""GRAPE"" – lacks L.

""CLIME"" – lacks A.

""FLAKE"":
- F (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""CRANE"" – lacks A.

""CLAVE"" invalid.

""GLARE"":
- G (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""BLARE"" – L in 2 invalid.

""PLAID"" – ends with D.

""FLARE"" – L in 2 invalid.

""CLARE"" – L in 3 invalid.

""SLARE"" – S is forbidden.

""PLAET"" – not a word.

""GRAET"" – not a word.

""CRATE"" – lacks A.

""CRANE"" – lacks A.

""GRADE"" – lacks L.

""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""CLADE"" – A is in 3, which was forbidden.

""BLADE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""FLAKE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""GLADE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""PLANE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""CRANE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""GRAPE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""SLATE"" – already used.

""CLAVE"" – already considered.

""PLUME"" – lacks A.

""CRUEL"" – ends with L, not E.

""CRUEL"" – wrong.

Let’s systematically list possible positions:

Word ends with E.

A must be in 2 or 4.

L must be in 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out).

Case 1: A in 2, L in 1 → L A _ _ E
Case 2: A in 2, L in 4 → _ A _ L E
Case 3: A in 4, L in 1 → L _ _ A E
Case 4: A in 4, L in 4 → impossible (both can't be in 4)

So possible patterns:
L A _ _ E
_ A _ L E
L _ _ A E

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding S, T, O, N.

Pattern L A _ _ E:
- L A _ _ E – possible letters: L A R D E (not a word), L A M P E (not a word), L A R G E – ""large"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A in 2, L in 1. But ""large"" has R and G, which are allowed.

Check ""large"":
- L (1) – allowed
- A (2) – allowed
- R (3) – new
- G (4) – new
- E (5) – correct
No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- L is in 1 (was wrong in 2,3, so 1 is allowed)
- A is in 2 (was wrong in 1,3, so 2 is allowed)
- G and R are new
- No S, T, O, N
""large"" is a valid English word.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓)

So we know:
- E is the 5th letter.
- L and A are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they were.
- S and T are not in the word at all.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
3. Does not contain S or T.

Possible letters to avoid: S, T
Possible positions to try: L could be 1,3,4; A could be 1,2,3,4 (but not 3 if it was in 3 before).

A good candidate is ""CLARE"":
- Ends with E (matches known position).
- Contains L and A.
- L is in position 2 (was in 2 before, but feedback said wrong position, so this is invalid because L can't be in 2).

Next candidate: ""GRAPE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 2) and P, G, R. But we need L somewhere.
- Doesn't contain L, so invalid.

Next candidate: ""ALONE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (position 1) and L (position 3).
- L was in position 2 before, so position 3 is new.
- A was in position 3 before, so position 1 is new.
- Doesn't contain S or T.

- A (1) - new position
- L (3) - new position
- O (2) - new

- E (5) - correct

This should give us more information about L, A, and new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALONE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. E is definitely in the 5th position.
2. L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (it was wrong in both guesses).
3. A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (it was wrong in both guesses).
4. S, T, O, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the word ends with E, contains both A and L somewhere in the first four positions, and avoids S, T, O, N.

Possible positions left for A: 2 or 4  
Possible positions left for L: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out)

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has A and L in allowed positions
- Uses only remaining common letters

A good candidate is ""PLAID"":
- Ends with D... wait, no, must end with E.  
Let’s try ""GRAPE"" – no, lacks L.  
""CRANE"" – lacks A.  
""CLAVE"" – has A and L, ends with E, no forbidden letters.

Check CLAVE:
- C (1) – new
- L (2) – allowed (was wrong in position 2 before, but now we’re testing position 2 again; actually feedback said L is wrong in position 2 from ALONE, so L cannot be in position 2. So CLAVE is invalid because L is in position 2.)

Next candidate: ""BLAME"":
- B (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid (was wrong here before)
""FLAME"":
- F (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""CLAVE"" invalid as above.

Next: ""PLUME"" – lacks A.

""PALE"" – too short.

""GLADE"":
- G (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""GLAZE"" – lacks A.

""BLADE"":
- B (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""GRAPE"" – lacks L.

""CLIME"" – lacks A.

""FLAKE"":
- F (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""CRANE"" – lacks A.

""CLAVE"" invalid.

""GLARE"":
- G (1) – new
- L (2) – invalid
""BLARE"" – L in 2 invalid.

""PLAID"" – ends with D.

""FLARE"" – L in 2 invalid.

""CLARE"" – L in 3 invalid.

""SLARE"" – S is forbidden.

""PLAET"" – not a word.

""GRAET"" – not a word.

""CRATE"" – lacks A.

""CRANE"" – lacks A.

""GRADE"" – lacks L.

""PLATE"" – lacks L.

""CLADE"" – A is in 3, which was forbidden.

""BLADE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""FLAKE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""GLADE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""PLANE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""CRANE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""GRAPE"" – A is in 3, forbidden.

""SLATE"" – already used.

""CLAVE"" – already considered.

""PLUME"" – lacks A.

""CRUEL"" – ends with L, not E.

""CRUEL"" – wrong.

Let’s systematically list possible positions:

Word ends with E.

A must be in 2 or 4.

L must be in 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are out).

Case 1: A in 2, L in 1 → L A _ _ E
Case 2: A in 2, L in 4 → _ A _ L E
Case 3: A in 4, L in 1 → L _ _ A E
Case 4: A in 4, L in 4 → impossible (both can't be in 4)

So possible patterns:
L A _ _ E
_ A _ L E
L _ _ A E

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, avoiding S, T, O, N.

Pattern L A _ _ E:
- L A _ _ E – possible letters: L A R D E (not a word), L A M P E (not a word), L A R G E – ""large"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A in 2, L in 1. But ""large"" has R and G, which are allowed.

Check ""large"":
- L (1) – allowed
- A (2) – allowed
- R (3) – new
- G (4) – new
- E (5) – correct
No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- L is in 1 (was wrong in 2,3, so 1 is allowed)
- A is in 2 (was wrong in 1,3, so 2 is allowed)
- G and R are new
- No S, T, O, N
""large"" is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: LARGE -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) R(x) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on LARGE:

- L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 2.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (already known).

So we now know:

1. Word ends with E.
2. A is in position 2.
3. L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from SLATE, ALONE, and LARGE feedback).
   Therefore L must be in position 4.
4. Forbidden letters so far: S, T, O, N, R, G.

Current pattern: _ A _ L E

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = L
- Position 5 = E
- Does NOT contain S, T, O, N, R, G
- Position 1 and 3 are new letters (not yet ruled out)

Possible letters left (common ones): B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s think of common words fitting _ A _ L E:

- B A _ L E → ""bale"" is 4 letters, ""balde"" not a word.
- C A _ L E → ""cable"" has B and L, but B is allowed, but we need 5 letters. ""cable"" is 5 letters: C A B L E. But B is allowed, and C is allowed. Let's check:
  - C (1) – new
  - A (2) – correct
  - B (3) – new
  - L (4) – correct (was only ruled out of 1,2,3)
  - E (5) – correct
  No forbidden letters.

- D A _ L E → ""dable"" not a word.
- F A _ L E → ""fable"" has B, but B is allowed, but ""fable"" is 5 letters: F A B L E. Check:
  - F (1) – new
  - A (2) – correct
  - B (3) – new
  - L (4) – correct
  - E (5) – correct
  No forbidden letters.

- P A _ L E → ""pale"" is 4 letters, ""palae"" not standard.
- M A _ L E → ""mable"" not a word.

Between ""cable"" and ""fable"", both fit. ""cable"" is more common. Let's choose ""cable"".

But wait, ""cable"" has B in position 3, which is new and allowed.

So the next guess is CABLE.

- B(x)  → B is NOT in the word.
- L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was wrong there).

So far we know:

1. Word ends with E.
2. A is in position 2.
3. L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   Therefore L must be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.
   This is impossible, so our assumption must be wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: CABLE
- C(x) → C not in word
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (correct)
- B(x) → B not in word
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (correct)

But we already know E is in position 5, so L cannot be in position 5.  
The only positions left for L are 1, 3, or 4, but:
- From SLATE: L was wrong in position 1
- From ALONE: L was wrong in position 2 (but we know L isn't in 2)
- From LARGE: L was wrong in position 1 and 4
- From CABLE: L was wrong in position 4

So L must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ A L E

But we need 5 letters, so the pattern is: _ A L _ E

Wait, no. The pattern is:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = L
- Position 5 = E

So the word is: _ A L _ E

Looking for 5-letter words with this pattern, avoiding all forbidden letters (S, T, O, N, R, G, C, B).

Possible letters left: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- D A L _ E → ""dalle"" (but has two L's, which might be allowed, but we don't know yet)
- F A L _ E → ""fable"" but B is forbidden
- H A L _ E → ""halve"" (H, A, L, V, E) – H and V are allowed
- M A L _ E → ""malve"" (not common)
- P A L _ E → ""palae"" (not standard)
- V A L _ E → ""valve"" (V, A, L, V, E) – V is allowed

""halve"" and ""valve"" both fit. ""halve"" is more common.

Let's check ""halve"":
