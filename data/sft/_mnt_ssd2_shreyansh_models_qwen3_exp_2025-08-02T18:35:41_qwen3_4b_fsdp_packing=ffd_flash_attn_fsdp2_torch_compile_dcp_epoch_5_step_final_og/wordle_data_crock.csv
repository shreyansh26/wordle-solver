### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This will help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the second letter is R
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the third letter is O
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Therefore, the pattern so far is: _ R O _ _

Letters still available (not ruled out yet): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter
2. Has O as the third letter
3. Does not contain A, S, or E
4. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Possible candidates:
- BROTH
- CROON (but O is already used twice)
- DROOL
- GROIN
- PROUD
- TROOP
- WROTE (but E is ruled out)
- BROKE
- CROWN
- DROWN

Looking at these, ""CROWN"" fits perfectly: C R O W N
- C: new letter
- R: already confirmed ✓
- O: already confirmed ✓
- W: new letter
- N: new letter

This will help test new consonants and vowels while respecting the constraints.
