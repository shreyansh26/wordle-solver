For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _

Next, I want to test new letters that haven’t been eliminated yet. Good consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc., and vowels left are I, U, Y. I should pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd spot.
2. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (no A, R, S, E).
3. Introduces several new letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- POINT (but has I, P, N, T – but E is out, so this is okay)
- DOING (D, I, N, G – but G is less common)
- CLOTH (C, L, T, H – but H is less common)
- MOUND (M, U, N, D – but D is okay)
- BOUND (B, U, N, D – but B is okay)

I’ll choose “POINT” because it introduces P, I, N, T while keeping O fixed in the 3rd spot and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Current known facts:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters ruled out completely: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 5 (from feedback D(-)).

So the word must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, but not at the end. Position 3 is already O, so D must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Remaining candidate letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels Y (sometimes).

But we need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ _ O _ _ with D somewhere and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible placements for D:
1. D _ O _ _  (D at start)
2. _ D O _ _  (D at position 2)
3. _ _ O D _  (D at position 4)

Let's brainstorm words:
- D _ O _ _: DROWN (N is out), DWIND (not a word), etc. – nothing valid.
- _ D O _ _: BROKE (B, R, K – R is out), FROZE (R is out), etc. – R is out.
- _ _ O D _: B O D _ _ – not fitting. Words like ""M O D _ _"" – M O D E L (E is out), M O D I S (I is out), etc.
- _ _ O _ D: but D must not be at position 5 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must have O in position 3 and D somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 4). Also, no A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U.

Possible words:
- B O D _ _ – but we need 5 letters. ""BODGE"" (G, E – E is out), ""BODHI"" (I is out), etc.
- F O D _ _ – ""FODDER"" is too long, ""FODOR"" (R is out).
- G O D _ _ – ""GODLY"" (L is out), ""GODDE"" (E is out).
- H O D _ _ – ""HODAD"" (D is repeated, but D is allowed), but is it a word?
- M O D _ _ – ""M O D E L"" – E is out, ""M O D I S"" – I is out.
- W O D _ _ – ""W O D E N"" – E is out, ""W O D I E"" – I, E are out.
- Y O D _ _ – ""Y O D A"" – too short.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe D is in position 4:
_ _ O D _

Letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus Y.

Possible words:
- B O D _ _ – not matching _ _ O D _.
- F O D _ _ – not matching.
- G O D _ _ – not matching.
- H O D _ _ – not matching.
- M O D _ _ – not matching.
- W O D _ _ – not matching.

Wait, maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" – but needs 5 letters. ""M O D Y"" is 4 letters.

Alternative approach: Maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus another letter, but must fit _ _ O _ _ with D in position 4 and no eliminated letters.

Looking for valid words:
- ""M O D Y"" – 4 letters.
- ""M O D Y L"" – too long.
- ""M O D Y N"" – N is out.
- ""M O D Y S"" – S is out.
- ""M O D Y T"" – T is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe D is in position 2:
_ D O _ _

Letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus Y.

Possible words:
- B D O _ _ – not valid.
- F D O _ _ – not valid.
- G D O _ _ – not valid.
- H D O _ _ – not valid.
- J D O _ _ – not valid.
- K D O _ _ – not valid.
- M D O _ _ – not valid.
- V D O _ _ – not valid.
- W D O _ _ – not valid.
- Y D O _ _ – not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus another letter, but must fit _ _ O _ _.

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words with O in position 3 and D in position 1, 2, or 4, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- B O D _ _ – ""BODGE"" (E is out), ""BODHI"" (I is out).
- F O D _ _ – ""FODDER"" (too long), ""FODOR"" (R is out).
- G O D _ _ – ""GODLY"" (L is out), ""GODDE"" (E is out).
- H O D _ _ – ""HODAD"" (D is repeated, but D is allowed), but is ""HODAD"" a word? It's slang for ""hodgiedod"" but might not be valid.
- J O D _ _ – not valid.
- K O D _ _ – not valid.
- M O D _ _ – ""MODEL"" (E is out), ""MODUS"" (S is out), ""MODIC"" (C is out), ""MODGY"" (G is okay, Y is okay) – ""MODGY"" is not a standard word.
- V O D _ _ – not valid.
- W O D _ _ – ""WODEN"" (E is out), ""WODIE"" (I, E are out).
- Y O D _ _ – not valid.

This seems extremely limited. Maybe I missed something. Let's re-examine the feedback:

From CLOUD:
- C(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) D(-)
This means:
- O is in position 3 (confirmed).
- C, L, U are not in the word.
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word must contain D in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- D _ O _ _ – but we need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters not ruled out (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and forming a valid word.
- _ D O _ _ – same.
- _ _ O D _ – same.

Looking for valid words:
- ""DOWDY"" – but O is in position 2, not 3.
- ""DOUGH"" – O is in position 2, not 3.
- ""DOZER"" – R is out.
- ""DODGE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – I is out, N is out.
- ""DOWNS"" – S is out.
- ""DUMMY"" – M, Y are okay, but O is in position 3? No, O is in position 2.
- ""DODOL"" – L is out.
- ""DOZEN"" – Z, E, N – E, N are out.
- ""DOWNS"" – S is out.
- ""DOWEL"" – L is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – O is in position 2.
- ""DOWRY"" – O is in position 2.
- ""DOWER"" – R is out.
- ""DOWSE"" – S, E are out.
- ""DOWNT"" – T is out.
- ""DOZER"" – R is out.

This is extremely limited. Maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus another letter, but must fit _ _ O _ _.

Wait, let's try ""M O D Y"" plus a letter at the end, but D must not be at position 5, so:
- ""M O D Y"" – 4 letters.
- ""M O D Y L"" – too long.
- ""M O D Y N"" – N is out.
- ""M O D Y S"" – S is out.
- ""M O D Y T"" – T is out.

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From CLOUD:
- C(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) D(-)
This means:
- O is in position 3 (confirmed).
- C, L, U are not in the word.
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Possible valid words:
- ""BODGE"" – E is out.
- ""BODHI"" – I is out.
- ""FODOR"" – R is out.
- ""GODLY"" – L is out.
- ""HODAD"" – D is repeated, but D is allowed, and ""HODAD"" might be considered a word (slang for ""hodgiedod"").
- ""JODHP"" – not valid.
- ""KODIA"" – A is out.
- ""MODY"" – too short.
- ""VODKA"" – K, A – A is out.
- ""WODEN"" – E is out.
- ""YODLE"" – L is out.

""HODAD"" seems the closest valid word, even if slang. It fits:
- H O D A D – but A is out.
Wait, no, A is out from AROSE.

This is very challenging. Maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus another letter, but must fit _ _ O _ _.

Another approach: Maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus a letter at position 5, but D must not be at 5, so:
- ""M O D Y"" – 4 letters.
- ""M O D Y L"" – too long.
- ""M O D Y N"" – N is out.
- ""M O D Y S"" – S is out.
- ""M O D Y T"" – T is out.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently: maybe the word is ""M O D Y"" plus a letter at position 1 or 2.

But we need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 3 and D somewhere else, avoiding all eliminated letters.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that comes to mind is ""M O D Y"" plus another letter, but it doesn't fit.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _

Next, I want to test new letters that haven’t been eliminated yet. Good consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc., and vowels left are I, U, Y. I should pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd spot.
2. Uses only letters that haven’t been ruled out (no A, R, S, E).
3. Introduces several new letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- POINT (but has I, P, N, T – but E is out, so this is okay)
- DOING (D, I, N, G – but G is less common)
- CLOTH (C, L, T, H – but H is less common)
- MOUND (M, U, N, D – but D is okay)
- BOUND (B, U, N, D – but B is okay)

I’ll choose “POINT” because it introduces P, I, N, T while keeping O fixed in the 3rd spot and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Pattern: _ _ O _ _
Word: P O I N T → P(1), O(3), I(2), N(4), T(5)

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3: _ _ O _ _

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - Confirms O in position 3 again.
   - Eliminates P, I, N, T entirely.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, plus vowels U and Y.

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3.
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWN (B, L, O, W, N) – but N is out.
- CLOWN – N is out.
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – uses C, L, U, D; none ruled out.
- MOUND – N is out.
- FOCUS – C is okay, but S is out.
- GLOOM – M is okay, but O is repeated; G, L, O, O, M – but O is fixed once, so double O is possible.
- GUMMY – Y is okay, but M, M, U, M – M is okay, but U is okay.
- LUMBO – B is okay, but O is fixed in position 3.
- MOLLY – L, L, Y are okay, but O is fixed in position 3.

Best seems CLOUD: C, L, O, U, D – all letters not yet eliminated, and it tests C, L, U, D.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   – O is in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   – Confirms O in position 3.
   – Eliminates P, I, N, T.

3. CLOUD → C(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) D(-)
   – Confirms O in position 3.
   – Eliminates C, L, U.
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: D (already confirmed), Y (sometimes vowel), O (fixed in position 3).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3.
- D somewhere other than position 5.
- Only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate words:
- B O D Y ? – but Y is allowed, but we need 5 letters.
- M O D E L – but E, L ruled out.
- F O G D Y – but G, F, Y allowed, but D must not be in position 5.
- B O D G Y – B, O, D, G, Y – all allowed, D is in position 3? No, D is in position 3 here, but O is in position 3. Doesn’t fit.
- M O D Y ? – not 5 letters.
- G O D D Y – D appears twice, but D is allowed in positions 1,2,3,4 (but position 3 is O).
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- F O D O R – R ruled out.
- B O D G Y – 5 letters, fits: B, O, D, G, Y – D is in position 3 (but O is in position 3, so D can’t be there). Doesn’t fit.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Wait, let’s list 5-letter words with O in position 3 and D not in position 5:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- F O G D Y – F, O, G, D, Y – D is in position 4, which is allowed. This is 5 letters.
- G O D D Y – D in position 4, allowed.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – D in position 3, but O is in position 3, so invalid.
- F O G D Y – F, O, G, D, Y – valid 5-letter word.

F O G D Y is a valid word (means ""foody"" in slang, or ""fed up with the food""). But let’s check if all letters are allowed: F, O, G, D, Y – all allowed. D is in position 4, which is allowed (feedback said D is in word but not in position 5).

Another option: G O D D Y – G, O, D, D, Y – valid, but double D.

Best choice seems FOGDY, but let’s check if it’s a valid word. Actually, ""FOG D Y"" isn’t a standard word. Let me think of standard words.

Standard words with O in position 3, D not in position 5:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- G O D D Y – valid word, but double D.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in position 3).
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with O in position 3:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- F O G G Y – G, G, Y – but D is missing.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- G O D D Y – valid word, but double D.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in position 3).
- D O G M A – A ruled out.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me think differently: D must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D D Y – 5 letters, D in position 3 is O, so D in 1,2,4. Here D is in 1 and 3, but 3 is O, so D in 1 and 4. Valid.

G O D D Y – G, O, D, D, Y – all allowed, D in position 4.

Another: B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).

Another: F O G D Y – invalid.

Another: M O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: B O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: D O M Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: M O D E L – E, L ruled out.

Another: G O D D Y – seems the only valid 5-letter word fitting constraints.

But let me check if there are others.

- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O G M A – A ruled out.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Actually, let me think of ""GODDY"" – but it’s 5 letters, G, O, D, D, Y – valid.

But let me check if there are others.

- B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- F O G G Y – no D.

Another approach: D must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D D Y – 5 letters, D in 1 and 4.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Seems G O D D Y is the only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.

But let me check if there are others.

- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- F O G G Y – no D.

Another: B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).

Another: D O G M A – A ruled out.

Another: M O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: G O D D Y – valid.

Thus, the best next guess is G O D D Y.

But let me check if there are other valid words.

Actually, let me think of ""BODGY"" – but D is in position 3, which is O, so invalid.

""FUGGY"" – no D.

""FOGGY"" – no D.

""DOGMY"" – not a word.

""MOODY"" – O in 3, D in 4, M, O, O, D, Y – but O is repeated, and D is allowed in 4, Y allowed.

MOODY – M, O, O, D, Y – all allowed, D in 4, O in 3.

This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- 5 letters.
- O in position 3 (yes, 3rd letter O).
- D is in word (yes, 4th letter).
- D not in position 5 (yes, it's in 4).
- All letters allowed: M, O, D, Y – yes.

Thus, MOODY is a valid next guess.

Another: ""BOOZY"" – no D.

""FUGGY"" – no D.

Thus, MOODY seems the best.

<guess>MOODY</guess>",MOODY,"From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   – O is in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   – Confirms O in position 3.
   – Eliminates P, I, N, T.

3. CLOUD → C(x) L(x) O(✓) U(x) D(-)
   – Confirms O in position 3.
   – Eliminates C, L, U.
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: D (already confirmed), Y (sometimes vowel), O (fixed in position 3).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3.
- D somewhere other than position 5.
- Only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate words:
- B O D Y ? – but Y is allowed, but we need 5 letters.
- M O D E L – but E, L ruled out.
- F O G D Y – but G, F, Y allowed, but D must not be in position 5.
- B O D G Y – B, O, D, G, Y – all allowed, D is in position 3? No, D is in position 3 here, but O is in position 3. Doesn’t fit.
- M O D Y ? – not 5 letters.
- G O D D Y – D appears twice, but D is allowed in positions 1,2,3,4 (but position 3 is O).
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- F O D O R – R ruled out.
- B O D G Y – 5 letters, fits: B, O, D, G, Y – D is in position 3 (but O is in position 3, so D can’t be there). Doesn’t fit.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Wait, let’s list 5-letter words with O in position 3 and D not in position 5:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- F O G D Y – F, O, G, D, Y – D is in position 4, which is allowed. This is 5 letters.
- G O D D Y – D in position 4, allowed.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – D in position 3, but O is in position 3, so invalid.
- F O G D Y – F, O, G, D, Y – valid 5-letter word.

F O G D Y is a valid word (means ""foody"" in slang, or ""fed up with the food""). But let’s check if all letters are allowed: F, O, G, D, Y – all allowed. D is in position 4, which is allowed (feedback said D is in word but not in position 5).

Another option: G O D D Y – G, O, D, D, Y – valid, but double D.

Best choice seems FOGDY, but let’s check if it’s a valid word. Actually, ""FOG D Y"" isn’t a standard word. Let me think of standard words.

Standard words with O in position 3, D not in position 5:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- G O D D Y – valid word, but double D.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in position 3).
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with O in position 3:

- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- F O G G Y – G, G, Y – but D is missing.
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- G O D D Y – valid word, but double D.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in position 3).
- D O G M A – A ruled out.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let me think differently: D must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D D Y – 5 letters, D in position 3 is O, so D in 1,2,4. Here D is in 1 and 3, but 3 is O, so D in 1 and 4. Valid.

G O D D Y – G, O, D, D, Y – all allowed, D in position 4.

Another: B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).

Another: F O G D Y – invalid.

Another: M O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: B O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: D O M Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: M O D E L – E, L ruled out.

Another: G O D D Y – seems the only valid 5-letter word fitting constraints.

But let me check if there are others.

- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O G M A – A ruled out.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Actually, let me think of ""GODDY"" – but it’s 5 letters, G, O, D, D, Y – valid.

But let me check if there are others.

- B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).
- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- F O G G Y – no D.

Another approach: D must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).
- M O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- G O D D Y – 5 letters, D in 1 and 4.
- F O G D Y – invalid.

Seems G O D D Y is the only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.

But let me check if there are others.

- M O D E L – E, L ruled out.
- C O D E ? – C, E ruled out.
- B O D Y ? – 4 letters.
- D O M Y ? – 4 letters.
- F O G G Y – no D.

Another: B O D G Y – invalid (D in 3).

Another: D O G M A – A ruled out.

Another: M O D Y ? – 4 letters.

Another: G O D D Y – valid.

Thus, the best next guess is G O D D Y.

But let me check if there are other valid words.

Actually, let me think of ""BODGY"" – but D is in position 3, which is O, so invalid.

""FUGGY"" – no D.

""FOGGY"" – no D.

""DOGMY"" – not a word.

""MOODY"" – O in 3, D in 4, M, O, O, D, Y – but O is repeated, and D is allowed in 4, Y allowed.

MOODY – M, O, O, D, Y – all allowed, D in 4, O in 3.

This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- 5 letters.
- O in position 3 (yes, 3rd letter O).
- D is in word (yes, 4th letter).
- D not in position 5 (yes, it's in 4).
- All letters allowed: M, O, D, Y – yes.

Thus, MOODY is a valid next guess.

Another: ""BOOZY"" – no D.

""FUGGY"" – no D.

Thus, MOODY seems the best.",Guess 5: MOODY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) O(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
