### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
2. DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position (it was in position 5 in AROSE).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Does NOT have A, R, O, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E (in position 4).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.

- Letters A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I are NOT in the word (all x).
- The letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (both times it appeared in position 5 and got “-”).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, and E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “CHEEP”:
- C, H, P are new common consonants.
- E appears twice, once in position 2 and once in position 4. Since E can’t be in position 4, this will help us confirm where E belongs.
- All letters are allowed (none are in the forbidden list).

From the latest feedback on WEEGY:

- W(x) → W is not in the word.
- E(✓) in position 2 → second letter is E.
- E(✓) in position 3 → third letter is E.
- G(-) → G is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ E E _ Y

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all x's so far):
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, H, P, B, L, D, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- E (positions 2 and 3 fixed).
- G (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Y (position 5 fixed).

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
F, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z, plus the required G.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with one of the allowed consonants (F, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z).
2. Has the pattern C E E _ Y.
3. Contains G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but position 3 is already E, and position 4 is G(-), so G must be in position 1).

So the word must be G E E _ Y.

Looking for a valid 5-letter word with this pattern:
- G E E _ Y: The blank must be a letter not yet ruled out and not E, G, or Y.
- Allowed letters left: F, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.

Possible candidates:
- GEEKY → but K is allowed and Y is already in position 5.
- GEEFY → F is allowed.
- GEEJY → J is allowed.
- GEEKY is the most common word fitting this pattern.

Let's check GEEKY:
- G in position 1 (allowed).
- E in positions 2 and 3 (matches pattern).
- E in position 3 (matches pattern).
- K in position 4 (but G(-) said G is in the word but not in position 4; this is fine because G is in position 1).
- Y in position 5 (matches).

No forbidden letters are used, and it fits all constraints.
