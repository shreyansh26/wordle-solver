### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   - N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 2nd place).  
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 4th place).  
   - U, T, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): N, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.  
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.  
- Uses only the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We already know I and N must appear.

Good candidates:
- BINGO (but O is eliminated)  
- CHIMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed, but T is eliminated)  
- VINYL (but V, Y, L – L is eliminated)  
- MINKY (but Y is allowed, K is allowed, M, I, N) – but K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- MINCY – but C is allowed, Y is allowed, but C is allowed.  
- PINKY – P, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.  
- WINKY – W, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.

Let’s pick “WINKY” because W, I, N, K, Y are all still possible and it tests new common letters (W, K, Y) while confirming positions for I and N.

But wait: “WINKY” has Y in position 5. Let’s check positions:  
- I is in position 3 (originally in 4th place in “until”), so this is a new position.  
- N is in position 2 (originally in 2nd place in “until”), so this is the same position – but we know N is in the word but wrong position in 2nd place, so position 2 is wrong for N, so position 2 in “WINKY” is invalid for N.  

Therefore “WINKY” is invalid because N cannot be in position 2.  

Let’s try “MINKY”:  
- M, I, N, K, Y.  
- I is in position 2 (originally in 4th place), new position.  
- N is in position 3 (originally in 2nd place), new position.  

This looks valid.  

Another option is “PINGY”:  
- P, I, N, G, Y.  
- I in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new).  

Both are valid. Let’s choose “PINGY” as it tests G and P, which are common.

But let’s double-check:  
- P, I, N, G, Y – none of these are in the eliminated list.  
- I and N are both in the word (from feedback).  
- All positions are new for I and N.

Therefore “PINGY” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely new, common letters.  
The most common consonants not yet used are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, and the remaining vowels are I, U.  
A strong candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because it uses five fresh, very frequent letters and covers two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L).  
This will help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   - N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 2nd place).  
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 4th place).  
   - U, T, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): N, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.  
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.  
- Uses only the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We already know I and N must appear.

Good candidates:
- BINGO (but O is eliminated)  
- CHIMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed, but T is eliminated)  
- VINYL (but V, Y, L – L is eliminated)  
- MINKY (but Y is allowed, K is allowed, M, I, N) – but K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- MINCY – but C is allowed, Y is allowed, but C is allowed.  
- PINKY – P, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.  
- WINKY – W, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.

Let’s pick “WINKY” because W, I, N, K, Y are all still possible and it tests new common letters (W, K, Y) while confirming positions for I and N.

But wait: “WINKY” has Y in position 5. Let’s check positions:  
- I is in position 3 (originally in 4th place in “until”), so this is a new position.  
- N is in position 2 (originally in 2nd place in “until”), so this is the same position – but we know N is in the word but wrong position in 2nd place, so position 2 is wrong for N, so position 2 in “WINKY” is invalid for N.  

Therefore “WINKY” is invalid because N cannot be in position 2.  

Let’s try “MINKY”:  
- M, I, N, K, Y.  
- I is in position 2 (originally in 4th place), new position.  
- N is in position 3 (originally in 2nd place), new position.  

This looks valid.  

Another option is “PINGY”:  
- P, I, N, G, Y.  
- I in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new).  

Both are valid. Let’s choose “PINGY” as it tests G and P, which are common.

But let’s double-check:  
- P, I, N, G, Y – none of these are in the eliminated list.  
- I and N are both in the word (from feedback).  
- All positions are new for I and N.

Therefore “PINGY” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely new, common letters.  
The most common consonants not yet used are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, and the remaining vowels are I, U.  
A strong candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because it uses five fresh, very frequent letters and covers two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L).  
This will help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   - N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 2nd place).  
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 4th place).  
   - U, T, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): N, I

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and I.  
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.  
- Uses only the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We already know I and N must appear.

Good candidates:
- BINGO (but O is eliminated)  
- CHIMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed, but T is eliminated)  
- VINYL (but V, Y, L – L is eliminated)  
- MINKY (but Y is allowed, K is allowed, M, I, N) – but K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
- MINCY – but C is allowed, Y is allowed, but C is allowed.  
- PINKY – P, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.  
- WINKY – W, I, N, K, Y – all allowed.

Let’s pick “WINKY” because W, I, N, K, Y are all still possible and it tests new common letters (W, K, Y) while confirming positions for I and N.

But wait: “WINKY” has Y in position 5. Let’s check positions:  
- I is in position 3 (originally in 4th place in “until”), so this is a new position.  
- N is in position 2 (originally in 2nd place in “until”), so this is the same position – but we know N is in the word but wrong position in 2nd place, so position 2 is wrong for N, so position 2 in “WINKY” is invalid for N.  

Therefore “WINKY” is invalid because N cannot be in position 2.  

Let’s try “MINKY”:  
- M, I, N, K, Y.  
- I is in position 2 (originally in 4th place), new position.  
- N is in position 3 (originally in 2nd place), new position.  

This looks valid.  

Another option is “PINGY”:  
- P, I, N, G, Y.  
- I in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new).  

Both are valid. Let’s choose “PINGY” as it tests G and P, which are common.

But let’s double-check:  
- P, I, N, G, Y – none of these are in the eliminated list.  
- I and N are both in the word (from feedback).  
- All positions are new for I and N.

Therefore “PINGY” is a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

   Eliminates: A, R, O, S, E

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   Eliminates: U, T, L  
   Confirms: N is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. pingy → P(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)  
   Eliminates: P, G  
   Confirms: I is in position 2, N is in position 3, Y is in position 5.

So the word looks like: _ I N _ Y

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated):  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Z, plus the already-placed I, N, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, V, W.

- F I N D Y  
- H I N G Y (G is eliminated)  
- H I N D Y  
- M I N D Y  
- W I N D Y
