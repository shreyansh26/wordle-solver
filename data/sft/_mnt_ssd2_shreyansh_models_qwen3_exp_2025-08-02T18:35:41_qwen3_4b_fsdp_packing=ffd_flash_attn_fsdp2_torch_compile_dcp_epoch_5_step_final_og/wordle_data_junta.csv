1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Uses none of R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (A is already known).

A strong next guess is “A” plus four new consonants. “A” in position 2 gives us “TA” as a prefix. “TAINT” uses T, A, I, N, T – but has double T and repeats N. Better to avoid repeats.

Instead, try “A” in position 3: “PLAID” – but D is less common. “MADAM” repeats A and M. “PAINT” is good: P, A, I, N, T – all new letters, A in position 2.

Let’s go with “paint”.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, N, T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I.
- A is not in position 1 or 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- T is not in position 5.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A, N, T plus two new letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

A good candidate is “UNTAT” – but this repeats T. Let’s avoid repeats.

Another candidate is “ANTID” – but D is less common. Let’s try “ANTID” first.

“ANTID”:
- A in position 2 (but feedback says A is not in position 2) → invalid.

Next, try “TANKS” – but S is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + two new letters: “TANIC” – but I is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “H”: “TANGH” – not a valid word.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “L”: “TANG” + L → “TANGL” – not valid.

Next, try “TAN” + “K” and “G”: “TANKG” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: A must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Option 1: A in position 3 → _ _ A _ _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ A T _ or T _ A N _ or _ N A T _ or _ T A N _
   Example: N A A T _ – invalid (double A).
   Example: N U A T _ → “NUAT_” – no valid word.

Option 2: A in position 4 → _ _ _ A _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ _ A T – but T cannot be in 5 → invalid.
   Possible: T _ _ A N – valid positions: T _ _ A N.
   Example: T _ _ A N → “T” in 1, “A” in 4, “N” in 5.
   Need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y).
   Let’s try “T” + “H” + “A” + “N” → need two more letters.
   Example: T H _ A N → “THAN_” – need one more letter.
   Example: T H A N _ – but A is in 4, so “THAN_” with fifth letter from remaining.
   Example: T H A N K – valid word: “THANK”.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, N, T → yes.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I → yes.
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not in 1 or 2).
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said N not in 4).

   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, N, T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I.
- A is not in position 1 or 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- T is not in position 5.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A, N, T plus two new letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

A good candidate is “UNTAT” – but this repeats T. Let’s avoid repeats.

Another candidate is “ANTID” – but D is less common. Let’s try “ANTID” first.

“ANTID”:
- A in position 2 (but feedback says A is not in position 2) → invalid.

Next, try “TANKS” – but S is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + two new letters: “TANIC” – but I is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “H”: “TANGH” – not a valid word.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “L”: “TANG” + L → “TANGL” – not valid.

Next, try “TAN” + “K” and “G”: “TANKG” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: A must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Option 1: A in position 3 → _ _ A _ _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ A T _ or T _ A N _ or _ N A T _ or _ T A N _
   Example: N A A T _ – invalid (double A).
   Example: N U A T _ → “NUAT_” – no valid word.

Option 2: A in position 4 → _ _ _ A _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ _ A T – but T cannot be in 5 → invalid.
   Possible: T _ _ A N – valid positions: T _ _ A N.
   Example: T _ _ A N → “T” in 1, “A” in 4, “N” in 5.
   Need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y).
   Let’s try “T” + “H” + “A” + “N” → need two more letters.
   Example: T H _ A N → “THAN_” – need one more letter.
   Example: T H A N _ – but A is in 4, so “THAN_” with fifth letter from remaining.
   Example: T H A N K – valid word: “THANK”.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, N, T → yes.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I → yes.
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not in 1 or 2).
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said N not in 4).
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said T not in 5).

“THANK” seems valid.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, E, P, I, H, K

Letters we know ARE in the word:
A, N, T

Positional constraints so far:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from arose and paint).
- N is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from paint and thank).
- T is NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from paint and thank).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- T must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

We also need one more letter from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, U, Y.

Let’s try to place A in position 3 first (since it’s a common central position).

If A is in position 3:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3. But 3 is taken by A, so N is in 1 or 2.
- T must be in 2, 3, or 4. 3 is taken by A, so T is in 2 or 4.

Case 1: N in 1, A in 3
Word structure: N _ A _ _
T must be in 2 or 4. If T is in 2: N T A _ _
We need a letter for position 4 from remaining pool. Let’s pick D: N T A D _
We need a fifth letter from remaining pool. Let’s pick U: N T A D U – not a valid word.
Try C instead: N T A D C – invalid.
Try L: N T A D L – invalid.

Case 2: T in 2, A in 3
Word structure: _ T A _ _
N must be in 1 or 2. 2 is taken by T, so N is in 1: N T A _ _
Same as above – need a valid word. N T A _ _ – “NTA” is not a prefix.

Case 3: A in 5
Word structure: _ _ _ _ A
N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
T must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try N in 1, T in 2:
Word structure: N T _ _ A
Need two letters from remaining pool for positions 3 and 4. Let’s pick D and M: N T D M A – invalid.
Pick C and L: N T C L A – invalid.

Try N in 2, T in 3:
Word structure: _ N T _ A

Pick C and L: C L N T A – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: use A in position 3 and N in 2, T in 4.

A is in 3, N is in 2, T is in 4.

Pick C and L: N C A T L – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Uses none of R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (A is already known).

A strong next guess is “A” plus four new consonants. “A” in position 2 gives us “TA” as a prefix. “TAINT” uses T, A, I, N, T – but has double T and repeats N. Better to avoid repeats.

Instead, try “A” in position 3: “PLAID” – but D is less common. “MADAM” repeats A and M. “PAINT” is good: P, A, I, N, T – all new letters, A in position 2.

Let’s go with “paint”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: paint -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. paint → P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)
   - P is NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, N, T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I.
- A is not in position 1 or 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- T is not in position 5.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A, N, T plus two new letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

A good candidate is “UNTAT” – but this repeats T. Let’s avoid repeats.

Another candidate is “ANTID” – but D is less common. Let’s try “ANTID” first.

“ANTID”:
- A in position 2 (but feedback says A is not in position 2) → invalid.

Next, try “TANKS” – but S is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + two new letters: “TANIC” – but I is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “H”: “TANGH” – not a valid word.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “L”: “TANG” + L → “TANGL” – not valid.

Next, try “TAN” + “K” and “G”: “TANKG” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: A must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Option 1: A in position 3 → _ _ A _ _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ A T _ or T _ A N _ or _ N A T _ or _ T A N _
   Example: N A A T _ – invalid (double A).
   Example: N U A T _ → “NUAT_” – no valid word.

Option 2: A in position 4 → _ _ _ A _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ _ A T – but T cannot be in 5 → invalid.
   Possible: T _ _ A N – valid positions: T _ _ A N.
   Example: T _ _ A N → “T” in 1, “A” in 4, “N” in 5.
   Need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y).
   Let’s try “T” + “H” + “A” + “N” → need two more letters.
   Example: T H _ A N → “THAN_” – need one more letter.
   Example: T H A N _ – but A is in 4, so “THAN_” with fifth letter from remaining.
   Example: T H A N K – valid word: “THANK”.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, N, T → yes.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I → yes.
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not in 1 or 2).
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said N not in 4).
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said T not in 5).

“THANK” seems valid.

Better to avoid repeats.\n\nInstead, try “A” in position 3: “PLAID” – but D is less common. “MADAM” repeats A and M. “PAINT” is good: P, A, I, N, T – all new letters, A in position 2.\n\nLet’s go with “paint”.\n\n<guess>paint</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: paint -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.\n   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.\n\n2. paint → P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)\n   - P is NOT in the word.\n   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.\n   - I is NOT in the word.\n   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.\n   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A, N, T.\n- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I.\n- A is not in position 1 or 2.\n- N is not in position 4.\n- T is not in position 5.\n\nRemaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.\nWe need a 5-letter word that uses A, N, T plus two new letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints.\n\nLet’s try:\n- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n\nA good candidate is “UNTAT” – but this repeats T.

Let’s consolidate the constraints we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word: A, N, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, H, K  

Positional constraints:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4.  Therefore A must be in position 3 or 5.
- N is NOT in position 4.  Therefore N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- T is NOT in position 5.  Therefore T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses A, N, T and two other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden set).  Also, we must obey the positional restrictions above.

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Case 1: A is in position 3  
Word structure: _ _ A _ _  
Now N and T must go in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).  
Possible placements for N and T:
- N in 1, T in 2 → N T A _ _  
- N in 1, T in 4 → N _ A T _  
- N in 2, T in 1 → T N A _ _  
- N in 2, T in 4 → T _ A T _  (invalid, T repeats)  
- N in 5, T in 1 → T _ A _ N  
- N in 5, T in 2 → _ T A _ N  
- N in 5, T in 4 → _ _ A T N  

Let’s pick one of these and fill with allowed letters.  
Take N _ A T _ → N _ A T _  
We need a letter for position 2 and 5.  Allowed letters (not in forbidden set): B, C, D, F, G, L, M, U, Y, etc.  
Try N U A T _ → need a fifth letter.  A valid word is “NUATE” – but E is forbidden.  
Try N U A T Y → “NUATY” – not a word.  
Try N U A T M → “NUATM” – not a word.  
Try N U A T L → “NUATL” – not a word.  
Try N U A T D → “NUATD” – not a word.  
Try N U A T G → “NUATG” – not a word.  
Try N U A T B → “NUATB” – not a word.  
Try N U A T F → “NUATF” – not a word.  
Try N U A T C → “NUATC” – not a word.  
This path seems problematic.  Let’s try another.

Try N T A D L → “NTADL” – not a word.  
This path also seems problematic.  Let’s try another.

Case 2: A is in position 5  
Word structure: _ _ _ _ A  
Now N and T must go in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but N not 4, T not 5).  
Possible placements for N and T:
- N in 1, T in 2 → N T _ _ A  
- N in 1, T in 3 → N _ T _ A  
- N in 1, T in 4 → N _ _ T A  
- N in 2, T in 1 → T N _ _ A  
- N in 2, T in 3 → _ N T _ A  
- N in 2, T in 4 → _ N _ T A  
- N in 3, T in 1 → T _ N _ A  
- N in 3, T in 2 → _ T N _ A  
- N in 3, T in 4 → _ _ N T A  
- N in 4 – invalid (N not in 4).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Uses none of R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (A is already known).

A strong next guess is “A” plus four new consonants. “A” in position 2 gives us “TA” as a prefix. “TAINT” uses T, A, I, N, T – but has double T and repeats N. Better to avoid repeats.

Instead, try “A” in position 3: “PLAID” – but D is less common. “MADAM” repeats A and M. “PAINT” is good: P, A, I, N, T – all new letters, A in position 2.

Let’s go with “paint”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: paint -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. paint → P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)
   - P is NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in the word.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, N, T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I.
- A is not in position 1 or 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- T is not in position 5.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A, N, T plus two new letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints.

Let’s try:
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

A good candidate is “UNTAT” – but this repeats T. Let’s avoid repeats.

Another candidate is “ANTID” – but D is less common. Let’s try “ANTID” first.

“ANTID”:
- A in position 2 (but feedback says A is not in position 2) → invalid.

Next, try “TANKS” – but S is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + two new letters: “TANIC” – but I is excluded.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “H”: “TANGH” – not a valid word.

Next, try “TAN” + “G” and “L”: “TANG” + L → “TANGL” – not valid.

Next, try “TAN” + “K” and “G”: “TANKG” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: A must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Option 1: A in position 3 → _ _ A _ _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ A T _ or T _ A N _ or _ N A T _ or _ T A N _
   Example: N A A T _ – invalid (double A).
   Example: N U A T _ → “NUAT_” – no valid word.

Option 2: A in position 4 → _ _ _ A _
   Then N and T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but N not 4, T not 5).
   Possible: N _ _ A T – but T cannot be in 5 → invalid.
   Possible: T _ _ A N – valid positions: T _ _ A N.
   Example: T _ _ A N → “T” in 1, “A” in 4, “N” in 5.
   Need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y).
   Let’s try “T” + “H” + “A” + “N” → need two more letters.
   Example: T H _ A N → “THAN_” – need one more letter.
   Example: T H A N _ – but A is in 4, so “THAN_” with fifth letter from remaining.
   Example: T H A N K – valid word: “THANK”.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, N, T → yes.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I → yes.
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not in 1 or 2).
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said N not in 4).
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said T not in 5).

“THANK” seems valid.

Let's carefully re-examine the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. paint → P(x) A(-) I(x) N(-) T(-)
   - P is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

3. thank → T(-) H(x) A(-) N(-) K(x)
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.
   - K is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters in the word: A, N, T (each confirmed once).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, H, K.
- Positional restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in position 4 or 5.
  – N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
  – T cannot be in positions 1 or 5 → must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
  – Positions 4 and 5 must be occupied by A or another letter (but A is limited to 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible placements:
- If A is in position 4:
  – N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
  – T must be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by A), so T must be in 2 or 3.
  Possible patterns:
    N _ T A _ → but A is in 4, so N _ T A _ → need a letter in 5.
    _ N T A _ → need letters in 1 and 5.
    _ _ T A N → but N cannot be in 5 (from paint feedback), so invalid.
    _ N _ A T → T cannot be in 5, so invalid.
    N T _ A _ → need a letter in 3 and 5.
    T N _ A _ → need a letter in 3 and 5.

- If A is in position 5:
  – N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
  – T must be in 2, 3, or 4.
  Possible patterns:
    N _ _ _ A
    _ N _ _ A
    _ _ N _ A
    _ _ _ T A
    etc.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
Option: A in position 4, N in position 1, T in position 2 → N T _ A _.
We need two more letters from the remaining pool (letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, U, Y, etc.).
A valid word: N T A _ _ → but A is already in 4, so N T _ A _.
Example: N T U A _ → need a fifth letter. “NTUA_” – no valid word.
Next: N T A _ _ → “NTA_ _” – no valid word.

Alternative: A in position 5, N in position 2, T in position 3 → _ N T _ A.
We need letters 1 and 4 from remaining pool.
Example: B N T U A → “BNTUA” – invalid.
Example: M N T L A → “MNTLA” – invalid.

Another pattern: A in position 4, N in position 2, T in position 3 → _ N T A _.
We need letters 1 and 5 from remaining pool.
Example: C N T A U → “CNTAU” – invalid.
Example: U N T A M → “UNTAM” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 5, N in position 1, T in position 2 → N T _ _ A.
We need letters 3 and 4 from remaining pool.
Example: N T U M A → “NTUMA” – invalid.
Example: N T U D A → “NTUDA” – invalid.

Another pattern: A in position 4, N in position 3, T in position 2 → _ T N A _.
We need letters 1 and 5 from remaining pool.
Example: L T N A U → “LTNAU” – invalid.
Example: C T N A M → “CTNAM” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 5, N in position 3, T in position 2 → _ T N _ A.
We need letters 1 and 4 from remaining pool.
Example: U T N D A → “UTNDA” – invalid.
Example: C T N U A → “CTNUA” – invalid.

After scanning common 5-letter words that contain A, N, T and avoid all ruled-out letters, one valid candidate is:
- A in position 4, N in position 1, T in position 2 → N T _ A _.
We need a letter in position 3 and 5. A valid word is “NTULA” – but this is not recognized.

Wait, let’s try a different approach: use common remaining consonants and valid word patterns.
A valid word that fits all constraints is “UNTAN” – but N cannot be in 5 (from paint feedback), so invalid.

Another valid word: “ANTAL” – but A is repeated, and L is allowed.

But let’s check:
- A in position 2 → invalid (from paint feedback).
So “ANTAL” is invalid.

Another valid word: “TANAL” – but T cannot be in 1 (from thank feedback), so invalid.

Another valid word: “TUNNA” – but N cannot be in 5 (from paint feedback), so invalid.

Let’s try “TUNAM” – but M is allowed, and positions:
- T in 1 → invalid (from thank feedback).

Let’s try “TULAN” – but L is allowed, positions:
- T in 1 → invalid.

Let’s try “TUBAN” – but B is allowed, positions:
- T in 1 → invalid.

Let’s try “TUGAN” – but G is allowed, positions:
- T in 1 → invalid.

Let’s try “TULAP” – but P is excluded.

Let’s try “TULAS” – but S is excluded.

Let’s try “TULIA” – but I is excluded.
