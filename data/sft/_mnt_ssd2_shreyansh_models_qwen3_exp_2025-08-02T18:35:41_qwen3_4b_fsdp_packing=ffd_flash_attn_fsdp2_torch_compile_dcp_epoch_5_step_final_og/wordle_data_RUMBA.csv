1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these letters, I can form a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another good option would be ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first; R cannot be second.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is allowed because we’re moving it).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is allowed).

Actually, wait: in AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1,3,4,5. Similarly, A was in position 1 and got (-), so A could be in positions 2,3,4,5.

So “TRAIL” would place R in position 2, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so that’s invalid. I need to avoid R in position 2 and A in position 1.

Let me rethink. A good next word should:
- include A and R in new positions.
- introduce new common letters.
- avoid O, S, E.

A better candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (was position 2, feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is fine).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is fine).
- T, I, O are new letters. Wait, O was already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next candidate: “TRAIN”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems good. Let me check positions:
- R in position 1: allowed (feedback only said R is not in position 2).

From the two guesses we have:

- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): A and R
- Position constraints:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).
  – R cannot be in position 2 or 1 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).

So possible positions left for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions left for R: 3, 4, 5

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Must have A and R in allowed spots.
- Must avoid the banned letters.

A quick scan gives “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters.
- R is in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CRAMP is invalid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these letters, I can form a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another good option would be ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first; R cannot be second.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is allowed because we’re moving it).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is allowed).

Actually, wait: in AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1,3,4,5. Similarly, A was in position 1 and got (-), so A could be in positions 2,3,4,5.

So “TRAIL” would place R in position 2, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so that’s invalid. I need to avoid R in position 2 and A in position 1.

Let me rethink. A good next word should:
- include A and R in new positions.
- introduce new common letters.
- avoid O, S, E.

A better candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (was position 2, feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is fine).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is fine).
- T, I, O are new letters. Wait, O was already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next candidate: “TRAIN”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems good. Let me check positions:
- R in position 1: allowed (feedback only said R is not in position 2).
- A in position 2: allowed (feedback only said A is not in position 1).

This looks like a solid next guess.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): A and R
- Position constraints:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).
  – R cannot be in position 2 or 1 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).

So possible positions left for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions left for R: 3, 4, 5

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Must have A and R in allowed spots.
- Must avoid the banned letters.

A quick scan gives “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters.
- R is in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CRAMP is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but E is banned.

Next: “CARDS” – but S is banned.

Next: “CARGO” – O is banned.

Next: “CURVY”:
- C, U, V, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 – again banned.

Next: “RANCH” – N and H: N is banned.

Next: “DRAWS” – S is banned.

Next: “GRAVY”:
- G, V, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 1 – allowed (only banned in 2).
- A is in position 2 – allowed (only banned in 1 and 3).
- Uses no banned letters.

GRAVY looks good.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: G, R, A, V, Y – none are banned.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces G, V, Y – new common letters.

So GRAVY is a valid next guess.

- R: 4 or 5

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and R in positions 4 or 5.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N, G, V, Y).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, H, B, F, K

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- Must have A and R in positions 4 or 5.
- Must use only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ A R
- _ _ _ R A

Let’s list some candidates:
- C L A R A – but A is repeated and we don’t know if A can repeat.
- C L A R K – but K is allowed, but where is A?
- C L A R A is invalid because A would be in position 4 and 5, which is unlikely.
- C L A R K: A is in position 4, R is in position 5 – both allowed positions.
- C L A R K uses C, L, A, R, K – none are banned.
- C L A R K is a valid English word.

Another candidate: B L A R K – but B, L, A, R, K – all allowed.
But CLARK is more common.

Let’s choose CLARK.

Check:
- Letters: C, L, A, R, K – none are banned.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces C, L, K – new common letters.

From all four guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
3. GRAVY → G(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) Y(x)
4. CLARK → C(x) L(x) A(-) R(-) K(x)

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated):
O, S, E, T, I, N, G, V, Y, C, L, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
A and R

Position constraints:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, TRAIN, GRAVY, CLARK feedback).
  ⇒ A must be in position 5.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, TRAIN, GRAVY, CLARK feedback).
  ⇒ R must be in position 5.

But positions 5 cannot simultaneously hold both A and R. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, one of the letters must appear more than once in the word (double letter). The only letters we know are in the word are A and R, so the word must contain both A and R, and one of them must appear twice.

From the position constraints:
- A must be in position 5 (only remaining slot).
- R must also be in position 5 (only remaining slot).

This forces the word to be _ _ _ _ A with R in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by A. This is impossible unless the word has two letters in position 5, which is not allowed.

This suggests an earlier assumption might be incorrect. Rechecking:
- In CLARK, A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 4.
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5.

So R cannot be in position 5, but from earlier guesses:
- AROSE: R not in position 2
- TRAIN: R not in position 1
- GRAVY: R not in position 1
- CLARK: R not in position 5

Thus R can only be in positions 3 or 4.

Similarly, A:
- AROSE: A not in position 1
- TRAIN: A not in position 3
- GRAVY: A not in position 3
- CLARK: A not in position 4

So A can be in positions 2 or 5.

Now we know:
- A is in 2 or 5
- R is in 3 or 4

We need a word that:
- Contains both A and R in these allowed positions
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (remaining: D, F, H, M, P, U, B, etc.)

Possible patterns:
1. _ A _ R _
2. _ A R _
3. _ _ A R
4. _ R A _
5. R A _ _

Let's try pattern _ A _ R _ with allowed letters:
- Possible letters: D, F, H, M, P, U, B
Example: D A M P R – but R must be in position 4, so D A M P R is invalid (R in 5).
Wait, pattern _ A _ R _ would have R in 4, which is allowed.

Example: B A R D _ – but we need 5 letters, and R must be in 4, so B A D R _ – but we need A in 2 and R in 4.

Example: B A D R _ – but we need 5 letters, and the last letter must be allowed.

But we also know A must be in 2 or 5, and R in 3 or 4.

Let's try A in 2 and R in 4: _ A _ R _
Possible word: B A D R _ – but we need a 5-letter word ending with allowed letter.
But we have no info on last letter except it must be allowed.

Looking for real words:
- B A R D Y – but Y is banned.
- B A R D S – S is banned.
- B A R D O – O is banned.
- B A R D G – G is banned.
- B A R D _ – no valid word.

Next pattern: _ A R _ _
A in 2, R in 3: _ A R _ _
Possible word: B A R D _ – again no.

Next: R in 4, A in 5: _ _ _ A R
But R cannot be in 5 (from CLARK feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: R in 3, A in 5: _ _ R A _
But A cannot be in 5 (from CLARK feedback), so invalid.

Next: R in 4, A in 2: _ A _ R _
Possible word: D A M P R – but P and M are allowed, but R in 4 is allowed, and A in 2 is allowed.

But is DAMPR a word? Not common.

Next: B A R D _ – no.

Next: C is banned, so C is out.

Next: D A M P R – not a word.

Next: B A R D _ – no.

Next: B A R G _ – G banned.

Next: F A R M A – but A in 5 is allowed, R in 3 is allowed, but we have two A's. Possible.

But we have no info on double letters, so possible.

But let's think of common words:
- B A R F _ – no.
- B A R G _ – G banned.
- B A R D _ – no.
- B A R M _ – no.
- F A R M A – possible, but A at end is allowed, R in 3 is allowed.

But we have no info on double letters, so this might be risky.

Another pattern: R in 4, A in 2: _ A _ R _
Possible word: B A D R _ – no.

Next: D A M P R – not a word.

Next: B A N K A – N banned.

Next: B A R D _ – no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these letters, I can form a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another good option would be ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first; R cannot be second.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids O, S, E.

A good candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is allowed because we’re moving it).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is allowed).

Actually, wait: in AROSE, R was in position 2 and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1,3,4,5. Similarly, A was in position 1 and got (-), so A could be in positions 2,3,4,5.

So “TRAIL” would place R in position 2, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so that’s invalid. I need to avoid R in position 2 and A in position 1.

Let me rethink. A good next word should:
- include A and R in new positions.
- introduce new common letters.
- avoid O, S, E.

A better candidate is “RATIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (was position 2, feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is fine).
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1, feedback said A is not in position 1, so this is fine).
- T, I, O are new letters. Wait, O was already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next candidate: “TRAIN”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems good. Let me check positions:
- R in position 1: allowed (feedback only said R is not in position 2).
- A in position 2: allowed (feedback only said A is not in position 1).

This looks like a solid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

What we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): A and R
- Position constraints:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).
  – R cannot be in position 2 or 1 (from AROSE and TRAIN feedback).

So possible positions left for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions left for R: 3, 4, 5

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- Must have A and R in allowed spots.
- Must avoid the banned letters.

A quick scan gives “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters.
- R is in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So CRAMP is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but E is banned.

Next: “CARDS” – but S is banned.

Next: “CARGO” – O is banned.

Next: “CURVY”:
- C, U, V, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 – again banned.

Next: “RANCH” – N and H: N is banned.

Next: “DRAWS” – S is banned.

Next: “GRAVY”:
- G, V, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 1 – allowed (only banned in 2).
- A is in position 2 – allowed (only banned in 1 and 3).
- Uses no banned letters.

GRAVY looks good.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: G, R, A, V, Y – none are banned.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Introduces G, V, Y – new common letters.

So GRAVY is a valid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: GRAVY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
3. GRAVY → G(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) Y(x)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, G, V, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A and R
- Position constraints:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and TRAIN and GRAVY feedback).
  – R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE, TRAIN, and GRAVY feedback).

So possible positions left:
- A: 4 or 5
- R: 4 or 5

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and R in positions 4 or 5.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N, G, V, Y).
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: D, L, C, U, M, P, H, B, F, K

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- Must have A and R in positions 4 or 5.
- Must use only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ A R
- _ _ _ R A

Let’s list some candidates:
- C L A R A – but A is repeated and we don’t know if A can repeat.
- C L A R K – but K is allowed, but where is A?
- C L A R A is invalid because A would be in position 4 and 5, which is unlikely.
- C L A R K: A is in position 4, R is in position 5 – both allowed positions.
- C L A R K uses C, L, A, R, K – none are banned.
- C L A R K is a valid English word.

Another candidate: B L A R K – but B, L, A, R, K – all allowed.
But CLARK is more common.

Let’s choose CLARK.

Check:
- Letters: C, L, A, R, K – none are banned.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces C, L, K – new common letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. \n\nLooking at these letters, I can form a word like ""AROSE"" which contains 5 of the most common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. \n\nAnother good option would be ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice because it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.\n- S(x) → S is NOT the word.\n- E(x) → E is NOT the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.\n- A cannot be first; R cannot be second.\n\nTo maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that:\n1.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word:  
O, S, E, T, I, N, G, V, Y, C, L, K  

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
A and R  

Position constraints:  
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 5.  

This is impossible unless A and R both occupy position 5, which is not allowed in a 5-letter word.  
Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word ends in “AR”.

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ A R  
and must use only letters not yet ruled out:  
Allowed letters: B, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z  

Looking for 5-letter English words ending in “AR” from these letters:  
- B D A R → “BDAR” – not a word  
- F U A R → “FUAR” – not a word  
- M A R – only 3 letters  
- P A R – only 3 letters  
- H A R – only 3 letters  
- D A R – only 3 letters  

Actually, the only common English 5-letter word ending in “AR” that uses allowed letters is “DAR” + something.  
But none of the remaining letters form a valid word ending in “AR”.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

From the feedback:
- A(-) in every guess means A is in the word but not in the guessed position.
- R(-) in every guess means R is in the word but not in the guessed position.

Let’s list all positions ruled out so far for A and R:

Positions ruled out for A:
1 (AROSE), 2 (TRAIN), 3 (GRAVY), 4 (CLARK) → must be 5.

Positions ruled out for R:
1 (AROSE), 2 (TRAIN), 3 (GRAVY), 1 (CLARK) → must be 5.

This forces both A and R into position 5, which is impossible.

This contradiction implies we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
  – A is in word but not in position 1.
  – R is in word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
  – R is in word but not in position 2 (already known).
  – A is in word but not in position 3.

Guess 3: GRAVY → G(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) Y(x)
  – R is in word but not in position 1.
  – A is in word but not in position 3 (already known).

Guess 4: CLARK → C(x) L(x) A(-) R(-) K(x)
  – A is in word but not in position 4.
  – R is in word but not in position 4.

So the positions ruled out for A:
1 (from AROSE), 3 (from TRAIN), 4 (from CLARK) → A must be in 2 or 5.

Positions ruled out for R:
2 (from AROSE), 1 (from GRAVY), 4 (from CLARK) → R must be in 3 or 5.

We need a word that contains both A and R with:
- A in 2 or 5
- R in 3 or 5

Possible patterns:
- _ A R _ _ (A in 2, R in 3)
- _ _ R _ A (R in 3, A in 5)
- _ _ _ R A (R in 4, but 4 is ruled out for R)
- etc.

Let’s list valid patterns:
1. _ A R _ _  (A in 2, R in 3)
2. _ _ R _ A  (R in 3, A in 5)

We need to fill the blanks with letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z.

For pattern 1: _ A R _ _
   First letter: B, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

   Example: B A R D S – but S is banned.

   Valid word: B A R M – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R P – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R U – not a word.
   Valid word: D A R K – K is banned.
   Valid word: F A R M – M is allowed, but F A R M is 4 letters.
   Valid word: H A R D – D is allowed, but H A R D is 4 letters.
   Valid word: M A R V – V is banned.
   Valid word: P A R T – T is banned.
   Valid word: B A R F – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R G – G banned.

   Valid word: B A R F – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R M – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R P – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R U – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R V – V banned.
   Valid word: B A R W – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R X – not a word.
   Valid word: B A R Z – not a word.
   It seems no valid 5-letter word fits _ A R _ _.

For pattern 2: _ _ R _ A  (R in 3, A in 5)
   First letter: B, D, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z
   Second letter: same set
   Fourth letter: same set
   Example: B B R D A – not a word.
   Valid word: B R U N A – N is banned.
   Valid word: B R U C A – C is banned.
   Valid word: B R U D A – not a word.
   Valid word: B R U M A – M is allowed, but B R U M A is not a word.
   Valid word: B R U F A – not a word.
   Valid word: D R U M A – not a word.
   Valid word: F R U N A – N banned.
   Valid word: H U R R A – H U R R A is a word (exclamation), but R is repeated and we don’t know if letters can repeat.
   Valid word: M U R D A – not a word.
   Valid word: P U R S A – S banned.
   Valid word: B U R N A – N banned.
   Valid word: B U R R A – B U R R A is a word (slang for ""burra"", but may not be valid).
   Valid word: F U R R A – not a word.
   Valid word: H U R R A – H U R R A is valid.
   H U R R A uses H, U, R, R, A – all allowed letters (R can repeat, no info against it).

Thus, the only valid word fitting the constraints is HURRA.

Let’s verify:
- H, U, R, R, A – none are in the banned list.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces new letters H and U.

Therefore, the next guess should be HURRA.
