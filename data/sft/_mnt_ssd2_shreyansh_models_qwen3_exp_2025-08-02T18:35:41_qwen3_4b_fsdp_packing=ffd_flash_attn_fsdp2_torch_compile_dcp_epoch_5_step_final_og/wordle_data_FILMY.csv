### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Therefore, my first guess is ""AROSE"".

So far we have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): I and L (each appears exactly once)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and L).
3. Places I and L in positions different from positions 3, 4, 5 (since they were marked “-” in those positions in previous guesses).

Let’s list possible positions for I and L:
- I cannot be in position 3 (from “child”) or 4 (from “until”) – so I can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- L cannot be in position 4 (from “until”) or 5 (from “child”) – so L can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- If we place I in position 1, L could be in 2 or 3.
- If we place I in position 2, L could be in 1 or 3.
- If we place I in position 5, L could be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try “FLIMY” – but this uses M and Y, which are allowed, but let’s check:
- F, L, I, M, Y – contains both I and L, uses only allowed letters, and positions:
  – I is in position 3 (forbidden), so this is invalid.

Next, try “BLIMP” – but this uses B, L, I, M, P. I is in position 3 (forbidden).

Next, try “FLICK” – but C is forbidden.

Try “MILKY” – K and Y are allowed, positions:

Check letters: M, I, L, K, Y – none are in the forbidden list. Positions:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, H, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): I and L (each appears exactly once)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and L).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

Therefore, my first guess is ""AROSE"".

All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters.  
Now I need a fresh set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y.  
A balanced word that uses five distinct, still-possible letters is “UNTIL”.  
It contains U, N, T, I, L – all of which are still in play and give good coverage.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: I and L (each appears once in the word, but not in the positions guessed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L exactly once each.
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.
3. Places I and L in positions different from positions 4 and 5 respectively (since in “until” they were marked “-”).

Remaining common letters we can still use: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Let’s try to place I and L in new positions while filling the rest with allowed letters.  
One good candidate is “CHILD”:
- C, H, I, L, D – all letters are still allowed.
- I is now in position 3 (was 4 before) and L is now in position 4 (was 5 before), satisfying the “wrong position” constraint.

Let’s check: C, H, I, L, D – none of the forbidden letters appear, and it contains both I and L.

Let’s list possible positions for I and L:

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- If we place I in position 1, L could be in 2 or 3.
- If we place I in position 2, L could be in 1 or 3.
- If we place I in position 5, L could be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try “FLIMY” – but this uses M and Y, which are allowed, but let’s check:
- F, L, I, M, Y – contains both I and L, uses only allowed letters, and positions:
  – I is in position 3 (forbidden), so this is invalid.

From the latest feedback:

- M is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1, so M cannot be in position 1).

- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K is NOT in the word.

- Position 1: cannot be M (from feedback), so possible letters: B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Position 4: can be any of the remaining letters, but must not repeat any already used letters.

We also know that M must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback), but it cannot be in position 1. The only remaining possible position for M is position 4.
