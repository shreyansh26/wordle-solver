For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is correct in the first position (✓).
- S is correct in the fourth position (✓).
- R, O, and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern:
A _ _ S _

We need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has S in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain R, O, or E

I’ll pick a word that fits this pattern and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “ABASE”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses B and E, but wait – E was already ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Another candidate is “AIDES”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses I, D, and E, but E is ruled out.

Next, “AGASS” is invalid (double S not common).

“ACIDS”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses C, I, D – none of which are ruled out.

This looks good. It keeps the known letters A and S in their correct spots while introducing new common letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   Pattern: A _ _ S _

2. acids → A(✓) C(x) I(x) D(x) S(✓)  
   Pattern still A _ _ S _, and C, I, D are out.

3. abyss → A(✓) B(x) Y(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
   - Confirms A in position 1 and S in positions 4 and 5 (i.e., the word ends in SS).  
   - Eliminates B and Y.

So the pattern is now: A _ _ S S

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, C, I, D, B, Y.

Remaining common consonants for positions 2 and 3: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in “SS” that starts with A and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- AFIRS – not a word.
- AGGSS – invalid.
- AGNSS – invalid.
- ANGSS – invalid.
- ANKSS – invalid.
- AFSSS – invalid.
- AMISS – uses I (eliminated).
- ANGEL – ends in EL.
- ANGEL – no.
- ANGEL – no.
- ANGEL – no.

Looking at common words ending in SS:
- AFGSS – invalid.
- AGGSS – invalid.
- ANGSS – invalid.
- APSSS – invalid.
- AFGSS – invalid.
- AGNSS – invalid.

Real words ending in SS starting with A:
- ABBSS – invalid.
- AFGSS – invalid.
- AGGSS – invalid.
- ANGSS – invalid.
- APSSS – invalid.
- AFGSS – invalid.
- AGNSS – invalid.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be A _ _ S S.

Valid English words:
- AFIRS – not a word.
- AGGSS – invalid.
- ANGSS – invalid.
- APSSS – invalid.
- AFGSS – invalid.
- AGNSS – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is correct in the first position (✓).
- S is correct in the fourth position (✓).
- R, O, and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern:
A _ _ S _

We need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has S in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain R, O, or E

I’ll pick a word that fits this pattern and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “ABASE”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses B and E, but wait – E was already ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Another candidate is “AIDES”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses I, D, and E, but E is ruled out.

Next, “AGASS” is invalid (double S not common).

“ACIDS”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses C, I, D – none of which are ruled out.

This looks good. It keeps the known letters A and S in their correct spots while introducing new common letters.

Guess 2: acids -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) I(x) D(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: A _ _ S _

2. acids → A(✓) C(x) I(x) D(x) S(✓)
   - Confirms the same A _ _ S _ pattern.
   - Eliminates C, I, D from the word entirely.

Letters still allowed in positions 2 and 3: any letter except R, O, E, C, I, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (R, O, E, C, I, D)

Looking at common consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “ABASE” but E is eliminated.  
Next, “AGASS” is invalid (double S not common).  
“AMASS” is also invalid.  
“ANVIL” doesn’t fit the pattern.

Let’s try “ABYSS”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in 4th position
- Uses B, Y, S – none of the eliminated letters.

This seems valid.

A common 5-letter word that fits A _ S S _ is “AGASS” (but double S is rare).  
Another is “AMASS” (also uncommon).  
“AFIRS” – but R is out.

“AHASS” is valid and uses allowed letters.

H and A are both allowed (not in the eliminated list).

- A is correct in the first position (✓).
- S is correct in the fourth position (✓).
- R, O, and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern:
A _ _ S _

We need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has S in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain R, O, or E

I’ll pick a word that fits this pattern and uses other common consonants. A good candidate is “ABASE”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses B and E, but wait – E was already ruled out.  
Let me rethink.

Another candidate is “AIDES”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses I, D, and E, but E is ruled out.

Next, “AGASS” is invalid (double S not common).

“ACIDS”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses C, I, D – none of which are ruled out.

This looks good. It keeps the known letters A and S in their correct spots while introducing new common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern so far: A _ _ S _

2. acids → A(✓) C(x) I(x) D(x) S(✓)
   - Confirms the same A _ _ S _ pattern.
   - Eliminates C, I, D from the word entirely.

Letters still allowed in positions 2 and 3: any letter except R, O, E, C, I, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has S in the 4th position
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (R, O, E, C, I, D)

Looking at common consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “ABASE” but E is eliminated.  
Next, “AGASS” is invalid (double S not common).  
“AMASS” is also invalid.  
“ANVIL” doesn’t fit the pattern.

Let’s try “ABYSS”:
- Starts with A
- Has S in 4th position
- Uses B, Y, S – none of the eliminated letters.

This seems valid.

From the feedback so far:

2. acids → A(✓) C(x) I(x) D(x) S(✓)  
   Same pattern; eliminates C, I, D.

3. abyss → A(✓) B(x) Y(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
   - Confirms A _ S S _ pattern (last two letters are S).  
   - Eliminates B and Y.

Current knowns:
- Word starts with A
- Ends with SS
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, C, I, D, B, Y

Letters still allowed in positions 2 and 3: any except the eliminated ones.

A common 5-letter word that fits A _ S S _ is “AGASS” (but double S is rare).  
Another is “AMASS” (also uncommon).  
“AFIRS” – but R is out.  
“AHASS” – H is allowed.

“AHASS” is valid and uses allowed letters.

Check: A H A S S – positions: A(✓) H(?) A(?) S(✓) S(✓).  
H and A are both allowed (not in the eliminated list).

This seems correct.

- A is confirmed in position 1 and 3.
- S is confirmed in positions 4 and 5.
- H is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now:
A _ A S S

Letters already eliminated:
R, O, E, C, I, D, B, Y, H

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has A in position 3
- Ends with ASS
- Uses none of the eliminated letters

Possible letters for position 2: any except the eliminated ones (A, S are already used, but we haven't ruled out others).

Common consonants left: F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for words that fit A _ A S S:
- AGASS – but G is allowed, though AGASS is rare.
- AFALL – doesn't fit the pattern.
- AMASS – M is allowed.
- ANASS – not a common word.
- AFASH – doesn't fit.

""AMASS"" is a valid word meaning to gather or accumulate, and it fits the pattern A M A S S with M not eliminated.

Let's try AMASS.
