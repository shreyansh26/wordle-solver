### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters and includes both vowels and consonants. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because it includes more vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, F, L, C

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
- E is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (E ✓ in position 3).  
- K is in the word but not in position 5 (K – in position 5).

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _
and must contain K somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known E and K.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E fixed at position 3.
- K somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- All other letters must be from the remaining unused set.

Candidate words:
- B E D K _  → “BEDKY” not valid.  
- K E _ _ _  → “KEY_ _” but we need 5 letters and K in position 1: “KEY” is 3 letters.  
- _ K E _ _  → “DK” is invalid.  
- _ _ E K _  → “_ _ E K _” with remaining letters.  
- _ K E _ _  → “B K E _ _” invalid.  

Valid English words fitting _ _ E K _ or _ K E _ _ with remaining letters:
- “BEDEK” – not an English word.  
- “PEEKY” – has P, E, E, K, Y. But E repeats and we don’t know if P is allowed.  
- “MEETK” – invalid.  
- “HEEKY” – invalid.  
- “BEERY” – no K.  
- “PEEKY” – as above.  
- “WEEDY” – no K.  
- “YEDEK” – invalid.  

The only valid English word that fits is “PEEKY”:
- P, E, E, K, Y.  
- E is in position 3 (✓).  
- K is in position 4 (allowed).  
- P and Y are new letters.  
- However, it repeats E, which we don’t know about yet.  

But we have no information that E is not repeated, so “PEEKY” is possible.  

Another candidate: “BEDEK” – not valid.  
“DEKEY” – not valid.  
“KEEPS” – S eliminated.  
“PEKIN” – N eliminated.  

Next best: “PEEKY” despite the double E, because it uses P and Y and places K correctly.  

But wait – let’s check if there’s a word with distinct letters.  
We have: _ _ E _ _ with K in 1, 2, or 4.  
Possible words:  
- “KEY” + 2 letters – but 5 letters.  
- “BEDEK” invalid.  
- “DEKEY” invalid.  
- “PEEKY” is the only valid word with K in 4th position.  

Thus, the best next guess is “PEEKY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters and includes both vowels and consonants. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because it includes more vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- The word has 5 distinct letters (no repeats so far).

I want a new word that:
1. Contains E (but not in position 5).
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “UNTIE”:
- Uses E (in position 4, which is allowed).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I.
- Does not use A, R, O, S.

Another candidate is “ELITE” but it repeats E, which is inefficient. “UNTIE” seems better.

I’ll go with UNTIE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
2. The letter E is in the word but in the wrong positions:  
   - In AROSE it was in position 5 → E is not in position 5.  
   - In UNTIE it was in position 5 again → E is not in position 5 (redundant).  
   So E must be in positions 1-4.

3. The word has 5 distinct letters (no repeats so far).

Remaining common letters (excluding the 8 already eliminated):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to test several consonants and the remaining vowels (Y can act as vowel).  
A good strategy is to pick a word that uses 3-4 new common letters plus the known E.

Candidate words:
- “BLEED” – but repeats E, so inefficient.  
- “CHEEP” – repeats E, inefficient.  
- “MELON” – uses M, L, O, N, but O and N are already eliminated.  
- “GELID” – uses G, L, D; O is eliminated.  
- “FLECK” – uses F, L, C, K; E is present.  
- “ELBOW” – uses L, B, W; E is present.  
- “ELDER” – repeats E and D, R eliminated.  
- “ELECT” – repeats E and C, T eliminated.  

The cleanest choice is “FLECK”:
- Contains E (position 2).  
- Uses new letters F, L, C, K.  
- None of the eliminated letters appear.  
- All letters are distinct.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (x): A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, F, L, C, P  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions (✓):  
   - Position 2: E  
   - Position 3: E  
   - Position 4: K  
   - Position 5: Y  

So the word is: _ E E K Y  

The only letter left is position 1.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, G, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not listed above).  

Valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern ?EEKY:  
- BEEKY – not a standard word.  
- DEEKY – not standard.  
- GEEKY – valid word.  
- HEEKY – not standard.

Thus, the only valid word is GEEKY.
