### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ _ A _ _.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere else in the word.

Since S, L, T are out, and we know A is fixed in the 3rd spot, I need a new word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. Avoids S, L, T entirely.

Good candidates would use other common letters. Let me think of a word that fits: ""CRANE"" comes to mind – it has A in position 3, E in position 5, and uses C, R, N which are common and haven't been ruled out. Let me check:
- C: not yet tested

- A: matches ✓
- N: not yet tested
- E: matches presence, just not position 5 (but that's okay since we only know it's not in position 5 from SLATE).

- C is position 4 (-) – allowed.
- E is position 2 (-) – allowed.
- Uses P, E, A, C, H – none eliminated except H is new, which is fine.

PEACH seems valid.

Let me check:
- P: new
- E: in word but not position 5 (it's in 2) – okay.
- A: position 3 ✓
- C: in word but not position 1 (it's in 4) – okay.
- H: new

No eliminated letters used. PEACH looks good.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (very common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ _ A _ _.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere else in the word.\n\nSince S, L, T are out, and we know A is fixed in the 3rd spot, I need a new word that:\n1.

From the feedback on PEACH:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- C(✓) → C is in the word and in position 4.
- H(✓) → H is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word is now determined to be:
_ E A C H

The only letter left is the first one. We know from earlier feedback that S, L, T, R, N, P are not in the word. The remaining common letters that fit are B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ""EACH"":
- BEACH
- DEACH (not a valid word)
- FEACH (not valid)
- GEACH (not valid)
- MEACH (not valid)
- WEACH (not valid)

The only valid word is ""BEACH"". Let's verify:
B: not yet eliminated.
E, A, C, H: positions are all correct.
No eliminated letters are used.

Therefore, the secret word must be BEACH.
