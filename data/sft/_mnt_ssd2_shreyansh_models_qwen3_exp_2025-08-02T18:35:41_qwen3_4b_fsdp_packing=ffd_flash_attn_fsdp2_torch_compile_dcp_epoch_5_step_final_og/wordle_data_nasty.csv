For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly
- Two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
- These letters are spread across different positions, giving good coverage for the first guess

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Has S somewhere (positions 1,2,3,5).
3. Does not contain R, O, or E.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates might be:
- STAND (but has N and D, and E is excluded, but STAND has A and S)
- SPASM (but has two S's and P, but is valid)
- SLASH (but has H)
- STASH (but has H)
- SASSY (but has Y)
- SAINT (but has I and N, T)
- SAGGY (but has G and Y)
- SAUCY (but has U, C, Y)

I'll choose STAND because:
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S can't be in position 4)
- A is in position 2 (allowed since A can't be in position 1)
- T, N are new letters to test
- No R, O, or E

However, STAND has N and D which are new letters, but I want to test more vowels. Another option is SAINT:
- S in position 1
- A in position 2
- I is a new vowel
- N and T are new consonants

But SAINT has I which is a new vowel. Between STAND and SAINT, I'll go with SAINT as it tests a new vowel (I) and new consonants (N, T).

Wait, but the feedback shows A(-) meaning A is in the word but not in position 1, and S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 2-5 for A and 1,2,3,5 for S.

SAINT:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (new)
- N in position 4 (new)
- T in position 5 (new)

This seems good as it tests new letters while keeping the known A and S in possible positions.

Another option is SADLY:
- S in position 1
- A in position 2
- D, L, Y are new
But Y is less common.

I think SAINT is better as it introduces new vowels and consonants.

But let me double-check: the word must not contain R, O, E. SAINT has none of these.

Yes, SAINT seems like a strong second guess.
