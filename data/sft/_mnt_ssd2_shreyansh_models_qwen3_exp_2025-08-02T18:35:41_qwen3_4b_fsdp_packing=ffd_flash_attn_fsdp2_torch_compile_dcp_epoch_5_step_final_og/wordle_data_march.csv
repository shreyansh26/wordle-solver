For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and R (and places them in new positions)
- Avoids O, S, E
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Good candidates:
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – uses A and R, avoids forbidden letters
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – same idea
- GRANT (G, R, A, N, T)

I’ll choose TRAIN because it places A in position 3 and R in position 2, testing new spots while adding T, I, N.

From both guesses we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, R
- From Guess 1: A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2
- From Guess 2: R is not in position 2 (confirmed), A is not in position 3

So the word:
- Contains both A and R exactly once each
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- R cannot be in position 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and R
- Avoids all forbidden letters
- Places A somewhere other than 1 or 3
- Places R somewhere other than 2

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: A (already used), U (only other common vowel left)

Let’s look for words that fit:
- A must be in 2, 4, or 5
- R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Possible patterns:
- A in 2: _ A _ _ _
- A in 4: _ _ _ A _
- A in 5: _ _ _ _ A

And R must go in allowed positions.

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies all this. A good candidate is ""CURLY"":
- C, U, R, L, Y
- Contains R and A? No, it doesn’t contain A, so that’s bad.

Next candidate: ""CRAZY"":
- C, R, A, Z, Y
- Contains A and R
- A is in position 3 → but A cannot be in 3 → invalid

Next: ""CRAMP"":
- C, R, A, M, P
- A in 3 → invalid

Next: ""GRAMP"":
- G, R, A, M, P
- A in 3 → invalid

Next: ""CRANK"":
- C, R, A, N, K → but N is forbidden → invalid

Next: ""GRAVY"":
- G, R, A, V, Y
- A in 3 → invalid

Next: ""DRAMA"":
- D, R, A, M, A → has two A’s → invalid

Next: ""ARGHY"":
- A, R, G, H, Y
- A in 1 → forbidden
- R in 2 → forbidden

Next: ""RAGGY"":
- R in 1, A in 2 → valid positions
- Contains R and A
- No forbidden letters
- Other letters: G, G, Y (G is allowed, Y is allowed)

But ""RAGGY"" has two G’s → is it a valid word? Yes, it's slang for ""ragged"".

However, to maximize information, let’s prefer words with distinct letters. So ""RAGGY"" might not be ideal.

Next candidate: ""GRAPE"":
- G, R, A, P, E → E is forbidden → invalid

Next: ""GRASP"":
- G, R, A, S, P → S is forbidden → invalid

Next: ""GRAND"":
- G, R, A, N, D → N is forbidden → invalid

Next: ""GRAFT"":

Next: ""GRAVY"" already considered.

Next: ""ARGON"":

Next: ""ARROW"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and R (and places them in new positions)
- Avoids O, S, E
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Good candidates:
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – uses A and R, avoids forbidden letters
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – same idea
- GRANT (G, R, A, N, T)

I’ll choose TRAIN because it places A in position 3 and R in position 2, testing new spots while adding T, I, N.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters present: A, R
- Letters absent: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3
- Positions ruled out for R: 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, N
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3
- Places R somewhere other than position 2

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible remaining vowels: A (already used), U (only other common vowel left)

Let’s list some candidate words:
- BARF (but has B and F, but is 4 letters)
- CRANK (but N is ruled out)
- GRAMP (but P is allowed, but M is allowed)
- GRASP (but S is ruled out)
- LARK (4 letters)
- RAP (3 letters)
- CRAMP (but P is allowed, M is allowed, C is allowed)

Wait, we need 5 letters. Let’s think systematically:
We need 5 letters, must include A and R, cannot include O, S, E, T, I, N.

Possible letters left: A, R, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and R in positions where they are allowed:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Let’s try to construct words:
- Position 1: can be R, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 2: can be A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: can be R, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: can be A, R, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: can be A, R, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit:
- CARDS (but D is allowed, S is ruled out)
- CRAMP (C, R, A, M, P) – but P is allowed, M is allowed
- GRAMP (G, R, A, M, P) – but P is allowed, M is allowed
- BRAGS (but S is ruled out)
- DRANK (but N is ruled out)
- PRANK (but N is ruled out)
- CRANK (but N is ruled out)
- GRAND (but N is ruled out)
- GRASP (but S is ruled out)
- CRISP (but S is ruled out)
- CRAMP seems valid: C, R, A, M, P – none of the forbidden letters
- Check positions:
  - R is in position 2 – but R cannot be in position 2 (from TRAIN feedback)
  - So CRAMP is invalid because R is in position 2

Let’s try other options:
- BARF (4 letters)
- FARM (but M is allowed, but 4 letters)
- FRANK (but N is ruled out)
- GRAM (but 4 letters)
- CRAD (but 4 letters)
- CRAM (but 4 letters)
- CRAMP is invalid because R is in position 2

Let’s try:
- RAMP (but 4 letters)
- ARM (but 3 letters)
- CARGO (but O is ruled out)
- CARV (but 4 letters)
- CARVY (but Y is allowed, but 5 letters)
- CARVY – but is this a valid word? ""carvy"" is not standard

Let’s try:
- BARVY (but B is allowed, A is allowed, R is allowed, V is allowed, Y is allowed)
- BARVY – but is this a valid word? Not standard

Let’s try:
- FRUMP (F, R, U, M, P)
  - F, R, U, M, P – none are forbidden
  - Check positions:
    - A is not in the word, but we need A – so FRUMP is invalid

We must include A and R. Let’s try:
- BARMS (but S is ruled out)
- BARMS – invalid

Let’s try:
- ARMOR (but O is ruled out)
- ARMOR – invalid

Let’s try:
- ARMAD (but D is allowed, but ARMAD is 5 letters)
  - A, R, M, A, D – but A is repeated, and positions:
    - A in position 1 – but A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE feedback)
    - So ARMAD is invalid

Let’s try:
- ARMAD – invalid for same reason

Let’s try:
- RAPID (but I is ruled out)
- RAPID – invalid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and R (and places them in new positions)
- Avoids O, S, E
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Good candidates:
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – uses A and R, avoids forbidden letters
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – same idea
- GRANT (G, R, A, N, T)

I’ll choose TRAIN because it places A in position 3 and R in position 2, testing new spots while adding T, I, N.

The feedback so far tells me:
- A and R are both in the word but not in their current positions.
- O, S, E, T, I, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the word must contain A and R, and none of the letters O, S, E, T, I, N.  
I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
3. Places A and R in new positions (since they were marked “-” in previous guesses).

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: A (already known), U, Y (sometimes)

Since A and R must appear, and we want to test new positions for them, let’s try a word that:
- Has A in a new spot (not 1st or 3rd).
- Has R in a new spot (not 2nd).
- Uses other common consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “CARDS”:
- C, D, S are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 4 (new position).
- S is actually ruled out, so this won’t work.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but E is ruled out.

Next: “CURLY” – but U and Y are allowed, and we can test positions.

But we must avoid S, E, T, I, N, O.  
Let’s pick “CURLY”:
- C, U, L, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (was in position 2 in TRAIN, so this would re-test R in position 2, which we already know is wrong).

Better: “FURRY” – but double R might not be helpful.

Better: “BRAID” – but I and D, but I is ruled out.

Better: “CURVY” – uses C, U, V, Y, and R in position 3 (new), A not present.

We must include A and R.  
Let’s try “CURVA” – but A is in position 5 (new), R in position 3 (new), and C, U, V are new letters.  
This satisfies all constraints.

So I’ll guess CURVA.

- R is in position 4 (new position).
- S is actually ruled out, so this won’t work.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but E is ruled out.

Next: “CURLY” – but U and Y are allowed, and we can test positions.

But we must avoid S, E, T, I, N, O.  
Let’s pick “CURLY”:
- C, U, L, Y are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (was in position 2 in TRAIN, so this would re-test R in position 2, which we already know is wrong).

Better: “FURRY” – but double R might not be helpful.

Better: “BRAID” – but I and D, but I is ruled out.

Better: “CURVY” – uses C, U, V, Y, and R in position 3 (new), A not present.

We must include A and R.  
Let’s try “CURVA” – but A is in position 5 (new), R in position 3 (new), and C, U, V are new letters.  
This satisfies all constraints.

So I’ll guess CURVA.

From the new feedback on CURVA:
- C(-) → C is in the word but not in position 1
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word
- R(✓) → R is in position 3 (correct)
- V(x) → V is NOT in the word
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 5

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, C
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, U, V
- R is fixed in position 3.
- A must appear somewhere other than positions 1, 3, 5.
- C must appear somewhere other than position 1.

Remaining possible positions for A: 2 or 4  
Remaining possible positions for C: 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is open)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3
- Has A in position 2 or 4
- Has C somewhere else
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no O, S, E, T, I, N, U, V)

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z plus R (already placed)

Let’s try A in position 2 and C in position 4:
- Pattern: _ A R C _
- We need a first and fifth letter from remaining allowed letters.

Possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z
Possible fifth letters: same set, but must form a valid word.

Looking for common words fitting _ A R C _:
- B: BARCS? Not a word.
- D: DARC? Not 5 letters.
- F: FARC? Not valid.
- G: GARC? Not valid.
- H: HARC? Not valid.
- L: LARC? Not valid.
- M: MARCH? 5 letters, but H is allowed, and C is in position 4. MARCH fits: M A R C H
  - Letters: M, A, R, C, H – all allowed
  - R in position 3 ✓
  - A in position 2 ✓
  - C in position 4 ✓
  - No disallowed letters ✓

So MARCH seems like a good next guess.
