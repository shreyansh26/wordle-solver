### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word that contains common letters in English and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O exists somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains O somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- Does not contain A, S, or E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Good next candidates should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Place O in a different position
3. Introduce new common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.)
4. Avoid A, S, E

A strong choice is ""FRONT"":
- F is a new consonant
- R stays in position 2

- N and T are common consonants we haven't tested

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - R is locked in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - Letters A, S, E are absent.

2. FRONT → F(-) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - R is still locked in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again) and also not in position 3 again (same spot), so we still need to place O elsewhere.
   - F is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1, so O is not 1).
   - N and T are absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain: O (not in positions 2,3) and F (not in position 1)
- Must NOT contain: A, S, E, N, T
- Available letters so far: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y (plus O and F)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Has O in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Has F somewhere except position 1.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try placing O in position 1: O R _ _ _
Then F must go in positions 3,4, or 5.
Good consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

A common word that fits: ORBIT
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (locked)
- B, I, T – but T is already excluded (from FRONT feedback), so ORBIT is invalid.

Next try: ORFED – but E is excluded.

Next: ORFIC – I is allowed, C is allowed, but is ORFIC a valid word? It’s obscure.

Better: PROUD
- P, R, O, U, D
- R in position 2 (good)
- O in position 3 – but O can’t be in position 3 (from AROSE feedback), so PROUD is invalid.

Next: GROVY – but Y is allowed, V is allowed, but is GROVY a word? No.

Next: CROON – N is excluded, so no.

Next: BROKE – E is excluded, so no.

Next: FROCK
- F in position 1 – but F can’t be in position 1 (from FRONT feedback), so no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word that contains common letters in English and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O exists somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains O somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- Does not contain A, S, or E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Good next candidates should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Place O in a different position
3. Introduce new common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.)
4. Avoid A, S, E

A strong choice is ""FRONT"":
- F is a new consonant
- R stays in position 2
- O moves to position 3
- N and T are common consonants we haven't tested
- No A, S, or E

- Letter F is in the word but not in position 1

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word that contains common letters in English and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O exists somewhere else
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains O somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- Does not contain A, S, or E
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Good next candidates should:
1. Keep R in position 2
2. Place O in a different position
3. Introduce new common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.)
4. Avoid A, S, E

A strong choice is ""FRONT"":
- F is a new consonant
- R stays in position 2
- O moves to position 3
- N and T are common consonants we haven't tested
- No A, S, or E
