### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains O and S.\n- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n- O is not in position 3, and S is not in position 4.\n\nTo maximize information, I should pick a word that:\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – O and S are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
   – A, R, E are out.

2. SOILS → S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) S(✓)
   – O is fixed in position 2.
   – S is fixed in position 5.
   – I and L are out.

3. BONDS → B(x) O(✓) N(x) D(x) S(✓)
   – Confirms O in position 2 and S in position 5.
   – B, N, D are out.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: O (pos 2), S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, E, I, L, B, N, D

Remaining unused common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ?O??S that uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- COOTS – but T is allowed, but O is repeated (already known), and T is allowed. However, O is in position 2 already, and COOTS has O in positions 2 and 3. But we already know O is in position 2 only; there’s no info against another O elsewhere. But COOTS uses C, O, O, T, S. O is allowed to appear more than once. However, we have no evidence for or against a second O, so this is possible.

- FOCUS – but U is allowed, C is allowed. Pattern: F O C U S. This fits _O??S.

- GLOSS – but L is out.

- HOCUS – H, O, C, U, S. This fits.

- MOCUS – M, O, C, U, S. Also fits.

- POCUS – P, O, C, U, S. Also fits.

- TOCUS – T, O, C, U, S. Also fits.

Among these, let’s pick one that uses new letters. FOCUS introduces F, C, U. This seems good.

Check FOCUS:
- F: new letter.
- O: position 2 ✓
- C: new letter.
- U: new letter.
- S: position 5 ✓

No letters used are ruled out. This seems optimal.
