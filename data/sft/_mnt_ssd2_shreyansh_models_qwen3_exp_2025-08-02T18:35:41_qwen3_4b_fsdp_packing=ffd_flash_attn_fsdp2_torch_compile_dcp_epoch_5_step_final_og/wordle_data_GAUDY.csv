For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these most common letters and can quickly tell me which vowels and consonants are present. However, since we're dealing with a 5-letter word, I should make sure it's a valid word. ""AROSE"" is valid, but let's consider ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" as options.

Another good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, E is out, O is out).

I'll look for a word with A in positions 2-5 and use other common letters. A word like ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and uses P, L, I, D. However, I need to check if it avoids R, O, S, E - yes, it does. But ""PLAID"" has D which is less common.

A better choice might be ""CHALK"":
- A in position 3 (not first).
- Letters: C, H, A, L, K. None of these are R, O, S, E.
- Common letters C, H, L, K.

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

   - A is still “in the word but wrong position” (so not in position 3 either).
   - C, H, L, K are absent.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Letters still allowed: all others except R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K.
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels: I, U (A already known).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me try to construct a word with A in position 2:
- B A _ _ _ → “BADLY” but L and Y are allowed? L is ruled out (from CHALK feedback). So “BADLY” is invalid (L is out).
- B A _ _ _ → “BAMBO” – but O is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BANDS” – S is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAPED” – E is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAKED” – E and K are out.

A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAIN” – R and I, N. R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLAID” – L and D, I. L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAND” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “CLAMP” – C is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLAME” – E is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BLUNT” – L and U, N, T. L is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRUNT” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “DRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

Looking for a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters.

A in position 2: “BADLY” (L out), “BAMBO” (O out), “BANDS” (S out), “BAPED” (E out), “BAKED” (E, K out) – none work.

A in position 4: “BRAIN” (R out), “GRAIN” (R out), “PLAID” (L out), “BLAND” (L out), “BRAND” (R out), “CLAMP” (C out), “FLANK” (L, K out), “FLAME” (E out), “GLAND” (L out), “PLANK” (L, K out) – none work.

A in position 5: “BLUNT” (L out), “BRUNT” (R out), “DRANK” (R, K out), “FRANK” (R, K out), “GRAIN” (R out), “SLANT” (S, L out) – none work.

I need to look for other combinations. Let me try A in position 2 with new consonants.

A in position 2: “BA” + new consonants. Available consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

“BADGY” – G, Y allowed? Yes, not ruled out. But is “BADGY” a valid word? It means having a bad complexion, but it’s uncommon.

“BAMBO” – O is out.

“BANDY” – D, Y allowed. “BANDY” is valid.

“BAPED” – E is out.

“BAKED” – E, K out.

“BAMBO” – O out.

“BANDY” seems acceptable.

Let me check “BANDY”:
- B, A, N, D, Y.
- Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K – none of these appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternatively, “BAMBO” is invalid (O out), “BADLY” invalid (L out), “BAPED” invalid (E out), “BAKED” invalid (E, K out).

Another option with A in position 4: “MADAM” – but A is in position 2 and 4, and M, D allowed.

“MADAM”:
- M, A, D, A, M.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), and position 4.
- Letters: M, D allowed.
- Valid word.

This seems good too.

Between “BANDY” and “MADAM”, “MADAM” uses more common letters (M, A, D) and repeats A which we know is in the word, giving more information.

I’ll go with “MADAM”.

A in position 4: “BRAIN” (R out), “GRAIN” (R out), “PLAID” (L out), “BLAND” (L out), “BRAND” (R out), “CLAMP” (C out), “FLANK” (L, K out), “FLAME” (E out), “GLAND” (L out), “PLANK” (L, K out) – none work.

A in position 5: “BLUNT” (L out), “BRUNT” (R out), “DRANK” (R, K out), “FRANK” (R, K out), “GRAIN” (R out), “SLANT” (S, L out) – none work.

I need to look for other combinations. Let me try A in position 2 with new consonants.

A in position 2: “BA” + new consonants. Available consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

“BADGY” – G, Y allowed? Yes, not ruled out. But is “BADGY” a valid word? It means having a bad complexion, but it’s uncommon.

“BAMBO” – O is out.

“BANDY” – D, Y allowed. “BANDY” is valid.

“BAPED” – E is out.

“BAKED” – E, K out.

“BAMBO” – O out.

“BANDY” seems acceptable.

Let me check “BANDY”:
- B, A, N, D, Y.
- Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K – none of these appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternatively, “BAMBO” is invalid (O out), “BADLY” invalid (L out), “BAPED” invalid (E out), “BAKED” invalid (E, K out).

Another option with A in position 4: “MADAM” – but A is in position 2 and 4, and M, D allowed.

“MADAM”:
- M, A, D, A, M.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), and position 4.
- Letters: M, D allowed.
- Valid word.

This seems good too.

Between “BANDY” and “MADAM”, “MADAM” uses more common letters (M, A, D) and repeats A which we know is in the word, giving more information.

I’ll go with “MADAM”.",Guess 3: MADAM -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(-) A(-) M(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these most common letters and can quickly tell me which vowels and consonants are present. However, since we're dealing with a 5-letter word, I should make sure it's a valid word. ""AROSE"" is valid, but let's consider ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" as options.

Another good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, E is out, O is out).

I'll look for a word with A in positions 2-5 and use other common letters. A word like ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and uses P, L, I, D. However, I need to check if it avoids R, O, S, E - yes, it does. But ""PLAID"" has D which is less common.

A better choice might be ""CHALK"":
- A in position 3 (not first).
- Letters: C, H, A, L, K. None of these are R, O, S, E.
- Common letters C, H, L, K.

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Guess 2: CHALK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. CHALK → C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
   - A is still “in the word but wrong position” (so not in position 3 either).
   - C, H, L, K are absent.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Letters still allowed: all others except R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K.
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels: I, U (A already known).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me try to construct a word with A in position 2:
- B A _ _ _ → “BADLY” but L and Y are allowed? L is ruled out (from CHALK feedback). So “BADLY” is invalid (L is out).
- B A _ _ _ → “BAMBO” – but O is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BANDS” – S is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAPED” – E is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAKED” – E and K are out.

A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAIN” – R and I, N. R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLAID” – L and D, I. L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAND” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “CLAMP” – C is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLAME” – E is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BLUNT” – L and U, N, T. L is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRUNT” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “DRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

Looking for a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters.

A in position 2: “BADLY” (L out), “BAMBO” (O out), “BANDS” (S out), “BAPED” (E out), “BAKED” (E, K out) – none work.

A in position 4: “BRAIN” (R out), “GRAIN” (R out), “PLAID” (L out), “BLAND” (L out), “BRAND” (R out), “CLAMP” (C out), “FLANK” (L, K out), “FLAME” (E out), “GLAND” (L out), “PLANK” (L, K out) – none work.

“BAMBO” – O is out.

“BANDY” – D, Y allowed. “BANDY” is valid.

“BAPED” – E is out.

“BAKED” – E, K out.

“BAMBO” – O out.

“BANDY” seems acceptable.

Let me check “BANDY”:
- B, A, N, D, Y.
- Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K – none of these appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternatively, “BAMBO” is invalid (O out), “BADLY” invalid (L out), “BAPED” invalid (E out), “BAKED” invalid (E, K out).

Another option with A in position 4: “MADAM” – but A is in position 2 and 4, and M, D allowed.

“MADAM”:
- M, A, D, A, M.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), and position 4.
- Letters: M, D allowed.

This seems good too.

From the above, the valid options are “DANDY” and “DAUNT”.

Between these:
- DANDY: D, A, N, D, Y. Repeats D, gives info on N and Y.
- DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T. Introduces U, N, T.

Both are good, but “DAUNT” introduces three new letters (U, N, T) while “DANDY” repeats D. I’ll choose “DAUNT” to maximize new information.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these most common letters and can quickly tell me which vowels and consonants are present. However, since we're dealing with a 5-letter word, I should make sure it's a valid word. ""AROSE"" is valid, but let's consider ""AROSE"" or ""RAISE"" as options.

Another good choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than first.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, E is out, O is out).

I'll look for a word with A in positions 2-5 and use other common letters. A word like ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and uses P, L, I, D. However, I need to check if it avoids R, O, S, E - yes, it does. But ""PLAID"" has D which is less common.

A better choice might be ""CHALK"":
- A in position 3 (not first).
- Letters: C, H, A, L, K. None of these are R, O, S, E.
- Common letters C, H, L, K.

This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHALK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. CHALK → C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
   - A is still “in the word but wrong position” (so not in position 3 either).
   - C, H, L, K are absent.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Letters still allowed: all others except R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K.
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels: I, U (A already known).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me try to construct a word with A in position 2:
- B A _ _ _ → “BADLY” but L and Y are allowed? L is ruled out (from CHALK feedback). So “BADLY” is invalid (L is out).
- B A _ _ _ → “BAMBO” – but O is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BANDS” – S is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAPED” – E is out.
- B A _ _ _ → “BAKED” – E and K are out.

A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAIN” – R and I, N. R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLAID” – L and D, I. L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “BRAND” – R is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “CLAMP” – C is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “FLAME” – E is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “GLAND” – L is out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ A _ → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BLUNT” – L and U, N, T. L is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “BRUNT” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “DRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “FRANK” – R and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “GRAIN” – R is out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “PLANK” – L and K are out.
- _ _ _ _ A → “SLANT” – S and L are out.

Looking for a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters.

A in position 2: “BADLY” (L out), “BAMBO” (O out), “BANDS” (S out), “BAPED” (E out), “BAKED” (E, K out) – none work.

A in position 4: “BRAIN” (R out), “GRAIN” (R out), “PLAID” (L out), “BLAND” (L out), “BRAND” (R out), “CLAMP” (C out), “FLANK” (L, K out), “FLAME” (E out), “GLAND” (L out), “PLANK” (L, K out) – none work.

A in position 5: “BLUNT” (L out), “BRUNT” (R out), “DRANK” (R, K out), “FRANK” (R, K out), “GRAIN” (R out), “SLANT” (S, L out) – none work.

I need to look for other combinations. Let me try A in position 2 with new consonants.

A in position 2: “BA” + new consonants. Available consonants: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

“BADGY” – G, Y allowed? Yes, not ruled out. But is “BADGY” a valid word? It means having a bad complexion, but it’s uncommon.

“BAMBO” – O is out.

“BANDY” – D, Y allowed. “BANDY” is valid.

“BAPED” – E is out.

“BAKED” – E, K out.

“BAMBO” – O out.

“BANDY” seems acceptable.

Let me check “BANDY”:
- B, A, N, D, Y.
- Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K – none of these appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- It’s a valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternatively, “BAMBO” is invalid (O out), “BADLY” invalid (L out), “BAPED” invalid (E out), “BAKED” invalid (E, K out).

Another option with A in position 4: “MADAM” – but A is in position 2 and 4, and M, D allowed.

“MADAM”:
- M, A, D, A, M.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), and position 4.
- Letters: M, D allowed.
- Valid word.

This seems good too.

Between “BANDY” and “MADAM”, “MADAM” uses more common letters (M, A, D) and repeats A which we know is in the word, giving more information.

I’ll go with “MADAM”.

Guess 3: MADAM -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(-) A(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. CHALK → C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
   - A is still “in the word but wrong position” (so not in position 3 either).
   - C, H, L, K are absent.

3. MADAM → M(x) A(✓) D(-) A(-) M(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - M is absent.

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains D but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K, M.

Letters still allowed: A (fixed in position 2), D, plus any other letters not yet ruled out. Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, N, P, T, W, Y, etc. Remaining vowels: I, U.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- D somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s try to construct words:

Option 1: D in position 1 → D A _ _ _
   - D A _ _ _ : “DAMPS” – S is out.
   - D A _ _ _ : “DANDY” – N, D, Y allowed. “DANDY” is valid.
   - D A _ _ _ : “DAILY” – L is out.
   - D A _ _ _ : “DAUNT” – U, N, T allowed. “DAUNT” is valid.

Option 2: D in position 4 → _ _ _ A D
   - _ _ _ A D : “BADLY” – L is out.
   - _ _ _ A D : “PLAID” – L is out.
   - _ _ _ A D : “GRAID” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ A D : “CLAD” is only 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “BREAD” – R, E are out.
   - _ _ _ A D : “GRAID” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ A D : “BLAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “SLAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “TRAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “PLAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “FLAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “CLAD” is 4 letters.
   - _ _ _ A D : “BRAWN” – doesn’t end in AD.

Option 3: D in position 5 → _ _ _ _ D
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BANDS” – S is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “PLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BLAND” – L is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BRAND” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “CLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “FLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “GRAND” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “PLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BLAND” – L is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BRAND” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “CLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “FLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “GRAND” – R is out.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “PLAND” – not a word.
   - _ _ _ _ D : “BLAND” – L is out.

From the above, the valid options are “DANDY” and “DAUNT”.

Between these:
- DANDY: D, A, N, D, Y. Repeats D, gives info on N and Y.
- DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T. Introduces U, N, T.

Both are good, but “DAUNT” introduces three new letters (U, N, T) while “DANDY” repeats D. I’ll choose “DAUNT” to maximize new information.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. CHALK → C(x) H(x) A(-) L(x) K(x)
   - A is still “in the word but wrong position” (so not in position 3 either).
   - C, H, L, K are absent.

3. MADAM → M(x) A(✓) D(-) A(-) M(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - M is absent.

4. DAUNT → D(-) A(✓) U(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - D is in the word but not in position 1 (because feedback for D is “-”, i.e., wrong position).
   - N and T are absent.

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has D somewhere (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- Has U somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, C, H, L, K, M, N, T.

Letters still allowed: A (fixed in position 2), D, U, plus any other letters not yet ruled out. Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, P, W, Y, etc. Remaining vowels: I (since A and U are used, and O, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- D and U each in one of positions 3, 4, 5 (but not overlapping).
- No forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A D U _
- _ A U D _
- _ A _ D U
- _ A _ U D
- _ A D _ U
- _ A U _ D
- D A _ U _
- U A _ D _
- etc. (but D cannot be in position 1, U cannot be in position 3).

Let’s list possible words fitting these patterns:

Pattern 1: _ A D U _
   - B A D U _ → “BADUM” – not a word.
   - F A D U _ → “FADUM” – not a word.
   - G A D U _ → “GADUM” – not a word.

   - F A U D _ → “FAUD_” – “FAUDY” is valid.
   - G A U D _ → “GAUD_” – “GAUDY” is valid.
   - P A U D _ → “PAUD_” – not a word.
   - W A U D _ → “WAUD_” – not a word.
   - Y A U D _ → “YAUD_” – not a word.

Pattern 3: _ A _ D U
   - B A _ D U → “BADU_” – “BADU_” doesn’t fit.
   - F A _ D U → “FAIDU” – not a word.
   - G A _ D U → “GAIDU” – not a word.
   - P A _ D U → “PAIDU” – not a word.
   - W A _ D U → “WAIDU” – not a word.
   - Y A _ D U → “YAIDU” – not a word.

Pattern 4: _ A _ U D
   - B A _ U D → “BAUD_” – “BAUD_” doesn’t fit.

   - P A U _ D → “PAUD_” – not a word.
   - W A U _ D → “WAUD_” – not a word.
   - Y A U _ D → “YAUD_” – not a word.

From the valid words found:
- “BAUDY”, “FAUDY”, “GAUDY”.

Among these, “GAUDY” uses the most common remaining letters (G, A, U, D, Y) and is a valid word. I’ll choose “GAUDY”.
