### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify multiple vowels and consonants efficiently. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which can quickly tell me about vowel positions.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English, maximizing information gain.

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word and in the first position (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. Letters R, S, E are eliminated.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in the first position.
- Place O in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Introduce new common consonants (like T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
- Avoid R, S, E.

""ADMON"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with A.
- O is in position 3 (but we know O isn't there, so this might not be ideal).
Wait, let me rethink.

Better options:
- ""AFOOT"" - but has two O's and we don't know about double letters.
- ""AMONG"" - has O in position 3 (still bad).
- ""ALONE"" - has E (eliminated).
- ""ABOUT"" - has O in position 2 (good), introduces B, U, T.

""ABOUT"" seems better:
- A(✓) in position 1.
- O in position 2 (new position).
- Introduces B, U, T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids R, S, E.

But let's check if this is optimal. Another option is ""AUDIO"" - but has U and I which might be less common.

""ABOUT"" seems the best so far.
