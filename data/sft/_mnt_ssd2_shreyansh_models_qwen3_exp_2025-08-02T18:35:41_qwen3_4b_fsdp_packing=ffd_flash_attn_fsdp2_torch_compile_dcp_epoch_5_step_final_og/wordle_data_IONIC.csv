For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would use several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U - but has less common letters)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

2. The letters R, A, S, E are NOT in the word.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
   - P and T are not in the word.
   - O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - I is in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew that).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), I, N
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, T
- I is not in position 3
- N is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both I and N somewhere else (not positions 3 and 4 respectively)
- Uses only letters not ruled out (so far allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N)

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _
We need to place I and N in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- I not in position 3
- N not in position 4

Let’s list possible positions for I and N:
- I could be in 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5

Let’s try to find a word that fits:
- If I is in position 1: I O _ _ _
  - Then N must be in 3 or 5
  - N in 3: I O N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 5: I O _ _ N → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 4: _ O _ I _
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 5: _ O _ _ I
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ _ I → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N _ I → need two more letters from allowed set

Let’s pick one possibility and see if it forms a valid word.
Try N in position 1, I in position 4:
N O _ I _
Need two letters from allowed set (not R,A,S,E,P,T). Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L I _ → need one more letter. N O L I D? That’s “NOLID” – not a valid word.
N O D I _ → N O D I L? Not valid.
N O M I _ → N O M I D? Not valid.

Try I in position 1, N in position 3:
I O N _ _
Need two more letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → I O N D L? Not valid.
I O N L _ → I O N L D? Not valid.

Try N in position 1, I in position 5:
N O _ _ I
Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L D I → “NOLDI” – not valid.
N O M D I → not valid.

Try I in position 4, N in position 3:
_ O N I _
Need two letters in positions 1 and 5 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N I _ → D O N I L? Not valid.
M O N I _ → M O N I L? Not valid.

Try I in position 5, N in position 3:
_ O N _ I
Need two letters in positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N L I → “DONLI” – not valid.
M O N L I → “MONLI” – not valid.

Let’s try another approach: look for valid 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ _ with O in position 2, and contain both I and N, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BOUND – but U is allowed, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in position 4 from POINT feedback). Also D is allowed.
- ROUND – but R is ruled out.
- SOUND – S is ruled out.
- FOUND – F is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- MOUND – M is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- GOUND – not a valid word.
- HOUND – H is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).

Hmm, seems like N is often in position 4 in these words. Let’s try N in position 3:
_ O N _ _
Need I somewhere else (positions 1,4,5), but I can’t be in position 3 (already N), and from RAISE I can’t be in position 3 anyway.
Possible:
- B O N I _ → BONID? Not valid.
- D O N I _ → DONID? Not valid.
- F O N I _ → FONID? Not valid.
- G O N I _ → GONID? Not valid.
- H O N I _ → HONID? Not valid.
- J O N I _ → JONID? Not valid.
- K O N I _ → KONID? Not valid.
- L O N I _ → LONID? Not valid.
- M O N I _ → MONID? Not valid.
- Q O N I _ → QONID? Not valid.
- V O N I _ → VONID? Not valid.
- W O N I _ → WONID? Not valid.
- X O N I _ → XONID? Not valid.
- Y O N I _ → YONID? Not valid.
- Z O N I _ → ZONID? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 1:
I O N _ _
Need two letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → ION D? Not valid.
I O N L _ → ION L? Not valid.
I O N M _ → ION M? Not valid.
I O N D Y → IONDY? Not valid.
I O N D L → IOND L? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 5:
_ O _ _ I
Need N somewhere else (positions 1,3,4), and I in position 5.
Possible:
- N O _ _ I → N O L D I? Not valid.
- N O M _ I → N O M D I? Not valid.
- N O D _ I → N O D L I? Not valid.
- L O N _ I → L O N D I? Not valid.
- M O N _ I → M O N D I? Not valid.
- D O N _ I → D O N L I? Not valid.

This is tricky. Let’s try to think of valid words with O in position 2, containing I and N, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BONDI – B, O, N, D, I – but N is in position 3 (allowed), I in position 5 (allowed). Letters used: B, O, N, D, I – none are ruled out. This seems valid.
- FONDI – F, O, N, D, I – same pattern.
- GONID – not a valid word.
- HONDI – not a valid word.
- JONID – not a valid word.
- KONID – not a valid word.
- LONID – not a valid word.
- MONID – not a valid word.
- PONID – P is ruled out.
- SONID – S is ruled out.
- TONID – T is ruled out.
- WONID – not a valid word.

“BONDI” seems to fit:
- B: allowed (not ruled out)
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N can’t be in position 4)
- D: allowed
- I: in position 5 (allowed, since I can’t be in position 3)

Let’s check if BONDI is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid 5-letter word (a type of ring).

So, guess: BONDI

- Uses only letters not ruled out (so far allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N)

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _
We need to place I and N in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- I not in position 3
- N not in position 4

Let’s list possible positions for I and N:
- I could be in 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5

Let’s try to find a word that fits:
- If I is in position 1: I O _ _ _
  - Then N must be in 3 or 5
  - N in 3: I O N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 5: I O _ _ N → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 4: _ O _ I _
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 5: _ O _ _ I
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ _ I → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N _ I → need two more letters from allowed set

Let’s pick one possibility and see if it forms a valid word.
Try N in position 1, I in position 4:
N O _ I _
Need two letters from allowed set (not R,A,S,E,P,T). Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L I _ → need one more letter. N O L I D? That’s “NOLID” – not a valid word.
N O D I _ → N O D I L? Not valid.
N O M I _ → N O M I D? Not valid.

Try I in position 1, N in position 3:
I O N _ _
Need two more letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → I O N D L? Not valid.
I O N L _ → I O N L D? Not valid.

Try N in position 1, I in position 5:
N O _ _ I
Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L D I → “NOLDI” – not valid.
N O M D I → not valid.

Try I in position 4, N in position 3:
_ O N I _
Need two letters in positions 1 and 5 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N I _ → D O N I L? Not valid.
M O N I _ → M O N I L? Not valid.

Try I in position 5, N in position 3:
_ O N _ I
Need two letters in positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N L I → “DONLI” – not valid.
M O N L I → “MONLI” – not valid.

Let’s try another approach: look for valid 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ _ with O in position 2, and contain both I and N, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BOUND – but U is allowed, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in position 4 from POINT feedback). Also D is allowed.
- ROUND – but R is ruled out.
- SOUND – S is ruled out.
- FOUND – F is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- MOUND – M is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- GOUND – not a valid word.
- HOUND – H is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).

Hmm, seems like N is often in position 4 in these words. Let’s try N in position 3:
_ O N _ _
Need I somewhere else (positions 1,4,5), but I can’t be in position 3 (already N), and from RAISE I can’t be in position 3 anyway.
Possible:
- B O N I _ → BONID? Not valid.
- D O N I _ → DONID? Not valid.
- F O N I _ → FONID? Not valid.
- G O N I _ → GONID? Not valid.
- H O N I _ → HONID? Not valid.
- J O N I _ → JONID? Not valid.
- K O N I _ → KONID? Not valid.
- L O N I _ → LONID? Not valid.
- M O N I _ → MONID? Not valid.
- Q O N I _ → QONID? Not valid.
- V O N I _ → VONID? Not valid.
- W O N I _ → WONID? Not valid.
- X O N I _ → XONID? Not valid.
- Y O N I _ → YONID? Not valid.
- Z O N I _ → ZONID? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 1:
I O N _ _
Need two letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → ION D? Not valid.
I O N L _ → ION L? Not valid.
I O N M _ → ION M? Not valid.
I O N D Y → IONDY? Not valid.
I O N D L → IOND L? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 5:
_ O _ _ I
Need N somewhere else (positions 1,3,4), and I in position 5.
Possible:
- N O _ _ I → N O L D I? Not valid.
- N O M _ I → N O M D I? Not valid.
- N O D _ I → N O D L I? Not valid.
- L O N _ I → L O N D I? Not valid.
- M O N _ I → M O N D I? Not valid.
- D O N _ I → D O N L I? Not valid.

This is tricky. Let’s try to think of valid words with O in position 2, containing I and N, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BONDI – B, O, N, D, I – but N is in position 3 (allowed), I in position 5 (allowed). Letters used: B, O, N, D, I – none are ruled out. This seems valid.
- FONDI – F, O, N, D, I – same pattern.
- GONID – not a valid word.
- HONDI – not a valid word.
- JONID – not a valid word.
- KONID – not a valid word.
- LONID – not a valid word.
- MONID – not a valid word.
- PONID – P is ruled out.
- SONID – S is ruled out.
- TONID – T is ruled out.
- WONID – not a valid word.

“BONDI” seems to fit:
- B: allowed (not ruled out)
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N can’t be in position 4)
- D: allowed
- I: in position 5 (allowed, since I can’t be in position 3)

Let’s check if BONDI is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid 5-letter word (a type of ring).

So, guess: BONDI",Guess 3: BONDI -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(✓) D(x) I(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would use several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U - but has less common letters)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: x → not in the word at all
- I: - → the letter I is in the word but not in the 3rd position
- S: x → not in the word at all
- E: x → not in the word at all

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter I, but not in position 3.
2. The letters R, A, S, E are NOT in the word.
3. We still need to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good next letters to test are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. The remaining common vowels are O and U, and common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

A word that uses I plus several new common letters, while avoiding the ruled-out ones, is “POINT”. It includes:
- P (new consonant)
- O (new vowel)
- I (known to be in the word, placed in position 3 – but feedback said I is NOT in position 3, so we’ll check if it moves)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)

This tests five fresh letters while re-using the known letter I in a different position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
   - P and T are not in the word.
   - O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).
   - I is in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew that).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), I, N
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, T
- I is not in position 3
- N is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both I and N somewhere else (not positions 3 and 4 respectively)
- Uses only letters not ruled out (so far allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N)

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _
We need to place I and N in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- I not in position 3
- N not in position 4

Let’s list possible positions for I and N:
- I could be in 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in 1, 3, or 5

Let’s try to find a word that fits:
- If I is in position 1: I O _ _ _
  - Then N must be in 3 or 5
  - N in 3: I O N _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 5: I O _ _ N → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 4: _ O _ I _
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N I _ → need two more letters from allowed set
- If I is in position 5: _ O _ _ I
  - Then N must be in 1 or 3
  - N in 1: N O _ _ I → need two more letters from allowed set
  - N in 3: _ O N _ I → need two more letters from allowed set

Let’s pick one possibility and see if it forms a valid word.
Try N in position 1, I in position 4:
N O _ I _
Need two letters from allowed set (not R,A,S,E,P,T). Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L I _ → need one more letter. N O L I D? That’s “NOLID” – not a valid word.
N O D I _ → N O D I L? Not valid.
N O M I _ → N O M I D? Not valid.

Try I in position 1, N in position 3:
I O N _ _
Need two more letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → I O N D L? Not valid.
I O N L _ → I O N L D? Not valid.

Try N in position 1, I in position 5:
N O _ _ I
Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
N O L D I → “NOLDI” – not valid.
N O M D I → not valid.

Try I in position 4, N in position 3:
_ O N I _
Need two letters in positions 1 and 5 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N I _ → D O N I L? Not valid.
M O N I _ → M O N I L? Not valid.

Try I in position 5, N in position 3:
_ O N _ I
Need two letters in positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.
Let’s pick common letters: L, D, M, etc.
D O N L I → “DONLI” – not valid.
M O N L I → “MONLI” – not valid.

Let’s try another approach: look for valid 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ _ with O in position 2, and contain both I and N, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BOUND – but U is allowed, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in position 4 from POINT feedback). Also D is allowed.
- ROUND – but R is ruled out.
- SOUND – S is ruled out.
- FOUND – F is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- MOUND – M is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).
- GOUND – not a valid word.
- HOUND – H is allowed, U is allowed, N is in position 4 (invalid).

Hmm, seems like N is often in position 4 in these words. Let’s try N in position 3:
_ O N _ _
Need I somewhere else (positions 1,4,5), but I can’t be in position 3 (already N), and from RAISE I can’t be in position 3 anyway.
Possible:
- B O N I _ → BONID? Not valid.
- D O N I _ → DONID? Not valid.
- F O N I _ → FONID? Not valid.
- G O N I _ → GONID? Not valid.
- H O N I _ → HONID? Not valid.
- J O N I _ → JONID? Not valid.
- K O N I _ → KONID? Not valid.
- L O N I _ → LONID? Not valid.
- M O N I _ → MONID? Not valid.
- Q O N I _ → QONID? Not valid.
- V O N I _ → VONID? Not valid.
- W O N I _ → WONID? Not valid.
- X O N I _ → XONID? Not valid.
- Y O N I _ → YONID? Not valid.
- Z O N I _ → ZONID? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 1:
I O N _ _
Need two letters from allowed set. Let’s pick common letters: D, L, M, etc.
I O N D _ → ION D? Not valid.
I O N L _ → ION L? Not valid.
I O N M _ → ION M? Not valid.
I O N D Y → IONDY? Not valid.
I O N D L → IOND L? Not valid.

Let’s try I in position 5:
_ O _ _ I
Need N somewhere else (positions 1,3,4), and I in position 5.
Possible:
- N O _ _ I → N O L D I? Not valid.
- N O M _ I → N O M D I? Not valid.
- N O D _ I → N O D L I? Not valid.
- L O N _ I → L O N D I? Not valid.
- M O N _ I → M O N D I? Not valid.
- D O N _ I → D O N L I? Not valid.

This is tricky. Let’s try to think of valid words with O in position 2, containing I and N, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Possible valid words:
- BONDI – B, O, N, D, I – but N is in position 3 (allowed), I in position 5 (allowed). Letters used: B, O, N, D, I – none are ruled out. This seems valid.
- FONDI – F, O, N, D, I – same pattern.
- GONID – not a valid word.
- HONDI – not a valid word.
- JONID – not a valid word.
- KONID – not a valid word.
- LONID – not a valid word.
- MONID – not a valid word.
- PONID – P is ruled out.
- SONID – S is ruled out.
- TONID – T is ruled out.
- WONID – not a valid word.

“BONDI” seems to fit:
- B: allowed (not ruled out)
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N can’t be in position 4)
- D: allowed
- I: in position 5 (allowed, since I can’t be in position 3)

Let’s check if BONDI is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid 5-letter word (a type of ring).

So, guess: BONDI

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, A, S, E, P, T, B, D

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POINT and BONDI)
- N is in position 3 (✓ from BONDI)
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from RAISE: not 3; from POINT: not 3; from BONDI: not 5)
  ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 4.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: N
- Position 1 or 4: I
- Positions 3 and 5: still open (but 3 is N)

Possible patterns:
1. I O N _ _
2. _ O N I _

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns using only letters not yet ruled out.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters O, N, I.

Let’s look for valid words:

Pattern 1: I O N _ _
- IONIC – but C is allowed, and the word is valid. However, we already have N in position 3, and I in position 1, which fits the constraints.
- IONIC: I O N I C – but I would be in position 4 here, which is allowed, and C is allowed.
  But wait, in IONIC, I appears twice, and we don’t have any information against that yet.

Pattern 2: _ O N I _
- CONIC – but C is allowed, and the word is valid. However, C is allowed, and the word fits.
- FONIC – not a valid word.
- GONIC – not a valid word.
- HONIC – not a valid word.
- JONIC – not a valid word.
- KONIC – not a valid word.
- LONIC – not a valid word.
- MONIC – not a valid word.
- QONIC – not a valid word.
- WONIC – not a valid word.

Looking at pattern 1: IONIC is valid, but let’s check if it fits all constraints:
- I in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (correct)
- I in position 4 (allowed, since I can be in 1 or 4)
- C is allowed

But we have to check if any letters are ruled out. C has not been ruled out, so IONIC is possible.

However, let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another possibility is:
- IONIC seems the most straightforward, but let’s check if there’s a word with distinct letters.

Another candidate:
- IONIC – I O N I C (valid)
- IONIC is a valid word.

But let’s also check if there’s a word with I in position 4:
- _ O N I _
- CONIC – not valid
- FONIC – not valid
- GONIC – not valid
- HONIC – not valid
- JONIC – not valid
- KONIC – not valid
- LONIC – not valid
- MONIC – not valid
- QONIC – not valid
- WONIC – not valid

So the only valid word fitting the pattern seems to be IONIC.

But wait, let’s double-check:
- IONIC: I O N I C
- Letters used: I, O, N, I, C – none of these are in the ruled-out list.
- Positions:
  - I in position 1 (allowed)
  - O in position 2 (correct)
  - N in position 3 (correct)
  - I in position 4 (allowed)
  - C in position 5 (allowed)

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be IONIC.
