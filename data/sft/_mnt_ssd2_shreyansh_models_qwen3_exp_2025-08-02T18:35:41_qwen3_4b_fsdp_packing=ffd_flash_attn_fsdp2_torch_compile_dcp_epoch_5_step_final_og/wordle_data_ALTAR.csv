For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ L _ _ _
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so A appears somewhere else
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so T appears somewhere else
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Letters to include: A, T
- Letters to exclude: S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with a letter other than S
2. Has L as the second letter
3. Contains both A and T somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5
4. Does NOT contain S or E

Possible candidates:
- FLANK (but N is not confirmed)
- PLANT (but P is not confirmed)
- CLAMP (but C is not confirmed)
- BLAT? (but BLAT is not a valid word)
- GLARE (but E is excluded)
- CLAPT (but P is not confirmed)
- PLAIT (but I is not confirmed)

Looking at valid words:
- PLANT: P, L, A, N, T – fits all criteria
- CLAMP: C, L, A, M, P – fits all criteria
- BLANK: B, L, A, N, K – fits all criteria

Among these, PLANT seems to be a strong guess because it uses common letters (P, N) and confirms both A and T positions.

Let me check PLANT:
- P (new letter)
- L (matches ✓)
- A (must be somewhere else, here it's 3rd)
- N (new letter)
- T (must be somewhere else, here it's 5th)

This should help narrow down positions for A and T while testing new consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The pattern is _ L _ _ _
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, P, N
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: A and T
4. Therefore A and T must appear in the remaining three open slots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), but NOT in their previous positions (A was 3rd, T was 5th).

So A must be in 1, 4, or 5 and T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with a letter that is NOT S, E, P, N
- Has L in the 2nd position
- Contains both A and T in the remaining slots
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Candidate letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known L.

Possible words:
- BLART – not a valid word
- CLART – not a valid word
- FLART – not a valid word
- GLART – not a valid word
- CLAT? – needs another letter
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- GLADT – not valid
- CLADT – not valid
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- FLAT? – needs another letter
- PLAT? – P is excluded
- SLAT? – S is excluded

Looking at valid words that fit _ L _ _ _ with A and T:
- CLAT? – CLAT is a word (short for ""clatter"" or ""clayton""), but it's obscure
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – doesn't have T
- BLAND – no T
- CLAMP – no T
- CLAVT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid

Wait, let's think systematically:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ L _ _ _
Letters to place: A and T in 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
A not 3rd, T not 5th.

Possible placements:
- A in 1, T in 3 or 4
- A in 4, T in 1 or 3
- A in 5, T in 1 or 3 or 4

Let's list valid words:
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- CLAT? – CLAT is valid (as in ""clat"" sound)
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – no T
- PLAT? – P excluded
- SLAT? – S excluded
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- CLAVT – not valid
- BLURT – not valid

Actually, let's think of real words:
- CLAT is a valid word (British slang for ""clatter"")
- FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT is valid (Glat is a surname, but not common)
- BLAT is valid (slang for ""blat"" sound)

But we need 5-letter words. Let's think again:
- BLURT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- GLATT – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T:
- CLAPT – C, L, A, P, T – but P is excluded
- FLANK – no T
- GLADE – E excluded
- PLAIT – P excluded
- SLANT – S excluded
- CLAMP – no T
- BLAND – no T
- CLAVD – no T
- FLANK – no T
- GLAND – no T
- PLANK – P excluded
- SLANT – S excluded

Wait, let's think of words with A and T:
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters

This suggests I need to look for 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ with A and T in the remaining slots.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words:
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – no T
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- BLURT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- GLATT – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A

Actually, let's think systematically:
Possible 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T, excluding S, E, P, N:

- BLART – not valid
- CLART – not valid
- FLART – not valid
- GLART – not valid
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters

This seems limited. Let me think of other possibilities:
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- BLURT – not valid

Wait, let's think of words with A in 1st position:
- AL? – needs 5 letters
- ALBAT – not valid
- ALCT? – not valid

This is proving difficult. Let me try to list valid 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T, excluding S, E, P, N:

- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters

Actually, there are very few 5-letter words with L in 2nd position that contain both A and T. Let me think of ""CLAPT"" but P is excluded.

Wait, let me think of ""CLAVT"" – not valid.

This suggests I need to look for words where A and T are in different positions. Let me try:

- A in 4th, T in 1st: T L A _ _
- A in 5th, T in 1st: T L _ _ A
- A in 4th, T in 3rd: _ L T A _
- A in 5th, T in 3rd: _ L T _ A
- A in 1st, T in 3rd: A L T _ _
- A in 5th, T in 4th: _ L _ T A
- A in 1st, T in 4th: A L _ T _

Let me think of valid words:
- ALTAR – A, L, T, A, R – but A is already in word, but we need to check positions
- ALTAR: A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5) – but T is in 3rd which was previously wrong position (T was 5th in PLANT), so 3rd is allowed. However, we need to check if this fits all constraints.

ALTAR:
- A in 1st (new position)
- L in 2nd (matches ✓)
- T in 3rd (new position, allowed)
- A in 4th (new position)
- R in 5th (new letter)

This seems valid because:
- Contains A and T in new positions
- L is in correct position
- Excludes S, E, P, N
- Uses only letters not ruled out

Let me check if ALTAR is a valid 5-letter word: Yes, ALTAR is valid.

This seems like the best next guess.
</think>

From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Letters to include: A and T
- Letters to exclude: S, E, P, N

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 2nd position, containing both A and T in the remaining slots, and using only letters not yet ruled out. The word ""ALTAR"" fits these constraints perfectly:
- A in 1st position (new position)
- L in 2nd position (matches ✓)
- T in 3rd position (new position)
- A in 4th position (new position)
- R in 5th position (new letter)

This will help confirm the positions of A and T while testing the letter R.

<guess>ALTAR</guess>",ALTAR,"From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The pattern is _ L _ _ _
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, P, N
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: A and T
4. Therefore A and T must appear in the remaining three open slots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), but NOT in their previous positions (A was 3rd, T was 5th).

So A must be in 1, 4, or 5 and T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with a letter that is NOT S, E, P, N
- Has L in the 2nd position
- Contains both A and T in the remaining slots
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Candidate letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known L.

Possible words:
- BLART – not a valid word
- CLART – not a valid word
- FLART – not a valid word
- GLART – not a valid word
- CLAT? – needs another letter
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- GLADT – not valid
- CLADT – not valid
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- FLAT? – needs another letter
- PLAT? – P is excluded
- SLAT? – S is excluded

Looking at valid words that fit _ L _ _ _ with A and T:
- CLAT? – CLAT is a word (short for ""clatter"" or ""clayton""), but it's obscure
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – doesn't have T
- BLAND – no T
- CLAMP – no T
- CLAVT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid

Wait, let's think systematically:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ L _ _ _
Letters to place: A and T in 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
A not 3rd, T not 5th.

Possible placements:
- A in 1, T in 3 or 4
- A in 4, T in 1 or 3
- A in 5, T in 1 or 3 or 4

Let's list valid words:
- BLAT? – needs another letter
- CLAT? – CLAT is valid (as in ""clat"" sound)
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – no T
- PLAT? – P excluded
- SLAT? – S excluded
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- CLAVT – not valid
- BLURT – not valid

Actually, let's think of real words:
- CLAT is a valid word (British slang for ""clatter"")
- FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT is valid (Glat is a surname, but not common)
- BLAT is valid (slang for ""blat"" sound)

But we need 5-letter words. Let's think again:
- BLURT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- GLATT – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T:
- CLAPT – C, L, A, P, T – but P is excluded
- FLANK – no T
- GLADE – E excluded
- PLAIT – P excluded
- SLANT – S excluded
- CLAMP – no T
- BLAND – no T
- CLAVD – no T
- FLANK – no T
- GLAND – no T
- PLANK – P excluded
- SLANT – S excluded

Wait, let's think of words with A and T:
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters

This suggests I need to look for 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _ with A and T in the remaining slots.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words:
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAD? – no T
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- BLURT – not valid
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- GLATT – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A

Actually, let's think systematically:
Possible 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T, excluding S, E, P, N:

- BLART – not valid
- CLART – not valid
- FLART – not valid
- GLART – not valid
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters
- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters

This seems limited. Let me think of other possibilities:
- CLAVT – not valid
- FLUTA – has T but not A
- ULTRA – has T but not A
- BLURT – not valid

Wait, let's think of words with A in 1st position:
- AL? – needs 5 letters
- ALBAT – not valid
- ALCT? – not valid

This is proving difficult. Let me try to list valid 5-letter words with L in 2nd position, containing A and T, excluding S, E, P, N:

- CLAT? – CLAT is 4 letters
- FLAT? – FLAT is 4 letters
- GLAT? – GLAT is 4 letters
- BLAT? – BLAT is 4 letters

Actually, there are very few 5-letter words with L in 2nd position that contain both A and T. Let me think of ""CLAPT"" but P is excluded.

Wait, let me think of ""CLAVT"" – not valid.

This suggests I need to look for words where A and T are in different positions. Let me try:

- A in 4th, T in 1st: T L A _ _
- A in 5th, T in 1st: T L _ _ A
- A in 4th, T in 3rd: _ L T A _
- A in 5th, T in 3rd: _ L T _ A
- A in 1st, T in 3rd: A L T _ _
- A in 5th, T in 4th: _ L _ T A
- A in 1st, T in 4th: A L _ T _

Let me think of valid words:
- ALTAR – A, L, T, A, R – but A is already in word, but we need to check positions
- ALTAR: A(1), L(2), T(3), A(4), R(5) – but T is in 3rd which was previously wrong position (T was 5th in PLANT), so 3rd is allowed. However, we need to check if this fits all constraints.

ALTAR:
- A in 1st (new position)
- L in 2nd (matches ✓)
- T in 3rd (new position, allowed)
- A in 4th (new position)
- R in 5th (new letter)

This seems valid because:
- Contains A and T in new positions
- L is in correct position
- Excludes S, E, P, N
- Uses only letters not ruled out

Let me check if ALTAR is a valid 5-letter word: Yes, ALTAR is valid.

This seems like the best next guess.From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Letters to include: A and T
- Letters to exclude: S, E, P, N

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 2nd position, containing both A and T in the remaining slots, and using only letters not yet ruled out. The word ""ALTAR"" fits these constraints perfectly:
- A in 1st position (new position)
- L in 2nd position (matches ✓)
- T in 3rd position (new position)
- A in 4th position (new position)
- R in 5th position (new letter)

This will help confirm the positions of A and T while testing the letter R.",Guess 3: ALTAR -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) T(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
