### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word often includes:

- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and T in different positions (not 3rd and 4th).
- Avoids S, L, E entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be “TRAIN”:
- Uses A and T in new positions (positions 2 and 3).
- Introduces R, I, N which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids all the ruled-out letters (S, L, E).

Let’s go with TRAIN.

A good starting word often includes:\n\n- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U\n- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N\n\nOne of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x).\n- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and T somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.\n- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Uses A and T in different positions (not 3rd and 4th).\n- Avoids S, L, E entirely.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nGood candidate letters to test next: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nA strong next guess would be “TRAIN”:\n- Uses A and T in new positions (positions 2 and 3).\n- Introduces R, I, N which are common and haven’t been tested yet.\n- Avoids all the ruled-out letters (S, L, E).\n\nLet’s go with TRAIN.\n\n<guess>TRAIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current constraints:\n1.

From the new feedback on TANGO:
- T is still ✓ in position 1.
- A is now ✓ in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 here and got “-”).
- G and O are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern so far is:
T A _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word: T (pos 1), A (pos 2), N (somewhere else, but not pos 3).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, E, R, I, G, O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with TA.
2. Contains N, but N cannot be in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for N: 4 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are taken by T and A, and 3 is excluded).

Let’s look for common words starting with TA and containing N in position 4 or 5.

Candidate words:
- TANIC (but I is excluded)
- TANGY (but G and Y are still allowed, but O is excluded, G is excluded)
- TAPIR (but P is allowed, R is excluded)
- TAPIR is invalid (R excluded)
- TAWNY (but W is allowed, N is in position 4)
- TAWNY: T A W N Y
  - T ✓, A ✓, N in position 4 (allowed)
  - W and Y are new letters to test
  - No excluded letters used

This seems like a good next guess.
