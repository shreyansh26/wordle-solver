For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these high-frequency letters. 

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This should give us good feedback about several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 5.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ _ E

Letters to avoid: L, A, T  
Letters already fixed: S (1st), E (5th)

I need a 5-letter word that starts with S and ends with E, uses none of L, A, T, and contains no repeats of S or E.

Good candidates might use other common consonants and vowels. Let’s try to include R, I, N, C, O, etc. One simple word that fits is “SHIRE”:
- S ✓ (position 1)
- H (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- E ✓ (position 5)

This tests H, I, R, which are common and haven’t been tried yet. It also keeps the word common and valid.

Since R is in the word but not in position 4, and position 4 is already R in SHIRE feedback (but marked as -), that means R must be in position 2 or 3. However, in SHIRE, R was in position 4 and marked -, so R cannot be in position 4. But our pattern already has R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback. Wait, let me re-express:

From SHIRE feedback:
- S(✓) position 1
- H(x) not in word

- R(-) in word but wrong position (currently position 4)
- E(✓) position 5

So the word is S _ _ _ E with R somewhere in positions 2,3 or 4 (but not 4 because it's marked as wrong position there). Wait, no: the R in SHIRE was in position 4 and marked as -, which means R is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore R must be in position 2 or 3.

- S P R E E: same issue with double E.
- S N O R E: N and O are possible, but R is in position 4, which is invalid because R was marked as wrong position in SHIRE (position 4).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these high-frequency letters. 

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This should give us good feedback about several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

I need a 5-letter word that starts with S and ends with E, uses none of L, A, T, and contains no repeats of S or E.

Good candidates might use other common consonants and vowels. Let’s try to include R, I, N, C, O, etc. One simple word that fits is “SHIRE”:
- S ✓ (position 1)
- H (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- E ✓ (position 5)

This tests H, I, R, which are common and haven’t been tried yet. It also keeps the word common and valid.

So the word is S _ _ _ E with R somewhere in positions 2,3 or 4 (but not 4 because it's marked as wrong position there). Wait, no: the R in SHIRE was in position 4 and marked as -, which means R is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore R must be in position 2 or 3.

- Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern is now S R _ _ E. The word ""SURGE"" fits this pattern and uses untested letters U and G.

- S K R E E – but double E might be possible
- Letters: S, K, R, E, E – K is untested, E is allowed twice

But we need to avoid double letters unless confirmed. Let me think of single-letter possibilities:

But wait, ""SKREE"" has E in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. However, we have only one E confirmed in position 5, so double E is risky. 

Another word: ""SPREE"" – P and double E, but P is untested. However, ""SPREE"" is invalid because P is untested and double E is possible.

Looking back, the only valid word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" uses K which is untested and fits better.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""SPRUE"" – but U is excluded. ""SPREE"" – P is untested, but double E is possible. 

Given constraints, ""SPREE"" seems the closest, even with double E. Alternatively, ""SKREE"".

But ""SKREE"" is less common. Let me think of ""SPREE"" as it's more common.

However, ""SPREE"" has P in position 4 and double E. Since we have no info on P yet, it's acceptable.

But we need to avoid double E unless necessary. 

Actually, the word ""SPRUE"" is invalid (U excluded). 

The correct word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" is more likely.

But let me re-examine: the pattern is S _ R _ E. The only valid word left is ""SKREE"" (S-K-R-E-E) or ""SPREE"" (S-P-R-E-E). Both use untested letters. 

Between these, ""SKREE"" is more common. I'll go with ""SKREE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these high-frequency letters. 

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This should give us good feedback about several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 5.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ _ E

Letters to avoid: L, A, T  
Letters already fixed: S (1st), E (5th)

I need a 5-letter word that starts with S and ends with E, uses none of L, A, T, and contains no repeats of S or E.

Good candidates might use other common consonants and vowels. Let’s try to include R, I, N, C, O, etc. One simple word that fits is “SHIRE”:
- S ✓ (position 1)
- H (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- E ✓ (position 5)

This tests H, I, R, which are common and haven’t been tried yet. It also keeps the word common and valid.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: S _ _ R E  (R is in the word but in the wrong position)

Since R is in the word but not in position 4, and position 4 is already R in SHIRE feedback (but marked as -), that means R must be in position 2 or 3. However, in SHIRE, R was in position 4 and marked -, so R cannot be in position 4. But our pattern already has R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback. Wait, let me re-express:

From SHIRE feedback:
- S(✓) position 1
- H(x) not in word
- I(x) not in word
- R(-) in word but wrong position (currently position 4)
- E(✓) position 5

So the word is S _ _ _ E with R somewhere in positions 2,3 or 4 (but not 4 because it's marked as wrong position there). Wait, no: the R in SHIRE was in position 4 and marked as -, which means R is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore R must be in position 2 or 3.

So pattern is S R _ _ E or S _ R _ E.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- S R _ _ E: ""SCORE"" (but O and C are possible), but R is in position 2 here. However, we don't know about O or C yet.
- S _ R _ E: ""STARE"" (but T is already excluded), ""SNARE"" (N and A, but A is excluded), ""SPREE"" (P and P, but E is already in position 5), ""STREE"" (invalid), etc.

Wait, let's list possible words:
- S C O R E: fits S _ _ R E (R in position 4) but R is supposed to be in word but not in position 4, so this is invalid.
- S P R I E: but I is excluded.
- S C R E E: but E is already in position 5, and we don't know about double E.
- S P R E E: same issue with double E.
- S N O R E: N and O are possible, but R is in position 4, which is invalid because R was marked as wrong position in SHIRE (position 4).

Hmm, seems like R must be in position 2 or 3. Let's try:
- S R _ _ E: ""SCORE"" - but R is in position 2, which is allowed (since it's not in position 4). But we need to check letters: S, C, O, R, E. C and O haven't been tested yet. This seems valid.
- S _ R _ E: ""STARE"" - T is excluded, ""SNARE"" - A is excluded, ""SWORE"" - W and O, but W is untested, O is untested. This could work.

Between SCORE and SWORE, let's choose SCORE as it tests C and O which are common.Based on the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- E is correct in position 5
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (so R must be in position 2 or 3)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, H, I

I'll test ""SCORE"" which places R in position 3 (allowed) and introduces C and O.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: S _ _ _ E  (S and E are fixed in positions 1 and 5)
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in SCORE, R was in position 3 and marked -, and in SHIRE, R was in position 4 and also marked -)
3. Therefore R must be in position 2
4. Letters already excluded: L, A, T, H, I, C, O
5. Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R, but R is already placed in position 2)

So the pattern is now: S R _ _ E

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S R _ _ E:
- SRB_E: no common words
- SRD_E: no
- SRF_E: no
- SRG_E: no
- SRK_E: no
- SRM_E: no
- SRN_E: no
- SPR_E: no
- SRT_E: T is excluded
- SRW_E: no
- SRY_E: no

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- S R U _ E: ""SURGE"" - but G is untested
- S R I _ E: I is excluded
- S R A _ E: A is excluded
- S R O _ E: O is excluded
- S R E _ E: no
- S R U _ E: ""SURGE"" - G is untested
- S R I _ E: I is excluded
- S R O _ E: O is excluded

Another approach: position 3 and 4 must be from remaining letters. Let's list possible combinations:
- SRBDE: no
- SRBFE: no
- SRBGE: no
- SRBME: no
- SRBNE: no
- SRBPE: no
- SRBQE: no
- SRBRE: no
- SRBSE: no
- SRBTE: T is excluded
- SRBUE: no
- SRBVE: no
- SRBWE: no
- SRBZE: no

This seems limited. Let me think of actual words:
- ""SRIKE"" - I is excluded
- ""SRULE"" - U and L, L is excluded
- ""SRIDE"" - I is excluded
- ""SRATE"" - A is excluded
- ""SREDE"" - no
- ""SRIPE"" - I is excluded
- ""SRODE"" - O is excluded
- ""SRISE"" - I is excluded
- ""SRIKE"" - I is excluded

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of words with R in position 2:
- ""SPARE"" - A is excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded
- ""SNARE"" - A is excluded
- ""SWORE"" - W and O, O is excluded
- ""SPIRE"" - I is excluded
- ""SPREE"" - P and double E
- ""SNORE"" - O is excluded
- ""SPORE"" - P and O, O is excluded
- ""SPARE"" - A is excluded
- ""SHORE"" - H is excluded
- ""SHIRE"" - already tried
- ""SKORE"" - K and O, O is excluded
- ""SMORE"" - M and O, O is excluded
- ""SNORE"" - O is excluded
- ""SPORE"" - O is excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded
- ""STOLE"" - T and O, both excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded
- ""STARE"" - T is excluded

This is tricky. Maybe ""SURGE"" is the closest:
- S R U G E
- Letters: S, R, U, G, E
- U and G are untested
- R is in position 2, which fits constraints
- No excluded letters are used

Let's go with ""SURGE"".Based on the feedback:
- S and E are fixed in positions 1 and 5.
- R must be in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in positions 3 and 4 in previous guesses).
- Letters already excluded: L, A, T, H, I, C, O.
- Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern is now S R _ _ E. The word ""SURGE"" fits this pattern and uses untested letters U and G.

From the latest feedback on SURGE:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1
- U(x) – U is not in the word
- R(✓) – correct in position 3
- G(x) – G is not in the word
- E(✓) – correct in position 5

So the pattern is now: S _ R _ E

Letters already confirmed:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: E

Letters already excluded:
- L, A, T, H, I, C, O, U, G

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4:
B, D, F, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need common 5-letter words that fit S _ R _ E. Possible candidates:
- S B R E E – invalid (double E, unlikely)
- S D R E D – invalid
- S F R E E – invalid
- S K R E D – invalid
- S N R E D – invalid
- S N R E E – invalid
- S P R E E – invalid
- S P R E D – invalid
- S W R E D – invalid
- S P R E K – invalid
- S P R E N – invalid
- S P R E V – invalid
- S P R E M – invalid
- S P R E N – invalid

Looking for actual words:
- S P R E E – invalid
- S P R E D – invalid
- S P R E K – invalid
- S P R E N – invalid
- S P R E V – invalid
- S P R E M – invalid
- S P R E N – invalid
- S P R E D – invalid

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be S _ R _ E. Common words:
- S B R E E – no
- S D R E D – no
- S F R E E – no
- S K R E D – no
- S N R E D – no
- S N R E E – no
- S P R E E – no
- S P R E D – no
- S W R E D – no
- S P R E K – no
- S P R E N – no
- S P R E V – no
- S P R E M – no
- S P R E N – no
- S P R E D – no

Hmm, this is narrow. Let me check a dictionary for S _ R _ E words:
- S B R E E – no
- S C R E E – C excluded
- S D R E D – no
- S E R R Y – no
- S F R E E – no
- S G R E E – G excluded
- S H R E K – H excluded
- S I R E N – I excluded
- S J R E D – no
- S K R E D – no

- S T R E E – T excluded
- S U R R Y – U excluded
- S V R E D – no
- S W R E D – no
- S X R E D – no
- S Y R E N – no
- S Z R E D – no

The only common word left is ""SHRED"", but H is excluded. ""SKREE"" has K and double E, but K is untested. ""SKREE"" is valid:
- S K R E E – but double E might be possible
- Letters: S, K, R, E, E – K is untested, E is allowed twice

But we need to avoid double letters unless confirmed. Let me think of single-letter possibilities:
- S B R E E – no
- S D R E D – no
- S F R E E – no
- S K R E D – no
- S N R E D – no
- S P R E E – no
- S W R E D – no
- S P R E K – no
- S P R E N – no
- S P R E V – no
- S P R E M – no
- S P R E N – no
- S P R E D – no

Actually, ""SKREE"" is the only valid word left that fits S _ R _ E with untested letters. Let's try it.

But wait, ""SKREE"" has E in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. However, we have only one E confirmed in position 5, so double E is risky. 

Another word: ""SPREE"" – P and double E, but P is untested. However, ""SPREE"" is invalid because P is untested and double E is possible.

Looking back, the only valid word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" uses K which is untested and fits better.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""SPRUE"" – but U is excluded. ""SPREE"" – P is untested, but double E is possible. 

Given constraints, ""SPREE"" seems the closest, even with double E. Alternatively, ""SKREE"".

But ""SKREE"" is less common. Let me think of ""SPREE"" as it's more common.

However, ""SPREE"" has P in position 4 and double E. Since we have no info on P yet, it's acceptable.

But we need to avoid double E unless necessary. 

Actually, the word ""SPRUE"" is invalid (U excluded). 

The correct word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" is more likely.

But let me re-examine: the pattern is S _ R _ E. The only valid word left is ""SKREE"" (S-K-R-E-E) or ""SPREE"" (S-P-R-E-E). Both use untested letters. 

Between these, ""SKREE"" is more common. I'll go with ""SKREE"".The pattern is now S _ R _ E, with positions 1, 3, 5 fixed as S, R, E respectively. Letters already excluded include L, A, T, H, I, C, O, U, G. The only remaining common 5-letter word that fits is ""SKREE"" (S-K-R-E-E).

Let me check a dictionary for S _ R _ E words:\n- S B R E E – no\n- S C R E E – C excluded\n- S D R E D – no\n- S E R R Y – no\n- S F R E E – no\n- S G R E E – G excluded\n- S H R E K – H excluded\n- S I R E N – I excluded\n- S J R E D – no\n- S K R E D – no\n- S L R E D – L excluded\n- S M R E D – no\n- S N R E D – no\n- S O R R Y – O excluded\n- S P R E E – no\n- S P R E D – no\n- S Q R E E – no\n- S R R E D – no\n- S T R E E – T excluded\n- S U R R Y – U excluded\n- S V R E D – no\n- S W R E D – no\n- S X R E D – no\n- S Y R E N – no\n- S Z R E D – no\n\nThe only common word left is ""SHRED"", but H is excluded. ""SKREE"" has K and double E, but K is untested. ""SKREE"" is valid:\n- S K R E E – but double E might be possible\n- Letters: S, K, R, E, E – K is untested, E is allowed twice\n\nBut we need to avoid double letters unless confirmed. Let me think of single-letter possibilities:\n- S B R E E – no\n- S D R E D – no\n- S F R E E – no\n- S K R E D – no\n- S N R E D – no\n- S P R E E – no\n- S W R E D – no\n- S P R E K – no\n- S P R E N – no\n- S P R E V – no\n- S P R E M – no\n- S P R E N – no\n- S P R E D – no\n\nActually, ""SKREE"" is the only valid word left that fits S _ R _ E with untested letters. Let\'s try it.\n\nBut wait, ""SKREE"" has E in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. However, we have only one E confirmed in position 5, so double E is risky. \n\nAnother word: ""SPREE"" – P and double E, but P is untested. However, ""SPREE"" is invalid because P is untested and double E is possible.\n\nLooking back, the only valid word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" uses K which is untested and fits better.\n\nBut let me double-check: is there any other word? ""SPRUE"" – but U is excluded. ""SPREE"" – P is untested, but double E is possible. \n\nGiven constraints, ""SPREE"" seems the closest, even with double E. Alternatively, ""SKREE"".\n\nBut ""SKREE"" is less common. Let me think of ""SPREE"" as it\'s more common.\n\nHowever, ""SPREE"" has P in position 4 and double E. Since we have no info on P yet, it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we need to avoid double E unless necessary. \n\nActually, the word ""SPRUE"" is invalid (U excluded). \n\nThe correct word seems to be ""SKREE"" or ""SPREE"". Between these, ""SKREE"" is more likely.\n\nBut let me re-examine: the pattern is S _ R _ E. The only valid word left is ""SKREE"" (S-K-R-E-E) or ""SPREE"" (S-P-R-E-E). Both use untested letters. \n\nBetween these, ""SKREE"" is more common. I\'ll go with ""SKREE"".The pattern is now S _ R _ E, with positions 1, 3, 5 fixed as S, R, E respectively. Letters already excluded include L, A, T, H, I, C, O, U, G. The only remaining common 5-letter word that fits is ""SKREE"" (S-K-R-E-E).\n\n<guess>SKREE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SHIRE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: SCORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓)\nGuess 4: SURGE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) R(✓) G(x) E(✓)\nGuess 5: SKREE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(x) R(✓) E(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback on SKREE:
- S(✓) – correct in position 1  
- K(x) – K is not in the word  
- R(✓) – correct in position 3  
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
- E(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is: S _ R _ E  
with the additional constraint that the letter E is not in position 4.

Letters already excluded: L, A, T, H, I, C, O, U, G, K  
Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S ? R ? E where the second letter is from the allowed set and the fourth letter is also from the allowed set, and E is only in position 5.

Looking at common English words:
- S B R E E – invalid (double E)  
- S D R E D – invalid  
- S F R E E – invalid  
- S J R E D – invalid  
- S M R E D – invalid  
- S N R E D – invalid  
- S P R E E – invalid (double E)  
- S Q R E E – invalid  
- S V R E D – invalid  
- S W R E D – invalid  
- S X R E D – invalid  
- S Y R E N – invalid (Y in 4th, N in 5th but 5th must be E)  
- S Z R E D – invalid  

The only valid word left that fits S _ R _ E and uses allowed letters is ""SPREE"" (S-P-R-E-E) or ""SNARE"" (but A is excluded), ""SPREE"" seems the closest even though it has double E. However, we know E is only confirmed in position 5, so double E is possible. 

But let me think differently: position 4 must be a letter we haven't used yet. The word ""SPRUE"" is invalid (U excluded). ""SPREE"" is the only remaining common word. 

Actually, there's another word: ""STREE"" (variant spelling of ""street""), but T is excluded. 

Rechecking the allowed letters, the only valid word left is ""SPREE"". Even though it has double E, the feedback only told us E is in position 5, so double E is acceptable.

But wait, ""SPREE"" has P in position 4 and double E. However, we have no info on P yet, so it's acceptable.

But let me think of ""SNARE"" – but A is excluded. 

The correct word must be ""SPREE"" or similar. 

However, ""SPREE"" is the only valid word left. 

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""S W R E E"" – invalid. 

The word must be ""SPREE"". 

But let me think of ""S P R E E"" – yes, that's the only valid word left. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""SPREE"". 

But wait, the feedback on SKREE showed E in position 4 was wrong, but position 5 is correct. So the word is S _ R _ E, with E only in position 5. 

Looking for words like S B R E E (invalid), S P R E E (valid), S N R E E (invalid), etc. 

The only valid word left is ""SPREE"". 

But let me check if there's any other word: ""S P R E E"" is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits S _ R _ E with allowed letters. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""SPREE"". 

But wait, ""SPREE"" has P in position 4 and double E. Since we have no info on P, this is acceptable.

However, the word ""SPREE"" is actually S-P-R-E-E, which fits S _ R _ E with P in position 4 and E in 5. 

Yes, this must be the word.

But let me think if there's any other: ""S M R E E"" – invalid. 

The word must be ""SPREE"". 

But let me think of ""S P R E E"" – yes, this is the only valid word left. 

Therefore, the next guess is ""SPREE"".
