### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stain → S(✓) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Known letters: S (position 1), A (somewhere else), T (somewhere else).
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, I, N.
- Remaining common letters to test: L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A and T somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N.

Possible candidates:
- SATUR → but U is okay, but SATUR is 6 letters.
- STAMP → contains P, M, but A is in position 2 (was wrong there in stain).
- SALT? → but L is okay, but A is in position 2 (wrong there).
- SCAT? → C is okay, A in 3 (wrong there).
- STASH → H is okay, but S is repeated (we already know S is in 1).
- SPLIT → P, L, I (I excluded), so no.
- SQUAT → Q is okay, but U is okay, but A in 3 (wrong there).

Wait, we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from arose and stain).
- T is in the word but not in position 2.

So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is S, so 3, 4, or 5.

Let's try to construct:
S _ _ _ _ with A and T in remaining positions.

Possible words:
- SAT _ _ : but A in 2 was wrong in stain (T was in 2, A in 3 was wrong). So A in 2 is possible? Wait, in stain, A was in 3 and marked (-), meaning A is in word but not 3. So A could be 2,4,5. Similarly T was in 2 and marked (-), so T is in word but not 2, so could be 3,4,5.

Let's try SAT _ _ but A in 2. However in stain, A was in 3 (wrong), but that doesn't preclude A in 2. However, in arose, A was in 1 (wrong), so A could be 2. So SAT _ _ is possible. But we need to test T somewhere.

But we need to include both A and T. So SAT _ _ would have A in 2, but where is T? It must be in 3,4,5.

But we need to test new letters. Let's try ""STAMP"":
- S (fixed in 1).
- T in 2 (but stain said T is not in 2), so this is invalid.

Next, ""SQUAD"":
- S (1), Q, U, A (4), D. But A was not in 4 in stain (it was in 3 and marked wrong), but that doesn't preclude A in 4. However, we need to include T. So this is missing T.

We need a word with S, A, T, and two new letters, avoiding excluded ones.

Let's try ""STASH"":
- S (1), T (2) - but T can't be in 2 (stain said T is not in 2). So invalid.

Next, ""SALTY"":
- S (1), A (2), L, T (4), Y. This has:
   - S in 1 (✓ from stain).
   - A in 2 (was in 3 in stain, marked wrong, so 2 is allowed).
   - T in 4 (was in 2 in stain, marked wrong, so 4 is allowed).
   - L and Y are new letters to test.
   - No excluded letters (R,O,E,I,N).

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""SATIN"" - but N is excluded.

""SATUR"" - 6 letters.

""SAUCY"" - has C,Y, but no T.

""SAVYT"" - not a valid word.

""SALTY"" seems the best.

Let's verify:
S A L T Y
- S (1) ✓
- A in 2 (was wrong in 3 in stain, so allowed)
- T in 4 (was wrong in 2 in stain, so allowed)
- L and Y are new letters.
- No R,O,E,I,N.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) → O is NOT the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Must include: A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively).
- Must exclude: R, O, E.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.  
We want a word that:
- Uses A and S in different positions.
- Avoids R, O, E.
- Uses new common letters to maximize info.

A strong candidate is “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (was wrong in 4, so this is new info).
- T, I, N are common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- A is now in position 2 (was wrong in 1, so this is new info).
- No R, O, or E.

This should help narrow down positions for A and S and test T, I, N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: stain -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stain → S(✓) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Known letters: S (position 1), A (somewhere else), T (somewhere else).
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, I, N.
- Remaining common letters to test: L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A and T somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N.

Possible candidates:
- SATUR → but U is okay, but SATUR is 6 letters.
- STAMP → contains P, M, but A is in position 2 (was wrong there in stain).
- SALT? → but L is okay, but A is in position 2 (wrong there).
- SCAT? → C is okay, A in 3 (wrong there).
- STASH → H is okay, but S is repeated (we already know S is in 1).
- SPLIT → P, L, I (I excluded), so no.
- SQUAT → Q is okay, but U is okay, but A in 3 (wrong there).

Wait, we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from arose and stain).
- T is in the word but not in position 2.

So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
T must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is S, so 3, 4, or 5.

Let's try to construct:
S _ _ _ _ with A and T in remaining positions.

Possible words:
- SAT _ _ : but A in 2 was wrong in stain (T was in 2, A in 3 was wrong). So A in 2 is possible? Wait, in stain, A was in 3 and marked (-), meaning A is in word but not 3. So A could be 2,4,5. Similarly T was in 2 and marked (-), so T is in word but not 2, so could be 3,4,5.

Let's try SAT _ _ but A in 2. However in stain, A was in 3 (wrong), but that doesn't preclude A in 2. However, in arose, A was in 1 (wrong), so A could be 2. So SAT _ _ is possible. But we need to test T somewhere.

But we need to include both A and T. So SAT _ _ would have A in 2, but where is T? It must be in 3,4,5.

But we need to test new letters. Let's try ""STAMP"":
- S (fixed in 1).
- T in 2 (but stain said T is not in 2), so this is invalid.

Next, ""SQUAD"":
- S (1), Q, U, A (4), D. But A was not in 4 in stain (it was in 3 and marked wrong), but that doesn't preclude A in 4. However, we need to include T. So this is missing T.

We need a word with S, A, T, and two new letters, avoiding excluded ones.

Let's try ""STASH"":
- S (1), T (2) - but T can't be in 2 (stain said T is not in 2). So invalid.

Next, ""SALTY"":
- S (1), A (2), L, T (4), Y. This has:
   - S in 1 (✓ from stain).
   - A in 2 (was in 3 in stain, marked wrong, so 2 is allowed).
   - T in 4 (was in 2 in stain, marked wrong, so 4 is allowed).
   - L and Y are new letters to test.
   - No excluded letters (R,O,E,I,N).

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""SATIN"" - but N is excluded.

""SATUR"" - 6 letters.

""SAUCY"" - has C,Y, but no T.

""SAVYT"" - not a valid word.

""SALTY"" seems the best.

Let's verify:
S A L T Y
- S (1) ✓
- A in 2 (was wrong in 3 in stain, so allowed)
- T in 4 (was wrong in 2 in stain, so allowed)
- L and Y are new letters.
- No R,O,E,I,N.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

Let's consolidate everything we know after the three guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   - S is still in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L and Y are absent.
   - T is in the word but not in position 4.

Current constraints:
- Word structure: S _ _ _ _
- Must contain: A (not in 1, 2, or 3) → A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Must contain: T (not in 2 or 4) → T must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, I, N, L, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing both A and T, with A in 4 or 5, and T in 3, 4, or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible positions:
- If A is in 4: then T must be in 3 or 5.
- If A is in 5: then T must be in 3 or 4.

Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: A in 4
S _ T A _
Possible letters for positions 2 and 5 (from remaining): C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, etc.
Looking for valid words:
- STACH? Not a word.
- STAMP? A is in 4, but M,P are okay. Wait, STAMP has A in 3, which is excluded. So no.
- SUTAH? Not a word.
- STHAT? Not a word.
- SUTAH? Not a word.

Case 2: A in 5
S _ _ _ A
T must be in 3 or 4.
Subcase 2a: T in 3

S H T _ A → ""SHATA""? Not valid.
S C T _ A → ""SC T _ A"": ""SCUBA"" but U and B are okay? But B is not tested yet, but we need to include T in 3 and A in 5. ""SCUBA"" has B and U, but no T in 3. So no.

S P U T A → ""SPUTA""? Not a word.
S H U T A → ""SHUTA""? Not a word.

S C A T A → A in 2, excluded.
S C U T A → ""SCUTA"" not valid.
S C H T A → not valid.
