### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word
4. It has no repeating letters, maximizing letter coverage

This will give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already confirmed).

Let’s try a word that uses O in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It contains O (in position 2, which is allowed since O was only ruled out of position 3).
- It introduces P, I, N, T – all common letters not yet tested.
- It avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

Let’s go with POINT.

   – O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it was marked “-”).
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   – N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with P and ends with T: P _ _ _ T
- Contains O and I, but O cannot be in positions 2 or 3, and I cannot be in position 3.
- Cannot contain A, R, S, E, N.

Remaining possible positions for O: 4 (since 1 and 5 are taken by P and T, 2 and 3 are ruled out by the feedback).

Remaining possible positions for I: 2 or 4 (but 4 might be taken by O).

Let’s try to place O in position 4 and I in position 2:
P I _ O T

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits P I _ O T. The missing letter must be common and not yet ruled out. Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, etc.

Testing “PILOT”:
- P(✓) I(✓) L(?) O(✓) T(✓)
- L hasn’t been tested yet and is allowed.
- Word is valid.

Let’s check if “PILOT” satisfies all constraints:
- P in position 1: ✓
- I in position 2: allowed (only position 3 was ruled out for I)
- O in position 4: allowed (positions 2 and 3 were ruled out for O)
- T in position 5: ✓
- No A, R, S, E, N: ✓
- L is a new letter, giving us more information.

Therefore, “PILOT” is a good next guess.
