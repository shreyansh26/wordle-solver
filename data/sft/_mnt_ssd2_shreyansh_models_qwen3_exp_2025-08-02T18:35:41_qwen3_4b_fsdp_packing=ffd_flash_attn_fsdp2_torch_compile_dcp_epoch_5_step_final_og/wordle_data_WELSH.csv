### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in common positions. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in different positions. This should give me good feedback about which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Has an E in positions 1-4.
3. Avoids A, R, O.

I’ll pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are T, N, L, I, C, etc. I’ll try “STILE”:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Has E in position 4 (✓).
- Uses T, I, L which haven’t been tested yet.

- HELPS (H, E, L, P, S)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in common positions. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in different positions. This should give me good feedback about which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Has an E in positions 1-4.
3. Avoids A, R, O.

I’ll pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are T, N, L, I, C, etc. I’ll try “STILE”:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Has E in position 4 (✓).
- Uses T, I, L which haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, R, O (✓).

   - S is locked in position 5.

   - A, R, O are excluded.

   - T, I are excluded.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known) or 4 (now confirmed).

So far:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains E, L, and S (S already placed at 5).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E and L.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with E and L somewhere in positions 1-4, using only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- CLEFS (but F and second L are allowed? Wait, we don't know about F yet.)
- HELPS (H, E, L, P, S)
- MELTS (M, E, L, T, S) – but T is excluded.
- BELLS (B, E, L, L, S) – double L allowed?
- CELLS (C, E, L, L, S)

Let’s pick HELPS:
- Ends with S.
- Contains E and L.
- Uses H, E, L, P, S – none of the excluded letters.

But let me check if HELPS is valid: yes, it is a 5-letter English word.

Another option is BELLS:
- B, E, L, L, S – also valid.

Between these, HELPS seems simpler with distinct letters. I’ll go with HELPS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in common positions. A good strategy is to use a word with no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in different positions. This should give me good feedback about which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Has an E in positions 1-4.
3. Avoids A, R, O.

I’ll pick a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates are T, N, L, I, C, etc. I’ll try “STILE”:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Has E in position 4 (✓).
- Uses T, I, L which haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, R, O (✓).

Guess 2: stile -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) L(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is locked in position 5.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A, R, O are excluded.

2. stile → S(-) T(x) I(x) L(-) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (already known to be in 5).
   - T, I are excluded.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known) or 4 (now confirmed).

So far:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains E, L, and S (S already placed at 5).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E and L.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with E and L somewhere in positions 1-4, using only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- CLEFS (but F and second L are allowed? Wait, we don't know about F yet.)
- HELPS (H, E, L, P, S)
- MELTS (M, E, L, T, S) – but T is excluded.
- BELLS (B, E, L, L, S) – double L allowed?
- CELLS (C, E, L, L, S)

Let’s pick HELPS:
- Ends with S.
- Contains E and L.
- Uses H, E, L, P, S – none of the excluded letters.

But let me check if HELPS is valid: yes, it is a 5-letter English word.

Another option is BELLS:
- B, E, L, L, S – also valid.

Between these, HELPS seems simpler with distinct letters. I’ll go with HELPS.

Guess 3: helps -> FEEDBACK: H(-) E(✓) L(✓) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed at position 5.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. stile → S(-) T(x) I(x) L(-) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not at position 1 (already known to be at 5).
   - L is in the word but not at position 4.
   - E is in the word but not at position 4 or 5.

3. helps → H(-) E(✓) L(✓) P(x) S(-)
   - E is now confirmed at position 2.
   - L is confirmed at position 3.
   - S is in the word but not at position 4 (consistent with previous info).
   - P is excluded.

Current known pattern: _ E L _ S
Letters already excluded: A, R, O, T, I, P
Letters already confirmed: E (pos 2), L (pos 3), S (pos 5)

We need a 5-letter word matching the pattern: ? E L ? S
Possible letters for positions 1 and 4, excluding A, R, O, T, I, P.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting ? E L ? S:
- B E L L S → B E L L S (but L is already at pos 3, and we have L at pos 3 and 4 – double L allowed?)
- C E L L S → C E L L S
- F E L L S → F E L L S
- G E L S ? – needs 5 letters ending in S.
- M E L D S – ends with S? No, ends with S? MELDS ends with S? Yes, M E L D S.
- N E L D S – but D is allowed.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- BELLS
- CELLS
- FELLS
- MELDS
- NELDS (not a common word)
- GELDS (not a word)
- HELDS (not a word)

Among these, BELLS, CELLS, FELLS, MELDS are valid. BELLS and CELLS have double L which is allowed. Between these, BELLS is more common.

But let’s check if any other constraints apply. We have no info about B, C, F, M yet. BELLS uses B which hasn’t been tested.

I’ll choose BELLS as it’s a common word and tests B.

From all feedback so far:

Pattern locked in:

- Position 3: L (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

So the word is: _ E L _ S

Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, T, I, P, B

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (excluding the banned list):
1st position: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
4th position: same, but we want common letters.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in “ELS”:
- CELLS (C E L L S) – L appears twice, but position 4 would be L which is allowed
- FELLS (F E L L S)
- GELDS (not a word)
- HELPS (P excluded)
- MELDS (M E L D S)
- NELDS (not a word)
- VELDS (not a word)

Among these, CELLS and FELLS are both valid. Between them, CELLS is more common.
