For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
2. It contains R and E, but R is not in the second position and E is not in the fifth position.
3. It does not contain A or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter
- Contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain A or S

Possible candidates: TROPE, GROPE, PROVE, CRORE, DROVE, etc.

Looking at these, ""TROPE"" fits:
- T _ O P E
- R is in the word (position 2, which wasn't ruled out)
- E is in the word (position 5, but this was ruled out as wrong position for E)
Wait, in AROSE E was in position 5, and feedback was E(-), so E cannot be in position 5. So TROPE would put E in position 5 again, which is invalid.

Next: ""GROPE"" - same issue, E in position 5.

""PROVE"" - O is in position 3, R in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""DROVE"" - same problem with E in position 5.

""CRORE"" - O in position 3, R in positions 2 and 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""VOICE"" - but this has I and C, which we haven't tested yet, but we know O is correct in position 3.

Wait, let's think differently: since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try ""ROE"" as a prefix but need 5 letters. ""ROE"" plus two more letters not A/S. ""ROE"" is 3 letters.

""ORE"" is 3 letters.

""R"" is in word, not in position 2.

Let's try ""CORER"":
- C _ O R E
- O is correct in position 3
- R is in positions 4 and 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 5 (disallowed)

Hmm.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
2. It contains R and E, but R is not in the second position and E is not in the fifth position.
3. It does not contain A or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter
- Contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain A or S

Possible candidates: TROPE, GROPE, PROVE, CRORE, DROVE, etc.

Looking at these, ""TROPE"" fits:
- T _ O P E
- R is in the word (position 2, which wasn't ruled out)
- E is in the word (position 5, but this was ruled out as wrong position for E)
Wait, in AROSE E was in position 5, and feedback was E(-), so E cannot be in position 5. So TROPE would put E in position 5 again, which is invalid.

Next: ""GROPE"" - same issue, E in position 5.

""PROVE"" - O is in position 3, R in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""DROVE"" - same problem with E in position 5.

""CRORE"" - O in position 3, R in positions 2 and 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""VOICE"" - but this has I and C, which we haven't tested yet, but we know O is correct in position 3.

Wait, let's think differently: since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try ""ROE"" as a prefix but need 5 letters. ""ROE"" plus two more letters not A/S. ""ROE"" is 3 letters.

""ORE"" is 3 letters.

""R"" is in word, not in position 2.

Let's try ""CORER"":
- C _ O R E
- O is correct in position 3
- R is in positions 4 and 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 5 (disallowed)

Hmm.

""FORGE"":
- F _ O R G E
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (disallowed)

""POKER"":
- P _ O K E R
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was in position 5 before)
This seems valid.

""POKER"" fits all constraints:
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 5 (not in position 2, so allowed)
- E in position 4 (not in position 5, so allowed)
- Does not contain A or S
- All letters are valid and not yet ruled outBased on the feedback, the word has O in the third position, contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out), and does not contain A or S. A good next guess is ""POKER"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: POKER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POKER:
- P is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – confirms O is the 3rd letter
- K is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so E is the 4th letter
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 5th letter

So the pattern is now: _ _ O E R

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, P, K  
Letters we know ARE in the word and in their correct positions: O (3), E (4), R (5)

We still need the 1st and 2nd letters.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any letter except A, S, P, K.  
We also know from earlier that the word must contain R and E (which we already placed), so no additional constraints on those letters.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Possible second letters: same set, excluding any already used (O, E, R).

Let’s try a word that fits _ _ O E R and uses new letters.  
""FOGER"" – but G is allowed, F is allowed, but we already know E and R are correct.  
""F"" and ""G"" haven’t been tested yet, so ""FOGER"" is valid.

Another option: ""COBER"" – but ""COBER"" isn’t a common English word.  
""DOVER"" – but V is allowed, D is allowed, but we already have R in position 5.

""FOGER"" seems like a good next guess.

- Has O as the third letter
- Contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out)

Possible candidates: TROPE, GROPE, PROVE, CRORE, DROVE, etc.

Looking at these, ""TROPE"" fits:
- T _ O P E
- R is in the word (position 2, which wasn't ruled out)
- E is in the word (position 5, but this was ruled out as wrong position for E)
Wait, in AROSE E was in position 5, and feedback was E(-), so E cannot be in position 5. So TROPE would put E in position 5 again, which is invalid.

Next: ""GROPE"" - same issue, E in position 5.

""PROVE"" - O is in position 3, R in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""CRORE"" - O in position 3, R in positions 2 and 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → third letter is O
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
2. It contains R and E, but R is not in the second position and E is not in the fifth position.
3. It does not contain A or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter
- Contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain A or S

Possible candidates: TROPE, GROPE, PROVE, CRORE, DROVE, etc.

Looking at these, ""TROPE"" fits:
- T _ O P E
- R is in the word (position 2, which wasn't ruled out)
- E is in the word (position 5, but this was ruled out as wrong position for E)
Wait, in AROSE E was in position 5, and feedback was E(-), so E cannot be in position 5. So TROPE would put E in position 5 again, which is invalid.

Next: ""GROPE"" - same issue, E in position 5.

""PROVE"" - O is in position 3, R in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""DROVE"" - same problem with E in position 5.

""CRORE"" - O in position 3, R in positions 2 and 4 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed).

""VOICE"" - but this has I and C, which we haven't tested yet, but we know O is correct in position 3.

Wait, let's think differently: since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Let's try ""ROE"" as a prefix but need 5 letters. ""ROE"" plus two more letters not A/S. ""ROE"" is 3 letters.

""ORE"" is 3 letters.

""R"" is in word, not in position 2.

Let's try ""CORER"":
- C _ O R E
- O is correct in position 3
- R is in positions 4 and 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 5 (disallowed)

Hmm.

""FORGE"":
- F _ O R G E
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 (disallowed)

""POKER"":
- P _ O K E R
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was in position 5 before)
This seems valid.

""POKER"" fits all constraints:
- O in position 3 (correct)
- R in position 5 (not in position 2, so allowed)
- E in position 4 (not in position 5, so allowed)
- Does not contain A or S
- All letters are valid and not yet ruled outBased on the feedback, the word has O in the third position, contains R and E (but not in the positions already ruled out), and does not contain A or S. A good next guess is ""POKER"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POKER -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POKER:
- P is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – confirms O is the 3rd letter
- K is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so E is the 4th letter
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 5th letter

So the pattern is now: _ _ O E R

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, P, K  
Letters we know ARE in the word and in their correct positions: O (3), E (4), R (5)

We still need the 1st and 2nd letters.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): any letter except A, S, P, K.  
We also know from earlier that the word must contain R and E (which we already placed), so no additional constraints on those letters.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Possible second letters: same set, excluding any already used (O, E, R).

Let’s try a word that fits _ _ O E R and uses new letters.  
""FOGER"" – but G is allowed, F is allowed, but we already know E and R are correct.  
""F"" and ""G"" haven’t been tested yet, so ""FOGER"" is valid.

Another option: ""COBER"" – but ""COBER"" isn’t a common English word.  
""DOVER"" – but V is allowed, D is allowed, but we already have R in position 5.

""FOGER"" seems like a good next guess.

We now know the pattern is _ _ O E R and the letters already ruled out for positions 1 and 2 are: A, S, P, K, F, G, C, V, N, D.

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2 (still untested): B, H, L, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit _ _ O E R using only these remaining letters:

- B: BOBER (invalid), B _ O E R → ""BOGER"" (G ruled out)
- H: HOVER (V ruled out), H _ O E R → ""HOPER"" (P ruled out)
- L: L _ O E R → ""LOPER"" (P ruled out), ""LOVER"" (V ruled out)
- M: M _ O E R → ""MOBER"" (invalid), ""MOVER"" (V ruled out)
- T: T _ O E R → ""TOBER"" (invalid), ""TOVER"" (V ruled out)
- W: W _ O E R → ""WOBER"" (invalid), ""WOVER"" (V ruled out)
- Y: Y _ O E R → ""YODER"" (D ruled out), ""YOPER"" (P ruled out)

The only remaining valid word that fits is ""BORED"" (B, O, R, E, D), but D was already ruled out in position 2.  
Another valid word is ""WORER"" (W, O, R, E, R), but R is already in position 5 and we don't know if R is duplicated.

Actually, let's re-examine: we need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2, neither of which has been ruled out.  
From the remaining letters: B, H, L, M, T, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- B and H → ""BHOER"" (invalid)
- B and L → ""BLOER"" (invalid)
- B and M → ""BMOER"" (invalid)
- B and T → ""BTOER"" (invalid)
- B and W → ""BWOER"" (invalid)
- B and Y → ""BYOER"" (invalid)

None of these form valid English words.  
Looking again, the only valid English word left that fits _ _ O E R and uses only the still-allowed letters is ""BROER"" (B, R, O, E, R), but R is already in position 5 and we don't know if it appears twice.

However, ""BROER"" is a valid word (a Dutch surname).  
But let's check if any other word exists: ""THOER"" (invalid), ""MHOER"" (invalid), etc.

Actually, the only valid English word left is ""WORER"" (W, O, R, E, R).  
Let's verify:
- W: not ruled out
- O: correct position
- R: already known to be in position 5
- E: correct position
- R: duplicate allowed

""WORER"" fits all constraints.

But let's check if there's a more common word.  
Another possibility is ""TOWER"" (T, O, W, E, R), but W is allowed and T is allowed, and it fits _ _ O E R.

""TOWER"" uses T and W, both still allowed.

This seems like the best next guess.
