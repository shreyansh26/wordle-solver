For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because:
- C and R are common consonants
- A and E are common vowels
- N is also a very common letter
- It covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word efficiently.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)

- A: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the 3rd letter
- N: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ A _ _
- It contains the letter E somewhere other than the last position
- It does NOT contain C, R, or N

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, B, M, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are already confirmed)

We need a word that:

- Does NOT contain C, R, or N

Possible patterns:

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits these constraints. ""STEAL"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses S, T, L which are common. However, it doesn't use E in position 1 or 2. Another option is ""PEACH"" but it has C which is forbidden. ""PLATE"" has E in position 4 and uses P, L, T which are good. ""PLATE"" seems like a good choice:
- P: not yet ruled out
- L: not yet ruled out
- A: correct position
- T: not yet ruled out
- E: in the word, position 4 is allowed

This should give us good information about P, L, T and confirm the placement of A and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - 3rd letter is A (from both guesses).

2. Letters that are somewhere in the word but not in the positions tried so far:
   - E (not in 4th position from PLATE, not in 5th position from CRANE)
   - L (not in 2nd position from PLATE)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T

So the word looks like:
_ _ A _ _  (with A locked in 3rd place)

And must contain E and L somewhere, with:
- E not in 4th or 5th position → E must be 1st or 2nd.
- L not in 2nd position → L must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.

Possible patterns:
E _ A _ _
_ E A _ _
_ _ A _ L
_ _ A L _

We need a word that uses only the remaining unused letters (no C, R, N, P, T) and fits one of these patterns.

Let's try:
E _ A _ _
Looking for common words: EASED (but S and D are allowed), EAGLE (G is allowed), EARTH (but T is forbidden), EVADE (V and D are allowed), ELATE (but T is forbidden).

EAGLE seems good:
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- G is new
- L in 4th (allowed)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th from CRANE feedback) → conflict. So EAGLE is invalid.

Next option: _ E A _ _
Possible: BEACH (C forbidden), DEBIT (T forbidden), FEVER (R forbidden), LEAVE (L in 1st, E in 2nd, A in 3rd, V in 4th, E in 5th). But E in 5th is invalid.

Next pattern: _ _ A _ L
Looking for words ending in AL: VITAL (T forbidden), HABIT (T forbidden), SALAD (S, A, D allowed but A is 3rd), but SALAD has A in 3rd and ends in D, not L.

Next pattern: _ _ A L _
Looking for words with AL in 3-4: but 3rd is A, so AL would be 3-4, but 3rd is A, so 4th is L. So _ _ A L _

Possible: GULAL (not common), SALAD (doesn't fit), but SALAD has A in 3rd and L in 4th, but ends in D.

Wait, let's think differently. We need:
- A in 3rd
- E and L somewhere
- No C, R, N, P, T

Possible words:
- BLEAT (T forbidden)
- DREAD (R forbidden)
- GLEAM (M is allowed, but A is 3rd, E is 4th, but E cannot be 4th from PLATE feedback)
- SLEET (T forbidden)
- VELAR (R forbidden)
- WIELD (D is allowed, but E is 4th which is invalid)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try:
E _ A L _
Looking for E in 1st, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 5th letter not forbidden.

E G A L _ → EGAL_ → EGALY (not a word), EGALS (plural, but 5 letters), but EGALS is valid.

But EGALS is 5 letters: E, G, A, L, S. Let's check:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- G new
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
This seems valid and hasn't used any forbidden letters.

Another option: _ E A L _

B E A L _ → BEALS (valid word)
D E A L _ → DEALS (valid)
F E A L _ → FEALS (valid)
S E A L _ → SEALED (6 letters), SEALED is invalid.

BEALS, DEALS, FEALS are all valid 5-letter words.

Let's pick BEALS:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because:
- C and R are common consonants
- A and E are common vowels
- N is also a very common letter
- It covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the 3rd letter
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ A _ _
- It contains the letter E somewhere other than the last position
- It does NOT contain C, R, or N

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, B, M, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are already confirmed)

We need a word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 3 is already A, so 1, 2, or 4)
- Does NOT contain C, R, or N

Possible patterns:
E _ A _ _
_ E A _ _
_ _ A E _

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits these constraints. ""STEAL"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses S, T, L which are common. However, it doesn't use E in position 1 or 2. Another option is ""PEACH"" but it has C which is forbidden. ""PLATE"" has E in position 4 and uses P, L, T which are good. ""PLATE"" seems like a good choice:
- P: not yet ruled out
- L: not yet ruled out
- A: correct position
- T: not yet ruled out
- E: in the word, position 4 is allowed

This should give us good information about P, L, T and confirm the placement of A and E.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - 3rd letter is A (from both guesses).

2. Letters that are somewhere in the word but not in the positions tried so far:
   - E (not in 4th position from PLATE, not in 5th position from CRANE)
   - L (not in 2nd position from PLATE)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T

So the word looks like:
_ _ A _ _  (with A locked in 3rd place)

And must contain E and L somewhere, with:
- E not in 4th or 5th position → E must be 1st or 2nd.
- L not in 2nd position → L must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.

Possible patterns:
E _ A _ _
_ E A _ _
_ _ A _ L
_ _ A L _

We need a word that uses only the remaining unused letters (no C, R, N, P, T) and fits one of these patterns.

Let's try:
E _ A _ _
Looking for common words: EASED (but S and D are allowed), EAGLE (G is allowed), EARTH (but T is forbidden), EVADE (V and D are allowed), ELATE (but T is forbidden).

EAGLE seems good:
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- G is new
- L in 4th (allowed)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th from CRANE feedback) → conflict. So EAGLE is invalid.

Next option: _ E A _ _
Possible: BEACH (C forbidden), DEBIT (T forbidden), FEVER (R forbidden), LEAVE (L in 1st, E in 2nd, A in 3rd, V in 4th, E in 5th). But E in 5th is invalid.

Next pattern: _ _ A _ L
Looking for words ending in AL: VITAL (T forbidden), HABIT (T forbidden), SALAD (S, A, D allowed but A is 3rd), but SALAD has A in 3rd and ends in D, not L.

Next pattern: _ _ A L _
Looking for words with AL in 3-4: but 3rd is A, so AL would be 3-4, but 3rd is A, so 4th is L. So _ _ A L _

Possible: GULAL (not common), SALAD (doesn't fit), but SALAD has A in 3rd and L in 4th, but ends in D.

Wait, let's think differently. We need:
- A in 3rd
- E and L somewhere
- No C, R, N, P, T

Possible words:
- BLEAT (T forbidden)
- DREAD (R forbidden)
- GLEAM (M is allowed, but A is 3rd, E is 4th, but E cannot be 4th from PLATE feedback)
- SLEET (T forbidden)
- VELAR (R forbidden)
- WIELD (D is allowed, but E is 4th which is invalid)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try:
E _ A L _
Looking for E in 1st, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 5th letter not forbidden.

E G A L _ → EGAL_ → EGALY (not a word), EGALS (plural, but 5 letters), but EGALS is valid.

But EGALS is 5 letters: E, G, A, L, S. Let's check:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- G new
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
This seems valid and hasn't used any forbidden letters.

Another option: _ E A L _
Looking for E in 2nd, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 1st letter not forbidden.

B E A L _ → BEALS (valid word)
D E A L _ → DEALS (valid)
F E A L _ → FEALS (valid)
S E A L _ → SEALED (6 letters), SEALED is invalid.

BEALS, DEALS, FEALS are all valid 5-letter words.

Let's pick BEALS:
- B new
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
No forbidden letters.

This seems like a good third guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Fixed letters:

   - 2nd letter is E (from BEALS)

   So the pattern is: _ E A _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - L (from PLATE and BEALS: L is in the word but not in 2nd or 4th positions)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T, B, S

4. Therefore:
   - L must be in the 1st or 5th position (since it can't be 2nd or 4th)
   - The remaining letters (positions 1, 4, 5) must come from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- L E A _ _  (L in 1st)
- _ E A _ L  (L in 5th)

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: L E A _ _
Looking for 5-letter words starting with L, second letter E, third A.
- LEAF_ → LEAFY (but Y is allowed)
- LEAG_ → LEAGU (not a word), LEAGY (not a word)
- LEAK_ → LEAKY (valid)
- LEAM_ → LEAMY (not a word)
- LEAP_ → LEAPS (but S is forbidden)
- LEAR_ → LEARN (R forbidden), LEARS (S forbidden)
- LEAFY, LEAKY are both valid and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 2: _ E A _ L
Looking for words with L in 5th position.
- D E A L L → DEALS (but S is forbidden)
- F E A R L → FEARL (not a word)
- G E A R L → GEARL (not a word)
- M E A K L → MEAKL (not a word)
- V E A L _ → V E A L _ (no 5-letter word ending in L with these letters)

Pattern 1 seems more promising with LEAFY and LEAKY.

Between these two:
- LEAFY: F and Y are new letters.
- LEAKY: K and Y are new letters.

Both are valid, but LEAKY uses K which is slightly less common than F. However, LEAFY is more common. Let's go with LEAFY first.

But wait, let's double-check:
- LEAFY: L, E, A, F, Y
   - L: allowed in 1st position (confirmed in word)
   - E: confirmed in 2nd position
   - A: confirmed in 3rd position
   - F: new letter
   - Y: new letter
   - No forbidden letters.

- WIELD (D is allowed, but E is 4th which is invalid)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try:
E _ A L _
Looking for E in 1st, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 5th letter not forbidden.

E G A L _ → EGAL_ → EGALY (not a word), EGALS (plural, but 5 letters), but EGALS is valid.

But EGALS is 5 letters: E, G, A, L, S. Let's check:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- G new
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
This seems valid and hasn't used any forbidden letters.

Another option: _ E A L _
Looking for E in 2nd, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 1st letter not forbidden.

B E A L _ → BEALS (valid word)
D E A L _ → DEALS (valid)
F E A L _ → FEALS (valid)
S E A L _ → SEALED (6 letters), SEALED is invalid.

BEALS, DEALS, FEALS are all valid 5-letter words.

Let's pick BEALS:
- B new
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
No forbidden letters.

This seems like a good third guess.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - 3rd letter is A (from CRANE, PLATE, BEALS)
   - 2nd letter is E (from BEALS)

   So the pattern is: _ E A _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - L (from PLATE and BEALS: L is in the word but not in 2nd or 4th positions)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T, B, S

4. Therefore:
   - L must be in the 1st or 5th position (since it can't be 2nd or 4th)
   - The remaining letters (positions 1, 4, 5) must come from the unused alphabet excluding the forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- L E A _ _  (L in 1st)
- _ E A _ L  (L in 5th)

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: L E A _ _
Looking for 5-letter words starting with L, second letter E, third A.
- LEAF_ → LEAFY (but Y is allowed)
- LEAG_ → LEAGU (not a word), LEAGY (not a word)
- LEAK_ → LEAKY (valid)
- LEAM_ → LEAMY (not a word)
- LEAP_ → LEAPS (but S is forbidden)
- LEAR_ → LEARN (R forbidden), LEARS (S forbidden)
- LEAFY, LEAKY are both valid and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 2: _ E A _ L
Looking for words with L in 5th position.
- D E A L L → DEALS (but S is forbidden)
- F E A R L → FEARL (not a word)
- G E A R L → GEARL (not a word)
- M E A K L → MEAKL (not a word)
- V E A L _ → V E A L _ (no 5-letter word ending in L with these letters)

Pattern 1 seems more promising with LEAFY and LEAKY.

Between these two:
- LEAFY: F and Y are new letters.
- LEAKY: K and Y are new letters.

Both are valid, but LEAKY uses K which is slightly less common than F. However, LEAFY is more common. Let's go with LEAFY first.

But wait, let's double-check:
- LEAFY: L, E, A, F, Y
   - L: allowed in 1st position (confirmed in word)
   - E: confirmed in 2nd position
   - A: confirmed in 3rd position
   - F: new letter
   - Y: new letter
   - No forbidden letters.

This seems perfect.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because:
- C and R are common consonants
- A and E are common vowels
- N is also a very common letter
- It covers 5 distinct letters, giving maximum information

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the 3rd letter
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ A _ _
- It contains the letter E somewhere other than the last position
- It does NOT contain C, R, or N

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, B, M, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are already confirmed)

We need a word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 3 is already A, so 1, 2, or 4)
- Does NOT contain C, R, or N

Possible patterns:
E _ A _ _
_ E A _ _
_ _ A E _

Let's pick a word that uses common letters and fits these constraints. ""STEAL"" comes to mind, but it has A in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses S, T, L which are common. However, it doesn't use E in position 1 or 2. Another option is ""PEACH"" but it has C which is forbidden. ""PLATE"" has E in position 4 and uses P, L, T which are good. ""PLATE"" seems like a good choice:
- P: not yet ruled out
- L: not yet ruled out
- A: correct position
- T: not yet ruled out
- E: in the word, position 4 is allowed

This should give us good information about P, L, T and confirm the placement of A and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - 3rd letter is A (from both guesses).

2. Letters that are somewhere in the word but not in the positions tried so far:
   - E (not in 4th position from PLATE, not in 5th position from CRANE)
   - L (not in 2nd position from PLATE)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T

So the word looks like:
_ _ A _ _  (with A locked in 3rd place)

And must contain E and L somewhere, with:
- E not in 4th or 5th position → E must be 1st or 2nd.
- L not in 2nd position → L must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.

Possible patterns:
E _ A _ _
_ E A _ _
_ _ A _ L
_ _ A L _

We need a word that uses only the remaining unused letters (no C, R, N, P, T) and fits one of these patterns.

Let's try:
E _ A _ _
Looking for common words: EASED (but S and D are allowed), EAGLE (G is allowed), EARTH (but T is forbidden), EVADE (V and D are allowed), ELATE (but T is forbidden).

EAGLE seems good:
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- G is new
- L in 4th (allowed)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th from CRANE feedback) → conflict. So EAGLE is invalid.

Next option: _ E A _ _
Possible: BEACH (C forbidden), DEBIT (T forbidden), FEVER (R forbidden), LEAVE (L in 1st, E in 2nd, A in 3rd, V in 4th, E in 5th). But E in 5th is invalid.

Next pattern: _ _ A _ L
Looking for words ending in AL: VITAL (T forbidden), HABIT (T forbidden), SALAD (S, A, D allowed but A is 3rd), but SALAD has A in 3rd and ends in D, not L.

Next pattern: _ _ A L _
Looking for words with AL in 3-4: but 3rd is A, so AL would be 3-4, but 3rd is A, so 4th is L. So _ _ A L _

Possible: GULAL (not common), SALAD (doesn't fit), but SALAD has A in 3rd and L in 4th, but ends in D.

Wait, let's think differently. We need:
- A in 3rd
- E and L somewhere
- No C, R, N, P, T

Possible words:
- BLEAT (T forbidden)
- DREAD (R forbidden)
- GLEAM (M is allowed, but A is 3rd, E is 4th, but E cannot be 4th from PLATE feedback)
- SLEET (T forbidden)
- VELAR (R forbidden)
- WIELD (D is allowed, but E is 4th which is invalid)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try:
E _ A L _
Looking for E in 1st, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 5th letter not forbidden.

E G A L _ → EGAL_ → EGALY (not a word), EGALS (plural, but 5 letters), but EGALS is valid.

But EGALS is 5 letters: E, G, A, L, S. Let's check:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- G new
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
This seems valid and hasn't used any forbidden letters.

Another option: _ E A L _
Looking for E in 2nd, A in 3rd, L in 4th, and a 1st letter not forbidden.

B E A L _ → BEALS (valid word)
D E A L _ → DEALS (valid)
F E A L _ → FEALS (valid)
S E A L _ → SEALED (6 letters), SEALED is invalid.

BEALS, DEALS, FEALS are all valid 5-letter words.

Let's pick BEALS:
- B new
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- A in 3rd (fixed)
- L in 4th (allowed)
- S new
No forbidden letters.

1. Fixed letters:
   - 3rd letter is A (from CRANE, PLATE, BEALS)
   - 2nd letter is E (from BEALS)

   So the pattern is: _ E A _ _

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - L (from PLATE and BEALS: L is in the word but not in 2nd or 4th positions)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - C, R, N, P, T, B, S

4. Therefore:
   - L must be in the 1st or 5th position (since it can't be 2nd or 4th)

- LEAP_ → LEAPS (but S is forbidden)
- LEAR_ → LEARN (R forbidden), LEARS (S forbidden)
- LEAFY, LEAKY are both valid and use only allowed letters.

Pattern 2: _ E A _ L
Looking for words with L in 5th position.
- D E A L L → DEALS (but S is forbidden)
- F E A R L → FEARL (not a word)
- G E A R L → GEARL (not a word)
- M E A K L → MEAKL (not a word)
- V E A L _ → V E A L _ (no 5-letter word ending in L with these letters)

Pattern 1 seems more promising with LEAFY and LEAKY.

Between these two:
- LEAFY: F and Y are new letters.
- LEAKY: K and Y are new letters.

Both are valid, but LEAKY uses K which is slightly less common than F. However, LEAFY is more common. Let's go with LEAFY first.

But wait, let's double-check:
- LEAFY: L, E, A, F, Y
   - L: allowed in 1st position (confirmed in word)
   - E: confirmed in 2nd position
   - A: confirmed in 3rd position
   - F: new letter
   - Y: new letter
   - No forbidden letters.

This seems perfect.

We now have four letters locked in place:

1. L in position 1 (✓)
2. E in position 2 (✓)
3. A in position 3 (✓)
4. Y in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be of the form: L E A _ Y

Only the 4th position is still unknown.  
We need a single letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, P, T, B, S, F)
- Is a valid English letter in the 4th position to make a 5-letter word

Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, etc.

Looking for real 5-letter words that fit L E A _ Y:
- LEADY
- LEAGY (but G is allowed)
- LEAMY (but M is allowed)
- LEAVY (but V is allowed)

Among these, LEADY is the most common word.  All letters in LEADY are still allowed based on previous feedback.
