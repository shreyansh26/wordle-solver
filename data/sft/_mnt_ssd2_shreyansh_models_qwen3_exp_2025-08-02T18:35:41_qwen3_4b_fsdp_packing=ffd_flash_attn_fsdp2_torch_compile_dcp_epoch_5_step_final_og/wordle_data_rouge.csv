### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So far we know:
- E is fixed in the 5th position.
- R and O are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E in the 5th position.
2. Use R and O in new positions.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 3, 4.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, 4.

Let's try ""TROPE"":
- T: new consonant
- R: move to position 2
- O: move to position 3
- P: new consonant
- E: keep in position 5

This tests R in position 2 and O in position 3, while introducing T and P.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is locked in position 5.
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trope).
3. O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from arose and trope).
4. A, S, T, P are NOT in the word.

So far:
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5 → but 5 is E, so 1 or 4.
- O must be in 1, 2, or 5 → but 5 is E, so 1 or 2.

We need a word that:
- ends in E
- contains R and O in new positions
- uses none of A, S, T, P

Let’s try to place R in position 4 and O in position 2.  
A word that fits is “CRORE”:
- C: new consonant
- R: now in position 2 (but wait – from arose and trope R was wrong in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2. Let’s rethink.)

Let’s try R in position 1 and O in position 2: “RO…E”.  
A valid word: “ROUND” doesn’t fit (ends in D).  
“ROWEL” ends in L.  
“ROGER” ends in R.  
“ROAST” has S and T (invalid).  
“ROGER” has R in 1 and 4, but we only know one R exists (from feedback it seems only one R is present).  
“ROGER” also has G (new letter).

Let’s try “ROGER”:
- R in 1 and 4 → but we don’t know if there are two Rs.  
Better to keep it simple: one R.

Try “ROUND” – invalid ends in D.  
Try “ROWEL” – invalid ends in L.  
Try “ROGER” – valid, but double R.  
Try “ROGER” is acceptable.

But let’s try a word with single R and O in 2, R in 1: “ROGER” is fine.

Wait, let’s try “ROGER”:
- R in 1 (new position)
- O in 2 (new position)
- G: new consonant
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5, so invalid).

Oops, E must be in 5.  
So we need:
- 5th letter E
- R somewhere (1 or 4)
- O somewhere (1 or 2)

Let’s try:
- R in 4, O in 2: “_ O _ _ R E”
A word: “MOORE” – but has O in 1 and 4, R in 4 (double R).  
“DOORE” – invalid.  
“FOGUE” – no R.  
“BOGRE” – no O in 2.

Let’s try R in 1, O in 2: “R O _ _ E”
A word: “ROGER” – but E must be in 5, so “ROGER” is invalid.

Let’s try “ROUGE”:
- R in 1 (new position)
- O in 2 (new position)
- U: new vowel
- G: new consonant
- E in 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Check letters: R, O, U, G, E – none of A, S, T, P.  
Positions:
- R in 1 (was wrong in 2,3, so ok)
- O in 2 (was wrong in 3,4, so ok)
- E in 5 (correct)
- U and G are new tests.

This seems optimal.
