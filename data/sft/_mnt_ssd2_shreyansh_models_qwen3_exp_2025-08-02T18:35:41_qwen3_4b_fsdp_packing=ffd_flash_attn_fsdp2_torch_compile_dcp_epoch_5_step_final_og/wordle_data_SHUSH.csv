For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are very frequent. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is in position 4 (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
   - H is in the word but not in position 2 (✓ means it’s in the correct position, but the feedback shows H(✓) which is confusing because in position 2, but the symbol is ✓, which usually means correct position). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

   Actually, the feedback for CHIPS is:
   C(x) – C is not in the word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – I is not in the word.
   P(x) – P is not in the word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, now it’s in position 5, so the word must have S in position 5? But that contradicts the first feedback where S was in position 4 and marked ✓. This suggests the feedback symbols might be interpreted differently.)

   Let me re-examine the feedback symbols as per the initial instructions:
   - ✓ : letter is in the word and in the correct position.
   - - : letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - x : letter is not in the word.

   So for CHIPS:
   C(x) – not in word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – not in word.
   P(x) – not in word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in CHIPS and marked wrong position).

   Combining with the first feedback:
   - S is in position 4 (from AROSE) and must also be in the word (from CHIPS), so S is in position 4.
   - H is in position 2 (from CHIPS).
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, C, I, P.

   So the word pattern is: _ H _ S _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, D, G, M, Y, etc.

   I need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses letters not yet eliminated. Possible candidates: THINS, but I is eliminated; HUMPS, but P is eliminated; THROBS, but O and R are eliminated; THYMS, but Y and M are possible.

   A good next guess would be ""THYMS"" but that's less common. Another option is ""THROB"" but O and R are out. ""THICK"" has I and C out. ""THUMS"" uses U and M which are still possible.

   Let me pick ""THUMS"" as it tests U and M in positions 3 and 5, which are still possible.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are very frequent. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution.

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
   - H is in the word but not in position 2 (✓ means it’s in the correct position, but the feedback shows H(✓) which is confusing because in position 2, but the symbol is ✓, which usually means correct position). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

   Actually, the feedback for CHIPS is:
   C(x) – C is not in the word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – I is not in the word.
   P(x) – P is not in the word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, now it’s in position 5, so the word must have S in position 5? But that contradicts the first feedback where S was in position 4 and marked ✓. This suggests the feedback symbols might be interpreted differently.)

   Let me re-examine the feedback symbols as per the initial instructions:
   - ✓ : letter is in the word and in the correct position.
   - - : letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - x : letter is not in the word.

   So for CHIPS:
   C(x) – not in word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – not in word.
   P(x) – not in word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in CHIPS and marked wrong position).

   Combining with the first feedback:
   - S is in position 4 (from AROSE) and must also be in the word (from CHIPS), so S is in position 4.
   - H is in position 2 (from CHIPS).
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, C, I, P.

   So the word pattern is: _ H _ S _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, D, G, M, Y, etc.

   I need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses letters not yet eliminated. Possible candidates: THINS, but I is eliminated; HUMPS, but P is eliminated; THROBS, but O and R are eliminated; THYMS, but Y and M are possible.

   A good next guess would be ""THYMS"" but that's less common. Another option is ""THROB"" but O and R are out. ""THICK"" has I and C out. ""THUMS"" uses U and M which are still possible.

   Let me pick ""THUMS"" as it tests U and M in positions 3 and 5, which are still possible.

   Alternatively, ""THYME"" but E is out. ""THYMS"" is better.

   So I'll go with THYMS.

From all the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 4 (✓)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all  

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is in position 2 (✓)  
   – C, I, P are not in the word  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it appeared in position 5 and got “-”)  
   (However, from AROSE we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.)

3. THYMS → T(x) H(✓) Y(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – T, Y, M are not in the word  
   – H is still in position 2 (✓)  
   – S is again marked “-” when it appears in position 5, confirming it must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now locked as:  
_ H _ S _  
with the following letters already eliminated:  
A, R, O, E, C, I, P, T, Y, M

Remaining common consonants: D, G, L, N, B, F, K, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O are out, and I is out)

We need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Possible candidates:  
- B H _ S _ → BHORS (R is out), BHUSH (U and B are still possible)  
- D H _ S _ → DHUSK (K is possible), DHUMS (M is out)  
- F H _ S _ → FHUSH (U is possible)  
- G H _ S _ → GHUSH (G and U are possible)  
- L H _ S _ → LHUSH (L and U are possible)  
- N H _ S _ → NHUSH (N and U are possible)  
- U is the only remaining vowel, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
  Position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R is out), UHINS (I is out), UHAPS (A is out) – no good.  
  Position 3: _ H U S _ → D H U S K (K is possible) → DHUSK  
  Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I is out), DHLAS (L is possible but A is out) – no good.

The only viable word left is DHUSK, but that’s not a common English word.  
Another candidate: NHUSH (N, H, U, S, H) – but double H is unlikely.  
Another: GHUSH (G, H, U, S, H) – also double H.  
Another: FHUSH (F, H, U, S, H) – same issue.

Wait, let’s re-examine:  
We need _ H _ S _ with remaining letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, N, V, W, U.

Looking for common words:  
- B H O S K (O is out)  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not common  
- F H U S K (FHUSK) – not a word  
- G H U S K (GHUSK) – not a word  
- L H U S K (LHUSK) – not a word  
- N H U S K (NHUSK) – not a word  

Let’s try _ H _ S _ with U in position 3:  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not a word  
- B H U S K (BHUSK) – not a word  

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word has U in position 1 or 5.  
But position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R out), UHINS (I out), UHAPS (A out) – nothing.  
Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I out), DHLAS (A out), DHLUS (not a word), etc. – nothing.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit _ H _ S _ and use only letters not eliminated.  
The only common one left seems to be “DHUSK” but that’s obscure.  
Another: “GHUSH” – but double H is unlikely.  

Wait, let’s check “BHUSH” – not a word.  
“FHUSH” – not a word.  
“KHUSH” – this is a valid word (means “hush” in Indian English).  
Letters: K, H, U, S, H – but double H is possible.  

“KHUSH” uses K, H, U, S – all still allowed.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are very frequent. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word is _ _ _ S _.
- Letters A, R, O, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good letters to test next are T, I, N, L, U, C, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that keeps S fixed in position 4 and introduces several new common letters. “CHIPS” is a strong candidate (C, H, I, P), but since we already know S is correct, let’s check “CHIPS”:

C H I P S
- C, H, I, P are all new letters.
- S is already confirmed in position 4.

This should give us information about C, H, I, P while keeping S locked in place.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is in position 4 (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
   - H is in the word but not in position 2 (✓ means it’s in the correct position, but the feedback shows H(✓) which is confusing because in position 2, but the symbol is ✓, which usually means correct position). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

   Actually, the feedback for CHIPS is:
   C(x) – C is not in the word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – I is not in the word.
   P(x) – P is not in the word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, now it’s in position 5, so the word must have S in position 5? But that contradicts the first feedback where S was in position 4 and marked ✓. This suggests the feedback symbols might be interpreted differently.)

   Let me re-examine the feedback symbols as per the initial instructions:
   - ✓ : letter is in the word and in the correct position.
   - - : letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - x : letter is not in the word.

   So for CHIPS:
   C(x) – not in word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – not in word.
   P(x) – not in word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in CHIPS and marked wrong position).

   Combining with the first feedback:
   - S is in position 4 (from AROSE) and must also be in the word (from CHIPS), so S is in position 4.
   - H is in position 2 (from CHIPS).
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, C, I, P.

   So the word pattern is: _ H _ S _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, D, G, M, Y, etc.

   I need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses letters not yet eliminated. Possible candidates: THINS, but I is eliminated; HUMPS, but P is eliminated; THROBS, but O and R are eliminated; THYMS, but Y and M are possible.

   A good next guess would be ""THYMS"" but that's less common. Another option is ""THROB"" but O and R are out. ""THICK"" has I and C out. ""THUMS"" uses U and M which are still possible.

   Let me pick ""THUMS"" as it tests U and M in positions 3 and 5, which are still possible.

   Alternatively, ""THYME"" but E is out. ""THYMS"" is better.

   So I'll go with THYMS.

From all the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 4 (✓)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all  

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is in position 2 (✓)  
   – C, I, P are not in the word  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it appeared in position 5 and got “-”)  
   (However, from AROSE we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.)

3. THYMS → T(x) H(✓) Y(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – T, Y, M are not in the word  
   – H is still in position 2 (✓)  
   – S is again marked “-” when it appears in position 5, confirming it must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now locked as:

Remaining common consonants: D, G, L, N, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

- G H _ S _ → GHUSH (G and U are possible)  
- L H _ S _ → LHUSH (L and U are possible)  
- N H _ S _ → NHUSH (N and U are possible)  
- U is the only remaining vowel, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
  Position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R is out), UHINS (I is out), UHAPS (A is out) – no good.  
  Position 3: _ H U S _ → D H U S K (K is possible) → DHUSK  
  Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I is out), DHLAS (L is possible but A is out) – no good.

The only viable word left is DHUSK, but that’s not a common English word.  
Another candidate: NHUSH (N, H, U, S, H) – but double H is unlikely.  
Another: GHUSH (G, H, U, S, H) – also double H.  
Another: FHUSH (F, H, U, S, H) – same issue.

Wait, let’s re-examine:  
We need _ H _ S _ with remaining letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, N, V, W, U.

Looking for common words:  
- B H O S K (O is out)  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not common  
- F H U S K (FHUSK) – not a word  
- G H U S K (GHUSK) – not a word  
- L H U S K (LHUSK) – not a word  
- N H U S K (NHUSK) – not a word  

Let’s try _ H _ S _ with U in position 3:  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not a word  
- B H U S K (BHUSK) – not a word  

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word has U in position 1 or 5.  
But position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R out), UHINS (I out), UHAPS (A out) – nothing.  
Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I out), DHLAS (A out), DHLUS (not a word), etc. – nothing.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit _ H _ S _ and use only letters not eliminated.  
The only common one left seems to be “DHUSK” but that’s obscure.  
Another: “GHUSH” – but double H is unlikely.  

Wait, let’s check “BHUSH” – not a word.  
“FHUSH” – not a word.  
“KHUSH” – this is a valid word (means “hush” in Indian English).  
Letters: K, H, U, S, H – but double H is possible.  

“KHUSH” uses K, H, U, S – all still allowed.  
Let’s go with KHUSH.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are very frequent. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word is _ _ _ S _.
- Letters A, R, O, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good letters to test next are T, I, N, L, U, C, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that keeps S fixed in position 4 and introduces several new common letters. “CHIPS” is a strong candidate (C, H, I, P), but since we already know S is correct, let’s check “CHIPS”:

C H I P S
- C, H, I, P are all new letters.
- S is already confirmed in position 4.

This should give us information about C, H, I, P while keeping S locked in place.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is in position 4 (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
   - H is in the word but not in position 2 (✓ means it’s in the correct position, but the feedback shows H(✓) which is confusing because in position 2, but the symbol is ✓, which usually means correct position). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

   Actually, the feedback for CHIPS is:
   C(x) – C is not in the word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – I is not in the word.
   P(x) – P is not in the word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, now it’s in position 5, so the word must have S in position 5? But that contradicts the first feedback where S was in position 4 and marked ✓. This suggests the feedback symbols might be interpreted differently.)

   Let me re-examine the feedback symbols as per the initial instructions:
   - ✓ : letter is in the word and in the correct position.
   - - : letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - x : letter is not in the word.

   So for CHIPS:
   C(x) – not in word.
   H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   I(x) – not in word.
   P(x) – not in word.
   S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in CHIPS and marked wrong position).

   Combining with the first feedback:
   - S is in position 4 (from AROSE) and must also be in the word (from CHIPS), so S is in position 4.
   - H is in position 2 (from CHIPS).
   - Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, C, I, P.

   So the word pattern is: _ H _ S _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, D, G, M, Y, etc.

   I need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses letters not yet eliminated. Possible candidates: THINS, but I is eliminated; HUMPS, but P is eliminated; THROBS, but O and R are eliminated; THYMS, but Y and M are possible.

   A good next guess would be ""THYMS"" but that's less common. Another option is ""THROB"" but O and R are out. ""THICK"" has I and C out. ""THUMS"" uses U and M which are still possible.

   Let me pick ""THUMS"" as it tests U and M in positions 3 and 5, which are still possible.

   Alternatively, ""THYME"" but E is out. ""THYMS"" is better.

   So I'll go with THYMS.

Guess 3: THYMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(✓) Y(x) M(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 4 (✓)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word at all  

2. CHIPS → C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – H is in position 2 (✓)  
   – C, I, P are not in the word  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it appeared in position 5 and got “-”)  
   (However, from AROSE we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.)

3. THYMS → T(x) H(✓) Y(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – T, Y, M are not in the word  
   – H is still in position 2 (✓)  
   – S is again marked “-” when it appears in position 5, confirming it must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now locked as:  
_ H _ S _  
with the following letters already eliminated:  
A, R, O, E, C, I, P, T, Y, M

Remaining common consonants: D, G, L, N, B, F, K, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O are out, and I is out)

We need a word that fits _ H _ S _ and uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Possible candidates:  
- B H _ S _ → BHORS (R is out), BHUSH (U and B are still possible)  
- D H _ S _ → DHUSK (K is possible), DHUMS (M is out)  
- F H _ S _ → FHUSH (U is possible)  
- G H _ S _ → GHUSH (G and U are possible)  
- L H _ S _ → LHUSH (L and U are possible)  
- N H _ S _ → NHUSH (N and U are possible)  
- U is the only remaining vowel, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
  Position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R is out), UHINS (I is out), UHAPS (A is out) – no good.  
  Position 3: _ H U S _ → D H U S K (K is possible) → DHUSK  
  Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I is out), DHLAS (L is possible but A is out) – no good.

The only viable word left is DHUSK, but that’s not a common English word.  
Another candidate: NHUSH (N, H, U, S, H) – but double H is unlikely.  
Another: GHUSH (G, H, U, S, H) – also double H.  
Another: FHUSH (F, H, U, S, H) – same issue.

Wait, let’s re-examine:  
We need _ H _ S _ with remaining letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, N, V, W, U.

Looking for common words:  
- B H O S K (O is out)  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not common  
- F H U S K (FHUSK) – not a word  
- G H U S K (GHUSK) – not a word  
- L H U S K (LHUSK) – not a word  
- N H U S K (NHUSK) – not a word  

Let’s try _ H _ S _ with U in position 3:  
- D H U S K (DHUSK) – not a word  
- B H U S K (BHUSK) – not a word  

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word has U in position 1 or 5.  
But position 1: U H _ S _ → UHORS (R out), UHINS (I out), UHAPS (A out) – nothing.  
Position 5: _ H _ S U → D H _ S U → DHISU (I out), DHLAS (A out), DHLUS (not a word), etc. – nothing.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit _ H _ S _ and use only letters not eliminated.  
The only common one left seems to be “DHUSK” but that’s obscure.  
Another: “GHUSH” – but double H is unlikely.  

Wait, let’s check “BHUSH” – not a word.  
“FHUSH” – not a word.  
“KHUSH” – this is a valid word (means “hush” in Indian English).  
Letters: K, H, U, S, H – but double H is possible.  

“KHUSH” uses K, H, U, S – all still allowed.  
Let’s go with KHUSH.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)
Guess 3: THYMS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(✓) Y(x) M(x) S(-)
Guess 4: KHUSH -> FEEDBACK: K(x) H(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

From the latest feedback on KHUSH:

K(x) – K is not in the word.  
H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is now fully determined:

Position 1: ?  
Position 2: H  
Position 3: U  
Position 4: S  
Position 5: H  

The word must be _ H U S H.  
Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, E, C, I, P, T, Y, M, K.  
Remaining possible first letters: B, D, F, G, L, N, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit _ H U S H:

- B H U S H – BHUSH (not a word)  
- D H U S H – DHUSH (not a word)  
- F H U S H – FHUSH (not a word)  
- G H U S H – GHUSH (valid word meaning “hush” in Indian English)  
- L H U S H – LHUSH (not a word)  
- N H U S H – NHUSH (not a word)  

The only valid word left is GHUSH.

The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. \n\nLooking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are very frequent. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common. \n\nA good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.\n\nAnother good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it\'s slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(x) – O is not in the word.\n- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word is _ _ _ S _.\n- Letters A, R, O, E are eliminated.\n- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.\n\nGood letters to test next are T, I, N, L, U, C, H, etc. I’ll pick a word that keeps S fixed in position 4 and introduces several new common letters. “CHIPS” is a strong candidate (C, H, I, P), but since we already know S is correct, let’s check “CHIPS”:\n\nC H I P S\n- C, H, I, P are all new letters.\n- S is already confirmed in position 4.\n\nThis should give us information about C, H, I, P while keeping S locked in place.\n\n<guess>CHIPS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) I(x) P(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two pieces of feedback we have:\n\n1.

Another option is ""THROB"" but O and R are out. ""THICK"" has I and C out. ""THUMS"" uses U and M which are still possible.\n\n   Let me pick ""THUMS"" as it tests U and M in positions 3 and 5, which are still possible.\n\n   Alternatively, ""THYME"" but E is out.
