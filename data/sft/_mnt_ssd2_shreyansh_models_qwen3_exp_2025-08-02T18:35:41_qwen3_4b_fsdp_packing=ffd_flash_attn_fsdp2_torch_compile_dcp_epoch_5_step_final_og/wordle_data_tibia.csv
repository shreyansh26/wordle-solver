For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That means:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we want a new guess that uses the information we have, we should:
- Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
- Make sure A is in a position other than 1.
- Include other common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- It has A in position 2 (since A can’t be in position 1).
- It uses common letters U, N, T, L that we haven’t tested yet.
- It doesn’t use any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “CANT” or “LINED”, but “UNTIL” seems balanced.

So far we know:

- Letters in the word: A (not in position 1), I (in position 4)
- T is in the word but not in position 3

Positions we know:
- Position 4: I
- Position 1: not A, not any of R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Position 3: not T
- Position 2: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4
- Contains A (not in position 1)
- Contains T (not in position 3)
- Does not use R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not their known wrong positions), and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is I
- Let’s try A in position 2: _ A _ I _
- We need T somewhere else (not position 3). Let’s try T in position 5: _ A _ I T
- Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible third letters: same list, excluding the first letter.

Let’s pick C for position 1 and K for position 3: C A K I T → ""CAKIT"" (but this is not a valid English word)
Next try: M A D I T → ""MADIT"" (invalid)
Next: B A T I N → but N is excluded
Next: C A P I T → ""CAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: D A R I T → R is excluded
Next: D A M I T → ""DAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: G A P I T → ""GAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: H A M I T → ""HAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: P A T I C → ""PATIC"" (invalid)
Next: T A C I T → ""TACIT"" (valid word, means ""speaking in a precise manner"")

Check constraints for TACIT:
- Contains T (position 1) and I (position 4) – I is correct position.
- Contains A (position 2) – A is not in position 1, so this satisfies.
- Does not use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E, U, N, L).

- Does not use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E, U, N, L).
- All letters are allowed.

From the new feedback on TACIT:

- T(✓) : T is in position 1 and correct.
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) : C is not in the word.
- I(✓) : I is in position 4 and correct.
- T(-) : T is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know it’s in position 1, so this is consistent).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C
- Letters in the word: T (position 1), I (position 4), A (somewhere else)
- A is not in position 1, 2, or 5 (because in Guess 1 A was in position 1 and got “-”, in Guess 2 A was not used, and in Guess 3 A was in position 2 and got “-”). Therefore A must be in position 3.

Word structure so far:
- Position 1: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: I
- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown, but must be letters not yet excluded: allowed letters are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the allowed set and not repeating.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: same, different from position 2.

Let’s try common letters first. A good candidate is “TABID” (but D is allowed and I is already in position 4). However, “TABID” is not a valid word.

Next try: “TAMID” – invalid.
Next: “TAPID” – invalid.
Next: “TAPIR” – R is excluded.
Next: “TAWNY” – W and N, but N is excluded.
Next: “TAXIC” – C is excluded.
Next: “TAXIS” – S is excluded.
Next: “TAPIR” – already considered.
Next: “TAPIE” – E is excluded.
Next: “TAPIK” – K is allowed, but “TAPIK” is not a valid word.
Next: “TAPIR” – already considered.
Next: “TAPIE” – already considered.
Next: “TAPIK” – already considered.

Let’s think differently: the word must be T _ A I _ and use allowed letters.

Valid English words fitting T _ A I _ with allowed letters:
- TUBAI – U is excluded.
- TUBIA – U is excluded.
- TUBIC – C is excluded.
- TUBIS – S is excluded.
- TUBIX – X is allowed, but “TUBIX” is not common.
- TUBIC – C is excluded.
- TUBIS – S is excluded.
- TUBIX – already considered.
- TUBIC – C is excluded.
- TUBIS – S is excluded.
- TUBIX – already considered.

Next: T _ A I _ with other letters:
- T D A I _ – “TDAI_” – no common word.
- T F A I _ – “TFAI_” – no common word.
- T G A I _ – “TGAI_” – no common word.
- T H A I _ – “THAI_” – “THAI” is 4 letters, “THAIL” is 5 but L is excluded.
- T J A I _ – “TJAI_” – no word.
- T K A I _ – “TKAI_” – no word.
- T M A I _ – “TMAI_” – no word.
- T P A I _ – “TPAI_” – no word.
- T Q A I _ – “TQAI_” – no word.
- T V A I _ – “TVAI_” – no word.
- T W A I _ – “TWAI_” – no word.
- T X A I _ – “TXAI_” – no word.
- T Y A I _ – “TYAI_” – no word.
- T Z A I _ – “TZAI_” – no word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with T, have A in position 3, I in position 4, and use only allowed letters.

Possible valid word: “TUBIC” – but C is excluded.
“TUBIS” – S is excluded.
“TUBIX” – X is allowed, but “TUBIX” is not standard.
“TUBIC” – C excluded.
“TUBIS” – S excluded.
“TUBIX” – X allowed, but not a common word.

Next: “TAMID” – invalid.

“TAPIE” – E excluded.
“TAPIK” – K allowed, but not a word.
“TAPIR” – R excluded.
“TAPIE” – E excluded.
“TAPIK” – K allowed, but not a word.

“TAXIS” – S excluded.
“TAWNY” – N is excluded.
“TAWSE” – S and E excluded.
“TAWIE” – E is excluded.

Next: “TIMID” – M and D are allowed, I is already in position 4.
“TIMID” – M and D are allowed.
Check: T I M I D – but position 3 must be A, not M.
So this doesn’t fit T _ A I _.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That means:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we want a new guess that uses the information we have, we should:
- Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
- Make sure A is in a position other than 1.
- Include other common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- It has A in position 2 (since A can’t be in position 1).
- It uses common letters U, N, T, L that we haven’t tested yet.
- It doesn’t use any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “CANT” or “LINED”, but “UNTIL” seems balanced.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Letters in the word: A (not in position 1), I (in position 4)
- T is in the word but not in position 3

Positions we know:
- Position 4: I
- Position 1: not A, not any of R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Position 3: not T
- Position 2: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4
- Contains A (not in position 1)
- Contains T (not in position 3)
- Does not use R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not their known wrong positions), and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is I
- Let’s try A in position 2: _ A _ I _
- We need T somewhere else (not position 3). Let’s try T in position 5: _ A _ I T
- Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible third letters: same list, excluding the first letter.

Let’s pick C for position 1 and K for position 3: C A K I T → ""CAKIT"" (but this is not a valid English word)
Next try: M A D I T → ""MADIT"" (invalid)
Next: B A T I N → but N is excluded
Next: C A P I T → ""CAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: D A R I T → R is excluded
Next: D A M I T → ""DAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: G A P I T → ""GAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: H A M I T → ""HAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: P A T I C → ""PATIC"" (invalid)
Next: T A C I T → ""TACIT"" (valid word, means ""speaking in a precise manner"")

Check constraints for TACIT:
- Contains T (position 1) and I (position 4) – I is correct position.
- Contains A (position 2) – A is not in position 1, so this satisfies.
- Does not use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E, U, N, L).
- All letters are allowed.

""TACIT"" seems to be a valid guess that incorporates all the known constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:  
   - T is in the word and is in position 1 (✓)  
   - I is in the word and is in position 4 (✓)

3. Additional constraints:  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from TACIT).  
     So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
     However, position 4 is already I, so A must be in position 3 or 5.  
   - The second T in position 5 is marked (-), meaning T is not in position 5 (already known since T is in position 1).

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Starts with T  
   - Has I in position 4  
   - Contains A in position 3 or 5  
   - Uses only letters not yet excluded (allowed letters so far: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Let’s try to build valid words:

Option 1: A in position 3 → T _ A I _  
   Need a first and fifth letter.  
   Possible combinations:  
   - T B A I D → “TB AID” (invalid)  
   - T H A I K → “THAIK” (invalid)  
   - T H A I N → N is excluded  
   - T H A I D → “THAID” (invalid)  
   - T H A I M → “THAIM” (invalid)  
   - T H A I P → “THAIP” (invalid)  
   - T H A I Y → “THAIY” (invalid)  
   - T H A I V → “THAIV” (invalid)  
   - T H A I K → already tried  

   No valid English word found.

Option 2: A in position 5 → T _ _ I A  
   Need a second and third letter.  
   Possible combinations:  
   - T H I I A → “THIIA” (invalid)  
   - T H I K A → “THIKA” (invalid)  
   - T H I D A → “THIDA” (invalid)  
   - T H I M A → “THIMA” (invalid)  
   - T H I P A → “THIPA” (invalid)  
   - T H I V A → “THIVA” (invalid)  
   - T H I K A → already tried  

   Still no valid English word.

Let’s try different first letters:  
- T B _ I A → “TB _ IA” (invalid)  
- T D _ I A → “TD _ IA” (invalid)  
- T G _ I A → “TG _ IA” (invalid)  
- T H _ I A → “TH _ IA” (invalid)  
- T J _ I A → “TJ _ IA” (invalid)  
- T K _ I A → “TK _ IA” (invalid)  
- T M _ I A → “TM _ IA” (invalid)  
- T P _ I A → “TP _ IA” (invalid)  
- T V _ I A → “TV _ IA” (invalid)  
- T W _ I A → “TW _ IA” (invalid)  
- T Y _ I A → “TY _ IA” (invalid)  
- T Z _ I A → “TZ _ IA” (invalid)  

None of these form valid words.

Let’s reconsider the placement of A:  
We thought A must be in position 3 or 5 because positions 1 and 2 are excluded.  
But position 3 is possible.  
Let’s try T _ A I _ again with valid words:

- T H A I D → invalid  
- T H A I M → invalid  
- T H A I K → invalid  
- T H A I P → invalid  
- T H A I Y → invalid  
- T H A I V → invalid  

Wait, let’s think of actual English words that fit T _ _ I A or T _ A I _:

- T H I K A → invalid  
- T H I M A → invalid  
- T H I D A → invalid  
- T H I P A → invalid  
- T H I V A → invalid  
- T H I K A → invalid  

Actually, the only valid English word that fits T _ _ I A is “THICK” but I is in position 4, so let’s see:

- T H I C K → positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), C(4), K(5) – but I must be in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Let’s try “TIGER” – but R and E are excluded.

“TIGMA” – M and G are allowed, but A must be in position 3 or 5.  
- T I G M A → positions: T(1), I(2), G(3), M(4), A(5) – but I must be in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these without repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

That means:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we want a new guess that uses the information we have, we should:
- Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
- Make sure A is in a position other than 1.
- Include other common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.).

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- It has A in position 2 (since A can’t be in position 1).
- It uses common letters U, N, T, L that we haven’t tested yet.
- It doesn’t use any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “CANT” or “LINED”, but “UNTIL” seems balanced.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Letters in the word: A (not in position 1), I (in position 4)
- T is in the word but not in position 3

Positions we know:
- Position 4: I
- Position 1: not A, not any of R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Position 3: not T
- Position 2: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the excluded letters

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4
- Contains A (not in position 1)
- Contains T (not in position 3)
- Does not use R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not their known wrong positions), and fill the remaining spots with allowed letters.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is I
- Let’s try A in position 2: _ A _ I _
- We need T somewhere else (not position 3). Let’s try T in position 5: _ A _ I T
- Now we need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible third letters: same list, excluding the first letter.

Let’s pick C for position 1 and K for position 3: C A K I T → ""CAKIT"" (but this is not a valid English word)
Next try: M A D I T → ""MADIT"" (invalid)
Next: B A T I N → but N is excluded
Next: C A P I T → ""CAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: D A R I T → R is excluded
Next: D A M I T → ""DAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: G A P I T → ""GAPIT"" (invalid)
Next: H A M I T → ""HAMIT"" (invalid)
Next: P A T I C → ""PATIC"" (invalid)
Next: T A C I T → ""TACIT"" (valid word, means ""speaking in a precise manner"")

Check constraints for TACIT:
- Contains T (position 1) and I (position 4) – I is correct position.
- Contains A (position 2) – A is not in position 1, so this satisfies.
- Does not use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E, U, N, L).
- All letters are allowed.

""TACIT"" seems to be a valid guess that incorporates all the known constraints.

Let’s re-express the feedback clearly.

Known facts after three guesses:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - T is in the word and is in position 1 (✓)
   - I is in the word and is in position 4 (✓)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (because in TACIT, A was in position 2 and got “-”, so A must be in position 3 or 5)
3. Position constraints:
   - Position 1: T (fixed)
   - Position 4: I (fixed)
   - Position 3 or 5: A (must be)
4. Remaining letters to choose from (excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
T _ A I _  or  T _ _ I A

Let’s list possible valid English words that fit these patterns:

- T A A I _  – impossible (double A)
- T _ A I _  – e.g., T B A I _ → “TB...” not valid
- T _ _ I A – e.g., T B C I A → “TBCIA” not valid

Valid English words fitting T _ _ I A:
- TUBIA – but U is excluded
- TIGIA – not a valid word
- TAPIR – but R is excluded
- TIKIA – not valid
- TADIA – not valid
- TAVIA – not valid
- TIBIA – valid word (bone in the leg)

Check TIBIA:
- T (✓) in position 1 – correct
- I (✓) in position 4 – correct
- B is allowed (not in forbidden list)
- I is allowed in position 2 (no restriction yet)
- A is allowed in position 5 (satisfies A not in 1 or 2)
- No forbidden letters used

Therefore, TIBIA is a valid next guess.
