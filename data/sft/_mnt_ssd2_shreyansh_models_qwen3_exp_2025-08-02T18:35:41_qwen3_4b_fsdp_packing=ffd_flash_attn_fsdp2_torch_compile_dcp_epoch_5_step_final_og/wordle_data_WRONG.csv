3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate many possibilities. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.  
To maximize information with the second guess, I want a word that avoids those letters entirely and still covers other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining common letters to test include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, G, D, F, K, Y, W, etc.

A balanced second guess that avoids S, L, A, T, E and still hits several common letters is “CRONY”.  
It contains C, R, O, N, Y — none of which were in SLATE, and it tests three vowels (O) plus two common consonants (C, R, N, Y).  
This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, Y, P  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions:
   - R in position 2  
   - O in position 3  
   - N in position 4  
   - G in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ R O N G

We only need to determine the first letter.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit the pattern ? R O N G:
- B R O N G → “BRONG” is not a valid English word.  
- D R O N G → “DRONG” is also not valid.  
- F R O N G → “FRONG” is not valid.  
- H R O N G → “HRONG” is not valid.  
- K R O N G → “KRONG” is a valid word (a type of giant insect).  
- M R O N G → “MRONG” is not valid.  
- V R O N G → “VRONG” is not valid.  
- W R O N G → “WRONG” is a valid English word.

Between “KRONG” and “WRONG”, “WRONG” is far more common and likely the intended word.  
Therefore, the next guess should be WRONG.
