For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants plus vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - excellent vowel coverage
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - all vowels plus D

""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and potentially the positions of R and S.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
A, R, S, T, O, N, E, Y

Letters ruled out (x):
A, R, S, N, Y

Letters confirmed present but in wrong positions:
- O (not in 3rd or 2nd)
- E (not in 5th or 4th)
- T (in word, not in 1st)

So the secret word:
- must contain O, E, T
- must NOT contain A, R, S, N, Y
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- T cannot be in position 1

We need a 5-letter word using only the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) plus O, E, T, with the positional constraints above.

Let’s list possible positions:
- O can be in 1, 4, 5
- E can be in 1, 2, 3
- T can be in 2, 3, 4, 5

We need two more distinct letters from the allowed set (not O, E, T). Let’s pick common consonants like L, D, M, C, etc.

Try to form a word:
- O in position 1: O _ _ _ _
- E in position 2: _ E _ _ _
- T in position 3: _ _ T _ _
- O in position 4: _ _ _ O _
- O in position 5: _ _ _ _ O
- E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- T in position 2: _ T _ _ _
- T in position 4: _ _ _ T _
- T in position 5: _ _ _ _ T

Let’s try O in position 1 and E in position 3, with T in position 2:
O T E _ _

We need two more letters. Let’s try common ones: L and D → O T E L D → “OTELD” is not a valid word.
Try O T E M P → “OTEMP” – invalid.
Try O T E L D → invalid.
Try O T E L L → invalid.

Try O in position 1, E in position 2, T in position 4:
O E _ T _
Need two more letters. Try O E M T _ → “OEMT_” – invalid.
Try O E L T _ → “OELT_” – invalid.

Try O in position 4, E in position 2, T in position 3:
_ E T O _
Need two more letters. Try B E T O _ → “BETOM” – invalid.
Try C E T O _ → “CETOL” – invalid.
Try M E T O _ → “METOL” – invalid.

Try O in position 5, E in position 2, T in position 3:
_ E T _ O
Try B E T C O → “BETCO” – invalid.
Try C E T C O → invalid.
Try D E T C O → invalid.

Try O in position 1, E in position 2, T in position 5:
O E _ _ T
Try O E L L T → invalid.
Try O E L D T → invalid.

Try O in position 4, E in position 1, T in position 2:
E T _ O _
Try E T L O D → “ETLOD” – invalid.
Try E T C O D → “ETCOD” – invalid.

Try O in position 5, E in position 3, T in position 2:
_ T E _ O
Try C T E L O → “CTELO” – invalid.
Try L T E M O → invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words that contain O, E, T without the forbidden letters.

Possible valid words:
- TOEIC – but Y is forbidden, and I is allowed, but C is allowed. However, Y is forbidden, so this is invalid.
- TOGAE – A is forbidden.
- TOWER – R is forbidden.
- TOGET – T appears twice, but we don’t know if duplicates are allowed. Even if they are, this seems unlikely.
- TOLKE – K is allowed, but L is allowed. “TOLKE” – not a word.
- TOILE – I is allowed, L is allowed. “TOILE” is a valid word (French for “dress”), but we need English.

“TOILE” is valid English (a type of fabric).

Check constraints:
- Contains O, E, T – yes.
- Does not contain A, R, S, N, Y – yes.
- O is in position 2 – but feedback says O is not in position 2 (from TONEY: O(-) means O is not in 2nd position). So O cannot be in 2nd position, but in TOILE it is in 2nd position – invalid.

Next candidate: “TOKEI” – not a word.
“TOKED” – D is allowed. Check:
- T, O, K, E, D
- O is in position 2 – invalid (from TONEY feedback).

Next: “TOLDE” – not a word.
“TOILE” already invalid.

Next: “ETCOT” – not a word.
“OTECO” – not a word.

Let’s try O in position 4, E in position 1, T in position 2:
E T _ O _
Try E T C O D → “ETCOD” – invalid.
Try E T M O D → “ETMOD” – invalid.

Try O in position 5, E in position 1, T in position 2:
E T _ _ O
Try E T C L O → “ETCLO” – invalid.
Try E T M L O → invalid.

Try O in position 1, E in position 3, T in position 4:
O _ E T _
Try O L E T T → invalid.
Try O B E T T → invalid.

Try O in position 1, E in position 3, T in position 5:
O _ E _ T
Try O B E L T → “OBELT” – not a word.
Try O C E L T → “OCELT” – not a word.

Try O in position 4, E in position 3, T in position 2:
_ T E O _
Try C T E O N → N is forbidden.
Try L T E O N → N forbidden.
Try B T E O N → N forbidden.

Try O in position 5, E in position 3, T in position 2:
_ T E _ O
Try C T E L O → invalid.
Try L T E M O → invalid.

Try O C E T T → invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants plus vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - excellent vowel coverage
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - all vowels plus D

""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and potentially the positions of R and S.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters not present: A, R, S
- Letters present but misplaced: O (not 3rd), E (not 5th)

We need a word that:
- Contains both O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: O, E (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

Let’s try a word that uses O and E in new positions and introduces new consonants. “TONEY” comes to mind:
- T, N, E, O, Y
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- T, N, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This should give us more information about T, N, Y, and confirm or deny the positions of O and E.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, N, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions (-): O, E, T

We know:
- O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TONEY).
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and TONEY).
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (from TONEY).

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O, E are either ruled out or confirmed present).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O, E, T (all confirmed present).
2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
3. Places E in positions 1, 2, 4 (since it can’t be 3 or 5).
4. Places T in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1).
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, N, Y).

Possible word structure:  
Let’s try O in position 1, E in position 2, T in position 3.  
We need two more letters that haven’t been used yet. Good candidates: C, D, L, M, P, etc.

A valid word fitting this pattern is “OCTET”:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- C (new letter)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- T in position 5 (allowed)

Check letters: O, C, T, E, T – none are in the forbidden list, and all required letters are included.

So, “OCTET” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants plus vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - excellent vowel coverage
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - all vowels plus D

""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and potentially the positions of R and S.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters not present: A, R, S
- Letters present but misplaced: O (not 3rd), E (not 5th)

We need a word that:
- Contains both O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: O, E (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

Let’s try a word that uses O and E in new positions and introduces new consonants. “TONEY” comes to mind:
- T, N, E, O, Y
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- T, N, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This should give us more information about T, N, Y, and confirm or deny the positions of O and E.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants plus vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - excellent vowel coverage
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - all vowels plus D

""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and potentially the positions of R and S.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: O, E (already confirmed), plus maybe I or U.

Let’s try a word that uses O and E in new positions and introduces new consonants. “TONEY” comes to mind:
- T, N, E, O, Y
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- T, N, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This should give us more information about T, N, Y, and confirm or deny the positions of O and E.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, N, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions (-): O, E, T

We know:
- O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TONEY).
- E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and TONEY).
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (from TONEY).

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O, E are either ruled out or confirmed present).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O, E, T (all confirmed present).
2. Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
3. Places E in positions 1, 2, 4 (since it can’t be 3 or 5).
4. Places T in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1).
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, N, Y).

Possible word structure:  
Let’s try O in position 1, E in position 2, T in position 3.  
We need two more letters that haven’t been used yet. Good candidates: C, D, L, M, P, etc.

A valid word fitting this pattern is “OCTET”:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- C (new letter)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- T in position 5 (allowed)

Check letters: O, C, T, E, T – none are in the forbidden list, and all required letters are included.

So, “OCTET” is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on OCTET:

- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- T(✓) → T is in the word AND in position 3.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, N, Y, C  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, E, T (with T fixed in position 3).

Positions we still need to determine:  
- O cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was wrong in 1 and 2 already and T is in 3).  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
- T is fixed in position 3.

Thus:
- O must be in position 4 or 5.  
- E must be in position 1 or 2.  
- T is in position 3.

We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, S, N, Y, C). Good consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s try placing E in position 1 and O in position 4:

Word structure so far: E _ T O _

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 5) from the unused set.  
Let’s pick B and D (both still allowed).

A valid word: E B T O D → “EBTOD” is not a real word.  
Try swapping: E D T O B → “EDTOB” – not valid.  
Try a real word that fits: E _ T O _.

“ETHOS” is invalid (H and S; S is ruled out).  
“ELOTE” – invalid.  
“EXOTI” – invalid.  
“EXOTY” – Y is ruled out.  
“EPODE” – P is allowed, D is allowed. “EPODE” is a real word (a type of poem).

Check letters: E, P, O, D, E – none are in the forbidden list.  
Positions:  
- T is in position 3 (✓).  
- O is in position 4 (allowed).  
- E is in position 1 (allowed).  
- P and D are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Therefore, “EPODE” is a valid next guess.

Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x):
A, R, S, N, Y, C, P

Letters that ARE in the word (from “-” or “✓”):
- O (must be somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 from the feedback so far – wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 5

2. TONEY → T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 3  

3. OCTET → O(-) C(x) T(✓) E(-) T(-)  
   – T is in the word and IS in position 3  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 4  

4. EPODE → E(-) P(x) O(-) D(-) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – P is NOT in the word  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known)  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 4  

So far we have:

- T is fixed in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
  The only remaining position for E is position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
  Wait, that can’t be possible. Let’s re-examine the positions:

  From all feedback on O:
  – AROSE: not 3  
  – TONEY: not 2  
  – OCTET: not 1  
  – EPODE: not 3 (again)  

  Positions left for O: 4 or 5.

Similarly for E:
– AROSE: not 5  
– TONEY: not 3  
– OCTET: not 4  
– EPODE: not 1, 3, 4, 5  

  The only remaining position for E is 2.

So the word must be: _ E T O _ or _ E T _ O, with O in 4 or 5.

But E must be in 2, T in 3, so the pattern is: _ E T O _ or _ E T _ O.

We also know D is in the word but not in position 4 (from EPODE feedback).  
So D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:

Case 1: _ E T O _  
Then D must be in position 5.  
Word: ? E T O D  
Allowed consonants left (not ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.  
D is allowed in position 5.  
A valid word: B E T O D → “BETOD” – not valid.  
F E T O D → “FETOD” – not valid.  
H E T O D → “HETOD” – not valid.  
L E T O D → “LETOD” – not valid.  
M E T O D → “METOD” – not valid.  
V E T O D → “VETOD” – not valid.  
W E T O D → “WETOD” – not valid.  
G E T O D → “GETOD” – not valid.  

Case 2: _ E T _ O  
Then D must be in position 1 or 4.  
But D cannot be in position 4 (from EPODE feedback: D(-) means not in 4).  
So D must be in position 1.  
Word: D E T _ O  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form D E T _ O.  
Looking for such words:  
DETRO – invalid (R ruled out)  
DETFO – invalid  
DETHO – invalid  
DETGO – invalid  
DETMO – invalid  
DETVO – invalid  
DETWO – invalid  

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let’s double-check if we missed any possibilities.

Wait, the feedback for EPODE shows E(-) in positions 1 and 5, which means E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.  
We already have T in position 3, so the only possible positions for E are 2 or 4.  
But from earlier feedback:
– TONEY: E not in 3  
– OCTET: E not in 4  
So E cannot be in 4 either.  
Thus E must be in position 2.  

So the pattern is _ E T _ O or _ E T O _.

From EPODE feedback:
- D is in the word but not in position 4.  
So D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s re-examine the possible words:

Pattern _ E T _ O:
- D must be in position 1 or 5.  
  If D in 1: D E T _ O → need a valid word.  
  DETRO – invalid (R ruled out)  
  DETFO – invalid  
  … none seem valid.  
  If D in 5: _ E T _ D → but then O must be in 4, so word is _ E T O D.  
  We tried this earlier and found no valid words.

This suggests we may have missed a valid word. Let’s think differently.

We know:
- T is in position 3.  
- E must be in position 2.  
- O must be in position 4 or 5.  
- D is in the word but not in position 4.  
- All other letters must be from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words matching _ E T _ _ with these constraints.

Possible words:
- BETEL – invalid (L is allowed, but E is already used twice)  
- BETON – invalid (N ruled out)  
- BETOD – invalid  
- DETOX – invalid (X not ruled out, but let’s check)  
Wait, we need to ensure O is in 4 or 5.

Let’s try:
- BETEL – has E in 2 and 5, but E cannot be in 5.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETOL – L is allowed, but O is in 4: B E T O L – “BETOL” – not valid.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETES – S ruled out.  
- BETES – same.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETEL – E in 5 invalid.  
- DETOX – X not ruled out, but O in 4: D E T O X – “DETOK” – no, “DETOK” is not a word.  
- FETID – D in 5, but I is allowed: F E T I D – but O must be in word, so this is invalid.  
- GELID – G E L I D – no T.  
- HELIX – no T.  
- JETON – J is allowed, but N ruled out.  
- METAL – A ruled out.  
- METRO – R ruled out.  
- PETAL – P ruled out.  
- VETED – V E T E D – but E in 2 and 4, but E cannot be in 4.  
- WETTE – double E, but E cannot be in 4.  
- WETON – N ruled out.  

This is tricky. Let’s try O in 5 and D in 1:  
D E T _ O – need a valid word.  
DETRO – R ruled out.  
DETOX – X not ruled out, but is “DETOX” a word? Yes, “DETOX” is a valid word meaning to detoxify.  
Check constraints:
- D in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
- E in 2: required  
- T in 3: required  
- O in 5: allowed (not ruled out)  
- X in 4: X has not been ruled out.  

DETOX satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be DETOX.

<guess>DETOX</guess>",DETOX,"Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x):
A, R, S, N, Y, C, P

Letters that ARE in the word (from “-” or “✓”):
- O (must be somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 from the feedback so far – wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully)

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 5

2. TONEY → T(-) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 3  

3. OCTET → O(-) C(x) T(✓) E(-) T(-)  
   – T is in the word and IS in position 3  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 4  

4. EPODE → E(-) P(x) O(-) D(-) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
   – P is NOT in the word  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known)  
   – D is in the word but NOT in position 4  

So far we have:

- T is fixed in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
  The only remaining position for E is position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
  Wait, that can’t be possible. Let’s re-examine the positions:

  From all feedback on O:
  – AROSE: not 3  
  – TONEY: not 2  
  – OCTET: not 1  
  – EPODE: not 3 (again)  

  Positions left for O: 4 or 5.

Similarly for E:
– AROSE: not 5  
– TONEY: not 3  
– OCTET: not 4  
– EPODE: not 1, 3, 4, 5  

  The only remaining position for E is 2.

So the word must be: _ E T O _ or _ E T _ O, with O in 4 or 5.

But E must be in 2, T in 3, so the pattern is: _ E T O _ or _ E T _ O.

We also know D is in the word but not in position 4 (from EPODE feedback).  
So D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible words:

Case 1: _ E T O _  
Then D must be in position 5.  
Word: ? E T O D  
Allowed consonants left (not ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.  
D is allowed in position 5.  
A valid word: B E T O D → “BETOD” – not valid.  
F E T O D → “FETOD” – not valid.  
H E T O D → “HETOD” – not valid.  
L E T O D → “LETOD” – not valid.  
M E T O D → “METOD” – not valid.  
V E T O D → “VETOD” – not valid.  
W E T O D → “WETOD” – not valid.  
G E T O D → “GETOD” – not valid.  

Case 2: _ E T _ O  
Then D must be in position 1 or 4.  
But D cannot be in position 4 (from EPODE feedback: D(-) means not in 4).  
So D must be in position 1.  
Word: D E T _ O  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form D E T _ O.  
Looking for such words:  
DETRO – invalid (R ruled out)  
DETFO – invalid  
DETHO – invalid  
DETGO – invalid  
DETMO – invalid  
DETVO – invalid  
DETWO – invalid  

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let’s double-check if we missed any possibilities.

Wait, the feedback for EPODE shows E(-) in positions 1 and 5, which means E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.  
We already have T in position 3, so the only possible positions for E are 2 or 4.  
But from earlier feedback:
– TONEY: E not in 3  
– OCTET: E not in 4  
So E cannot be in 4 either.  
Thus E must be in position 2.  

So the pattern is _ E T _ O or _ E T O _.

From EPODE feedback:
- D is in the word but not in position 4.  
So D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s re-examine the possible words:

Pattern _ E T _ O:
- D must be in position 1 or 5.  
  If D in 1: D E T _ O → need a valid word.  
  DETRO – invalid (R ruled out)  
  DETFO – invalid  
  … none seem valid.  
  If D in 5: _ E T _ D → but then O must be in 4, so word is _ E T O D.  
  We tried this earlier and found no valid words.

This suggests we may have missed a valid word. Let’s think differently.

We know:
- T is in position 3.  
- E must be in position 2.  
- O must be in position 4 or 5.  
- D is in the word but not in position 4.  
- All other letters must be from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words matching _ E T _ _ with these constraints.

Possible words:
- BETEL – invalid (L is allowed, but E is already used twice)  
- BETON – invalid (N ruled out)  
- BETOD – invalid  
- DETOX – invalid (X not ruled out, but let’s check)  
Wait, we need to ensure O is in 4 or 5.

Let’s try:
- BETEL – has E in 2 and 5, but E cannot be in 5.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETOL – L is allowed, but O is in 4: B E T O L – “BETOL” – not valid.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETES – S ruled out.  
- BETES – same.  
- BETON – N ruled out.  
- BETEL – E in 5 invalid.  
- DETOX – X not ruled out, but O in 4: D E T O X – “DETOK” – no, “DETOK” is not a word.  
- FETID – D in 5, but I is allowed: F E T I D – but O must be in word, so this is invalid.  
- GELID – G E L I D – no T.  
- HELIX – no T.  
- JETON – J is allowed, but N ruled out.  
- METAL – A ruled out.  
- METRO – R ruled out.  
- PETAL – P ruled out.  
- VETED – V E T E D – but E in 2 and 4, but E cannot be in 4.  
- WETTE – double E, but E cannot be in 4.  
- WETON – N ruled out.  

This is tricky. Let’s try O in 5 and D in 1:  
D E T _ O – need a valid word.  
DETRO – R ruled out.  
DETOX – X not ruled out, but is “DETOX” a word? Yes, “DETOX” is a valid word meaning to detoxify.  
Check constraints:
- D in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
- E in 2: required  
- T in 3: required  
- O in 5: allowed (not ruled out)  
- X in 4: X has not been ruled out.  

DETOX satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be DETOX.",Guess 6: DETOX -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) T(✓) O(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
