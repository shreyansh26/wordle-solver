### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4 (and 3 is already O) are all letters except A, E, O, R, S, M, L.

Common consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We also know B must appear once (since it was marked “-” in AMBLE, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).  
Therefore B must be in position 2 or 4.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Pattern: A _ O _ E

2. AMBLE → A(✓) M(x) B(-) L(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ B is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. ABODE → A(✓) B(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ B is now confirmed in position 2.  
   ⇒ D is NOT in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: A B O _ E  
- Letters ruled out: R, S, M, L, D  
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out.

Letters still available for position 4 (excluding A, B, O, E and the ruled-out set):  
C, F, G, H, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words fitting A B O _ E:
- ABONE (but N is allowed)  
- ABOGE (G allowed)  
- ABOFE (F allowed)  
- ABOHE (H allowed)  
- ABONE, ABOGE, ABOFE, ABOHE, ABOTE, ABOYE

Valid English words among these:
- ABONE (variant spelling of “abone”, but not standard)  
- ABOGE (not a word)  
- ABOFE (not a word)  
- ABOHE (not a word)  
- ABONE (not standard)  
- ABOTE (not a word)  
- ABOYE (not a word)

Wait, let’s double-check: the only common English word fitting A B O _ E is “ABOVE”.

Letters in ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E  
- V has not been ruled out.  
- All letters are allowed.

Therefore, the only possible word left is ABOVE.
