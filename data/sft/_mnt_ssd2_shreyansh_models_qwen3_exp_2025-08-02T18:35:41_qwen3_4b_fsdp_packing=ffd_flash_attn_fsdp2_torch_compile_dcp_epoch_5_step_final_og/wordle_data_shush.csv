### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but less consonants)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is excellent because:
1. It includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T)
2. The letters S, T, A, E are all very frequent in English
3. L is a common consonant that can appear in many positions

This gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. No L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the word
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, D, C, B, M, P, F, H, G

A strong second guess would test several of these new letters while keeping S fixed. A good candidate is ""SPURN"":

Common starting words include:\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (many vowels but less consonants)\n- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)\n\nAmong these, ""SLATE"" is excellent because:\n1. It includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T)\n2. The letters S, T, A, E are all very frequent in English\n3. L is a common consonant that can appear in many positions\n\nThis gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is in the correct first position (✓)\n- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

Current constraints:
1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓)
2. U is fixed in position 3 (✓)
3. H is fixed in position 2 (✓)
4. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, P, R, N, C, K

So the pattern is: S H U _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters that have not been ruled out. Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, J, M, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O (since A and E are out, and U is already used)

Good candidates should test new letters efficiently. Let's try ""SHU"" + something:
- SHU + M + ? ""SHUM"" is 4 letters. ""SHUMP"" - P is out. ""SHUDD"" - not a word.

Better: ""SHU"" + ""B"" + ""I"" -> ""SHUBI"" - not valid. ""SHU"" + ""B"" + ""O"" -> ""SHUBO"" - no.

Try ""SHU"" + ""M"" + ""O"" -> ""SHUMO"" - no. ""SHU"" + ""M"" + ""B"" -> ""SHUMB"" - no.

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words matching S H U _ _:
- SHUSH - but S is already in position 1 and we don't know about S in position 5 yet.
- SHULK - K is out.
- SHULG - not a word.
- SHULM - not a word.

Actually, let's list valid words: ""SHUSH"", ""SHUDD"", ""SHUVE"", etc. But most have ruled-out letters.

Real valid words:
- SHUSH: S H U S H - but S is already used in position 1, and we don't know if S is allowed in position 5. Also, U is already in position 3.
- SHULS - plural of shul, but not common.
- SHUDD - not a word.

Actually, let's think of ""SHU"" + ""B"" + ""I"" -> ""SHUBI"" - no. ""SHU"" + ""B"" + ""O"" -> ""SHUBO"" - no.

Another approach: position 4 and 5 can be:
- consonants: B, D, F, G, J, M, V, W, Y
- vowels: I, O

Possible combinations:
- SHU + M + I -> ""SHUMI"" - not a word.
- SHU + M + O -> ""SHUMO"" - no.
- SHU + B + I -> ""SHUBI"" - no.
- SHU + B + O -> ""SHUBO"" - no.

- SHU + Y + O -> ""SHUYO"" - no.

Hmm, seems like few valid words. Let's try ""SHUSH"" - even though S is repeated, it's possible. But we have no info on S in position 5 yet.

Another valid word: ""SHU"" + ""B"" + ""O"" -> ""SHUBO"" - no. 

Wait, let's think of ""SHU"" + ""M"" + ""B"" -> ""SHUMB"" - no.

Actually, ""SHU"" + ""M"" + ""I"" -> ""SHUMI"" - not a word.

Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with SHU:

- SHUGS
- SHUPE
- SHURS
- SHURT

From these, the ones without ruled-out letters (L,A,T,E,P,R,N,C,K):
- SHUSH - uses S twice, but S is allowed in position 5 if not ruled out.
- SHULS - L is out.
- SHULD - L is out.

Among these, ""SHUSH"" is the most common word. Let's try it.
