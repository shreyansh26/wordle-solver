For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally use letters that appear frequently in English words. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which will help me quickly narrow down possible letters. The letters A, R, O, S, and E are all very common in English words, so this should give me good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

That leaves us with consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Common remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O, E entirely.

Candidate words that fit:
- “stink” – uses S in 1st position, plus T, I, N, K (but K is less common).
- “spend” – S in 1st, P, E (but E is ruled out).
- “sling” – S in 1st, L, I, N, G (I and N are good, G is okay).
- “spurn” – S in 1st, P, U, R (R is ruled out).
- “sulks” – S in 5th, U, L, K (but S is in wrong position).
- “tucks” – S in 5th, T, U, C, K (good letters, S in new position).

“tucks” seems strong because:
- S is now in 5th position (different from 4th).
- T, U, C, K are all new letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

So I’ll go with “tucks”.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
   - Letters not in the word: T, C, K (already knew A, R, O, E are out)
   - Letter U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s not in position 4).

So the secret word:
- Has U in position 2.
- Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with U in position 2 and S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4, since we just learned it can’t be 5). Wait, the feedback for tucks shows S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. Since it was position 4 in tucks, the earlier arose feedback said S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 1: S _ U _ _
- Position 3: _ _ U S _

We need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

Good candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""spuds"" – but D is okay, P is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3? No, U must be position 2. So ""spuds"" is invalid (U is position 3). ""subpo"" – invalid (contains O). ""sulks"" – K is out. ""swung"" – W is okay, N is okay, G is okay, but U is position 3, not 2. ""swung"" is invalid. ""squad"" – A is out. ""suds"" – too short. ""sushi"" – I is okay, but H is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _: e.g., ""mushy"" – H, Y are okay, but S is position 4, which is invalid (S can’t be 4). ""pulsy"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 4, invalid. ""bushy"" – same issue. ""gushy"" – same. ""lusty"" – L, T is out. ""musky"" – K is out. ""nusty"" – N, T is out. ""pusty"" – P, T is out. ""wusty"" – W, T is out.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let’s list possible words with U in position 2 and S in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
  - S _ U _ _ : e.g., ""spuds"" – no, U is 3. ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sugar"" – A, R out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, but Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.

Wait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

But for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.

So the pattern must be:
- S _ U _ _

But in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
- U(✓) means U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the word has:
- Position 2: U
- Contains S, but S is not in position 5 (and from arose, S is not in position 4).

So possible positions for S: 1, 3 (since 2 is U, 4 and 5 are excluded).

So possible patterns:
1. S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
2. _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid because S can't be 4 from arose)
3. _ _ U _ S (S in 5, but this is invalid from tucks feedback)

So only possible pattern is S _ U _ _ with S in 1 and U in 2.

But then the word would be S U _ _ _ but that would have U in 2 and S in 1, which fits.

Examples:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3. Wait, no, in ""sully"" U is position 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.

I realize now I'm confusing positions. Let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
From tucks (T U C K S):
- Position 1: T (x) – not in word
- Position 2: U (✓) – correct position (2)
- Position 3: C (x) – not in word
- Position 4: K (x) – not in word
- Position 5: S (-) – in word, not in position 5

So the word has:
- U in position 2
- S is in word, but not in position 5
- From arose, S is not in position 4
- So S must be in position 1 or 3

Possible patterns:
1. S U _ _ _ (S in 1, U in 2)
2. _ U _ S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid from arose)
3. _ U S _ _ (S in 3)

So two possible patterns:
- S U _ _ _
- _ U S _ _

Now let's think of words fitting these patterns with remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

For S U _ _ _:
- S U _ _ _ : e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it's an English word meaning to make someone look bad.

For _ U S _ _:
- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.

Between these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.

But ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let's check:
- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- U in 2: correct from feedback
- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct
- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it's in 1)

So ""sully"" seems valid.

Another option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y. But double S might be less likely, and Y is okay.

Between ""sully"" and ""lussy"", ""sully"" is more common.

Thus, I'll guess ""sully"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2.
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and tucks).
- Therefore S must be in position 1 or 3.
- From the pattern _ U S _ _, ""pussy"" and ""lussy"" fit, but ""sully"" (S U _ _ _) also fits and is a valid word.

I'll choose ""sully"" as it places S in position 1, satisfying all constraints.

So the secret word:
- Has U in position 2.
- Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with U in position 2 and S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4, since we just learned it can’t be 5). Wait, the feedback for tucks shows S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. Since it was position 4 in tucks, the earlier arose feedback said S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 1: S _ U _ _
- Position 3: _ _ U S _

We need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

Good candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""spuds"" – but D is okay, P is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3? No, U must be position 2. So ""spuds"" is invalid (U is position 3). ""subpo"" – invalid (contains O). ""sulks"" – K is out. ""swung"" – W is okay, N is okay, G is okay, but U is position 3, not 2. ""swung"" is invalid. ""squad"" – A is out. ""suds"" – too short. ""sushi"" – I is okay, but H is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _: e.g., ""mushy"" – H, Y are okay, but S is position 4, which is invalid (S can’t be 4). ""pulsy"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 4, invalid. ""bushy"" – same issue. ""gushy"" – same. ""lusty"" – L, T is out. ""musky"" – K is out. ""nusty"" – N, T is out. ""pusty"" – P, T is out. ""wusty"" – W, T is out.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let’s list possible words with U in position 2 and S in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
  - S _ U _ _ : e.g., ""spuds"" – no, U is 3. ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sugar"" – A, R out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, but Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.

Wait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

But for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.

So the pattern must be:
- S _ U _ _

But in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
- U(✓) means U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the word has:
- Position 2: U
- Contains S, but S is not in position 5 (and from arose, S is not in position 4).

So possible positions for S: 1, 3 (since 2 is U, 4 and 5 are excluded).

So possible patterns:
1. S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
2. _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid because S can't be 4 from arose)
3. _ _ U _ S (S in 5, but this is invalid from tucks feedback)

So only possible pattern is S _ U _ _ with S in 1 and U in 2.

But then the word would be S U _ _ _ but that would have U in 2 and S in 1, which fits.

Examples:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3. Wait, no, in ""sully"" U is position 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.

I realize now I'm confusing positions. Let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
From tucks (T U C K S):
- Position 1: T (x) – not in word
- Position 2: U (✓) – correct position (2)
- Position 3: C (x) – not in word
- Position 4: K (x) – not in word
- Position 5: S (-) – in word, not in position 5

So the word has:
- U in position 2
- S is in word, but not in position 5
- From arose, S is not in position 4
- So S must be in position 1 or 3

Possible patterns:
1. S U _ _ _ (S in 1, U in 2)
2. _ U _ S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid from arose)
3. _ U S _ _ (S in 3)

So two possible patterns:
- S U _ _ _
- _ U S _ _

Now let's think of words fitting these patterns with remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

For S U _ _ _:
- S U _ _ _ : e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it's an English word meaning to make someone look bad.

For _ U S _ _:
- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.

Between these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.

But ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let's check:
- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- U in 2: correct from feedback
- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct
- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it's in 1)

So ""sully"" seems valid.

Another option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y. But double S might be less likely, and Y is okay.

Between ""sully"" and ""lussy"", ""sully"" is more common.

Thus, I'll guess ""sully"".Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2.
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and tucks).
- Therefore S must be in position 1 or 3.
- From the pattern _ U S _ _, ""pussy"" and ""lussy"" fit, but ""sully"" (S U _ _ _) also fits and is a valid word.

I'll choose ""sully"" as it places S in position 1, satisfying all constraints.",Guess 3: sully -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally use letters that appear frequently in English words. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which will help me quickly narrow down possible letters. The letters A, R, O, S, and E are all very common in English words, so this should give me good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

That leaves us with consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Common remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O, E entirely.

Candidate words that fit:
- “stink” – uses S in 1st position, plus T, I, N, K (but K is less common).
- “spend” – S in 1st, P, E (but E is ruled out).
- “sling” – S in 1st, L, I, N, G (I and N are good, G is okay).
- “spurn” – S in 1st, P, U, R (R is ruled out).
- “sulks” – S in 5th, U, L, K (but S is in wrong position).
- “tucks” – S in 5th, T, U, C, K (good letters, S in new position).

“tucks” seems strong because:
- S is now in 5th position (different from 4th).
- T, U, C, K are all new letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

So I’ll go with “tucks”.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E

- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.

Wait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

But for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.

So the pattern must be:

But in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally use letters that appear frequently in English words. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which will help me quickly narrow down possible letters. The letters A, R, O, S, and E are all very common in English words, so this should give me good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

That leaves us with consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Common remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O, E entirely.

Candidate words that fit:
- “stink” – uses S in 1st position, plus T, I, N, K (but K is less common).
- “spend” – S in 1st, P, E (but E is ruled out).
- “sling” – S in 1st, L, I, N, G (I and N are good, G is okay).
- “spurn” – S in 1st, P, U, R (R is ruled out).
- “sulks” – S in 5th, U, L, K (but S is in wrong position).
- “tucks” – S in 5th, T, U, C, K (good letters, S in new position).

“tucks” seems strong because:
- S is now in 5th position (different from 4th).
- T, U, C, K are all new letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

So I’ll go with “tucks”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: tucks -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
   - Letters not in the word: T, C, K (already knew A, R, O, E are out)
   - Letter U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s not in position 4).

So the secret word:
- Has U in position 2.
- Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with U in position 2 and S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4, since we just learned it can’t be 5). Wait, the feedback for tucks shows S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. Since it was position 4 in tucks, the earlier arose feedback said S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 1: S _ U _ _
- Position 3: _ _ U S _

We need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

Good candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""spuds"" – but D is okay, P is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3? No, U must be position 2. So ""spuds"" is invalid (U is position 3). ""subpo"" – invalid (contains O). ""sulks"" – K is out. ""swung"" – W is okay, N is okay, G is okay, but U is position 3, not 2. ""swung"" is invalid. ""squad"" – A is out. ""suds"" – too short. ""sushi"" – I is okay, but H is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _: e.g., ""mushy"" – H, Y are okay, but S is position 4, which is invalid (S can’t be 4). ""pulsy"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 4, invalid. ""bushy"" – same issue. ""gushy"" – same. ""lusty"" – L, T is out. ""musky"" – K is out. ""nusty"" – N, T is out. ""pusty"" – P, T is out. ""wusty"" – W, T is out.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let’s list possible words with U in position 2 and S in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
  - S _ U _ _ : e.g., ""spuds"" – no, U is 3. ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sugar"" – A, R out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, but Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.

Wait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

But for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.

So the pattern must be:
- S _ U _ _

But in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
- U(✓) means U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the word has:
- Position 2: U
- Contains S, but S is not in position 5 (and from arose, S is not in position 4).

So possible positions for S: 1, 3 (since 2 is U, 4 and 5 are excluded).

So possible patterns:
1. S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
2. _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid because S can't be 4 from arose)
3. _ _ U _ S (S in 5, but this is invalid from tucks feedback)

So only possible pattern is S _ U _ _ with S in 1 and U in 2.

But then the word would be S U _ _ _ but that would have U in 2 and S in 1, which fits.

Examples:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3. Wait, no, in ""sully"" U is position 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.

I realize now I'm confusing positions. Let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
From tucks (T U C K S):
- Position 1: T (x) – not in word
- Position 2: U (✓) – correct position (2)
- Position 3: C (x) – not in word
- Position 4: K (x) – not in word
- Position 5: S (-) – in word, not in position 5

So the word has:
- U in position 2
- S is in word, but not in position 5
- From arose, S is not in position 4
- So S must be in position 1 or 3

Possible patterns:
1. S U _ _ _ (S in 1, U in 2)
2. _ U _ S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid from arose)
3. _ U S _ _ (S in 3)

So two possible patterns:
- S U _ _ _
- _ U S _ _

Now let's think of words fitting these patterns with remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

For S U _ _ _:
- S U _ _ _ : e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it's an English word meaning to make someone look bad.

For _ U S _ _:
- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.

Between these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.

But ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let's check:
- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- U in 2: correct from feedback
- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct
- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it's in 1)

So ""sully"" seems valid.

Another option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y. But double S might be less likely, and Y is okay.

Between ""sully"" and ""lussy"", ""sully"" is more common.

Thus, I'll guess ""sully"".Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2.
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and tucks).
- Therefore S must be in position 1 or 3.
- From the pattern _ U S _ _, ""pussy"" and ""lussy"" fit, but ""sully"" (S U _ _ _) also fits and is a valid word.

I'll choose ""sully"" as it places S in position 1, satisfying all constraints.

""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it\'s an English word meaning to make someone look bad.\n\nFor _ U S _ _:\n- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.\n\nBetween these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.\n\nBut ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let\'s check:\n- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)\n- U in 2: correct from feedback\n- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct\n- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it\'s in 1)\n\nSo ""sully"" seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally use letters that appear frequently in English words. 

After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which will help me quickly narrow down possible letters. The letters A, R, O, S, and E are all very common in English words, so this should give me good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

That leaves us with consonants and vowels not yet ruled out. Common remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the known letter S in a different position.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid A, R, O, E entirely.

Candidate words that fit:
- “stink” – uses S in 1st position, plus T, I, N, K (but K is less common).
- “spend” – S in 1st, P, E (but E is ruled out).
- “sling” – S in 1st, L, I, N, G (I and N are good, G is okay).
- “spurn” – S in 1st, P, U, R (R is ruled out).
- “sulks” – S in 5th, U, L, K (but S is in wrong position).
- “tucks” – S in 5th, T, U, C, K (good letters, S in new position).

“tucks” seems strong because:
- S is now in 5th position (different from 4th).
- T, U, C, K are all new letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

So I’ll go with “tucks”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: tucks -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
   - Letters not in the word: T, C, K (already knew A, R, O, E are out)
   - Letter U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we already knew it’s not in position 4).

So the secret word:
- Has U in position 2.
- Contains S, but S cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with U in position 2 and S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4, since we just learned it can’t be 5). Wait, the feedback for tucks shows S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. Since it was position 4 in tucks, the earlier arose feedback said S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 1: S _ U _ _
- Position 3: _ _ U S _

We need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

Good candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""spuds"" – but D is okay, P is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3? No, U must be position 2. So ""spuds"" is invalid (U is position 3). ""subpo"" – invalid (contains O). ""sulks"" – K is out. ""swung"" – W is okay, N is okay, G is okay, but U is position 3, not 2. ""swung"" is invalid. ""squad"" – A is out. ""suds"" – too short. ""sushi"" – I is okay, but H is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _: e.g., ""mushy"" – H, Y are okay, but S is position 4, which is invalid (S can’t be 4). ""pulsy"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 4, invalid. ""bushy"" – same issue. ""gushy"" – same. ""lusty"" – L, T is out. ""musky"" – K is out. ""nusty"" – N, T is out. ""pusty"" – P, T is out. ""wusty"" – W, T is out.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let’s list possible words with U in position 2 and S in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
  - S _ U _ _ : e.g., ""spuds"" – no, U is 3. ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sugar"" – A, R out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, but Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.

- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.

Wait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

But for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.

So the pattern must be:
- S _ U _ _

But in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)
- U(✓) means U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the word has:
- Position 2: U
- Contains S, but S is not in position 5 (and from arose, S is not in position 4).

So possible positions for S: 1, 3 (since 2 is U, 4 and 5 are excluded).

So possible patterns:
1. S _ U _ _ (S in 1)
2. _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid because S can't be 4 from arose)
3. _ _ U _ S (S in 5, but this is invalid from tucks feedback)

So only possible pattern is S _ U _ _ with S in 1 and U in 2.

But then the word would be S U _ _ _ but that would have U in 2 and S in 1, which fits.

Examples:
- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3. Wait, no, in ""sully"" U is position 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.

I realize now I'm confusing positions. Let me re-index:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
From tucks (T U C K S):
- Position 1: T (x) – not in word
- Position 2: U (✓) – correct position (2)
- Position 3: C (x) – not in word
- Position 4: K (x) – not in word
- Position 5: S (-) – in word, not in position 5

So the word has:
- U in position 2
- S is in word, but not in position 5
- From arose, S is not in position 4
- So S must be in position 1 or 3

Possible patterns:
1. S U _ _ _ (S in 1, U in 2)
2. _ U _ S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid from arose)
3. _ U S _ _ (S in 3)

So two possible patterns:
- S U _ _ _
- _ U S _ _

Now let's think of words fitting these patterns with remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).

For S U _ _ _:
- S U _ _ _ : e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it's an English word meaning to make someone look bad.

For _ U S _ _:
- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.

Between these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.

But ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let's check:
- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- U in 2: correct from feedback
- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct
- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it's in 1)

So ""sully"" seems valid.

Another option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y. But double S might be less likely, and Y is okay.

Between ""sully"" and ""lussy"", ""sully"" is more common.

Thus, I'll guess ""sully"".Based on the feedback:
- U is confirmed in position 2.
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and tucks).
- Therefore S must be in position 1 or 3.
- From the pattern _ U S _ _, ""pussy"" and ""lussy"" fit, but ""sully"" (S U _ _ _) also fits and is a valid word.

I'll choose ""sully"" as it places S in position 1, satisfying all constraints.

- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U(✓) → U is in position 2 (already known).  
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.  
- L(x) → same.  
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ U _ _ Y  
with the additional constraints:
- Contains S, but S is NOT in position 1 or 5 (from arose and sully).  
  Therefore S must be in position 3 or 4.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, O, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
_ U S _ Y  or  _ U _ S Y

Let’s list possibilities:

1. _ U S _ Y  
   - “musky” – K out.  
   - “pusky” – not a word.  
   - “bushy” – H is okay, but S is in 3, U in 2, Y in 5.  
     “bushy” is valid: B U S H Y.

2. _ U _ S Y  
   - “musky” – K out.  
   - “pussy” – P U S S Y (double S).  
   - “bussy” – B U S S Y (double S).  
   - “nusky” – K out.  
   - “hussy” – H U S S Y (double S).  

Among these, “bushy” is a clean word with no repeated letters and no banned letters.  
Let’s verify:
- B, U, S, H, Y  
- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L → OK  
- U in 2, Y in 5 → matches ✓  
- S in 3 → allowed (not 1 or 5) → matches ✓  
- No other letters ruled out → OK  

“bushy” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback on “bushy”:

- B(x) → B is NOT in the word.  
- U(✓) → U is in position 2 (already known).  
- S(✓) → S is in position 3 (new, exact placement).  
- H(✓) → H is in position 4 (new, exact placement).  
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 (already known).

So the secret word now has the fixed pattern:

_ U S H Y

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out include: A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L, B.  
Remaining consonants that can start a word: D, F, G, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these consonants and ends in “USHY”.

Scanning common words:
- DUSHY – not standard.  
- FUSHY – not a word.  
- GUSHY – valid (means “moist” or “damp”).  
- MUSHY – valid.  
- NUSHY – not a word.  
- PUS HY – not a word.  
- WUSHY – not a word.  

Between GUSHY and MUSHY, both fit perfectly.  
GUSHY is slightly more common in everyday use, so I’ll choose it.

A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally use letters that appear frequently in English words. \n\nAfter considering options like ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ADIEU"", I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice. It contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which will help me quickly narrow down possible letters. The letters A, R, O, S, and E are all very common in English words, so this should give me good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose”:\n- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains S, but NOT in the 4th position.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.\n\nThat leaves us with consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Wait, the feedback for tucks shows S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 5. Since it was position 4 in tucks, the earlier arose feedback said S is not in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nLet’s list possible positions:\n- Position 1: S _ U _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ U S _\n\nWe need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).\n\nGood candidate letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.\n\nLet’s think of words that fit:\n- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""spuds"" – but D is okay, P is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3? No, U must be position 2. So ""spuds"" is invalid (U is position 3). ""subpo"" – invalid (contains O). ""sulks"" – K is out. ""swung"" – W is okay, N is okay, G is okay, but U is position 3, not 2. ""swung"" is invalid. ""squad"" – A is out. ""suds"" – too short. ""sushi"" – I is okay, but H is okay, but S is position 1, U position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.\n\n- _ _ U S _: e.g., ""mushy"" – H, Y are okay, but S is position 4, which is invalid (S can’t be 4). ""pulsy"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 4, invalid. ""bushy"" – same issue. ""gushy"" – same. ""lusty"" – L, T is out. ""musky"" – K is out. ""nusty"" – N, T is out. ""pusty"" – P, T is out. ""wusty"" – W, T is out.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let’s list possible words with U in position 2 and S in position 1 or 3.\n\nPossible patterns:\n- S _ U _ _ (S in 1)\n  - S _ U _ _ : e.g., ""spuds"" – no, U is 3. ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sugar"" – A, R out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, but Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3 again. Not matching U in position 2.\n\n- _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but we know S can’t be 4 from arose feedback). So this is invalid.\n\nWait, the arose feedback said S is in word but not position 4. The tucks feedback said S is in word but not position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nBut for _ _ U S _ (S in 4) is invalid. So S must be in position 1 or 3, but in position 3 would make the word _ _ U S _, which is S in 4, which is invalid. Therefore S must be in position 1.\n\nSo the pattern must be:\n- S _ U _ _\n\nBut in this pattern, U is position 3, not 2. This contradicts the tucks feedback that U is in position 2.\n\nWait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.\n\nFrom tucks → T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)\n- U(✓) means U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).\n\nSo the word has:\n- Position 2: U\n- Contains S, but S is not in position 5 (and from arose, S is not in position 4).\n\nSo possible positions for S: 1, 3 (since 2 is U, 4 and 5 are excluded).\n\nSo possible patterns:\n1. S _ U _ _ (S in 1)\n2. _ _ U S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid because S can\'t be 4 from arose)\n3. _ _ U _ S (S in 5, but this is invalid from tucks feedback)\n\nSo only possible pattern is S _ U _ _ with S in 1 and U in 2.\n\nBut then the word would be S U _ _ _ but that would have U in 2 and S in 1, which fits.\n\nExamples:\n- S _ U _ _: e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L is okay, Y is okay, but S is position 1, U is position 3. Wait, no, in ""sully"" U is position 3, not 2. So this doesn\'t fit.\n\nI realize now I\'m confusing positions. Let me re-index:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5\nFrom tucks (T U C K S):\n- Position 1: T (x) – not in word\n- Position 2: U (✓) – correct position (2)\n- Position 3: C (x) – not in word\n- Position 4: K (x) – not in word\n- Position 5: S (-) – in word, not in position 5\n\nSo the word has:\n- U in position 2\n- S is in word, but not in position 5\n- From arose, S is not in position 4\n- So S must be in position 1 or 3\n\nPossible patterns:\n1. S U _ _ _ (S in 1, U in 2)\n2. _ U _ S _ (S in 4, but this is invalid from arose)\n3. _ U S _ _ (S in 3)\n\nSo two possible patterns:\n- S U _ _ _\n- _ U S _ _\n\nNow let\'s think of words fitting these patterns with remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, T, C, K).\n\nFor S U _ _ _:\n- S U _ _ _ : e.g., ""sulks"" – K out. ""sulfa"" – A out. ""sulky"" – K out. ""sully"" – L, Y are okay, but this would be S U L L Y – but Y is okay. However, ""sully"" has U in 2 and S in 1, but the word would be S U L L Y. Is ""sully"" valid? Yes, it\'s an English word meaning to make someone look bad.\n\nFor _ U S _ _:\n- _ U S _ _ : e.g., ""mussy"" – M, Y are okay, but S is in 3. ""musky"" – K out. ""lussy"" – L, Y are okay. ""pussy"" – P, Y are okay. ""bussy"" – B, Y are okay.\n\nBetween these, ""sully"" and ""pussy"" are both valid. ""pussy"" uses P, S, U, Y, but P is okay. ""sully"" uses S, U, L, Y.\n\nBut ""sully"" has S in 1, U in 2, which fits all constraints. Let\'s check:\n- S in 1: allowed (not excluded)\n- U in 2: correct from feedback\n- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K: correct\n- S is in word, not in 5: correct (it\'s in 1)\n\nSo ""sully"" seems valid.\n\nAnother option: ""lussy"" – L, U, S, S, Y. But double S might be less likely, and Y is okay.\n\nBetween ""sully"" and ""lussy"", ""sully"" is more common.\n\nThus, I\'ll guess ""sully"".Based on the feedback:\n- U is confirmed in position 2.\n- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and tucks).\n- Therefore S must be in position 1 or 3.\n- From the pattern _ U S _ _, ""pussy"" and ""lussy"" fit, but ""sully"" (S U _ _ _) also fits and is a valid word.\n\nI\'ll choose ""sully"" as it places S in position 1, satisfying all constraints.\n\n<guess>sully</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: tucks -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: sully -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the latest feedback on “sully”:\n\n- S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  \n- U(✓) → U is in position 2 (already known).  \n- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.  \n- L(x) → same.  \n- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word has the pattern:\n_ U _ _ Y  \nwith the additional constraints:\n- Contains S, but S is NOT in position 1 or 5 (from arose and sully).  \n  Therefore S must be in position 3 or 4.  \n- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L.\n\nRemaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.  \nRemaining vowels: I (since A, O, E are out).\n\nWe need a 5-letter word of the form:\n_ U S _ Y  or  _ U _ S Y\n\nLet’s list possibilities:\n\n1. _ U S _ Y  \n   - “musky” – K out.  \n   - “pusky” – not a word.  \n   - “bushy” – H is okay, but S is in 3, U in 2, Y in 5.  \n     “bushy” is valid: B U S H Y.\n\n2. _ U _ S Y  \n   - “musky” – K out.  \n   - “pussy” – P U S S Y (double S).  \n   - “bussy” – B U S S Y (double S).  \n   - “nusky” – K out.  \n   - “hussy” – H U S S Y (double S).  \n\nAmong these, “bushy” is a clean word with no repeated letters and no banned letters.  \nLet’s verify:\n- B, U, S, H, Y  \n- No A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L → OK  \n- U in 2, Y in 5 → matches ✓  \n- S in 3 → allowed (not 1 or 5) → matches ✓  \n- No other letters ruled out → OK  \n\n“bushy” is a strong next guess.\n\n<guess>bushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: tucks -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: sully -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “bushy”:\n\n- B(x) → B is NOT in the word.  \n- U(✓) → U is in position 2 (already known).  \n- S(✓) → S is in position 3 (new, exact placement).  \n- H(✓) → H is in position 4 (new, exact placement).  \n- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 (already known).\n\nSo the secret word now has the fixed pattern:\n\n_ U S H Y\n\nOnly the first letter is unknown.  \nLetters already ruled out include: A, R, O, E, T, C, K, L, B.  \nRemaining consonants that can start a word: D, F, G, M, N, P, V, W, etc.\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these consonants and ends in “USHY”.\n\nScanning common words:\n- DUSHY – not standard.  \n- FUSHY – not a word.  \n- GUSHY – valid (means “moist” or “damp”).  \n- MUSHY – valid.  \n- NUSHY – not a word.  \n- PUS HY – not a word.  \n- WUSHY – not a word.  \n\nBetween GUSHY and MUSHY, both fit perfectly.  \nGUSHY is slightly more common in everyday use, so I’ll choose it.\n\n<guess>gushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: tucks -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: sully -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: gushy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
