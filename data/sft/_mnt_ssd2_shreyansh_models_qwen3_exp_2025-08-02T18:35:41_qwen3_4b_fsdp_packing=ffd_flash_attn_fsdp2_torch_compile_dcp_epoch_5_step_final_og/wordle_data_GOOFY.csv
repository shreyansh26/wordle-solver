### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word must avoid every one of those letters.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E  

We need a 5-letter word that uses none of those letters.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A strong second guess should cover new common letters.  
Popular choices that avoid S,L,A,T,E:

- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  

Letters we know ARE in the word and in the correct position (from Guess 2):  
O in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set):  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O)

We need a 5-letter word with O in the second position and no other eliminated letters.  
Good candidates:  
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) → but A is eliminated  
- GLOBE → E is eliminated  
- HOIST → S, T are eliminated  
- MOMMY → M, Y are still possible, but double M is okay  
- BOGGY → B, G, Y are possible  
- CHOIR → C, H, I, R → R is eliminated  
- WOOZY → Z is possible, but double O is okay  
- HOKEY → H, K, E → E is eliminated  
- MOPPY → M, P, Y are possible  
- POKEY → P, K, Y are possible  

Best single-use letter coverage:

Current known facts:

1. Letters NOT in the word:

2. Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:  
   - O is in position 2 (from ROUND and BOGGY)  
   - Y is in position 5 (from BOGGY)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are unknown:  
   - G (from BOGGY: G appears once and is marked “-” in positions 3 and 4)

4. Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set):  
   Consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Z  
   Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O and Y)

5. We need a 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ Y and containing G exactly once (since both G’s in BOGGY were “-”, meaning G is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4).

   Possible positions for G:  
   - Position 1: G O _ _ Y  
   - Position 3 or 4 are invalid (from BOGGY feedback)  
   - Position 5 is already Y, so G must be in position 1.

   Therefore the word must be G O _ _ Y.

6. Fill positions 3 and 4 with remaining unused letters that are not eliminated.  
   Good candidates for positions 3 and 4: C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, I

   Possible combinations:  
   - G O C H Y → “GOC HY” – not a word  
   - G O C K Y → “GOCKY” – not valid  
   - G O M I Y → “GOMIY” – not valid

   - G O V E R → E is eliminated  
   - G O V E N → E, N eliminated  
   - G O W N Y → N eliminated  
   - G O W N E → E eliminated  

   Valid dictionary word: “GOLLY” – but L is eliminated.  
   Valid word: “GOMMY” – but M is allowed and double M is okay.  
   Another: “GOOFY” – but F is allowed and double F is okay.  

   Best single-use letter coverage: “GOOFY” uses G, O, F, Y and tests F in position 4.

   However, we have only one G confirmed, so “GOOFY” has two G’s, which might be redundant.  
   Better: “GOMMY” uses G, O, M, Y and tests M in positions 3 and 4.  

   But we need a word with G in position 1, O in 2, and Y in 5, and one G in between.  
   Actually, we only know G is in the word once (since both G’s in BOGGY were “-”, not “✓”).  
   So the word must contain exactly one G, in position 1 or 3 or 4, but positions 3 and 4 are invalid (from BOGGY), so G must be in position 1.

   Therefore the word is G O _ _ Y.

   Possible valid words:  
   - G O M M Y → “GOMMY”  
   - G O P P Y → “GOPPY”  
   - G O C C Y → not a word  
   - G O V V Y → not a word  
   - G O W W Y → not a word  

   Between “GOMMY” and “GOPPY”, both are valid.  
   I’ll choose “GOMMY” as it tests M in positions 3 and 4, giving us more info.

   However, “GOMMY” has double M, which is acceptable.

   Wait, let me double-check:  
   - G is in position 1 (allowed)  
   - O in 2 (correct)  
   - M in 3 and 4 (both allowed, since we only know G is in the word once)  
   - Y in 5 (correct)  

   So “GOMMY” is valid.

   Another valid word: “GOOFY” – but that has two F’s and no M, giving less info.  
   “GOMMY” is better for testing M.

   Therefore, I’ll guess GOMMY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word must avoid every one of those letters.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E  

We need a 5-letter word that uses none of those letters.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A strong second guess should cover new common letters.  
Popular choices that avoid S,L,A,T,E:  
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- DUNNO (D, U, N, N, O)  

I’ll choose ROUND because it tests three new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D).

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  

Letters we know ARE in the word and in the correct position (from Guess 2):  
O in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set):  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O)

We need a 5-letter word with O in the second position and no other eliminated letters.  
Good candidates:  
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) → but A is eliminated  
- GLOBE → E is eliminated  
- HOIST → S, T are eliminated  
- MOMMY → M, Y are still possible, but double M is okay  
- BOGGY → B, G, Y are possible  
- CHOIR → C, H, I, R → R is eliminated  
- WOOZY → Z is possible, but double O is okay  
- HOKEY → H, K, E → E is eliminated  
- MOPPY → M, P, Y are possible  
- POKEY → P, K, Y are possible  

Best single-use letter coverage:  
""POKEY"" uses P, K, Y and the known O, avoiding all eliminated letters.  
Another good option is ""MOPPY"" or ""BOGGY"".

I'll go with ""BOGGY"" as it tests B, G, Y and keeps the O in place.

1. Pattern: G O _ _ Y  (from Guess 4 feedback)
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, B, M  
3. We still need to determine the third and fourth letters, which must be from the remaining unused common letters: C, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, Z, I  
4. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word of the form G O _ _ Y.

- G O C K Y  (valid word, uses C and K)
- G O F F Y  (valid word, uses F twice)

- G O V E R → E is eliminated
- G O W N Y → N is eliminated
- G O C C Y → not a word
- G O V V Y → not a word
- G O W W Y → not a word

Among these, G O C K Y gives us the most new letters (C and K) to test.

So the best next guess is G O C K Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word must avoid every one of those letters.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E  

We need a 5-letter word that uses none of those letters.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U  

A strong second guess should cover new common letters.  
Popular choices that avoid S,L,A,T,E:  
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- DUNNO (D, U, N, N, O)  

I’ll choose ROUND because it tests three new vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D).

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D  

Letters we know ARE in the word and in the correct position (from Guess 2):  
O in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set):  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O)

We need a 5-letter word with O in the second position and no other eliminated letters.  
Good candidates:  
- COBIA (C, O, B, I, A) → but A is eliminated  
- GLOBE → E is eliminated  
- HOIST → S, T are eliminated  
- MOMMY → M, Y are still possible, but double M is okay  
- BOGGY → B, G, Y are possible  
- CHOIR → C, H, I, R → R is eliminated  
- WOOZY → Z is possible, but double O is okay  
- HOKEY → H, K, E → E is eliminated  
- MOPPY → M, P, Y are possible  
- POKEY → P, K, Y are possible  

Best single-use letter coverage:  
""POKEY"" uses P, K, Y and the known O, avoiding all eliminated letters.  
Another good option is ""MOPPY"" or ""BOGGY"".

I'll go with ""BOGGY"" as it tests B, G, Y and keeps the O in place.

Current known facts:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, B

2. Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:  
   - O is in position 2 (from ROUND and BOGGY)  
   - Y is in position 5 (from BOGGY)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are unknown:  
   - G (from BOGGY: G appears once and is marked “-” in positions 3 and 4)

4. Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set):  
   Consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Z  
   Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O and Y)

5. We need a 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ Y and containing G exactly once (since both G’s in BOGGY were “-”, meaning G is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4).

   Possible positions for G:  
   - Position 1: G O _ _ Y  
   - Position 3 or 4 are invalid (from BOGGY feedback)  
   - Position 5 is already Y, so G must be in position 1.

   Therefore the word must be G O _ _ Y.

6. Fill positions 3 and 4 with remaining unused letters that are not eliminated.  
   Good candidates for positions 3 and 4: C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, I

   Possible combinations:  
   - G O C H Y → “GOC HY” – not a word  
   - G O C K Y → “GOCKY” – not valid  
   - G O M I Y → “GOMIY” – not valid  
   - G O P P Y → “GOPPY” – valid word (means “gossamer”)  
   - G O V E R → E is eliminated  
   - G O V E N → E, N eliminated  
   - G O W N Y → N eliminated  
   - G O W N E → E eliminated  

   Valid dictionary word: “GOLLY” – but L is eliminated.  
   Valid word: “GOMMY” – but M is allowed and double M is okay.  
   Another: “GOOFY” – but F is allowed and double F is okay.  

   Best single-use letter coverage: “GOOFY” uses G, O, F, Y and tests F in position 4.

   However, we have only one G confirmed, so “GOOFY” has two G’s, which might be redundant.  
   Better: “GOMMY” uses G, O, M, Y and tests M in positions 3 and 4.  

   But we need a word with G in position 1, O in 2, and Y in 5, and one G in between.  
   Actually, we only know G is in the word once (since both G’s in BOGGY were “-”, not “✓”).  
   So the word must contain exactly one G, in position 1 or 3 or 4, but positions 3 and 4 are invalid (from BOGGY), so G must be in position 1.

   Therefore the word is G O _ _ Y.

   Possible valid words:  
   - G O M M Y → “GOMMY”  
   - G O P P Y → “GOPPY”  
   - G O C C Y → not a word  
   - G O V V Y → not a word  
   - G O W W Y → not a word  

   Between “GOMMY” and “GOPPY”, both are valid.  
   I’ll choose “GOMMY” as it tests M in positions 3 and 4, giving us more info.

   However, “GOMMY” has double M, which is acceptable.

   Wait, let me double-check:  
   - G is in position 1 (allowed)  
   - O in 2 (correct)  
   - M in 3 and 4 (both allowed, since we only know G is in the word once)  
   - Y in 5 (correct)  

   So “GOMMY” is valid.

   Another valid word: “GOOFY” – but that has two F’s and no M, giving less info.  
   “GOMMY” is better for testing M.

   Therefore, I’ll guess GOMMY.

- G O H I Y  (not a word)

Between G O F F Y and G O P P Y, both test two new letters (F or P). Since F has not been tested yet and is common, G O F F Y seems slightly better for information gain.

However, let's verify: G O F F Y is a valid word meaning ""to fling or throw with force"". It uses F twice, which is acceptable.

Therefore, the next logical guess is G O F F Y.
