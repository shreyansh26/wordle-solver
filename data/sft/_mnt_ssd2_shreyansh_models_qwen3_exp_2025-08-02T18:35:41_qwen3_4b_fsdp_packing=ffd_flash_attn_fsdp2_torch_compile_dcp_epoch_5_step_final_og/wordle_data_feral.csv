2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution according to standard English analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position
- O is NOT in the word
- S is NOT in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position

So the secret word:
- contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their original)
- does NOT contain O or S
- has two more letters (since it's 5 letters total)

I need a new word that:
- uses A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively)
- avoids O and S
- introduces two new letters that are common but not yet ruled out

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: already known to be in word
- E: already known to be in word
- A: already known to be in word
- D: new letter

Check positions:
- R was in position 2 (original AROSE) - in TREAD it's position 2 again → this would contradict the feedback that R is in the wrong position. So TREAD is invalid.

Next try ""REACT"":
- R: position 1 (original was position 2) → allowed

- A: position 3 (original was position 1) → allowed

This looks valid. It uses A, R, E in new positions and adds C and T.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution according to standard English analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position
- O is NOT in the word
- S is NOT in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position

So the secret word:
- contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their original)
- does NOT contain O or S
- has two more letters (since it's 5 letters total)

I need a new word that:
- uses A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively)
- avoids O and S
- introduces two new letters that are common but not yet ruled out

Let me try ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: already known to be in word
- E: already known to be in word
- A: already known to be in word
- D: new letter

Check positions:
- R was in position 2 (original AROSE) - in TREAD it's position 2 again → this would contradict the feedback that R is in the wrong position. So TREAD is invalid.

Next try ""REACT"":

From the new feedback on REACT:

R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 1  
E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 2 (locked)  
A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3  
C(x) → C is not in the word  
T(x) → T is not in the word  

Summary so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, E  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, C, T  
- E is fixed in position 2  
- A must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 3  
- R must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 2  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2  
- Contains A and R, but not in the forbidden positions above  
- Avoids O, S, C, T  

Candidate positions:
1: not A, not R  
2: E (fixed)  
3: not A  
4: possible A or R  
5: possible A or R  

Good consonants to try next: N, D, L, M, P, B, etc.  
Let’s try to place A and R in remaining valid spots.

Possible structure: _ E _ _ _ with A and R in positions 4 and/or 5.

Try “PERAL”:
- P: new letter  
- E: fixed in position 2  
- R: position 3 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in 1 and 2)  
- A: position 4 (allowed, since A was only forbidden in 1 and 3)  
- L: new letter  

This satisfies all constraints.

(Another valid word could be “FERAL”, but “PERAL” uses P which we haven’t tested yet.)

A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". \n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E\n- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E\n- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U\n- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E\n\nAmong these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. \n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution according to standard English analysis.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else)\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position\n- O is NOT in the word\n- S is NOT in the word\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position\n\nSo the secret word:\n- contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their original)\n- does NOT contain O or S\n- has two more letters (since it\'s 5 letters total)\n\nI need a new word that:\n- uses A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively)\n- avoids O and S\n- introduces two new letters that are common but not yet ruled out\n\nGood candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me try ""TREAD"":\n- T: new letter\n- R: already known to be in word\n- E: already known to be in word\n- A: already known to be in word\n- D: new letter\n\nCheck positions:\n- R was in position 2 (original AROSE) - in TREAD it\'s position 2 again → this would contradict the feedback that R is in the wrong position.

From the latest feedback on PERAL:

P(x) → P is not in the word  
E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 2 (confirmed)  
R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 3 (locked)  
A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 4 (locked)  
L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 5 (locked)  

So the word structure is now fully determined:

_ E R A L

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, C, T, P.  
We need a single consonant for the first position that hasn’t been excluded and forms a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ERAL”.

Common first letters for “ERAL” endings:  
- B → BERAL? (not a valid word)  
- D → DERAL? (not valid)  
- F → FERAL (valid word)  
- G → GERAL? (not valid)  
- H → HERAL (not valid)  
- M → MERAL? (not valid)  
- N → NERAL? (not valid)  
- V → VERAL? (not valid)  
- W → WERAL? (not valid)  
- Y → YERAL? (not valid)  

The only valid word is “FERAL”.

Let’s verify:  
F is not yet ruled out, and “FERAL” is a recognized English word.
