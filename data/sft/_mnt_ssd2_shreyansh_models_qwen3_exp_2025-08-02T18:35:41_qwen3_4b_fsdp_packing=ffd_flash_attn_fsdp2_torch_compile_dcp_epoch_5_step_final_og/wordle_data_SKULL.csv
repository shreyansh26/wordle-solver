For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U (good vowel coverage)
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E (good mix of vowels and consonants)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it covers:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _
and the word contains an L somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains an L in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, D, etc.

Possible words:
- S P I L L → but has two L’s and we don’t know if L repeats.
- S C O L L → same issue with double L.
- S H I L L → same.
- S P L O R → has P, L, O, R (good letters).
- S P L O R → but R is in position 5, which is allowed since L could be in 3 or 4.

Actually, let’s pick a word with L in position 3 or 4 to test its placement. A good choice is ""SPILL"" but we don’t know if L repeats. Instead, let’s try ""SPOIL"" – it has L in position 4 and introduces O and I.

""SPOIL"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- L is in position 4 (possible based on feedback).
- Contains O and I (new letters).
- Avoids A, T, E.

Another good option is ""SPOOR"" but double O might not be optimal. ""SPOIL"" seems better.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U (good vowel coverage)
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E (good mix of vowels and consonants)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it covers:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

3. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, D, etc.

- S H I L L → same.
- S P L O R → has P, L, O, R (good letters).

Actually, let’s pick a word with L in position 3 or 4 to test its placement. A good choice is ""SPILL"" but we don’t know if L repeats. Instead, let’s try ""SPOIL"" – it has L in position 4 and introduces O and I.

""SPOIL"" fits:

Another good option is ""SPOOR"" but double O might not be optimal. ""SPOIL"" seems better.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(x) L(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S.
   - L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SPOIL → S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(x) L(✓)
   - Word starts with S.
   - L is in position 5 (✓), so the pattern is now S _ _ _ L.
   - P, O, I are not in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, I.

So far the pattern is:
S _ _ _ L

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out)

We want common letters to maximize information. Let’s try a word with common consonants and the remaining vowel U.

Possible candidates:
- SCUBA – but A is out.
- SCRUB – B is allowed, U is allowed.
- SNUGG – G is allowed, but double G might be less informative.
- SCRUL – not a valid word.
- SCRUB – valid word, uses C, R, U, B.

Let’s go with SCRUB:
- S _ _ _ L pattern.
- C, R, U, B are all new letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

So the next guess is SCRUB.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U (good vowel coverage)
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E (good mix of vowels and consonants)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it covers:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _
and the word contains an L somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains an L in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, D, etc.

Possible words:
- S P I L L → but has two L’s and we don’t know if L repeats.
- S C O L L → same issue with double L.
- S H I L L → same.
- S P L O R → has P, L, O, R (good letters).
- S P L O R → but R is in position 5, which is allowed since L could be in 3 or 4.

Actually, let’s pick a word with L in position 3 or 4 to test its placement. A good choice is ""SPILL"" but we don’t know if L repeats. Instead, let’s try ""SPOIL"" – it has L in position 4 and introduces O and I.

""SPOIL"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- L is in position 4 (possible based on feedback).
- Contains O and I (new letters).
- Avoids A, T, E.

Another good option is ""SPOOR"" but double O might not be optimal. ""SPOIL"" seems better.

Final choice: S P O I L → ""SPOIL"".

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - A, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SPOIL → S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(x) L(✓)
   - Word starts with S.
   - L is in position 5 (✓), so the pattern is now S _ _ _ L.
   - P, O, I are not in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, I.

So far the pattern is:
S _ _ _ L

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out)

Possible candidates:
- SCUBA – but A is out.
- SCRUB – B is allowed, U is allowed.
- SNUGG – G is allowed, but double G might be less informative.
- SCRUL – not a valid word.
- SCRUB – valid word, uses C, R, U, B.

Let’s go with SCRUB:

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

1. Pattern: S _ _ _ L (positions 1 and 5 are fixed as S and L).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, T, E, P, O, I, C, R, B, Y
3. From SCRUB we learned:
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.
4. From SULKY we learned:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3 (it’s already known to be in position 5, so this is consistent).
   - K is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word is S _ _ _ L, contains U, contains K, and does NOT contain any of the banned letters.

The remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out) are:
Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Z
Vowels: U (already known to be present)

We must place U and K in positions 2, 3, or 4, with the following constraints:
- U cannot be in position 2 (from SULKY feedback) or position 4 (from SCRUB feedback), so U must be in position 3.
- K cannot be in position 4 (from SULKY feedback), so K must be in position 2 or 4. But position 4 is now excluded, so K must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is:
S K U _ L

The only missing letter is position 4, and it must be one of the remaining allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, V, W, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit S K U _ L:
- SKULD – a valid word (archaic past tense of “skul”, but acceptable in word lists).
- SKUNK – uses N, which is allowed.
- SKULK – uses K again, but we already have K in position 2 and 4 is excluded for K.

SKUNK is the most common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Let’s check:
- S(✓) K(-) U(-) N(-) L(✓) → but we already know K is in the word and must be placed correctly.

Actually, we need to ensure K is in position 2 (since it can’t be in 4) and U in position 3. So the word must be S K U _ L.

Valid words:
- SKULD (but less common)
- SKUNK (valid, uses N)

SKUNK is the best choice.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U (good vowel coverage)
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E (good mix of vowels and consonants)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it covers:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _
and the word contains an L somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains an L in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, D, etc.

Possible words:
- S P I L L → but has two L’s and we don’t know if L repeats.
- S C O L L → same issue with double L.
- S H I L L → same.
- S P L O R → has P, L, O, R (good letters).
- S P L O R → but R is in position 5, which is allowed since L could be in 3 or 4.

Actually, let’s pick a word with L in position 3 or 4 to test its placement. A good choice is ""SPILL"" but we don’t know if L repeats. Instead, let’s try ""SPOIL"" – it has L in position 4 and introduces O and I.

""SPOIL"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- L is in position 4 (possible based on feedback).
- Contains O and I (new letters).
- Avoids A, T, E.

Another good option is ""SPOOR"" but double O might not be optimal. ""SPOIL"" seems better.

Final choice: S P O I L → ""SPOIL"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(x) L(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S.
   - L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. SPOIL → S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(x) L(✓)
   - Word starts with S.
   - L is in position 5 (✓), so the pattern is now S _ _ _ L.
   - P, O, I are not in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, I.

So far the pattern is:
S _ _ _ L

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, Z
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out)

We want common letters to maximize information. Let’s try a word with common consonants and the remaining vowel U.

Possible candidates:
- SCUBA – but A is out.
- SCRUB – B is allowed, U is allowed.
- SNUGG – G is allowed, but double G might be less informative.
- SCRUL – not a valid word.
- SCRUB – valid word, uses C, R, U, B.

Let’s go with SCRUB:
- S _ _ _ L pattern.
- C, R, U, B are all new letters.
- Valid 5-letter word.

So the next guess is SCRUB.

2. Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, I, C, R, B.
3. From SCRUB feedback:
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.
   - So U must be in position 2 or 3.
4. Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
   Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, Z
   Vowels: U (already known to be present)

We need to place U in position 2 or 3 and fill the remaining slot with one of the allowed consonants.

Let’s try placing U in position 2:
S U _ _ L

We need a consonant for position 3 and another for position 4, from the allowed list. Common consonants left: D, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y.

Good candidate words:
- SOUND – but O is out.
- SULKS – K is allowed, S is already used in position 1, but S is already fixed.
- SULKY – Y is allowed.
- SUNGL – not a valid word.
- SUGAR – A is out.
- SULKY – valid word, uses K and Y.

Another option is to place U in position 3:
S _ U _ L

Possible words:
- SNULL – N is allowed, but double L is possible (though we already have L in position 5).
- SNUDL – not a valid word.
- SNUGL – not a valid word.
- SNUPL – P is out.
- SNUML – not a valid word.

SULKY seems better as it’s valid and uses allowed letters.

Let’s go with SULKY.

The remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out) are:
Consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Z

We must place U and K in positions 2, 3, or 4, with the following constraints:
- U cannot be in position 2 (from SULKY feedback) or position 4 (from SCRUB feedback), so U must be in position 3.
- K cannot be in position 4 (from SULKY feedback), so K must be in position 2 or 4. But position 4 is now excluded, so K must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is:
S K U _ L

The only missing letter is position 4, and it must be one of the remaining allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, V, W, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit S K U _ L:

But position 4 is now excluded, so K must be in position 2.\n\nTherefore the pattern is:\nS K U _ L\n\nThe only missing letter is position 4, and it must be one of the remaining allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, V, W, Z.\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words that fit S K U _ L:\n- SKULD – a valid word (archaic past tense of “skul”, but acceptable in word lists).\n- SKUNK – uses N, which is allowed.\n- SKULK – uses K again, but we already have K in position 2 and 4 is excluded for K.\n\nSKUNK is the most common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.\n\nLet’s check:\n- S(✓) K(-) U(-) N(-) L(✓) → but we already know K is in the word and must be placed correctly.\n\nActually, we need to ensure K is in position 2 (since it can’t be in 4) and U in position 3.

Let’s distill the new information from Guess 5 (SKUNK):

- S(✓)  → already fixed in position 1  
- K(✓)  → K is in position 2 (correct placement)  
- U(✓)  → U is in position 3 (correct placement)  
- N(x)  → N is NOT in the word  
- K(-)  → K is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied since we know K is only in position 2)

So the pattern is now fully determined:

S K U _ L

The only missing letter is the 4th position.  
Letters already ruled out (from all previous guesses):  
A, T, E, P, O, I, C, R, B, Y, N

Remaining consonants that are still allowed for position 4:  
D, F, G, H, M, V, W, Z

Scanning common 5-letter English words that fit S K U _ L:

- SKULD (archaic, unlikely)  
- SKUNK (already tried)  
- SKULF (not a word)  
- SKULG (not a word)  
- SKULD (again)  
- SKULM (not a word)

The only valid, common word left is SKULD, but it’s archaic.  
However, SKULD is recognized in many Scrabble dictionaries and is a valid English word (past tense of “skul”).

Therefore, the only plausible remaining word is SKULD.
