Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O.
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Avoids A, R, O entirely.
4. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is “stein” (S, T, E, I, N), but it’s 5 letters and uses S and E in new positions. Let me check:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) – allowed.
- T, I, N are new letters.

Another option is “spend” (S, P, E, N, D):
- S in position 1 – allowed.
- E in position 3 – allowed.
- P, N, D are new letters.

Between “stein” and “spend”, I’ll go with “stein” because it uses I (a very common vowel) and N (common consonant), giving good coverage.

But wait – “stein” is sometimes considered a variant spelling, and we want to ensure it’s a valid 5-letter English word. “Spent” is definitely valid, and it uses P, N, T – all common.

I’ll choose “spent” as it’s more universally recognized.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, P, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions:
   - S is in position 1.
   - E is in position 3.
3. Letters whose status is still unknown: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern so far is: S _ E _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has E in the third spot.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, P, N, T).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible letters left for positions 2 and 4-5: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s brainstorm some words that fit S _ E _ _:
- S C E N T – but T is eliminated.
- S H E L F – H, L, F are allowed.
- S H E L F is a valid word and uses only allowed letters.

Another candidate: S P E C K – but P is eliminated.
Another: S L E D S – but D and S are allowed, but S is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat.
Another: S W E E T – T is eliminated.
Another: S C E N E – N is eliminated.
Another: S H E E K – K is allowed, but E repeats which might not be ideal.
Another: S L E E P – P is eliminated.
Another: S C E N E – N is eliminated.

The best candidate seems to be S H E L F.

Let me double-check:
- S (position 1) – ✓ from feedback.
- H (position 2) – new letter, allowed.
- E (position 3) – ✓ from feedback.
- L (position 4) – new letter, allowed.
- F (position 5) – new letter, allowed.

No eliminated letters are used, and it fits the pattern S _ E _ _.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. Pattern: S _ E L _
2. Eliminated letters: A, R, O, P, N, T, H, F
3. Still-allowed letters for remaining blanks: B, C, D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 3
- Has L in position 4
- Uses none of the eliminated letters
- Uses only the allowed letters

Possible endings (position 5) from allowed letters: B, C, D, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking at common English words fitting S _ E L _ :

- S C E L L – but double L is unlikely and L is already used in position 4.
- S C E L S – S repeats in position 1 and 5, which is possible but less common.
- S C E L L is invalid (double L).
- S C E L S is valid but has S twice.
- S M E L T – T is eliminated.
- S W E L L – W is allowed, double L is allowed, but L is already in position 4.
- S W E L L is valid and uses W (allowed) and L (already known correct).

Let’s check SWELL:
- S (✓) – correct position
- W (new, allowed)
- E (✓) – correct position
- L (✓) – correct position
- L (new, allowed, and double L is acceptable)

No eliminated letters are used, and it fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, SWELL is the logical next guess.
