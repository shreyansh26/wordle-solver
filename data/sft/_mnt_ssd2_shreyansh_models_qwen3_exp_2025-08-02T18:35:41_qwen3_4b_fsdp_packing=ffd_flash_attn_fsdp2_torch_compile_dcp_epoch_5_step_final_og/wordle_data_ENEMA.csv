### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good balance of vowels and consonants that are fairly common in English words.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.

""LEANT"" seems valid and meets all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good balance of vowels and consonants that are fairly common in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): The letter E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and E somewhere other than positions 1 and 5.
- Avoids R, O, S entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try ""TALON"" but it has O which is excluded. How about ""TALKE""? Not a valid word. ""LEANT""? It has N and T, but A is in position 2 which is allowed, and E is in position 4 which is allowed. Also avoids R, O, S. 

""LEANT"" seems valid and meets all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but positions unknown):
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3)
- E (cannot be in positions 2, 5)
- N (cannot be in position 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- R, O, S, L, T

So the secret word must contain A, E, N exactly once each, and two other letters that are not among R, O, S, L, T.

Common remaining consonants we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, E, N
- A not in position 1 or 3
- E not in position 2 or 5
- N not in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _

Let’s try to place A, E, N in valid spots and fill the rest with new letters.

Option: A in position 2 or 4, E in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 5), N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One candidate: “CANED”
- C: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- D: new letter
But D is allowed and not excluded yet.

Another candidate: “CANEY”
- C, A, N, E, Y
- A in 2, E in 4, N in 3 – all allowed positions
- Y is a valid letter not excluded.

Let’s go with CANED first because it uses two new consonants (C and D) and fits the constraints.

Only the third letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, L, T, C, D, I  
Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Wait, let’s double-check: is there any valid word E N _ M A?

Actually, the only common English word that fits E N _ M A is:
E N V E R M A? No, that’s 6 letters.
E N V E Y? No, that’s 5 letters but ends with Y.

Wait, let me think differently – maybe I missed a letter.  
Looking at the pattern E N _ M A, the missing letter must be such that the whole word is valid.

After checking, the only valid word that fits is:
E N V E R M A – no, that’s 7 letters.

Wait, let me re-examine: the pattern is E N _ M A, so the third letter must make a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at the dictionary, the only valid word that fits is:
E N V E R M A – no.

Actually, the correct word is:
E N V E R M A – no, that’s 7 letters.

Wait, let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with EN and ending with MA.

Valid words:
- ENEMA – but this has A in position 5, which we already know is correct, and the third letter is E, but we already have E in position 1. However, ENEMA is E N E M A, which fits E N _ M A with the third letter E. But we already have E in position 1 and 5, and in Wordle, letters can repeat unless ruled out. However, in our feedback, we have only one E (position 1), and the word ENIMA had E in position 1 correct, so it’s possible the word has another E.

But let me check: is ENEMA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we need to verify if the third letter E is allowed. Since we haven’t ruled out E, and the word ENEMA fits all constraints:
- E in position 1 correct.
- N in position 2 correct.
- _ in position 3: E.
- M in position 4 correct.
- A in position 5 correct.

Therefore, the word must be ENEMA.

But let me double-check: is there any other possible word?  
Looking at the pattern E N _ M A, the only valid English word is ENEMA.

Hence, the correct word is ENEMA.

Based on the feedback from Guess 4, we now know the exact positions of E, N, M, and A, leaving only the third letter to determine. The pattern is E N _ M A. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is:
