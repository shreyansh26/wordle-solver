### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Since A is in the word but not in the 3rd position, we need a new word that contains A but not in the 3rd spot. Also, we must avoid S, L, T, E entirely.

From the two guesses we have:

   – A is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent).

So far we know:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)

   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent).  
   – C, N, K are ruled out.

3. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – M is not in the word.  
   – The final A in position 5 is marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but already placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot also be A (but we already have A in position 1, so this just reconfirms A is only once).

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: NOT O and NOT any of S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M  
- Position 4: ?  
- Position 5: ?  

Letters already used and ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M.  
Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O.  
Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From AROMA feedback, O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
Therefore O must be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s list possible words that fit the pattern A R _ _ _ with O in position 4 or 5:

- A R _ O _  
  – Examples: ARGON (G, N already ruled out), ARBOR (B twice), ARDOR (D, O already in 4), ARROW (W twice).  
  – ARROW uses W twice, but W is allowed and not ruled out.

- A R _ _ O  
  – Examples: ARIPO (I, P), ARIDO (I, D), ARGYO (G, Y), etc.  
  – ARIPO uses I, P.

Between these, ARROW seems like a good test because:
- It keeps A and R fixed.  
- It places O in position 4 (which was ruled out for position 3).  
- It introduces W, which is new and common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since A is in the word but not in the 3rd position, we need a new word that contains A but not in the 3rd spot. Also, we must avoid S, L, T, E entirely.

We should look for common consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are R, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc. Let’s try a word with A in a different position and include some new common letters.

A common word that fits is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.

Let’s use CRANK.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – R is in the word AND in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent).  
   – C, N, K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, N, K.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2.
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No S, L, T, E, C, N, K.

Let’s look for possibilities:
- If A is in position 1: A R _ _ _  
  – Possible: ARISE (but has S, E), ARBOR (but has B twice), ARDOR (D, O), AROMA (O, M).  
  – AROMA uses new letters A, R, O, M.

- If A is in position 4: _ R _ A _  
  – Possible: BRAVA (B, V), GRAVA (G), DRAVA (D), etc.  
  – GRAVA uses G and V, both new.

- If A is in position 5: _ R _ _ A  
  – Possible: BRUJA (J), PRADA (P, D), etc.  
  – PRADA uses P, D.

Among these, AROMA seems like a good third guess because it introduces new common letters (O, M) while satisfying all constraints.

Let’s try AROMA.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – R is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent).  
   – C, N, K are ruled out.

3. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   – A is confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – M is not in the word.  
   – The final A in position 5 is marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but already placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot also be A (but we already have A in position 1, so this just reconfirms A is only once).

4. ARROW → A(✓) R(✓) R(-) O(✓) W(x)  
   – A is confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.  
   – O is confirmed in position 4.  
   – R in position 3 is marked “-”, meaning R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R.  
   – W is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: NOT R, NOT any of S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M, W  
- Position 4: O  
- Position 5: ?

Letters already used and ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M, W.  
Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O.  
Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since position 3 must be a new letter (not R or any ruled-out letters), and position 5 must also be a new letter, let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit A R _ O _.

Possible options:
- A R B O _ → ARBOR (B twice, but B is allowed and not ruled out)  
- A R D O _ → ARDOR (D, but R already in position 2)  
- A R G O _ → ARGON (G, N ruled out)  
- A R I O _ → ARIO_ (ARIDO, ARIOV, but not common)  
- A R P O _ → ARPO_ (not a word)  
- A R V O _ → ARVO_ (not a word)  
- A R F O _ → ARFO_ (not a word)  

The only common word left is ARBOR, which uses B in position 3 and R again in position 5. However, we already know R is only in position 2 (from CRANK feedback), so ARBOR would have R in position 5, which contradicts that R is only in position 2.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback for CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but does not say anything about R appearing elsewhere. The “-” in CRANK for the final A means A is in the word but already placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot be A. The “-” for R in ARROW (position 3) means R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R. However, R could still appear in position 5.

But looking at common words, ARBOR seems the only plausible one. Let’s check: ARBOR – positions: A(1), R(2), B(3), O(4), R(5). This would have R in both positions 2 and 5, but we have no information preventing that. However, the feedback from CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but doesn’t rule out another R. 

But let me think if there’s a word without another R. The next possibility is ARDOR, but it has R in position 5 again. 

Actually, let me list all possible letters for position 3 and 5 from remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- A R B O R – ARBOR (B, R)  
- A R D O R – ARDOR (D, R)  
- A R G O _ – ARGON (N ruled out)  
- A R I O _ – ARIDO (I, D) – but is ARIDO a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of arid, but not common.  
- A R P O _ – not a word  
- A R V O _ – not a word  

The most common word fitting the pattern is ARBOR, even though it has R in position 5. Since we have no information preventing a second R, and ARBOR is a valid word, let’s try it.

But wait, let me double-check: the feedback from CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but does not indicate how many times R appears. The feedback from ARROW showed R in position 3 is “-”, meaning R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R. This does not prevent R from appearing again in position 5.

Thus, the most plausible word is ARBOR.

However, let me check if there’s a word without another R. The only other possibility is ARIDO, but it’s less common. Given the constraints, ARBOR seems the best next guess.

But let me re-examine the feedback: the feedback for ARROW showed O in position 4 is correct (✓), so position 4 must be O. The pattern is A R _ O _.

Looking at common words:
- ARBOR – A R B O R  
- ARDOR – A R D O R  
- ARGON – A R G O N (N ruled out)  
- ARROW – already tried  
- ARIDO – A R I D O (but position 4 must be O, so A R I O _ – ARIDO is A R I D O, which would have O in position 5, but we need O in position 4, so this doesn’t fit. My mistake here.)

Actually, the pattern is A R _ O _, so position 4 must be O. Let me list valid words:

- A R B O _ – ARBOR (R in position 5)  
- A R D O _ – ARDOR (R in position 5)  
- A R G O _ – ARGON (N ruled out)  
- A R I O _ – ARIDO (I, D) – but ARIDO is A R I D O, which has O in position 5, not 4.  
- A R P O _ – not a word  
- A R V O _ – not a word  

The only valid words fitting A R _ O _ are ARBOR and ARDOR, both of which have R in position 5. Since we have no information preventing a second R, and these are the only possibilities, let’s try ARBOR.

But wait, let me check if there’s another word. The letter pool for positions 3 and 5 is B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. 

Possible combinations:
- A R B O D – not a word  
- A R B O F – not a word  
- A R B O G – not a word  
- A R B O H – not a word  
- A R B O I – not a word  
- A R B O J – not a word  
- A R B O P – not a word  
- A R B O Q – not a word  
- A R B O U – not a word  
- A R B O V – not a word  
- A R B O X – not a word  
- A R B O Y – not a word  
- A R B O Z – not a word  

Similarly for other letters in position 3. It seems the only common words are ARBOR and ARDOR. Between these, ARBOR is more common. Let’s try ARBOR.

But let me check the feedback again: the feedback for ARROW showed R in position 3 is “-”, meaning R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R. This does not prevent R from being in position 5. Therefore, ARBOR is valid.

Thus, the next guess is ARBOR.

However, let me re-examine the feedback for CRANK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x). This shows R is in position 2 and is correct, but does not say anything about R appearing elsewhere. The feedback for ARROW shows R in position 3 is “-”, meaning R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R. This does not prevent R from appearing in position 5. 

Therefore, the word could be ARBOR (A R B O R) or ARDOR (A R D O R). Between these, ARBOR is more common. Let’s choose ARBOR.

But wait, let me check if there’s a word without another R. The only other possibility is A R I O _ – but no common word fits. 

Thus, the best next guess is ARBOR.

But let me check if ARBOR is valid: yes, it’s a common word meaning a group of trees or a place where trees grow.

However, let me think if there’s a word with different letters. The pattern is A R _ O _, and remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- A R B O R – ARBOR  
- A R D O R – ARDOR  
- A R F O _ – not a word  
- A R G O _ – ARGON (N ruled out)  
- A R H O _ – not a word  
- A R I O _ – not a word  
- A R J O _ – not a word  
- A R P O _ – not a word  
- A R Q O _ – not a word  
- A R U O _ – not a word  
- A R V O _ – not a word  
- A R X O _ – not a word  
- A R Y O _ – not a word  
- A R Z O _ – not a word  

Thus, the only possible words are ARBOR and ARDOR. Between these, ARBOR is more common. Let’s choose ARBOR.

But let me check the feedback again: the feedback for ARROW showed O in position 4 is correct (✓), so position 4 must be O. The pattern is A R _ O _. The only common words are ARBOR and ARDOR. 

Therefore, the next guess is ARBOR.
</think>

From all feedback:
- A is fixed in position 1.
- R is fixed in position 2.
- O is fixed in position 4.
- Position 3 and 5 must be new letters not yet ruled out (S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M, W are out).

The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern A R _ O _ is ARBOR (A R B O R). Even though R appears twice, the feedback does not prohibit a second R in position 5.

<guess>ARBOR</guess>",ARBOR,"Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – R is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (consistent).  
   – C, N, K are ruled out.

3. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)  
   – A is confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – M is not in the word.  
   – The final A in position 5 is marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but already placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot also be A (but we already have A in position 1, so this just reconfirms A is only once).

4. ARROW → A(✓) R(✓) R(-) O(✓) W(x)  
   – A is confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.  
   – O is confirmed in position 4.  
   – R in position 3 is marked “-”, meaning R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R.  
   – W is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: A  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: NOT R, NOT any of S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M, W  
- Position 4: O  
- Position 5: ?

Letters already used and ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, N, K, M, W.  
Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O.  
Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since position 3 must be a new letter (not R or any ruled-out letters), and position 5 must also be a new letter, let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit A R _ O _.

Possible options:
- A R B O _ → ARBOR (B twice, but B is allowed and not ruled out)  
- A R D O _ → ARDOR (D, but R already in position 2)  
- A R G O _ → ARGON (G, N ruled out)  
- A R I O _ → ARIO_ (ARIDO, ARIOV, but not common)  
- A R P O _ → ARPO_ (not a word)  
- A R V O _ → ARVO_ (not a word)  
- A R F O _ → ARFO_ (not a word)  

The only common word left is ARBOR, which uses B in position 3 and R again in position 5. However, we already know R is only in position 2 (from CRANK feedback), so ARBOR would have R in position 5, which contradicts that R is only in position 2.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback for CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but does not say anything about R appearing elsewhere. The “-” in CRANK for the final A means A is in the word but already placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot be A. The “-” for R in ARROW (position 3) means R is in the word but already placed in position 2, so position 3 cannot be R. However, R could still appear in position 5.

But looking at common words, ARBOR seems the only plausible one. Let’s check: ARBOR – positions: A(1), R(2), B(3), O(4), R(5). This would have R in both positions 2 and 5, but we have no information preventing that. However, the feedback from CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but doesn’t rule out another R. 

But let me think if there’s a word without another R. The next possibility is ARDOR, but it has R in position 5 again.

Possible words:

- A R D O R – ARDOR (D, R)  
- A R G O _ – ARGON (N ruled out)  
- A R I O _ – ARIDO (I, D) – but is ARIDO a valid word? It’s a variant spelling of arid, but not common.  
- A R P O _ – not a word  
- A R V O _ – not a word  

The most common word fitting the pattern is ARBOR, even though it has R in position 5. Since we have no information preventing a second R, and ARBOR is a valid word, let’s try it.

But wait, let me double-check: the feedback from CRANK showed R in position 2 is correct, but does not indicate how many times R appears.

- ARGON – A R G O N (N ruled out)  
- ARROW – already tried  
- ARIDO – A R I D O (but position 4 must be O, so A R I O _ – ARIDO is A R I D O, which would have O in position 5, but we need O in position 4, so this doesn’t fit. My mistake here.)
