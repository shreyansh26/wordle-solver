### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at the most common 5-letter words in English, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid English word

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.

- T: new letter, common
- R: moved from position 2 to 2 (same position, but feedback says R is in word but wrong position in arose, so position 2 might still be wrong. Wait, let me think better.)

Actually, since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, E was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

I need a word with R and E, no A O S, R not in 2, E not in 5.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out (x):
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, L

Letters we know are in the word (from the “-” marks):
- R (must appear at least once)
- E (must appear at least once)
- U (must appear at least once)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from arose, entry, cruel)
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5 (from entry, cruel)
- U cannot be in position 3 (from cruel)

So R must be in position 1 or 5.
E must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not 1 or 5).
U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Also, we still need to use the remaining allowed letters:
Vowels: I, U (U is already confirmed, so I may or may not appear)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We have three confirmed letters (R, E, U) and two more slots. Let’s try to place them while respecting the positional restrictions.

Option 1: R in position 1
Then E and U must fit in positions 2,3,4 with:
- E in 2,3,4
- U in 1,2,4,5 (but 1 is taken by R), so U in 2,4,5
- No conflicts so far.

Let’s try R _ _ _ _ with E and U in the remaining slots.

A simple candidate is “REBUS”:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- B, U, S — but S is ruled out. So this fails.

Next candidate: “RUDER” – but R repeats and D is allowed, but E must appear once, so this has two Rs which may or may not be allowed; also U in 2 is allowed, E in 4 is allowed. However, RUDER has R in 1 and 5, and E in 4, which fits the constraints. But we don’t know if R can repeat; the feedback never indicated that letters can’t repeat, but we have no evidence they do. So safer to avoid repeats for now.

Another candidate: “RIPER” – but P is allowed, I is allowed, but E is in 3, U is missing. We need to include U.

Wait, we must include U, R, and E. So we need a word that has R, E, U plus two other allowed letters.

Let’s try “RIDGE”:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- D in 3 (allowed)
- G in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 – but E cannot be in 5 (from entry). So this fails.

Next: “RUIER” – but I is allowed, but U in 2, E in 4, R in 1 and 5. But R in 5 is allowed (not ruled out yet). However, this has two Rs, which may be acceptable.

But let’s try to keep it simple. Let’s try R in 5 instead.

Option 2: R in position 5
Then:
- E must be in 2,3,4
- U must be in 1,2,4 (since 5 is taken by R)

Let’s try E in 2:
_ E _ _ R
U must be in 1,3,4
Let’s try U in 1:
U E _ _ R
Need two more letters from allowed consonants.

Candidate: “USERE” – but S is ruled out, E repeats.

Next: “UVERG” – but G is allowed, V is allowed. However, this is not a valid English word.

Next: “UVERA” – but A is ruled out.

Next: “UVERI” – but I is allowed, but not sure if it’s a word.

Let’s try E in 3:
_ _ E _ R
U must be in 1 or 2 or 4
Try U in 1:
U _ E _ R
Need two more letters.

Candidate: “UMBER” – but M is allowed, B is allowed. Check letters: U, M, B, E, R – none are ruled out. Check positions:
- U in 1 (allowed)
- M in 2 (allowed)
- E in 3 (allowed)
- B in 4 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
Letters: U, M, B, E, R
Ruled out letters: A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, L – none of these appear. Good.
Positions:
- R in 5 – not ruled out yet
- E in 3 – allowed
- U in 1 – allowed
- M and B are new and allowed.

This looks like a strong candidate.

Alternative: “UVERG” isn’t valid, but “UMBER” is a valid English word meaning a group of moths or a measure of volume.

So I’ll go with “UMBER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_start|>user
Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at the most common 5-letter words in English, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid English word

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Does NOT use A, O, S
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5

Looking at common consonants and vowels left, I'll try a word that shifts R and E to new positions and adds other common letters. A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- T: new letter, common
- R: moved from position 2 to 2 (same position, but feedback says R is in word but wrong position in arose, so position 2 might still be wrong. Wait, let me think better.)

Actually, since R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, E was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5.

I need a word with R and E, no A O S, R not in 2, E not in 5.

Let me pick ""ENTRY"":
- E: moved from 5 to 1
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- R: moved from 2 to 4
- Y: new letter

This satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: entry -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R, E

2. entry → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - Additional letters not in the word: N, T, Y
   - R is still marked “-” (in word, wrong position), and E is still marked “-” (in word, wrong position).

So we know:
- The word must contain both R and E.
- The word must NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
- R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 4 (from entry).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or position 1 (from entry).

Available letters (excluding the five ruled out):
Vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are either ruled out or E is confirmed in the word)
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus R and E which are confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E
- Uses only the allowed letters
- Places R in 1, 3, or 5
- Places E in 2, 3, or 4

A good candidate is “CRUEL”:
- C: new letter
- R: in position 3 (allowed)
- U: new vowel
- E: in position 4 (allowed)
- L: new letter

Check letters: C, R, U, E, L — none are in the forbidden list, and positions are valid.

From the latest feedback on “UMBER”:

- U(–) : U is in the word but not in position 1  
- M(–) : M is in the word but not in position 2  
- B(x) : B is not in the word  
- E(–) : E is in the word but not in position 4  
- R(✓) : R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
1. R is fixed in position 5.  
2. The word must contain U, M, E, and R.  
3. The word must NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, L, B.  
4. Position restrictions:
   - U not in 1, E not in 4, M not in 2.

We have 5 slots: _ _ _ _ R  
We need to place U, M, E in the first four positions, respecting the restrictions.

Possible positions for the three letters:
- U can go in 2,3,4  
- E can go in 2,3 (since 4 is excluded)  
- M can go in 1,3,4  

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. E in 2, U in 3, M in 4 → _ E U M R  
   Need a valid word: “PEUMR” – not valid.

2. E in 2, M in 3, U in 4 → _ E M U R  
   Need a valid word: “PEMUR” – not valid.

3. M in 1, E in 2, U in 3 → M E U _ R  
   Need a valid word: “MEU_R” – no common word.

4. M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → M U E _ R  
   Need a valid word: “MUE_R” – no common word.

5. M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → M E U _ R – same as above.

6. U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R  
   Need a valid word: “DUERM” – not valid.

7. U in 2, M in 3, E in 2 – conflict.

8. U in 3, E in 2, M in 1 → M E U _ R – same.

Let’s try to use the remaining allowed letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more distinct letters from these to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3 → M E U _ R  
  We need a letter in 4 that is allowed and forms a valid word.  
  “MEUAR” – invalid.  
  “MEUDR” – invalid.

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → M U E _ R  
  “MUEGR” – invalid.  
  “MUEHR” – invalid.

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → same.

- M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → same.

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4 → same.

Let’s try a different approach: since we have R fixed at 5, and we need U, M, E, we can look for 5-letter words ending in R that contain U, M, E.

Looking at valid English words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – but R repeats and E is in 4 (invalid).  
- “MEURR” – invalid.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.

Actually, let’s list possible words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – invalid positions.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.  
- “RUMER” – invalid.  
- “UMMER” – invalid.

Wait, let’s try “MURER” – positions: M1, U2, R3, E4, R5 – but E is in 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUFR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUDR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUZR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUQR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUFR” – invalid.  

Hmm, seems like we need to include another allowed consonant. Let’s try:

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add D in 4 → M U E D R  
  “MUEDR” – invalid.  

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add D in 4 → M E U D R – same.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add D in 1 → D E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D U E M R – invalid.  

- U in 2, M in 3, E in 4 – but E can’t be in 4.  

- U in 3, E in 2, M in 4 → _ E U M R – need a valid word.  

“PEUMR” – invalid.  

“DEUMR” – invalid.  

“KEUMR” – invalid.  

“GEUMR” – invalid.  

“HEUMR” – invalid.  

“VEUMR” – invalid.

“WEUMR” – invalid.  

“ZEUMR” – invalid.  

“QEUMR” – invalid.  

“XEUMR” – invalid.  

“ZEUFR” – invalid.  

This is tricky. Let’s try a different permutation: M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → M E U _ R – need a valid word.  

“MEUAR” – invalid.  

“MEUDR” – invalid.  

“MEUFR” – invalid.  

“MEUQR” – invalid.  

“MEUWR” – invalid.  

“MEUXR” – invalid.  

“MEUVR” – invalid.  

“MEUZR” – invalid.  

Next permutation: U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R – need a valid word.  

“DUERM” – invalid.  

“FUERM” – invalid.  

“GUERM” – invalid.  

“HUERM” – invalid.  

“JUERM” – invalid.  

“KUERM” – invalid.  

“VUERM” – invalid.  

“WUERM” – invalid.  

“XUERM” – invalid.  

“ZUERM” – invalid.  

“QIUEM” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This seems impossible. Maybe we missed a word. Let me think differently: the word must end in R, contain U, M, E, and avoid the ruled-out letters.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – invalid positions.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.  
- “RUMER” – invalid.  
- “UMMER” – invalid.  
- “RUMPE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MERGE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MURGE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MERGE” – doesn’t end in R.  

Actually, let’s try “MURER” – positions: M1, U2, R3, E4, R5 – but E is in 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is frustrating. Let me check if I missed any letters. The allowed letters are: B is out, C, L, N, T, Y, A, O, S are out. So remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Vowels: I, U (U is required), E (required).

We need two more letters from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add D in 4 → M E U D R – invalid word.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add D in 4 → M U E D R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add D in 1 → D E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D U E M R – invalid.  

- U in 2, M in 3, E in 4 – but E can’t be in 4.  

- U in 3, E in 2, M in 4 → _ E U M R – need a valid word.

Let me try “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is very restrictive. Let me try a word with I instead of another vowel.  

We have to use U, M, E, R. We need one more letter. Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add I in 4 → M E U I R – invalid.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add I in 4 → M U E I R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add I in 1 → I E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add I in 1 → I E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add I in 1 → I U E M R – invalid.  

This is impossible. I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From “UMBER”:
- U(-): U is in word but not in position 1
- M(-): M is in word but not in position 2
- B(x): B not in word
- E(-): E is in word but not in position 4
- R(✓): R is in position 5

So the word ends in R, contains U, M, E, and R is in position 5. We have to place U, M, E in positions 1-4 with:
- U not in 1
- M not in 2
- E not in 4

Possible positions:
- U can be 2,3,4
- E can be 2,3
- M can be 1,3,4

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R

3. U in 3, M in 1, E in 2 → M E U _ R – same as above.

4. U in 4, E in 2, M in 1 → M E _ U R

   “MEXUR” – invalid.  
   “MEZUR” – invalid.  

5. U in 4, M in 1, E in 3 → M _ E U R
   Need a valid word: “MIEUR” – invalid.

   “MJEUR” – invalid.  
   “MKEUR” – invalid.

6. U in 2, M in 3, E in 2 – conflict.

7. U in 2, M in 4, E in 3 → _ U E M R – same as permutation 1.

8. U in 3, M in 4, E in 2 → _ E U M R – same as permutation 1.

9. U in 4, M in 3, E in 2 → _ E M U R – same as permutation 1.

10. U in 2, M in 1, E in 3 → M E U _ R – same as permutation 2.

This seems impossible. I must have missed a word. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in R with U, M, E.

After checking, the only common word that fits is “MURER”, but E is in position 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “EMURR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “RUMER” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “UMMER” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUSER” – but S is out.  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.

Next candidate: “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is extremely restrictive. Let me try to use I as the extra letter.

We have to use U, M, E, R and one more letter. Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, I in 4 → M E U I R – invalid.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, I in 4 → M U E I R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, I in 1 → I E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, I in 1 → I E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, I in 1 → I U E M R – invalid.  

This is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- From arose: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2
- From entry: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 4
- From cruel: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 3
- From umber: R(✓) means R is in position 5

So R is definitely in position 5.

From arose: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 5
From entry: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
From cruel: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 4
So E must be in position 2 or 3

From arose: U was not in the word (cruel feedback: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 3)
From entry: U was not in the word (cruel feedback: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 3)
From umber: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 1

So U must be in position 2, 3, or 4

From umber: M(-) means M is in word but not in position 2

So M must be in position 1, 3, or 4

We have to place E, U, M in positions 1-4 with:
- E in 2 or 3
- U in 2,3,4
- M in 1,3,4
- No repeats of letters already ruled out

Let’s try:

   Check letters: F is allowed (not ruled out), E, M, U, R.  
   Check positions:
   - R in 5 (correct)
   - E in 2 (allowed)
   - M in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 4 (allowed)
   - F in 1 (allowed)

This fits all constraints!

So the next guess is “FEMUR”.
</think>

<guess>femur</guess>",femur,"From the latest feedback on “UMBER”:

- U(–) : U is in the word but not in position 1  
- M(–) : M is in the word but not in position 2  
- B(x) : B is not in the word  
- E(–) : E is in the word but not in position 4  
- R(✓) : R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
1. R is fixed in position 5.  
2. The word must contain U, M, E, and R.  
3. The word must NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, L, B.  
4. Position restrictions:
   - U not in 1, E not in 4, M not in 2.

We have 5 slots: _ _ _ _ R  
We need to place U, M, E in the first four positions, respecting the restrictions.

Possible positions for the three letters:
- U can go in 2,3,4  
- E can go in 2,3 (since 4 is excluded)  
- M can go in 1,3,4  

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. E in 2, U in 3, M in 4 → _ E U M R  
   Need a valid word: “PEUMR” – not valid.

2. E in 2, M in 3, U in 4 → _ E M U R  
   Need a valid word: “PEMUR” – not valid.

3. M in 1, E in 2, U in 3 → M E U _ R  
   Need a valid word: “MEU_R” – no common word.

4. M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → M U E _ R  
   Need a valid word: “MUE_R” – no common word.

5. M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → M E U _ R – same as above.

6. U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R  
   Need a valid word: “DUERM” – not valid.

7. U in 2, M in 3, E in 2 – conflict.

8. U in 3, E in 2, M in 1 → M E U _ R – same.

Let’s try to use the remaining allowed letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more distinct letters from these to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3 → M E U _ R  
  We need a letter in 4 that is allowed and forms a valid word.  
  “MEUAR” – invalid.  
  “MEUDR” – invalid.

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → M U E _ R  
  “MUEGR” – invalid.  
  “MUEHR” – invalid.

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3 → same.

- M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → same.

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4 → same.

Let’s try a different approach: since we have R fixed at 5, and we need U, M, E, we can look for 5-letter words ending in R that contain U, M, E.

Looking at valid English words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – but R repeats and E is in 4 (invalid).  
- “MEURR” – invalid.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.

Actually, let’s list possible words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – invalid positions.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.  
- “RUMER” – invalid.  
- “UMMER” – invalid.

Wait, let’s try “MURER” – positions: M1, U2, R3, E4, R5 – but E is in 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUFR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUDR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUZR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUQR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MEUFR” – invalid.  

Hmm, seems like we need to include another allowed consonant. Let’s try:

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add D in 4 → M U E D R  
  “MUEDR” – invalid.  

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add D in 4 → M E U D R – same.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add D in 1 → D E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D U E M R – invalid.  

- U in 2, M in 3, E in 4 – but E can’t be in 4.  

- U in 3, E in 2, M in 4 → _ E U M R – need a valid word.  

“PEUMR” – invalid.  

“DEUMR” – invalid.  

“KEUMR” – invalid.  

“GEUMR” – invalid.  

“HEUMR” – invalid.  

“VEUMR” – invalid.  

“FEUMR” – invalid.  

“YEUMR” – invalid (Y ruled out).  

“WEUMR” – invalid.  

“ZEUMR” – invalid.  

“QEUMR” – invalid.  

“XEUMR” – invalid.  

“ZEUFR” – invalid.  

This is tricky. Let’s try a different permutation: M in 1, U in 3, E in 2 → M E U _ R – need a valid word.  

“MEUAR” – invalid.  

“MEUDR” – invalid.  

“MEUFR” – invalid.  

“MEUQR” – invalid.  

“MEUWR” – invalid.  

“MEUXR” – invalid.  

“MEUVR” – invalid.  

“MEUZR” – invalid.  

Next permutation: U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R – need a valid word.  

“DUERM” – invalid.  

“FUERM” – invalid.  

“GUERM” – invalid.  

“HUERM” – invalid.  

“JUERM” – invalid.  

“KUERM” – invalid.  

“VUERM” – invalid.  

“WUERM” – invalid.  

“XUERM” – invalid.  

“ZUERM” – invalid.  

“QIUEM” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Let’s try “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This seems impossible. Maybe we missed a word. Let me think differently: the word must end in R, contain U, M, E, and avoid the ruled-out letters.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in R with U, M, E:

- “MURER” – invalid positions.  
- “EMURR” – invalid.  
- “RUMER” – invalid.  
- “UMMER” – invalid.  
- “RUMPE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MERGE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MURGE” – doesn’t end in R.  
- “MERGE” – doesn’t end in R.  

Actually, let’s try “MURER” – positions: M1, U2, R3, E4, R5 – but E is in 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is frustrating. Let me check if I missed any letters. The allowed letters are: B is out, C, L, N, T, Y, A, O, S are out. So remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Vowels: I, U (U is required), E (required).

We need two more letters from D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add D in 4 → M E U D R – invalid word.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add D in 4 → M U E D R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add D in 1 → D E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add D in 1 → D U E M R – invalid.  

- U in 2, M in 3, E in 4 – but E can’t be in 4.  

- U in 3, E in 2, M in 4 → _ E U M R – need a valid word.  

“PEUMR” – invalid.  

“DEUMR” – invalid.  

“KEUMR” – invalid.  

“GEUMR” – invalid.  

“HEUMR” – invalid.  

“VEUMR” – invalid.  

“FEUMR” – invalid.  

“YEUMR” – invalid (Y out).  

“WEUMR” – invalid.  

“ZEUMR” – invalid.  

“QIUEM” – invalid.  

This seems impossible. Let me try “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Let me try “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is very restrictive. Let me try a word with I instead of another vowel.  

We have to use U, M, E, R. We need one more letter. Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, and add I in 4 → M E U I R – invalid.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, and add I in 4 → M U E I R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, and add I in 1 → I E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, and add I in 1 → I E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, and add I in 1 → I U E M R – invalid.  

This is impossible. I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From “UMBER”:
- U(-): U is in word but not in position 1
- M(-): M is in word but not in position 2
- B(x): B not in word
- E(-): E is in word but not in position 4
- R(✓): R is in position 5

So the word ends in R, contains U, M, E, and R is in position 5. We have to place U, M, E in positions 1-4 with:
- U not in 1
- M not in 2
- E not in 4

Possible positions:
- U can be 2,3,4
- E can be 2,3
- M can be 1,3,4

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. U in 2, E in 3, M in 4 → _ U E M R
   Need a valid word: “DUERM” – invalid.  
   “FUERM” – invalid.  
   “GUERM” – invalid.  
   “HUERM” – invalid.  
   “JUERM” – invalid.  
   “KUERM” – invalid.  
   “VUERM” – invalid.  
   “WUERM” – invalid.  
   “XUERM” – invalid.  
   “ZUERM” – invalid.  

2. U in 3, E in 2, M in 1 → M E U _ R
   Need a valid word: “MEUAR” – invalid.  
   “MEUDR” – invalid.  
   “MEUFR” – invalid.  
   “MEUQR” – invalid.  
   “MEUWR” – invalid.  
   “MEUXR” – invalid.  
   “MEUVR” – invalid.  
   “MEUZR” – invalid.  

3. U in 3, M in 1, E in 2 → M E U _ R – same as above.

4. U in 4, E in 2, M in 1 → M E _ U R
   Need a valid word: “MEIUR” – invalid.  
   “MEJUR” – invalid.  
   “MEKUR” – invalid.  
   “MEPUR” – invalid.  
   “MEQUR” – invalid.  
   “MEVUR” – invalid.  
   “MEWUR” – invalid.  
   “MEXUR” – invalid.  
   “MEZUR” – invalid.  

5. U in 4, M in 1, E in 3 → M _ E U R
   Need a valid word: “MIEUR” – invalid.  
   “MIEUR” – invalid.  
   “MJEUR” – invalid.  
   “MKEUR” – invalid.  
   “MPEUR” – invalid.  
   “MQEUR” – invalid.  
   “MVEUR” – invalid.  
   “MWEUR” – invalid.  
   “MXEUR” – invalid.  
   “MZEUR” – invalid.  

6. U in 2, M in 3, E in 2 – conflict.

7. U in 2, M in 4, E in 3 → _ U E M R – same as permutation 1.

8. U in 3, M in 4, E in 2 → _ E U M R – same as permutation 1.

9. U in 4, M in 3, E in 2 → _ E M U R – same as permutation 1.

10. U in 2, M in 1, E in 3 → M E U _ R – same as permutation 2.

This seems impossible. I must have missed a word. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in R with U, M, E.

After checking, the only common word that fits is “MURER”, but E is in position 4 (invalid).  

Next candidate: “EMURR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “RUMER” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “UMMER” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUSER” – but S is out.  

Next candidate: “MUEHR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEGR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEFR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEQR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEWR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEXR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEVR” – invalid.  

Next candidate: “MUEZR” – invalid.  

This is extremely restrictive. Let me try to use I as the extra letter.

We have to use U, M, E, R and one more letter. Let’s try:

- M in 1, E in 2, U in 3, I in 4 → M E U I R – invalid.  

- M in 1, U in 2, E in 3, I in 4 → M U E I R – invalid.  

- E in 2, U in 3, M in 4, I in 1 → I E U M R – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4, I in 1 → I E M U R – invalid.  

- U in 2, E in 3, M in 4, I in 1 → I U E M R – invalid.  

This is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading the feedback:
- From arose: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2
- From entry: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 4
- From cruel: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 3
- From umber: R(✓) means R is in position 5

So R is definitely in position 5.

From arose: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 5
From entry: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 1
From cruel: E(-) means E is in word but not in position 4
So E must be in position 2 or 3

From arose: U was not in the word (cruel feedback: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 3)
From entry: U was not in the word (cruel feedback: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 3)
From umber: U(-) means U is in word but not in position 1

So U must be in position 2, 3, or 4

From umber: M(-) means M is in word but not in position 2

So M must be in position 1, 3, or 4

We have to place E, U, M in positions 1-4 with:
- E in 2 or 3
- U in 2,3,4
- M in 1,3,4
- No repeats of letters already ruled out

Let’s try:
- E in 2, U in 3, M in 1 → M E U _ R
   Need a valid word: “MEUAR” – invalid.  
   “MEUDR” – invalid.  
   “MEUFR” – invalid.  
   “MEUQR” – invalid.  
   “MEUWR” – invalid.  
   “MEUXR” – invalid.  
   “MEUVR” – invalid.  
   “MEUZR” – invalid.  

- E in 2, M in 3, U in 4 → _ E M U R
   Need a valid word: “DEMER” – invalid.  
   “FEMUR” – this is a valid word (“femur” is the bone).  
   Check letters: F is allowed (not ruled out), E, M, U, R.  
   Check positions:
   - R in 5 (correct)
   - E in 2 (allowed)
   - M in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 4 (allowed)
   - F in 1 (allowed)

This fits all constraints!

So the next guess is “FEMUR”.",Guess 5: femur -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) E(✓) M(✓) U(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
