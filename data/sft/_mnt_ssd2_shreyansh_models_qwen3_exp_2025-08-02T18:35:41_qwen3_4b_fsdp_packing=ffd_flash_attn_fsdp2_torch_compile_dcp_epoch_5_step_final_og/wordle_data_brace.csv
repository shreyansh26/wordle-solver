### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" because they cover frequently used vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(✓) → R is in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not the word
- E(✓) → E is in position 5

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ R _ _ E
- It contains the letter A somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (but not 1 or 5)
- It does NOT contain O or S

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, D, C, etc.
Good vowels to test next: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are known)

A strong next guess would be a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2 and E in position 5
2. Places A in position 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are still open)
3. Tests new consonants in positions 1 and 4

A word that fits: TRAIN

- R (confirmed in position 2)
- A (confirmed in word, placed in position 3)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(✓) → R is in position 2
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(x) → S is not the word
- E(✓) → E is in position 5

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ R _ _ E
- It contains the letter A somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (but not 1 or 5)
- It does NOT contain O or S

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, D, C, etc.
Good vowels to test next: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are known)

A strong next guess would be a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2 and E in position 5
2. Places A in position 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are still open)
3. Tests new consonants in positions 1 and 4

A word that fits: TRAIN
- T (new consonant in position 1)
- R (confirmed in position 2)
- A (confirmed in word, placed in position 3)
- I (new vowel in position 4)
- N (new consonant in position 5)

This tests T, I, N while respecting all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R A _ E  (positions 2, 3, 5 are locked)
2. Letters confirmed present: R, A, E
3. Letters confirmed absent: O, S, T, I, N
4. Still need to test consonants for positions 1 and 4 and vowel for position 4 (but position 4 is consonant in the pattern _ R A _ E).

Good remaining consonants to test: C, D, L, M, P, V, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: U (only vowel left not yet tested).

We need a word that:
- Has the pattern _ R A _ E
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, T, I, N)
- Uses new letters in positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- CRANE: C (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), N (ruled out) → invalid
- GRADE: G (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), D (new), E (fixed) → valid
- BRAVE: B (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), V (new), E (fixed) → valid
- CRATE: C (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), T (ruled out) → invalid
- PRASE: P (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), S (ruled out) → invalid
- GRAPE: G (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), P (new), E (fixed) → valid

Among these, ""GRADE"" and ""BRAVE"" are common. ""GRADE"" tests D in position 4, while ""BRAVE"" tests V. Both are good, but ""GRADE"" is slightly more common. I'll go with GRADE.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E  (positions 2,3,5 are locked)
- Letters confirmed present: R, A, E
- Letters confirmed absent: O, S, T, I, N, G, D
- Still need to test consonants for positions 1 and 4.

Remaining consonants to test (common ones): B, C, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left not yet tested, but position 4 is consonant in the pattern)

We need a word that:
1. Has the pattern _ R A _ E
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out
3. Tests new consonants in positions 1 and 4

Candidate words:
- BRAVE: B (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), V (new), E (fixed) → B and V are new
- CRANE: C (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), N (ruled out) → invalid
- PRASE: P (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), S (ruled out) → invalid
- GRAPE: G (ruled out) → invalid
- CRAVE: C (new), R (fixed), A (fixed), V (new), E (fixed) → C and V are new

Between BRAVE and CRAVE, both are good, but CRAVE is slightly more common. I'll go with CRAVE.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern is definitely _ R A _ E
2. Letters we know are in the word: R, A, E
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, T, I, N, G, D, V
4. Letters we have tested so far for positions 1 and 4:
   - Position 1: A (ruled out), T (ruled out), G (ruled out), C (wrong position)
   - Position 4: S (ruled out), I (ruled out), D (ruled out), V (ruled out)

Still need to test for position 1: B, F, H, L, M, P, W, Y
Still need to test for position 4: consonants not yet tried (e.g., B, F, H, L, M, P, W, Y)

Candidate words that fit _ R A _ E and use only allowed letters:
- BRAVE: B (new for pos 1), V (new for pos 4) → but V was ruled out
- PRASE: S (ruled out)
- FRATE: T (ruled out)
- CRATE: T (ruled out), C (already tried in wrong position)
- BRACE: C (ruled out)
- PRASE: S (ruled out)
- CRAVE: already tried (C in wrong position, V ruled out)
- PRASE: S ruled out
- FRATE: T ruled out
- BRAKE: K not yet tested, but is that allowed? K wasn't ruled out
   - BRAKE: B (new pos 1), K (new pos 4) → K is allowed
   - Check letters: B, R, A, K, E → none of the forbidden letters (O,S,T,I,N,G,D,V)
   - Pattern: _ R A _ E → B R A K E fits

Another candidate: B R A M E → BRA M E? Not a valid word.
P R A M E? Not valid.
F R A M E → FRAME: F (new pos 1), M (new pos 4) → both new
Check letters: F, R, A, M, E → none forbidden
FRAME fits _ R A _ E pattern.

Between BRAKE and FRAME, both are valid. FRAME is more common. I'll go with FRAME.

We now know the pattern is _ R A _ E, and the letters F and M are NOT in the word.  
Forbidden letters so far: O, S, T, I, N, G, D, V, F, M.  
Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4: B, C, H, L, P, W, Y, K, etc.  

We have tested:
- Position 1: A, T, G, C, F → still need B, H, L, P, W, Y, K
- Position 4: S, I, D, V, M → still need B, C, H, L, P, W, Y, K

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ R A _ E with only allowed letters:
- BRAKE: B (allowed), R, A, K (allowed), E → none of the forbidden letters appear.
- PRASE: S is forbidden.
- CRANE: N is forbidden.
- CRAVE: already tried (C in wrong position, V ruled out).
- BRAVE: V is forbidden.
- FRAME: already tried (F and M ruled out).

The only remaining common word is BRAKE.

Let’s check: BRAKE → B, R, A, K, E.  
None of the letters are in the forbidden list, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, BRAKE is the logical next guess.
