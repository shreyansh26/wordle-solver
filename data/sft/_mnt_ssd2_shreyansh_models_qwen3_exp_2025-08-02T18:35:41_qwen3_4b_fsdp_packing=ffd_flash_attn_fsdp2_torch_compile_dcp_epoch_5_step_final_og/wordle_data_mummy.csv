1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates:
- The letters S, L, A, T, E entirely  
- Any word containing any of those letters

To maximize information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, focusing on the next most common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining frequent letters include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P  
- Letter that IS in the word and in the correct position: M (4th letter)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ M _

Remaining common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps M in the 4th position.
2. Uses new, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Doesn’t repeat any letters already eliminated.

Good candidates: “BUMPY”, “GUMMY”, “HUMID”, “JUMPS” (but S is out), “DUMPY”, “HUMOR”, etc.

“BUMPY” uses B, U, M, P, Y. But P is already ruled out (x), so P is invalid.

“GUMMY” uses G, U, M, M, Y – but M is already known to be in position 4, and we don’t know if it appears twice. Also, double M might be less informative.

“DUMPY” uses D, U, M, P, Y – P is out.

“HUMID” uses H, U, M, I, D – I is out.

“JUMPS” uses J, U, M, P, S – P and S are out.

“HUMOR” uses H, U, M, O, R – R is out.

“FUMED” uses F, U, M, E, D – E is out.

“GUMMY” seems the only reasonable 5-letter word left that keeps M in position 4 and uses new letters. Even though it has a double M, it still gives us info about G, U, Y.

But wait – “GUMMY” has two M’s, and we already know M is in position 4. The second M could be in position 3 or 5, but we don’t know. This might not be optimal.

Better choices:
- “FUMED” – but E is out.
- “DUMPS” – S is out.
- “HUMPS” – S is out.
- “BUMPY” – P is out.
- “JUMPS” – S and P are out.
- “GUMMY” – P is out (no P in GUMMY, actually – G, U, M, M, Y. P is not in this word, so this is valid).

Actually, “GUMMY” is valid because P is not in it. But we have no info on G, U, Y, M, M.

Another option: “FUMMY” – F, U, M, M, Y. But F is not ruled out yet.

But we have no info on F, U, Y, M, M.

“GUMMY” seems the best so far.

But let me think differently: we need a word with M in position 4, and no S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So “DUMBO” is a good next guess.

“GUMMY” uses G, U, M, M, Y – but M is already known to be in position 4, and we don’t know if it appears twice. Also, double M might be less informative.

“DUMPY” uses D, U, M, P, Y – P is out.

“HUMID” uses H, U, M, I, D – I is out.

“JUMPS” uses J, U, M, P, S – P and S are out.

“HUMOR” uses H, U, M, O, R – R is out.

“FUMED” uses F, U, M, E, D – E is out.

“GUMMY” seems the only reasonable 5-letter word left that keeps M in position 4 and uses new letters. Even though it has a double M, it still gives us info about G, U, Y.

But wait – “GUMMY” has two M’s, and we already know M is in position 4. The second M could be in position 3 or 5, but we don’t know. This might not be optimal.

Better choices:
- “FUMED” – but E is out.
- “DUMPS” – S is out.
- “HUMPS” – S is out.
- “BUMPY” – P is out.
- “JUMPS” – S and P are out.
- “GUMMY” – P is out (no P in GUMMY, actually – G, U, M, M, Y. P is not in this word, so this is valid).

Actually, “GUMMY” is valid because P is not in it. But we have no info on G, U, Y, M, M.

Another option: “FUMMY” – F, U, M, M, Y. But F is not ruled out yet.

But we have no info on F, U, Y, M, M.

“GUMMY” seems the best so far.

But let me think differently: we need a word with M in position 4, and no S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try “BUMPY” – but P is out.

“DUMBO” – but O is allowed, B is allowed, D is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed. But B and O are new.

But “DUMBO” has B and O, both new letters.

This seems good: D, U, M, B, O – none of the eliminated letters.

Let me check: D, U, M, B, O – none of S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P. This is valid.

So “DUMBO” is a good next guess.

But “DUMBO” is a valid word meaning a shady character.

Another option: “BUMPS” – but P is out.

“HUMID” – I is out.

“GUMMY” – seems okay, but double M.

“DUMBO” seems better.

Let me go with “DUMBO”.

Current known facts:
1. Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - M is 4th letter (position 4)
   - U is 2nd letter (position 2)
3. Therefore the word structure is: _ U _ M _

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any others not listed.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ U _ M _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- FUGMY (invalid, not a word)
- HUGMY (invalid)

- GUMMY – yes, but double M
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes, uses Y and U, M

But YUMMY has double M, which is allowed since we don't know if M appears twice. However, it's more likely a single M.

Looking again, the only valid word seems to be ""GUMMY"" but with double M. However, we need to check if there are other words.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ U _ M _ with letters from F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- FUGMY – no
- GUMMY – yes
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes

Between GUMMY and YUMMY, both are valid but GUMMY has G which is new. GUMMY seems better.

But let's check if there's a better word. Actually, ""GUMMY"" is valid.

""YUMMY"" seems acceptable.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates:
- The letters S, L, A, T, E entirely  
- Any word containing any of those letters

To maximize information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, focusing on the next most common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining frequent letters include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that avoids all of S, L, A, T, E while covering common letters is “CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P are all unused so far  
- Contains two common vowels (I, O) and three common consonants (C, R, M, P)  
- No repeated letters, maximizing coverage

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P  
- Letter that IS in the word and in the correct position: M (4th letter)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ M _

Remaining common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps M in the 4th position.
2. Uses new, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Doesn’t repeat any letters already eliminated.

Good candidates: “BUMPY”, “GUMMY”, “HUMID”, “JUMPS” (but S is out), “DUMPY”, “HUMOR”, etc.

“BUMPY” uses B, U, M, P, Y. But P is already ruled out (x), so P is invalid.

“GUMMY” uses G, U, M, M, Y – but M is already known to be in position 4, and we don’t know if it appears twice. Also, double M might be less informative.

“DUMPY” uses D, U, M, P, Y – P is out.

“HUMID” uses H, U, M, I, D – I is out.

“JUMPS” uses J, U, M, P, S – P and S are out.

“HUMOR” uses H, U, M, O, R – R is out.

“FUMED” uses F, U, M, E, D – E is out.

“GUMMY” seems the only reasonable 5-letter word left that keeps M in position 4 and uses new letters. Even though it has a double M, it still gives us info about G, U, Y.

But wait – “GUMMY” has two M’s, and we already know M is in position 4. The second M could be in position 3 or 5, but we don’t know. This might not be optimal.

Better choices:
- “FUMED” – but E is out.
- “DUMPS” – S is out.
- “HUMPS” – S is out.
- “BUMPY” – P is out.
- “JUMPS” – S and P are out.
- “GUMMY” – P is out (no P in GUMMY, actually – G, U, M, M, Y. P is not in this word, so this is valid).

Actually, “GUMMY” is valid because P is not in it. But we have no info on G, U, Y, M, M.

Another option: “FUMMY” – F, U, M, M, Y. But F is not ruled out yet.

But we have no info on F, U, Y, M, M.

“GUMMY” seems the best so far.

But let me think differently: we need a word with M in position 4, and no S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try “BUMPY” – but P is out.

“DUMBO” – but O is allowed, B is allowed, D is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed. But B and O are new.

But “DUMBO” has B and O, both new letters.

This seems good: D, U, M, B, O – none of the eliminated letters.

Let me check: D, U, M, B, O – none of S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P. This is valid.

So “DUMBO” is a good next guess.

But “DUMBO” is a valid word meaning a shady character.

Another option: “BUMPS” – but P is out.

“HUMID” – I is out.

“GUMMY” – seems okay, but double M.

“DUMBO” seems better.

Let me go with “DUMBO”.

Current known facts:
1. Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - M is 4th letter (position 4)
   - U is 2nd letter (position 2)
3. Therefore the word structure is: _ U _ M _

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any others not listed.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ U _ M _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- FUGMY (invalid, not a word)
- HUGMY (invalid)
- JUMPY (but JUMPY has P which is out)
- GUMMY (but GUMMY has G and Y, but double M might not be useful)
- HUMID (but I and D are out)
- FUMED (E is out)
- HUMOR (O is out)
- HUMPS (P and S are out)
- JUMPS (P and S are out)
- GUMMY (G, U, M, M, Y – but double M and Y is allowed)

Actually, let's list valid words fitting _ U _ M _ with remaining letters:
- FUGMY – no
- GUMMY – yes, but double M
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes, uses Y and U, M

But YUMMY has double M, which is allowed since we don't know if M appears twice. However, it's more likely a single M.

Looking again, the only valid word seems to be ""GUMMY"" but with double M. However, we need to check if there are other words.

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ U _ M _ with letters from F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- FUGMY – no
- GUMMY – yes
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes

Between GUMMY and YUMMY, both are valid but GUMMY has G which is new. GUMMY seems better.

But let's check if there's a better word. Actually, ""GUMMY"" is valid.

But let me think if there's a word with single M. The pattern is _ U _ M _. 

Another candidate: ""FUGMY"" – no. 

It appears ""GUMMY"" is the best fit, but let me check again.

Actually, ""GUMMY"" has G, U, M, M, Y – fits the pattern _ U _ M _ with M in position 4 and U in position 2. Even though it has double M, it's still a valid word.

However, let me think if there's a word with single M. The word must be _ U _ M _ with single M. 

Looking at possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- FUGMY – no
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes, but double M

It seems the only valid words are those with double M. 

But let me check ""YUMMY"" – it's valid and fits _ U _ M _ with Y in position 1, U in 2, M in 4, M in 5. 

But we know M is in position 4, so position 5 could be another M. 

""YUMMY"" seems acceptable.

But let me think of another approach. The word must be _ U _ M _ with letters from the remaining set. 

Another candidate: ""FUGMY"" – no. 

Actually, ""GUMMY"" is the only valid word fitting the pattern. 

But let me check if ""GUMMY"" is the best choice. 

However, there's another word: ""HUMID"" – but I and D are out. 

Wait, let me think of words with remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word must be _ U _ M _. 

Possible words:
- FUGMY – no
- GUMMY – yes
- HUGMY – no
- JUMPY – P is out
- KUMMY – no
- NUMMY – no
- VUMMY – no
- WUMMY – no
- YUMMY – yes

Between GUMMY and YUMMY, both are valid, but GUMMY has G which is new. 

But let me check if ""GUMMY"" is the correct word. 

Actually, ""GUMMY"" is valid and fits the pattern. 

But let me think if there's a better word. 

Another candidate: ""FUGMY"" – no. 

It seems ""GUMMY"" is the best fit. 

But let me think of ""FUGMY"" – no. 

Actually, the word must be _ U _ M _ with letters from remaining. 

After checking, ""GUMMY"" seems to be the only valid word. 

But let me think of ""FUGMY"" – no. 

Actually, ""GUMMY"" is the correct word.

But let me think of ""FUGMY"" – no. 

I realize now that ""GUMMY"" is the only valid word fitting _ U _ M _ with remaining letters. 

However, let me check if ""YUMMY"" is valid – yes, it is. 

Between GUMMY and YUMMY, both are valid, but GUMMY has G which is new. 

But let me check if ""GUMMY"" is the best choice. 

Actually, ""YUMMY"" seems better because Y is a new vowel and M is already known. 

But both are similar. 

Let me choose ""YUMMY"".

But let me think again: the word must be _ U _ M _ with letters from remaining. 

Another candidate: ""FUGMY"" – no. 

Actually, ""GUMMY"" is valid and fits. 

But let me think of ""FUGMY"" – no. 

After careful consideration, ""GUMMY"" is the best choice. 

But let me check if ""GUMMY"" is the correct word. 

Yes, ""GUMMY"" fits _ U _ M _ with G, U, M, M, Y – none of the eliminated letters. 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GUMMY"".

From the new feedback on GUMMY:
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – already knew it was position 2
- M is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – already knew it was position 4
- Second M is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so there is a second M, and it must be in position 5
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so position 1 is Y

So the word structure is now:
Y U _ M M

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O, G

Remaining possible letters for position 3: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with YU and ends with MM, using one of the remaining letters in the middle.

Possible candidates:
- YUMMY – but we already used M in position 4 and 5, and we have no info on double M, but the feedback shows M in position 4 and 5 as ✓, so YUMMY fits
- YUMPS – but P is out
- YUMIK – but I is out
- YUMMY – valid word

""YUMMY"" fits perfectly:
Y (position 1 ✓), U (position 2 ✓), M (position 3 – but we know position 4 and 5 are M), but wait, the structure is Y U _ M M, so position 3 must be a single letter. 

Looking at valid words:
- YUMMY – Y U M M Y – but this would be Y U M M Y, which has M in position 3 and 4, but we know position 4 is M and position 5 is M. This would require position 3 to be M as well, making it Y U M M M, but YUMMY is Y U M M Y.

This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GUMMY:
- Position 1: G(x) – not Y
- Position 2: U(✓) – correct
- Position 3: M(✓) – correct
- Position 4: M(✓) – correct
- Position 5: Y(✓) – correct

Wait, no – the feedback shows:
GUMMY -> G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: U is correct (✓)
- Position 3: M is correct (✓)
- Position 4: M is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

So the word must be _ U M M Y, but position 1 is not G, so possible letters for position 1: any not eliminated.

But we know:
- Position 1: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O
- Remaining letters: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

So the word must be one of these letters followed by UMMY.

Possible words:
- FUMMY – not a word
- HUMMY – not standard
- JUMMY – not standard
- KUMMY – not standard
- NUMMY – not standard
- WUMMY – not standard
- YUMMY – but Y is position 1, but we know position 5 is Y

Wait, this seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

The feedback for GUMMY is:
G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 2: U is correct
- Position 3: M is correct
- Position 4: M is correct
- Position 5: Y is correct

But position 1: G is not in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

So the word must be _ U M M Y, where the first letter is not G.

Possible first letters: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in UMMY:
- FUMMY – not valid
- HUMMY – not valid
- JUMMY – not valid
- KUMMY – not valid
- LUMMY – L is out
- MUMMY – M is already in positions 3-5, but this would be M U M M Y – but M is not in position 1
- NUMMY – not valid
- PUMMY – P is out
- S U M M Y – S is out
- T U M M Y – T is out
- W U M M Y – not valid
- X U M M Y – not valid
- Z U M M Y – not valid

This suggests there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me re-read the feedback carefully.

The feedback for GUMMY is:
G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 2: U is correct
- Position 3: M is correct
- Position 4: M is correct
- Position 5: Y is correct
- Position 1: G is not in the word

So the word must be _ U M M Y, with the first letter not G. However, there are no common English words fitting this pattern except ""MUMMY"", but that would require M in position 1, which is allowed since M is not eliminated.

""MUMMY"" fits:
- M is allowed (not in the eliminated list)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- M is in position 3 (✓)
- M is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

But we have no information that M is in position 1, so this seems possible.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. The only valid word fitting _ U M M Y is ""MUMMY"".

Therefore, the next guess must be MUMMY.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback, the word must be _ U M M Y with the first letter not G. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""MUMMY"".

<guess>MUMMY</guess>",MUMMY,"From the new feedback on GUMMY:
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – already knew it was position 2
- M is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – already knew it was position 4
- Second M is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so there is a second M, and it must be in position 5
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so position 1 is Y

So the word structure is now:
Y U _ M M

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O, G

Remaining possible letters for position 3: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with YU and ends with MM, using one of the remaining letters in the middle.

Possible candidates:
- YUMMY – but we already used M in position 4 and 5, and we have no info on double M, but the feedback shows M in position 4 and 5 as ✓, so YUMMY fits
- YUMPS – but P is out
- YUMIK – but I is out
- YUMMY – valid word

""YUMMY"" fits perfectly:
Y (position 1 ✓), U (position 2 ✓), M (position 3 – but we know position 4 and 5 are M), but wait, the structure is Y U _ M M, so position 3 must be a single letter. 

Looking at valid words:
- YUMMY – Y U M M Y – but this would be Y U M M Y, which has M in position 3 and 4, but we know position 4 is M and position 5 is M. This would require position 3 to be M as well, making it Y U M M M, but YUMMY is Y U M M Y.

This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From GUMMY:
- Position 1: G(x) – not Y
- Position 2: U(✓) – correct
- Position 3: M(✓) – correct
- Position 4: M(✓) – correct
- Position 5: Y(✓) – correct

Wait, no – the feedback shows:
GUMMY -> G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: U is correct (✓)
- Position 3: M is correct (✓)
- Position 4: M is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

So the word must be _ U M M Y, but position 1 is not G, so possible letters for position 1: any not eliminated.

But we know:
- Position 1: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, B, O
- Remaining letters: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

So the word must be one of these letters followed by UMMY.

Possible words:
- FUMMY – not a word
- HUMMY – not standard
- JUMMY – not standard
- KUMMY – not standard
- NUMMY – not standard
- WUMMY – not standard
- YUMMY – but Y is position 1, but we know position 5 is Y

Wait, this seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

The feedback for GUMMY is:
G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 2: U is correct
- Position 3: M is correct
- Position 4: M is correct
- Position 5: Y is correct

But position 1: G is not in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

So the word must be _ U M M Y, where the first letter is not G.

Possible first letters: F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in UMMY:
- FUMMY – not valid
- HUMMY – not valid
- JUMMY – not valid
- KUMMY – not valid
- LUMMY – L is out
- MUMMY – M is already in positions 3-5, but this would be M U M M Y – but M is not in position 1
- NUMMY – not valid
- PUMMY – P is out
- S U M M Y – S is out
- T U M M Y – T is out
- W U M M Y – not valid
- X U M M Y – not valid
- Z U M M Y – not valid

This suggests there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me re-read the feedback carefully.

The feedback for GUMMY is:
G(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 2: U is correct
- Position 3: M is correct
- Position 4: M is correct
- Position 5: Y is correct
- Position 1: G is not in the word

So the word must be _ U M M Y, with the first letter not G. However, there are no common English words fitting this pattern except ""MUMMY"", but that would require M in position 1, which is allowed since M is not eliminated.

""MUMMY"" fits:
- M is allowed (not in the eliminated list)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- M is in position 3 (✓)
- M is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

But we have no information that M is in position 1, so this seems possible.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. The only valid word fitting _ U M M Y is ""MUMMY"".

Therefore, the next guess must be MUMMY.Based on the latest feedback, the word must be _ U M M Y with the first letter not G. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""MUMMY"".",Guess 5: MUMMY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
