For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, E
Letters that are in the word: A, O, S (each in a different position than where they appeared in AROSE)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, S
- Does NOT contain R or E
- A is not in position 1
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SOAKS"" comes to mind, but it has two S’s and we already know S is in the word (but we don’t know how many times it appears). However, ""SOAKS"" also has an O in position 2 and an A in position 3, which might be useful.

Another option is ""SALSA"", but it has two S’s and two A’s, which might not be optimal.

""SAOIN"" is a less common word and might not be the best first guess.

""SAVIO"" is not a valid English word.

""SAO"" plus two more letters: ""SAO"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

""SAO"" plus ""S"" and ""T"" → ""SAOST"" (invalid)
""SAO"" plus ""N"" and ""D"" → ""SAOND"" (invalid)

""SOAKS"" seems like the most plausible valid word that fits the constraints:
- Contains S, A, O
- Doesn't contain R or E
- A is in position 3 (which is allowed, since A was in position 1 in AROSE)
- O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since O was in position 3 in AROSE)
- S is in position 1 (which is allowed, since S was in position 4 in AROSE)

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down positions.

- Does NOT contain R, E, K

- S O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is invalid
- S _ O _ _ : O in position 3

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SOAKS"" comes to mind, but it has two S’s and we already know S is in the word (but we don’t know how many times it appears). However, ""SOAKS"" also has an O in position 2 and an A in position 3, which might be useful.

Another option is ""SALSA"", but it has two S’s and two A’s, which might not be optimal.

""SAOIN"" is a less common word and might not be the best first guess.

""SAVIO"" is not a valid English word.

""SAO"" plus two more letters: ""SAO"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

""SAO"" plus ""S"" and ""T"" → ""SAOST"" (invalid)
""SAO"" plus ""N"" and ""D"" → ""SAOND"" (invalid)

""SOAKS"" seems like the most plausible valid word that fits the constraints:
- Contains S, A, O
- Doesn't contain R or E
- A is in position 3 (which is allowed, since A was in position 1 in AROSE)
- O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since O was in position 3 in AROSE)
- S is in position 1 (which is allowed, since S was in position 4 in AROSE)

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down positions.

Guess 2: SOAKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1
   - R, E are NOT in the word
   - O is in the word, not in position 3
   - S is in the word, not in position 4

2. SOAKS → S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - O is in the word, not in position 2
   - A is in the word, not in position 3
   - K is NOT in the word
   - Second S is in the word, but not in position 5

So we now know:
- Word starts with S (position 1)
- Contains A, O, S (with another S somewhere else)
- Does NOT contain R, E, K
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- O is not in position 2 or 3
- S is already in position 1, so the other S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Possible positions:
- S _ _ _ _
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Another S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Let's try to form words:
- S A _ _ _ : But A can't be in position 2 (since S is in 1 and we don't know about A in 2)
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5
- S O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is invalid
- S _ O _ _ : O in position 3
- S _ _ O _ : O in position 4
- S _ _ _ O : O in position 5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- S A M O S : Contains S, A, O, but K is already out, R/E out. SAMOS is valid.
  - S(✓) A(?) M(?) O(?) S(?)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed)
  - Another S in position 5 (allowed)
  - M is new, but we don't know yet

This seems like a good next guess to test positions of A and O and introduce M.

Another option: S A L O S (but L is new, and we don't know)
S A P O S (P is new)
S A T O S (T is new)

SAMOS seems balanced.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. A is correct in position 2.
3. O is correct in position 4.
4. M is NOT in the word.
5. The last S is in the word but not in position 5 (from SAMOS feedback: S(-) in position 5).

So the word looks like: S A _ O S

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SA, has O in the 4th position, ends with S, and contains no R, E, K, M.

Possible patterns: S A _ O S

Letters left to test for position 3: cannot be R, E, K, M, A, S, O (since those are already placed or ruled out).

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- S A B O S → ""SABOS"" (not a standard word)
- S A C O S → ""SACOS"" (not standard)
- S A D O S → ""SADOS"" (not standard)
- S A F O S → ""SAFOS"" (not standard)
- S A G O S → ""SAGOS"" (not standard)
- S A H O S → ""SAHOS"" (not standard)
- S A I O S → ""SAI O S"" (invalid)
- S A L O S → ""SALOS"" (not standard)
- S A N O S → ""SANOS"" (not standard)
- S A P O S → ""SAPOS"" (not standard)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A V O S → ""SAVOS"" (not standard)
- S A W O S → ""SAWOS"" (not standard)
- S A Y O S → ""SA YOS"" (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem standard. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which implies there must be another S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already A (correct), position 4 is O (correct), so the only remaining place for the second S is position 3.

Thus the word must be: S A S O _

But we need a 5-letter word ending with a letter that isn't R, E, K, M, A, O, S. The last letter must be a new letter.

Looking for ""SASO_"" words:
- SASOL (but L is allowed, and we haven't tested it yet)
- SASOS (but S is already in position 3, and position 5 would be S which is invalid because S can't be in position 5)

Wait, the pattern must be S A S O _, and the last letter must be something new. The only valid word I can think of is ""SASOL"", but that's 6 letters. 

Let me check again. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which means there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is O, the only possible place is position 3. So the word must be S A S O _.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that would have S in position 5, which is invalid. 

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From SAMOS:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- M(x) not in word
- O(✓) position 4
- S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 is A and 4 is O, so the only possible place is position 3. 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid word ending with a letter not yet ruled out is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid because S would be in position 5. 

This suggests there might be an error in my reasoning. Let me check if there's another interpretation. The feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 could mean the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, implying there could be multiple S's. However, we already have S in position 1 and possibly another S in position 3. 

But the word must be 5 letters, so the only possible pattern is S A S O _. The only valid word fitting this is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

Let me think differently: maybe the word has only one S, but the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 5. But we already have S in position 1, so that would be consistent. 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. But the feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might indicate that S is in the word but not in position 5, which could be redundant since we already have S in position 1. 

Given this confusion, let's try to find a word that starts with SA, has O in position 4, and no R, E, K, M. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON (but position 5 is N, not S)
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O R → SAVOR (but R is out)
- S A V O T → SA VOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

This is tricky. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might actually indicate that the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, which could mean there's another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. 

Given that, and knowing positions 1=A, 2=_, 4=O, the only possible place for another S is position 3. Thus the word must be S A S O _. 

The only valid word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that has S in position 5 which is invalid. 

This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be true. Let me check if I misread the feedback. 

Re-reading:
- SAMOS feedback: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)
  - S(✓) position 1
  - A(✓) position 2
  - M(x) not in word
  - O(✓) position 4
  - S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 3 (since 2 and 4 are taken by A and O). 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid 5-letter word ending with a new letter is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

This indicates I might need to consider that the word has only one S, and the feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 is just confirming S is in the word (already known). 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

The most plausible valid word seems to be SALON, but let me check if it fits all constraints:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- L (new)
- O(✓) position 4
- N (new)

This seems to fit all feedback:
- No R, E, K, M
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- S is in position 1 (allowed)
- The last S in SAMOS was just confirming S is in the word, which we already have.

Thus, SALON is a valid next guess.
</think>

From the combined feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- A is correct in position 2
- O is correct in position 4
- M is NOT in the word
- The final S in position 5 is simply confirming S exists but not in position 5 (redundant since S is already in position 1)

The word structure is: S A _ O _

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern and excluding R, E, K, M:
- SALON (S A L O N) is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, E
Letters that are in the word: A, O, S (each in a different position than where they appeared in AROSE)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, S
- Does NOT contain R or E
- A is not in position 1
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SOAKS"" comes to mind, but it has two S’s and we already know S is in the word (but we don’t know how many times it appears). However, ""SOAKS"" also has an O in position 2 and an A in position 3, which might be useful.

Another option is ""SALSA"", but it has two S’s and two A’s, which might not be optimal.

""SAOIN"" is a less common word and might not be the best first guess.

""SAVIO"" is not a valid English word.

""SAO"" plus two more letters: ""SAO"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

""SAO"" plus ""S"" and ""T"" → ""SAOST"" (invalid)
""SAO"" plus ""N"" and ""D"" → ""SAOND"" (invalid)

""SOAKS"" seems like the most plausible valid word that fits the constraints:
- Contains S, A, O
- Doesn't contain R or E
- A is in position 3 (which is allowed, since A was in position 1 in AROSE)
- O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since O was in position 3 in AROSE)
- S is in position 1 (which is allowed, since S was in position 4 in AROSE)

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOAKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1
   - R, E are NOT in the word
   - O is in the word, not in position 3
   - S is in the word, not in position 4

2. SOAKS → S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - O is in the word, not in position 2
   - A is in the word, not in position 3
   - K is NOT in the word
   - Second S is in the word, but not in position 5

So we now know:
- Word starts with S (position 1)
- Contains A, O, S (with another S somewhere else)
- Does NOT contain R, E, K
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- O is not in position 2 or 3
- S is already in position 1, so the other S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Possible positions:
- S _ _ _ _
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Another S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Let's try to form words:
- S A _ _ _ : But A can't be in position 2 (since S is in 1 and we don't know about A in 2)
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5
- S O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is invalid
- S _ O _ _ : O in position 3
- S _ _ O _ : O in position 4
- S _ _ _ O : O in position 5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- S A M O S : Contains S, A, O, but K is already out, R/E out. SAMOS is valid.
  - S(✓) A(?) M(?) O(?) S(?)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed)
  - Another S in position 5 (allowed)
  - M is new, but we don't know yet

This seems like a good next guess to test positions of A and O and introduce M.

Another option: S A L O S (but L is new, and we don't know)
S A P O S (P is new)
S A T O S (T is new)

SAMOS seems balanced.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOAKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
Guess 3: SAMOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now know:

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. A is correct in position 2.
3. O is correct in position 4.
4. M is NOT in the word.
5. The last S is in the word but not in position 5 (from SAMOS feedback: S(-) in position 5).

So the word looks like: S A _ O S

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SA, has O in the 4th position, ends with S, and contains no R, E, K, M.

Possible patterns: S A _ O S

Letters left to test for position 3: cannot be R, E, K, M, A, S, O (since those are already placed or ruled out).

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- S A B O S → ""SABOS"" (not a standard word)
- S A C O S → ""SACOS"" (not standard)
- S A D O S → ""SADOS"" (not standard)
- S A F O S → ""SAFOS"" (not standard)
- S A G O S → ""SAGOS"" (not standard)
- S A H O S → ""SAHOS"" (not standard)
- S A I O S → ""SAI O S"" (invalid)
- S A L O S → ""SALOS"" (not standard)
- S A N O S → ""SANOS"" (not standard)
- S A P O S → ""SAPOS"" (not standard)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A V O S → ""SAVOS"" (not standard)
- S A W O S → ""SAWOS"" (not standard)
- S A Y O S → ""SA YOS"" (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem standard. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which implies there must be another S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already A (correct), position 4 is O (correct), so the only remaining place for the second S is position 3.

Thus the word must be: S A S O _

But we need a 5-letter word ending with a letter that isn't R, E, K, M, A, O, S. The last letter must be a new letter.

Looking for ""SASO_"" words:
- SASOL (but L is allowed, and we haven't tested it yet)
- SASOS (but S is already in position 3, and position 5 would be S which is invalid because S can't be in position 5)

Wait, the pattern must be S A S O _, and the last letter must be something new. The only valid word I can think of is ""SASOL"", but that's 6 letters. 

Let me check again. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which means there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is O, the only possible place is position 3. So the word must be S A S O _.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that would have S in position 5, which is invalid. 

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From SAMOS:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- M(x) not in word
- O(✓) position 4
- S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 is A and 4 is O, so the only possible place is position 3. 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid word ending with a letter not yet ruled out is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid because S would be in position 5. 

This suggests there might be an error in my reasoning. Let me check if there's another interpretation. The feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 could mean the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, implying there could be multiple S's. However, we already have S in position 1 and possibly another S in position 3. 

But the word must be 5 letters, so the only possible pattern is S A S O _. The only valid word fitting this is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

Let me think differently: maybe the word has only one S, but the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 5. But we already have S in position 1, so that would be consistent. 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. But the feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might indicate that S is in the word but not in position 5, which could be redundant since we already have S in position 1. 

Given this confusion, let's try to find a word that starts with SA, has O in position 4, and no R, E, K, M. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON (but position 5 is N, not S)
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O R → SAVOR (but R is out)
- S A V O T → SA VOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

This is tricky. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might actually indicate that the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, which could mean there's another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. 

Given that, and knowing positions 1=A, 2=_, 4=O, the only possible place for another S is position 3. Thus the word must be S A S O _. 

The only valid word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that has S in position 5 which is invalid. 

This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be true. Let me check if I misread the feedback. 

Re-reading:
- SAMOS feedback: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)
  - S(✓) position 1
  - A(✓) position 2
  - M(x) not in word
  - O(✓) position 4
  - S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 3 (since 2 and 4 are taken by A and O). 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid 5-letter word ending with a new letter is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

This indicates I might need to consider that the word has only one S, and the feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 is just confirming S is in the word (already known). 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

The most plausible valid word seems to be SALON, but let me check if it fits all constraints:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- L (new)
- O(✓) position 4
- N (new)

This seems to fit all feedback:
- No R, E, K, M
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- S is in position 1 (allowed)
- The last S in SAMOS was just confirming S is in the word, which we already have.

Thus, SALON is a valid next guess.From the combined feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- A is correct in position 2
- O is correct in position 4
- M is NOT in the word
- The final S in position 5 is simply confirming S exists but not in position 5 (redundant since S is already in position 1)

The word structure is: S A _ O _

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern and excluding R, E, K, M:
- SALON (S A L O N) is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, E
Letters that are in the word: A, O, S (each in a different position than where they appeared in AROSE)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, S
- Does NOT contain R or E
- A is not in position 1
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SOAKS"" comes to mind, but it has two S’s and we already know S is in the word (but we don’t know how many times it appears). However, ""SOAKS"" also has an O in position 2 and an A in position 3, which might be useful.

Another option is ""SALSA"", but it has two S’s and two A’s, which might not be optimal.

""SAOIN"" is a less common word and might not be the best first guess.

""SAVIO"" is not a valid English word.

""SAO"" plus two more letters: ""SAO"" is 3 letters, we need 5.

""SAO"" plus ""S"" and ""T"" → ""SAOST"" (invalid)
""SAO"" plus ""N"" and ""D"" → ""SAOND"" (invalid)

""SOAKS"" seems like the most plausible valid word that fits the constraints:
- Contains S, A, O
- Doesn't contain R or E
- A is in position 3 (which is allowed, since A was in position 1 in AROSE)
- O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since O was in position 3 in AROSE)
- S is in position 1 (which is allowed, since S was in position 4 in AROSE)

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down positions.

Guess 2: SOAKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1
   - R, E are NOT in the word
   - O is in the word, not in position 3
   - S is in the word, not in position 4

2. SOAKS → S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - O is in the word, not in position 2
   - A is in the word, not in position 3
   - K is NOT in the word
   - Second S is in the word, but not in position 5

So we now know:
- Word starts with S (position 1)
- Contains A, O, S (with another S somewhere else)
- Does NOT contain R, E, K
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- O is not in position 2 or 3
- S is already in position 1, so the other S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Possible positions:
- S _ _ _ _
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Another S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Let's try to form words:
- S A _ _ _ : But A can't be in position 2 (since S is in 1 and we don't know about A in 2)
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5
- S O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is invalid
- S _ O _ _ : O in position 3
- S _ _ O _ : O in position 4
- S _ _ _ O : O in position 5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- S A M O S : Contains S, A, O, but K is already out, R/E out. SAMOS is valid.
  - S(✓) A(?) M(?) O(?) S(?)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed)
  - Another S in position 5 (allowed)
  - M is new, but we don't know yet

This seems like a good next guess to test positions of A and O and introduce M.

Another option: S A L O S (but L is new, and we don't know)
S A P O S (P is new)
S A T O S (T is new)

SAMOS seems balanced.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: SAMOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now know:

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. A is correct in position 2.
3. O is correct in position 4.
4. M is NOT in the word.
5. The last S is in the word but not in position 5 (from SAMOS feedback: S(-) in position 5).

So the word looks like: S A _ O S

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SA, has O in the 4th position, ends with S, and contains no R, E, K, M.

Possible patterns: S A _ O S

Letters left to test for position 3: cannot be R, E, K, M, A, S, O (since those are already placed or ruled out).

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- S A B O S → ""SABOS"" (not a standard word)
- S A C O S → ""SACOS"" (not standard)
- S A D O S → ""SADOS"" (not standard)
- S A F O S → ""SAFOS"" (not standard)
- S A G O S → ""SAGOS"" (not standard)
- S A H O S → ""SAHOS"" (not standard)
- S A I O S → ""SAI O S"" (invalid)
- S A L O S → ""SALOS"" (not standard)
- S A N O S → ""SANOS"" (not standard)
- S A P O S → ""SAPOS"" (not standard)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)
- S A V O S → ""SAVOS"" (not standard)
- S A W O S → ""SAWOS"" (not standard)
- S A Y O S → ""SA YOS"" (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem standard. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which implies there must be another S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already A (correct), position 4 is O (correct), so the only remaining place for the second S is position 3.

Thus the word must be: S A S O _

But we need a 5-letter word ending with a letter that isn't R, E, K, M, A, O, S. The last letter must be a new letter.

Looking for ""SASO_"" words:
- SASOL (but L is allowed, and we haven't tested it yet)
- SASOS (but S is already in position 3, and position 5 would be S which is invalid because S can't be in position 5)

Wait, the pattern must be S A S O _, and the last letter must be something new. The only valid word I can think of is ""SASOL"", but that's 6 letters. 

Let me check again. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which means there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is O, the only possible place is position 3. So the word must be S A S O _.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that would have S in position 5, which is invalid. 

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From SAMOS:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- M(x) not in word
- O(✓) position 4
- S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 is A and 4 is O, so the only possible place is position 3. 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid word ending with a letter not yet ruled out is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid because S would be in position 5. 

This suggests there might be an error in my reasoning. Let me check if there's another interpretation. The feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 could mean the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, implying there could be multiple S's. However, we already have S in position 1 and possibly another S in position 3. 

But the word must be 5 letters, so the only possible pattern is S A S O _. The only valid word fitting this is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

Let me think differently: maybe the word has only one S, but the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 5. But we already have S in position 1, so that would be consistent. 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. But the feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might indicate that S is in the word but not in position 5, which could be redundant since we already have S in position 1. 

Given this confusion, let's try to find a word that starts with SA, has O in position 4, and no R, E, K, M. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON (but position 5 is N, not S)
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O R → SAVOR (but R is out)
- S A V O T → SA VOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

This is tricky. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might actually indicate that the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, which could mean there's another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. 

Given that, and knowing positions 1=A, 2=_, 4=O, the only possible place for another S is position 3. Thus the word must be S A S O _. 

The only valid word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that has S in position 5 which is invalid. 

This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be true. Let me check if I misread the feedback. 

Re-reading:
- SAMOS feedback: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)
  - S(✓) position 1
  - A(✓) position 2
  - M(x) not in word
  - O(✓) position 4
  - S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 3 (since 2 and 4 are taken by A and O). 

Thus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid 5-letter word ending with a new letter is ""SASOS"", but that's invalid. 

Wait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that's 6 letters. 

This indicates I might need to consider that the word has only one S, and the feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 is just confirming S is in the word (already known). 

In this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. 

Possible words:
- S A L O N → SALON
- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)
- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)
- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)
- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)
- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)

The most plausible valid word seems to be SALON, but let me check if it fits all constraints:
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- L (new)
- O(✓) position 4
- N (new)

This seems to fit all feedback:
- No R, E, K, M
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- S is in position 1 (allowed)
- The last S in SAMOS was just confirming S is in the word, which we already have.

Thus, SALON is a valid next guess.From the combined feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- A is correct in position 2
- O is correct in position 4
- M is NOT in the word
- The final S in position 5 is simply confirming S exists but not in position 5 (redundant since S is already in position 1)

The word structure is: S A _ O _

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern and excluding R, E, K, M:
- SALON (S A L O N) is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

The last S is in the word but not in position 5 (from SAMOS feedback: S(-) in position 5).\n\nSo the word looks like: S A _ O S\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that starts with SA, has O in the 4th position, ends with S, and contains no R, E, K, M.\n\nPossible patterns: S A _ O S\n\nLetters left to test for position 3: cannot be R, E, K, M, A, S, O (since those are already placed or ruled out).\n\nCommon letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- S A B O S → ""SABOS"" (not a standard word)\n- S A C O S → ""SACOS"" (not standard)\n- S A D O S → ""SADOS"" (not standard)\n- S A F O S → ""SAFOS"" (not standard)\n- S A G O S → ""SAGOS"" (not standard)\n- S A H O S → ""SAHOS"" (not standard)\n- S A I O S → ""SAI O S"" (invalid)\n- S A L O S → ""SALOS"" (not standard)\n- S A N O S → ""SANOS"" (not standard)\n- S A P O S → ""SAPOS"" (not standard)\n- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)\n- S A T O S → ""SATO S"" (invalid)\n- S A V O S → ""SAVOS"" (not standard)\n- S A W O S → ""SAWOS"" (not standard)\n- S A Y O S → ""SA YOS"" (invalid)\n\nHmm, none of these seem standard. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which implies there must be another S somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, position 2 is already A (correct), position 4 is O (correct), so the only remaining place for the second S is position 3.\n\nThus the word must be: S A S O _\n\nBut we need a 5-letter word ending with a letter that isn\'t R, E, K, M, A, O, S. The last letter must be a new letter.\n\nLooking for ""SASO_"" words:\n- SASOL (but L is allowed, and we haven\'t tested it yet)\n- SASOS (but S is already in position 3, and position 5 would be S which is invalid because S can\'t be in position 5)\n\nWait, the pattern must be S A S O _, and the last letter must be something new. The only valid word I can think of is ""SASOL"", but that\'s 6 letters. \n\nLet me check again. The feedback says the last S is in the word but not in position 5, which means there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since position 2 is A and position 4 is O, the only possible place is position 3. So the word must be S A S O _.\n\nThe only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that would have S in position 5, which is invalid. \n\nThis suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nFrom SAMOS:\n- S(✓) position 1\n- A(✓) position 2\n- M(x) not in word\n- O(✓) position 4\n- S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 is A and 4 is O, so the only possible place is position 3. \n\nThus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid word ending with a letter not yet ruled out is ""SASOS"", but that\'s invalid because S would be in position 5. \n\nThis suggests there might be an error in my reasoning. Let me check if there\'s another interpretation. The feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 could mean the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, implying there could be multiple S\'s. However, we already have S in position 1 and possibly another S in position 3. \n\nBut the word must be 5 letters, so the only possible pattern is S A S O _. The only valid word fitting this is ""SASOS"", but that\'s invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that\'s 6 letters. \n\nLet me think differently: maybe the word has only one S, but the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 5. But we already have S in position 1, so that would be consistent. \n\nIn this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. But the feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might indicate that S is in the word but not in position 5, which could be redundant since we already have S in position 1. \n\nGiven this confusion, let\'s try to find a word that starts with SA, has O in position 4, and no R, E, K, M. \n\nPossible words:\n- S A L O N → SALON (but position 5 is N, not S)\n- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)\n- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)\n- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)\n- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)\n- S A V O R → SAVOR (but R is out)\n- S A V O T → SA VOT (not standard)\n- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)\n\nThis is tricky. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback from SAMOS shows S(-) in position 5, which might actually indicate that the letter S is in the word but not in position 5, which could mean there\'s another S in positions 2, 3, or 4. \n\nGiven that, and knowing positions 1=A, 2=_, 4=O, the only possible place for another S is position 3. Thus the word must be S A S O _. \n\nThe only valid word fitting this pattern is ""SASOS"", but that has S in position 5 which is invalid. \n\nThis suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can\'t be true. Let me check if I misread the feedback. \n\nRe-reading:\n- SAMOS feedback: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)\n  - S(✓) position 1\n  - A(✓) position 2\n  - M(x) not in word\n  - O(✓) position 4\n  - S(-) position 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5. This implies there must be another S in positions 3 (since 2 and 4 are taken by A and O). \n\nThus the word must be S A S O _. The only valid 5-letter word ending with a new letter is ""SASOS"", but that\'s invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the word is ""SASOL"" but that\'s 6 letters. \n\nThis indicates I might need to consider that the word has only one S, and the feedback ""S(-)"" in position 5 is just confirming S is in the word (already known). \n\nIn this case, the word would be S A _ O _, with no second S. \n\nPossible words:\n- S A L O N → SALON\n- S A L O T → SALOT (not standard)\n- S A N O T → SANOT (not standard)\n- S A P O N → SAPON (not standard)\n- S A P O T → SAPOT (not standard)\n- S A V O N → SA VON (not standard)\n\nThe most plausible valid word seems to be SALON, but let me check if it fits all constraints:\n- S(✓) position 1\n- A(✓) position 2\n- L (new)\n- O(✓) position 4\n- N (new)\n\nThis seems to fit all feedback:\n- No R, E, K, M\n- A is in position 2 (allowed)\n- O is in position 4 (allowed)\n- S is in position 1 (allowed)\n- The last S in SAMOS was just confirming S is in the word, which we already have.\n\nThus, SALON is a valid next guess.From the combined feedback:\n- S is correct in position 1\n- A is correct in position 2\n- O is correct in position 4\n- M is NOT in the word\n- The final S in position 5 is simply confirming S exists but not in position 5 (redundant since S is already in position 1)\n\nThe word structure is: S A _ O _\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern and excluding R, E, K, M:\n- SALON (S A L O N) is a valid English word and fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>SALON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOAKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: SAMOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) O(✓) S(-)\nGuess 4: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the four guesses we now have:\n\n1.

After checking all possible combinations, the only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern S A _ O _ and uses only the remaining allowed letters is ""SAVOY"" (though it's spelled S-A-V-O-Y). However, ""SAVOY"" is a valid word meaning a region in France or a type of wine. 

But let's verify:
- S A V O Y
- S(✓) position 1
- A(✓) position 2
- V (new, allowed)
- O(✓) position 4
- Y (new, allowed)

This fits all constraints.
