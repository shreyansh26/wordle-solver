### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll use a word that combines several of these. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives me a broad base to work from.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are out.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. trend → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T, N, D are out.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. perky → P(x) E(✓) R(-) K(x) Y(x)
   - P, K, Y are out.
   - E is in position 2 (✓), so E is locked in at position 2.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in perky and marked “-”).

Summary of constraints:
- Letters definitely present: E (fixed at position 2), R.
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, T, N, D, P, K, Y.
- Positions ruled out:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
  – E is already fixed at position 2 (so no conflict there).

Remaining positions for R: 1, 4, 5.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 2.
- R somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, N, D, P, K, Y).

Let’s try to place R in position 4 and fill the rest with allowed letters.

Candidate: B R E E D – but D is out.
Candidate: C R E W S – S and W are allowed? S is out.
Candidate: F R E E K – K is out.
Candidate: G R E E N – N is out.
Candidate: C R E E K – K is out.
Candidate: B R E E D – D is out.
Candidate: F R E E D – D is out.
Candidate: C R E E K – K is out.
Candidate: C R E E N – N is out.
Candidate: B R E E D – D is out.
Candidate: C R E E K – K is out.
Candidate: C R E E N – N is out.
Candidate: C R E E K – K is out.

Hmm, let’s try R in position 5:
E is in position 2, R in position 5: _ E _ _ R
Candidate: B E L I R – but R is not in position 5 here.
Candidate: B E L L R – not a word.
Candidate: C E L L R – not a word.
Candidate: B E L I R – not a word.
Candidate: F E L L R – not a word.
Candidate: C E L L R – not a word.
Candidate: B E L L R – not a word.

Let’s try R in position 1:
R E _ _ _
Candidate: R E B E L – letters R, E, B, E, L. B and L are allowed. No forbidden letters. R is in position 1 (allowed), E is in position 2 (fixed). This seems valid.

REBEL:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (fixed).
- B and L are new letters.
- No forbidden letters.

This looks like the best next guess.
