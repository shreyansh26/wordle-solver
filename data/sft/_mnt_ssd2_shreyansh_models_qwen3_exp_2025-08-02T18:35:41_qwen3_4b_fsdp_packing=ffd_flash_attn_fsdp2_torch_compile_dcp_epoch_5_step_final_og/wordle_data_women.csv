### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less common consonants
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, L, T), which should give me good information about letter presence and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). 

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
2. DOES contain E, but not in position 5 (last letter).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Includes E somewhere other than the last letter.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, D, M, P, plus vowels O, I, U.  
I’ll pick a word that mixes these and places E in a different spot.

A strong candidate is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R are new common letters.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less common consonants
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, L, T), which should give me good information about letter presence and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). 

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
2. DOES contain E, but not in position 5 (last letter).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Includes E somewhere other than the last letter.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, D, M, P, plus vowels O, I, U.  
I’ll pick a word that mixes these and places E in a different spot.

A strong candidate is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R are new common letters.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

Let’s try CHORE.

Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(-) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates S, L, A, T.  
   – E is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

2. CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(-) R(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates C, H, R.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – E is still in the word but NOT in position 5 (and we now know it’s also NOT in position 4).

So far we know the secret word:
- Contains: E, O  
- Does NOT contain: S, L, A, T, C, H, R  
- E is in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
- Places E and O in still-allowed positions.  
- Uses fresh common consonants to maximize information.

Remaining common consonants: N, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try “BONEY”:
- B, N, Y are new letters.  
- E is in position 3 (still allowed).  
- O is in position 2 (still allowed).  
- Word is valid and checks all constraints.
