### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A good balance is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of the alphabet to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good next guess would be ""STEIN"":
- Uses S and E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only marked as wrong in position 4).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E was only marked as wrong in position 5).
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids A, R, O.

This should give us more information about T, I, N and confirm positions for S and E.
