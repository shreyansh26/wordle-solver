### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, K, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

I’ll pick a word that uses several of these. ""UNTIE"" would use U, N, T, I, E – but it has an S-like letter (none of the forbidden ones), and ends with E. However, ""UNTIE"" has I in position 4, which might be useful. Alternatively, ""UNITY"" is another option, but it has Y at the end, which might not be as informative.

""UNTIE"" seems good because:
- Ends with E.
- Uses U, N, T, I – none of which are forbidden.
- Common letters that can help narrow down positions.

But wait, let me double-check:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S.
- ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E – none of these are forbidden. Good.

Another option could be ""UNITY"", but ""UNTIE"" might give more positional info. I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Word ends with E, and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(-) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Word ends with E (confirmed again).  
   ⇒ T is in position 3 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  
   ⇒ U and N are not in the word.

So the pattern so far: _ _ T _ E  
Letters known NOT to appear: A, R, O, S, U, N  
Letters known to appear: I (somewhere except position 4), plus any others not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has T in position 3 and E in position 5.  
- Contains I somewhere except position 4.  
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

Possible structure: _ _ T _ E with I in position 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 2.

Let’s list possibilities:
- I _ T _ E: e.g., I C T L E → “ICTLE” (invalid, not a word).  
- _ I T _ E: e.g., B I T C E → “BITEC” (invalid), L I T T E → “LITTE” (invalid).  
- _ _ T I E: but E is fixed at position 5, so this conflicts.

Wait, position 4 cannot be I (from feedback), so I must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s think of real words fitting _ I T _ E or I _ T _ E:
- “CITIE” – not a valid word.  
- “DITHE” – not valid.  
- “FIGHT” – ends with H, not E.  
- “VITAE” – ends with E, has I in position 2, T in position 3.  
  ⇒ V I T A E – but A is forbidden.  
- “LITHE” – ends with E, has I in position 1, T in position 3.  
  ⇒ L I T H E – H is allowed, no forbidden letters.

“LITHE” fits all constraints:
- T in position 3, E in position 5.  
- I in position 1 (not forbidden).  
- Uses only allowed letters (L, I, T, H, E).  
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information.

So the next guess is LITHE.
