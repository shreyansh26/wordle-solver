### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains many vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to identify which are in the word and which are not.

The feedback from Guess 3 says “Model answer is not five letters,” so HIDE is not a valid 5-letter word for the game.  
That leaves us with:

Known facts:
- Word ends with E (from SLATE and CRIME).
- I is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3 (from CRIME) and not in position 2 (from HIDE).
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, H.

So I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
But position 5 is already E, so I is in 1 or 4.

We still need to test common consonants: N, D, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E  
- Places I in position 1 or 4  
- Uses only untested letters

Candidate:  
- I + 4 consonants + E → “INVEE” (invalid)

- “FIDGE” – 5 letters but F and D and G and H and I and E. H is eliminated.  
- “VIEVE” – 5 letters but V and I and E.  

Let’s pick the most common valid word: “PINEE” (but PINEE is uncommon).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains many vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to identify which are in the word and which are not.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓).
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- We can ignore S, L, A, T entirely.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, B, G, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

Possible candidates:
- CRIME (C, R, I, M, E) – uses common letters, ends with E, no S/L/A/T.
- PRIME (P, R, I, M, E) – similar.
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E) – good spread.
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) – but V is less common.
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E) – possible but G is less common.

""CRIME"" seems like the best choice here: common letters, good consonant cluster, and ends with E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from SLATE: E✓ and CRIME: E✓).
2. I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from CRIME: I✓ but not in 3rd).
3. Letters S, L, A, T, C, R, M are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 5 = E
- Position 3 ≠ I (but I is somewhere else)
- No S, L, A, T, C, R, M

We still need to test common consonants and vowels:
- Remaining common consonants: N, D, G, H, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining common vowels: O, U (I is already confirmed)

Let’s look for a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains I somewhere (not in 3rd)
- Uses none of the eliminated letters

Possible candidates:
- DIVE (but V is less common, and D is fine)
- DRIVE (but R is eliminated)
- GIVE (but V is less common)
- HIVE (but V is less common)
- PIVE (not a valid word)
- WIVE (not a valid word)
- NIE (too short)
- BIDE (but D is fine, E is correct, I is in 2nd)
- FIDE (not a valid word)
- GIDE (not a valid word)
- HIDE (H, I, D, E) – valid word, ends with E, has I in 2nd, uses H and D which are still possible

From the latest feedback:

- Word ends with E (from SLATE, CRIME, BINGE).  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from CRIME) and NOT in position 2 (from BINGE).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from BINGE).  
- B and G are NOT in the word (from BINGE).  
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, H, B, G.

Remaining consonants to test: D, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (I is already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I (position 1 or 4) and N (position 1, 2, 4, or 5), using only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. I in position 1:  
   I _ _ _ E  
   N must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
   - I N _ _ E → “IN _ _ E” → “INKEE” (invalid), “INVEE” (invalid).  
   - I _ N _ E → “I _ N _ E” → “I D N E E” (invalid).  
   - I _ _ N E → “I _ _ N E” → “I D D N E” (invalid).  

2. I in position 4:  
   _ _ _ I E  
   N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
   - N _ _ I E → “N _ _ I E” → “N D I E” (invalid).  
   - _ N _ I E → “_ N _ I E” → “P N D I E” (invalid).  
   - _ _ N I E → “_ _ N I E” → “D O N I E” (invalid).  

Let’s think of valid words that fit:  
- “DINGE” – invalid.  
- “WINE” – 4 letters.  
- “PINE” – 4 letters.  
- “VINE” – 4 letters.  
- “FINGE” – invalid.  
- “DINGE” – invalid.  
- “VIDGE” – invalid.  
- “WIDIE” – invalid.  
- “DUNIE” – invalid.  
- “DUNIE” – invalid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains many vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to identify which are in the word and which are not.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓).
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- We can ignore S, L, A, T entirely.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, B, G, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

Possible candidates:
- CRIME (C, R, I, M, E) – uses common letters, ends with E, no S/L/A/T.
- PRIME (P, R, I, M, E) – similar.
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E) – good spread.
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) – but V is less common.
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E) – possible but G is less common.

""CRIME"" seems like the best choice here: common letters, good consonant cluster, and ends with E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (from SLATE: E✓ and CRIME: E✓).
2. I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (from CRIME: I✓ but not in 3rd).
3. Letters S, L, A, T, C, R, M are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 5 = E
- Position 3 ≠ I (but I is somewhere else)
- No S, L, A, T, C, R, M

We still need to test common consonants and vowels:
- Remaining common consonants: N, D, G, H, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining common vowels: O, U (I is already confirmed)

Let’s look for a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains I somewhere (not in 3rd)
- Uses none of the eliminated letters

Possible candidates:
- DIVE (but V is less common, and D is fine)
- DRIVE (but R is eliminated)
- GIVE (but V is less common)
- HIVE (but V is less common)
- PIVE (not a valid word)
- WIVE (not a valid word)
- NIE (too short)
- BIDE (but D is fine, E is correct, I is in 2nd)
- FIDE (not a valid word)
- GIDE (not a valid word)
- HIDE (H, I, D, E) – valid word, ends with E, has I in 2nd, uses H and D which are still possible

""HIDE"" seems like a good next guess because:
- Ends with E (✓)
- Has I in position 2 (✓)
- Uses H and D which haven't been tested yet
- Doesn't use any eliminated letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: HIDE -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from Guess 3 says “Model answer is not five letters,” so HIDE is not a valid 5-letter word for the game.  
That leaves us with:

Known facts:
- Word ends with E (from SLATE and CRIME).
- I is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3 (from CRIME) and not in position 2 (from HIDE).
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, H.

So I must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
But position 5 is already E, so I is in 1 or 4.

We still need to test common consonants: N, D, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E  
- Places I in position 1 or 4  
- Uses only untested letters

Candidate:  
- I + 4 consonants + E → “INVEE” (invalid)  
- 1 consonant + I + 3 consonants + E → “DINKE” (invalid)  
- “PINE” is 4 letters.  
- “WINE” is 4 letters.  
- “BIDGE” (invalid).  
- “VIDE” (invalid).  
- “GIVE” is 4 letters.  
- “PIGE” (invalid).  
- “DIVE” is 4 letters.  
- “FIDGE” (invalid).  
- “NIECE” (invalid).  
- “VIEVE” (invalid).  
- “YIPE” (invalid).  

Wait—let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E, containing I, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Valid candidates:
- “NIECE” – invalid (ends with CE, not E).  
- “DINER” – R eliminated.  
- “WIDER” – R eliminated.  
- “FIDER” – R eliminated.  
- “PINED” – ends with D.  
- “WOKEN” – ends with N.  
- “GIVEN” – ends with N.  
- “DINGE” – not a word.  
- “VIDGE” – not a word.  
- “PINE” + E → “PINEE” (valid, plural of pine).  
- “DINGE” – not valid.  
- “WINE” + E → “WINEE” (valid, plural of wine).  
- “BIDGE” – not valid.  
- “VIEVE” – not valid.  
- “GIVE” + E → “GIVEE” (valid, plural of give).  
- “PIDE” – 4 letters.  
- “NIECE” – 5 letters but ends with CE.  
- “DINER” – 5 letters but R eliminated.  
- “FIDGE” – 5 letters but F and D and G and H and I and E. H is eliminated.  
- “VIEVE” – 5 letters but V and I and E.  

Let’s pick the most common valid word: “PINEE” (but PINEE is uncommon).  
Another valid word: “WINEE” (uncommon).  
Another valid word: “GIVEE” (uncommon).  
Another valid word: “DINGE” – not valid.  
Another valid word: “VIDGE” – not valid.  

Let’s try “DINGE” – invalid.  
Let’s try “NIECE” – ends with CE.  
Let’s try “DINGE” – invalid.  
Let’s try “VIEVE” – invalid.  

Actually, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words ending in E, containing I, avoiding S, L, A, T, C, R, M, H.

Valid words:
- “DINGE” – invalid.  
- “VIDGE” – invalid.  
- “PINEE” – valid.  
- “WINEE” – valid.  
- “GIVEE” – valid.  
- “DINGE” – invalid.  
- “NIECE” – ends with CE.  
- “FIDGE” – invalid (H eliminated).  
- “VIEVE” – invalid.  

The only valid common words are the plurals: PINEE, WINEE, GIVEE.  
Among these, “PINEE” is the most common.  

But let’s check if we can find a better word.  
Let’s try “DINGE” – invalid.  
Let’s try “VIDGE” – invalid.  
Let’s try “BINGE” – B, I, N, G, E.  
- B: not eliminated.  
- I: not eliminated.  
- N: not eliminated.  
- G: not eliminated.  
- E: correct.  

“BINGE” is a valid 5-letter word, ends with E, contains I (in position 2), uses only untested letters (B, N, G, I, E), and avoids all eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, C, R, M, H).

So the best next guess is “BINGE”.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. The word ends with E (from SLATE, CRIME, and BINGE).
2. I is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRIME and BINGE).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, B, G.
4. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): I, E (E is already fixed at position 5).

Therefore I must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3, 4, 5 are ruled out or E is fixed).

We still need to test common consonants that haven’t been eliminated: D, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E
- Places I in position 1 or 2
- Uses only untested letters

Candidate: “DINER” – R is eliminated.
Candidate: “FINER” – R is eliminated.
Candidate: “WIDER” – R is eliminated.
Candidate: “VINED” – doesn’t fit pattern.
Candidate: “PINED” – ends with D.
Candidate: “DINED” – ends with D.
Candidate: “WINEY” – ends with Y.
Candidate: “FIDGE” – H is eliminated.
Candidate: “DINGE” – not a word.
Candidate: “VIDGE” – not a word.
Candidate: “PINEE” – valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, uses P, N, E. But N was marked “-” in BINGE, so N could be in the word but not in position 3.

Wait, in BINGE: N was marked “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 3. So N could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so N could be in 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try “PINED” – ends with D, invalid.
Let’s try “DINED” – ends with D, invalid.
Let’s try “NIECE” – ends with CE, invalid.
Let’s try “VINEE” – valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, uses V, N, E. N was “-” in BINGE, so N could be in position 4.

“VINEE” seems valid:
- V: not eliminated
- I: in position 2 (allowed, since I is not in 2 in CRIME but was “-” in BINGE, so position 2 is possible)
- N: in position 3, but N was “-” in BINGE (position 3), so this would be invalid because N cannot be in position 3.

Wait, in BINGE N was in position 3 and marked “-”, so N cannot be in position 3. Therefore N could be in 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try “NIECE” – ends with CE, invalid.
Let’s try “PINED” – ends with D, invalid.
Let’s try “DINED” – ends with D, invalid.
Let’s try “FIED” – too short.
Let’s try “WIEDE” – not a word.
Let’s try “FIEDE” – not a word.
Let’s try “DIEVE” – not a word.
Let’s try “KIEVE” – valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, uses K, I, E. K has not been tested.

“KIEVE” seems valid:
- K: not eliminated
- I: in position 2 (possible, since I is not in 2 in CRIME but was “-” in BINGE, so position 2 is possible)
- E: correct at position 5
- V: not eliminated (but V is in position 4, which is allowed)
- E: correct at position 5

But “KIEVE” has two E’s, which is allowed.

Alternatively, “DIEVE” – not a word.
“FIEVE” – not a word.
“GIVEE” – G is eliminated.
“HIVE” – too short.
“WIVE” – too short.
“NIECE” – ends with CE.
“DINGE” – not a word.
“VIDGE” – not a word.

Another candidate: “PINEE” – valid, ends with E, has I in position 2, uses P, N, E. N could be in position 4.

“PINEE”:
- P: not eliminated
- I: in position 2 (possible)
- N: in position 3, but N was “-” in BINGE (position 3), so this would be invalid (N cannot be in position 3)

So N cannot be in position 3, so “PINEE” is invalid.

Let’s try “DIEVE” – not a word.
Let’s try “KIEVE” – valid word, ends with E, has I in position 2, uses K, I, E. V is in position 4 (allowed), and K has not been tested.

“KIEVE” seems to fit all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains I (position 2)
- Uses only untested letters (K, I, V, E)
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Therefore, the next guess is “KIEVE”.
