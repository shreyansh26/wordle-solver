For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English.

Looking at the most common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. This seems like a strong starting choice.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is R
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 5th letter is E

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ E

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and E in position 5. Also, we know to avoid C, A, N.

Let’s think of words that fit R _ _ E and don’t contain C, A, N. Some possibilities:
- BRIBE (but has B twice)
- DRIZE (not a valid word)
- FRERE (not valid)
- GRIME (valid)
- PRIZE (valid)
- TRICE (valid)

""PRIZE"" seems like a good choice because:
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ E (P R I Z E)
- Uses common letters P, I, Z
- Doesn’t reuse any eliminated letters (C, A, N)
- Has no repeats
