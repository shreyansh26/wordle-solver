### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- It contains A, E, and S (with S already placed).
- It does NOT contain R or O.

Possible candidates:
- LEASE: L, E, A, S, E → but E is in position 5 (forbidden)
- PEACH: P, E, A, C, H → no S
- CHESS: C, H, E, S, S → S is in 4th and 5th, but we don't know if double S is allowed
- LEASE: already ruled out
- FEAST: F, E, A, S, T → positions: E is in 2, A in 3, S in 4, no R/O → looks good

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 4 must be S (from arose).
2. Position 2 must be E (from feast).
3. Position 3 must be A (from feast).
4. Position 5 must be T (from feast).
5. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, F.

So the word structure is:
- 1st letter: unknown (but not R, O, F)
- 2nd letter: E
- 3rd letter: A
- 4th letter: S
- 5th letter: T

That leaves only the first letter to determine. Possible first letters (not R, O, F) and forming a valid English word:
- B → BEAST (valid)
- C → CEAST (not a word)
- D → DEAST (not a word)
- G → GEAST (not a word)

- L → LEAST (valid)
- M → MEAST (not a word)
- P → PEAST (not a word)
- S → SEAST (not a word)
- W → WEAST (not a word)

Valid options are BEAST and LEAST. Between these, BEAST is more common, so we'll try BEAST first.

If BEAST is correct, the feedback should show B in position 1 as ✓, and the rest already confirmed.
