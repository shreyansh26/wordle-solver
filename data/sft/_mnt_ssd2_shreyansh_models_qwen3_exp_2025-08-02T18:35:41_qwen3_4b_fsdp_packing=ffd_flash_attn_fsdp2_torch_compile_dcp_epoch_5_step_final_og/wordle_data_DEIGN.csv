For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers C, R, A, N, E
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - covers S, T, A, R, E

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates S, L, A, T  
   – Confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(-)  
   – Eliminates C, R, O  
   – Confirms N is in the word but NOT in position 4  
   – Confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)

Summary of what we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, N  
- E cannot be in position 5  
- N cannot be in position 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
- E is in positions 1-4  
- N is in positions 1-3 or 5  

Remaining common letters to test: I, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

A good candidate should:
- Include E and N  
- Avoid the banned letters  
- Introduce several new high-frequency letters

Let’s try “UNHIP”:
- U: new letter  
- N: confirmed letter, in position 2  
- H: new letter  
- I: new letter  
- P: new letter  

It satisfies all constraints:
- Contains E? No, but we only need to include E and N. Wait, we must include E and N. So “UNHIP” is invalid because it lacks E.

Let me pick a word that has both E and N and avoids the banned letters. How about “BEIGN”?  
But B, E, I, G, N – G and I are new, B is new, but G is less common. Maybe simpler: “BEGIN”  
- B, E, G, I, N – all new except E and N, and G is okay.  

But G is not super common. Let me pick “UNIEN” – but that’s not a valid word.

“PENNY” – but repeats N.  

“NEIGH” – but H is new, I is new, G is new, but we already have N and E.  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with E and N, avoiding S,L,A,T,C,R,O:

- “VENUE” – V, E, N, U, E – repeats E, but V and U are new.  
- “HEINE” – not a common word.  
- “MINER” – R is banned.  
- “PEINE” – not common.  
- “VENUE” seems the best among common words.

“VENUE”:
- V: new  
- E: confirmed, in position 2  
- N: confirmed, in position 3  
- U: new  
- E: repeats, but that’s acceptable as we already know E exists.

But we want to maximize new letters. Let me try “BEGUN”:
- B, E, G, U, N – all new except E and N, and G is new.  

“BEGUN” is valid, has E and N, introduces B, G, U.

So I’ll go with “BEGUN”.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers C, R, A, N, E
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - covers S, T, A, R, E

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not in the last position.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

To maximize information on the next guess, I want:
- To keep E (and move it to a different position)
- To avoid S, L, A, T entirely
- To introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet

Good letters to test now: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that includes E in a new position and introduces several fresh high-frequency letters is “CRONE”:
- C: new letter
- R: new letter
- O: new letter
- N: new letter
- E: known letter, moved to 4th position

This tests 4 new letters plus E, avoiding all the eliminated ones.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates S, L, A, T  
   – Confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(-)  
   – Eliminates C, R, O  
   – Confirms N is in the word but NOT in position 4  
   – Confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)

Summary of what we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, N  
- E cannot be in position 5  
- N cannot be in position 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O  
- E is in positions 1-4  
- N is in positions 1-3 or 5  

Remaining common letters to test: I, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

A good candidate should:
- Include E and N  
- Avoid the banned letters  
- Introduce several new high-frequency letters

Let’s try “UNHIP”:
- U: new letter  
- N: confirmed letter, in position 2  
- H: new letter  
- I: new letter  
- P: new letter  

It satisfies all constraints:
- Contains E? No, but we only need to include E and N. Wait, we must include E and N. So “UNHIP” is invalid because it lacks E.

Let me pick a word that has both E and N and avoids the banned letters. How about “BEIGN”?  
But B, E, I, G, N – G and I are new, B is new, but G is less common. Maybe simpler: “BEGIN”  
- B, E, G, I, N – all new except E and N, and G is okay.  

But G is not super common. Let me pick “UNIEN” – but that’s not a valid word.

“PENNY” – but repeats N.  

“NEIGH” – but H is new, I is new, G is new, but we already have N and E.  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with E and N, avoiding S,L,A,T,C,R,O:

- “VENUE” – V, E, N, U, E – repeats E, but V and U are new.  
- “HEINE” – not a common word.  
- “MINER” – R is banned.  
- “PEINE” – not common.  
- “VENUE” seems the best among common words.

“VENUE”:
- V: new  
- E: confirmed, in position 2  
- N: confirmed, in position 3  
- U: new  
- E: repeats, but that’s acceptable as we already know E exists.

But we want to maximize new letters. Let me try “BEGUN”:
- B, E, G, U, N – all new except E and N, and G is new.  

“BEGUN” is valid, has E and N, introduces B, G, U.

So I’ll go with “BEGUN”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates S, L, A, T  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(-)  
   – Eliminates C, R, O  
   – N is in the word, but not in position 4.

3. BEGUN → B(x) E(✓) G(-) U(x) N(✓)  
   – Eliminates B, U  
   – E is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).  
   – N is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
   – G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

Summary of constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, B, U  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E (fixed at position 2), N (fixed at position 5), G (somewhere else).  
- G cannot be in position 3.  
- We still need two more distinct letters (positions 1, 3, 4) that have not been eliminated.

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We have:
- Position 1: any unused letter  
- Position 2: E (fixed)  
- Position 3: any unused letter except G (and G can’t be here anyway)  
- Position 4: any unused letter  
- Position 5: N (fixed)

We need to place G in either position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

Let’s try G in position 1:
G _ E _ N

We need a letter for position 3 and 4 from the unused pool. Let’s pick common ones: I and D → G I E D N → “GIEDN” is not a valid word.

Swap to D and I: D I E G N → “DIEGN” invalid.

Try G in position 4:
_ E _ G N

Pick common letters for positions 1 and 3: D and I → D E I G N → “DEIGN” is a valid English word (archaic past tense of “deign”, meaning to be proud or disdainful).

Check constraints:
- Contains E (pos 2) and N (pos 5) ✓  
- Contains G (pos 4) ✓  
- G is not in position 3 ✓  
- No banned letters ✓  
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

Therefore, “DEIGN” satisfies all constraints.
