### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PRENT"" – not a valid word
- ""FRET"" – too short
- ""GREET"" – contains E in 5th (invalid)
- ""DRIER"" – contains I, R, E, R – but R is in 3rd and 5th, E in 4th – all positions allowed, no forbidden letters. This is valid.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""PRIED"" and ""DRIER"", ""PRIED"" seems most promising because it uses common letters and positions R and E in new spots.

Check ""PRIED"":
- Letters: P, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2 – but feedback said R is not in position 2 (from AROSE). So R cannot be in position 2, so ""PRIED"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- ""RENTS"" - but has S (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" - has E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""CRUEL"" - has U, C, E, L, R - all allowed positions, no A/O/S
- ""CREPT"" - has P, T, but no S, O, A
- ""TREND"" - has N, D, but E is in 5th (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" - has S (invalid)
- ""CREST"" - has S (invalid)

""CRUEL"" seems good: C, R, U, E, L - no A, O, S. R is in 3rd (not 2nd), E is in 4th (not 5th). This gives new info on C, U, L while keeping R and E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions: R, E

2. CRUEL → C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: C, U, L
   - Confirms R and E are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word contains R and E, but
  – R is not in position 2
  – E is not in position 5
- The word does NOT contain: A, O, S, C, U, L

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, I, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and E
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, C, U, L

Possible candidates:
- ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""DREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PERKY"" – contains K, Y, P – but E is in 4th (valid), R is in 3rd (valid), no forbidden letters. This seems good.
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PRENT"" – not a valid word
- ""FRET"" – too short
- ""GREET"" – contains E in 5th (invalid)
- ""DRIER"" – contains I, R, E, R – but R is in 3rd and 5th, E in 4th – all positions allowed, no forbidden letters. This is valid.
- ""PRIED"" – contains P, R, I, E, D – R in 3rd, E in 4th – both allowed, no forbidden letters.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""PRIED"" and ""DRIER"", ""PRIED"" seems most promising because it uses common letters and positions R and E in new spots.

Check ""PRIED"":
- Letters: P, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2 – but feedback said R is not in position 2 (from AROSE). So R cannot be in position 2, so ""PRIED"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""PERKY""
- Letters: P, E, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (valid, not 2)
- E is in position 2 (valid, not 5)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, C, U, L are absent)

This seems correct.

Alternative: ""DRIER"" – but R is in 2nd position (invalid), so discard.

Another: ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid).

Another: ""FRET"" – too short.

Another: ""GRIOT"" – contains O (invalid).

Another: ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid).

Another: ""BRIEF"" – contains B, R, I, E, F – R in 3rd (valid), E in 4th (valid), no forbidden letters. This is valid.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""BRIEF"", both are valid, but ""BRIEF"" uses more common letters.

""BRIEF"":
- B, R, I, E, F
- R in 3rd (valid)
- E in 4th (valid)
- No forbidden letters

This seems best.

But let me check if ""BRIEF"" is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BRIEF"".

From all feedback so far:

2. CRUEL → C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
3. BRIEF → B(x) R(-) I(x) E(-) F(x)

What we now know for certain:
- The word contains R and E (because R and E both got “-” in every guess so far).
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in positions 2, 3, and 2 again).
  ⇒ R must be in position 1 or 5.
- E is NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in positions 5, 4, and 5 again).
  ⇒ E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- The word does NOT contain: A, O, S, C, U, L, B, I, F.

Forbidden letters so far: A, O, S, C, U, L, B, I, F.

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 1 or 5
- E in position 1, 3, or 4
- No forbidden letters

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 1
   Pattern: R _ _ _ _
   E must then be in position 3 or 4
   Possible: R E _ _ _   or   R _ E _ _
   Example words:
   - R E D _ _   → REDON? No, not valid
   - R _ E D _   → R E D _ _ is invalid
   - R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _
   - R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E

Case 2: R in position 5
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ R
   E must then be in position 1, 3, or 4
   Possible: E _ _ _ R   or   _ E _ _ R   or   _ _ E _ R

Let’s look for valid English words fitting these patterns using allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1: R in position 1
   - R E D _ _   → REDON? Not valid
   - R _ E D _   → R _ E D _   → R _ E D _   → R _ E D _
   - R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _   → R _ _ E _
   - R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E   → R _ _ _ E

Looking at Case 2: R in position 5
   - E _ _ _ R   → E _ _ _ R   → E _ _ _ R   → E _ _ _ R
   - _ E _ _ R   → _ E _ _ R   → _ E _ _ R   → _ E _ _ R
   - _ _ E _ R   → _ _ E _ R   → _ _ E _ R   → _ _ E _ R

Let’s think of actual words:
- ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""DREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""TIGER"" – contains I (invalid)
- ""TREND"" – contains N and D, but E is in 5th (invalid)
- ""TOWER"" – contains O (invalid)
- ""WRECK"" – contains C (invalid)
- ""DREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- Contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and E somewhere, but R not in 2nd and E not in 5th
- Does not have A, O, or S

Good letters to include next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

Let me think of words with R and E that avoid A, O, S:
- ""RENTS"" - but has S (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" - has E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""CRUEL"" - has U, C, E, L, R - all allowed positions, no A/O/S
- ""CREPT"" - has P, T, but no S, O, A
- ""TREND"" - has N, D, but E is in 5th (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" - has S (invalid)
- ""CREST"" - has S (invalid)

""CRUEL"" seems good: C, R, U, E, L - no A, O, S. R is in 3rd (not 2nd), E is in 4th (not 5th). This gives new info on C, U, L while keeping R and E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions: R, E

2. CRUEL → C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: C, U, L
   - Confirms R and E are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word contains R and E, but
  – R is not in position 2
  – E is not in position 5
- The word does NOT contain: A, O, S, C, U, L

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, I, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and E
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, C, U, L

Possible candidates:
- ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""DREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PERKY"" – contains K, Y, P – but E is in 4th (valid), R is in 3rd (valid), no forbidden letters. This seems good.
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PRENT"" – not a valid word
- ""FRET"" – too short
- ""GREET"" – contains E in 5th (invalid)
- ""DRIER"" – contains I, R, E, R – but R is in 3rd and 5th, E in 4th – all positions allowed, no forbidden letters. This is valid.
- ""PRIED"" – contains P, R, I, E, D – R in 3rd, E in 4th – both allowed, no forbidden letters.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""PRIED"" and ""DRIER"", ""PRIED"" seems most promising because it uses common letters and positions R and E in new spots.

Check ""PRIED"":
- Letters: P, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2 – but feedback said R is not in position 2 (from AROSE). So R cannot be in position 2, so ""PRIED"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""PERKY""
- Letters: P, E, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (valid, not 2)
- E is in position 2 (valid, not 5)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, C, U, L are absent)

This seems correct.

Alternative: ""DRIER"" – but R is in 2nd position (invalid), so discard.

Another: ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid).

Another: ""FRET"" – too short.

Another: ""GRIOT"" – contains O (invalid).

Another: ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid).

Another: ""BRIEF"" – contains B, R, I, E, F – R in 3rd (valid), E in 4th (valid), no forbidden letters. This is valid.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""BRIEF"", both are valid, but ""BRIEF"" uses more common letters.

""BRIEF"":
- B, R, I, E, F
- R in 3rd (valid)
- E in 4th (valid)
- No forbidden letters

This seems best.

But let me check if ""BRIEF"" is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BRIEF"".

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, C, F, I, L, O, S, U
- Letters definitely IN the word: R and E
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y

Possible positions for R and E:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try to construct a word that fits these constraints.

Option: “TREND”
- T, R, E, N, D
- R is in position 2 → invalid (R cannot be in 2)

Option: “TIGER”
- T, I, G, E, R
- I is ruled out → invalid

Option: “PERKY”
- P, E, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (valid)
- E is in position 2 (valid)
- No ruled-out letters → valid

Another option: “DRENT” (not a valid word)
Another option: “TREND” already ruled out
Another option: “PRENT” (not a valid word)

“PERKY” seems valid:
- P, E, R, K, Y
- R in position 3 (allowed)

- No forbidden letters

Therefore, “PERKY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- Contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and E somewhere, but R not in 2nd and E not in 5th
- Does not have A, O, or S

Good letters to include next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

Let me think of words with R and E that avoid A, O, S:
- ""RENTS"" - but has S (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" - has E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""CRUEL"" - has U, C, E, L, R - all allowed positions, no A/O/S
- ""CREPT"" - has P, T, but no S, O, A
- ""TREND"" - has N, D, but E is in 5th (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" - has A (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" - has S (invalid)
- ""CREST"" - has S (invalid)

""CRUEL"" seems good: C, R, U, E, L - no A, O, S. R is in 3rd (not 2nd), E is in 4th (not 5th). This gives new info on C, U, L while keeping R and E.

Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions: R, E

2. CRUEL → C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(x)
   - Additional letters NOT in the word: C, U, L
   - Confirms R and E are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

So far we know:
- The word contains R and E, but
  – R is not in position 2
  – E is not in position 5
- The word does NOT contain: A, O, S, C, U, L

Remaining common letters to try: T, N, I, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and E
- R not in position 2
- E not in position 5
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, C, U, L

Possible candidates:
- ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""ENTRY"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""FRESH"" – contains S (invalid)
- ""BREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""DREAD"" – contains A (invalid)
- ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PERKY"" – contains K, Y, P – but E is in 4th (valid), R is in 3rd (valid), no forbidden letters. This seems good.
- ""TREND"" – E in 5th (invalid)
- ""PRENT"" – not a valid word
- ""FRET"" – too short
- ""GREET"" – contains E in 5th (invalid)
- ""DRIER"" – contains I, R, E, R – but R is in 3rd and 5th, E in 4th – all positions allowed, no forbidden letters. This is valid.
- ""PRIED"" – contains P, R, I, E, D – R in 3rd, E in 4th – both allowed, no forbidden letters.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""PRIED"" and ""DRIER"", ""PRIED"" seems most promising because it uses common letters and positions R and E in new spots.

Check ""PRIED"":
- Letters: P, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2 – but feedback said R is not in position 2 (from AROSE). So R cannot be in position 2, so ""PRIED"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""PERKY""
- Letters: P, E, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (valid, not 2)
- E is in position 2 (valid, not 5)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, C, U, L are absent)

This seems correct.

Alternative: ""DRIER"" – but R is in 2nd position (invalid), so discard.

Another: ""TIGER"" – E in 5th (invalid).

Another: ""FRET"" – too short.

Another: ""GRIOT"" – contains O (invalid).

Another: ""TREAD"" – contains A (invalid).

Another: ""BRIEF"" – contains B, R, I, E, F – R in 3rd (valid), E in 4th (valid), no forbidden letters. This is valid.

Between ""PERKY"" and ""BRIEF"", both are valid, but ""BRIEF"" uses more common letters.

""BRIEF"":
- B, R, I, E, F
- R in 3rd (valid)
- E in 4th (valid)
- No forbidden letters

This seems best.

But let me check if ""BRIEF"" is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BRIEF"".

From the new feedback on PERKY:

P(x)  → P is not in the word  
E(✓)  → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 3  
K(x)  → K is not in the word  
Y(✓)  → Y is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)

So now we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ E _ _ Y
- Contains R somewhere, but R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback and new info)
  – From AROSE: R not in position 2  
  – From CRUEL: R not in position 2 again (same info)  
  – From BRIEF: R not in position 2 again (same info)  
  – From PERKY: R not in position 3  
  – R cannot be in position 5 because position 5 is Y (already fixed)
- Therefore R must be in position 1 or 4
- Forbidden letters so far: A, B, C, F, I, K, L, O, P, S, U
- Remaining common letters: D, G, H, M, N, T, V, W, Z

Possible patterns:
1. R E _ _ Y  (R in position 1)
2. _ E _ R Y  (R in position 4)

Let’s list valid words for each pattern:

Pattern 1: R E _ _ Y
- R E D D Y  (invalid, double D and not a word)
- R E M Y Y  (invalid)
- R E N E Y  (invalid)
- R E V E Y  (invalid)
- R E N D Y  (invalid)
- R E N N Y  (invalid)
- R E N T Y  (invalid)
- R E V Y Y  (invalid)
- R E N D Y  (invalid)
- R E N E Y  (invalid)
- R E N T Y  (invalid)
- R E V Y Y  (invalid)
- R E N D Y  (invalid)
- R E N E Y  (invalid)
- R E N T Y  (invalid)
- R E V Y Y  (invalid)

Pattern 2: _ E _ R Y
- D E N R Y  (invalid)
- G E N R Y  (invalid)
- H E N R Y  (invalid)
- M E N R Y  (invalid)
- N E N R Y  (invalid)
- T E N R Y  (invalid)
- V E N R Y  (invalid)
- W E N R Y  (invalid)

Wait, let’s think of actual English words that fit _ E _ R Y or R E _ _ Y.

Looking at _ E _ R Y:
- G E N R Y  → “genry” (not a word)
- H E N R Y  → “henry” (valid word)
- M E N R Y  → “menry” (not a word)
- T E N R Y  → “tenry” (not a word)
- V E N R Y  → “venry” (not a word)

Looking at R E _ _ Y:
- R E N E Y  → “ren ey” (not a word)
- R E N D Y  → “rendy” (not a word)
- R E N T Y  → “renty” (not a word)
- R E V E Y  → “rev ey” (not a word)
- R E V Y Y  → invalid
- R E N N Y  → “renny” (not a word)
- R E N E Y  → invalid

But “HENRY” fits _ E _ R Y:
- H E N R Y
- Letters: H, E, N, R, Y
- Check constraints:
  – Contains E in position 2 (✓)
  – Contains Y in position 5 (✓)
  – Contains R in position 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2,3,5 and 1 is open)
  – All letters are allowed (H, N not ruled out)

Therefore, HENRY is a valid next guess.
