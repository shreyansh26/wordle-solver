For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.

So the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S  
We still need to determine the first and second letters, and the fourth letter.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep the known O and E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid A, R, S in any position.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- O and E are already fixed, so this keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
- However, “POINT” has only 4 letters, so it’s invalid (needs to be 5 letters).

Let’s try “VOICE”:
- V, O, I, C, E  
- O is in position 3 (good), E in position 5 (good).  
- V, I, C are new letters.  
- This fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Another good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, O, I, N, G  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but “DOING” ends in G, not E, so this doesn’t fit).

Let’s try “MOIST”:
- M, O, I, S, T  
- S is already ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“COVEY”:
- C, O, V, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is in position 4 here, so this is bad).

“FOLEY”:
- F, O, L, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“HOIST”:
- H, O, I, S, T  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“JOINT”:
- J, O, I, N, T  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is missing), so this is bad.

“LOVER”:
- L, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“MOVER”:
- M, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“NOISE”:
- N, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“POISE”:
- P, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“VOICE” seems the best among these:  
- C, O, V, I, E  
- O in position 3, E in position 5.  
- C, V, I are new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ O _ E
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S
   - O and E are locked in positions 3 and 5.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5 (✓).
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
     This contradicts the first feedback where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
     Wait—let me re-read carefully: the second feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position.  
     But the first feedback already said O(✓) in position 3.  
     This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
     Assuming the second feedback is correct, the only resolution is that O is NOT in position 3, which would contradict the first feedback.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.

So the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S  
We still need to determine the first and second letters, and the fourth letter.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep the known O and E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid A, R, S in any position.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- O and E are already fixed, so this keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
- However, “POINT” has only 4 letters, so it’s invalid (needs to be 5 letters).

Let’s try “VOICE”:
- V, O, I, C, E  
- O is in position 3 (good), E in position 5 (good).  
- V, I, C are new letters.  
- This fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Another good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, O, I, N, G  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but “DOING” ends in G, not E, so this doesn’t fit).

Let’s try “MOIST”:
- M, O, I, S, T  
- S is already ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“COVEY”:
- C, O, V, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is in position 4 here, so this is bad).

“FOLEY”:
- F, O, L, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“HOIST”:
- H, O, I, S, T  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“JOINT”:
- J, O, I, N, T  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is missing), so this is bad.

“LOVER”:
- L, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“MOVER”:
- M, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“NOISE”:
- N, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“POISE”:
- P, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“VOICE” seems the best among these:  
- C, O, V, I, E  
- O in position 3, E in position 5.  
- C, V, I are new letters.  

Let’s go with “VOICE”.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S  
We still need to determine the first and second letters, and the fourth letter.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep the known O and E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid A, R, S in any position.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- O and E are already fixed, so this keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
- However, “POINT” has only 4 letters, so it’s invalid (needs to be 5 letters).

Let’s try “VOICE”:
- V, O, I, C, E  
- O is in position 3 (good), E in position 5 (good).  
- V, I, C are new letters.  
- This fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Another good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, O, I, N, G  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but “DOING” ends in G, not E, so this doesn’t fit).

Let’s try “MOIST”:
- M, O, I, S, T  
- S is already ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“COVEY”:
- C, O, V, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is in position 4 here, so this is bad).

“FOLEY”:
- F, O, L, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“HOIST”:
- H, O, I, S, T  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“JOINT”:
- J, O, I, N, T  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is missing), so this is bad.

“LOVER”:
- L, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“MOVER”:
- M, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“NOISE”:
- N, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“POISE”:
- P, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“VOICE” seems the best among these:  
- C, O, V, I, E  
- O in position 3, E in position 5.  
- C, V, I are new letters.  

Let’s go with “VOICE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: voice -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ O _ E
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S
   - O and E are locked in positions 3 and 5.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5 (✓).
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
     This contradicts the first feedback where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
     Wait—let me re-read carefully: the second feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position.  
     But the first feedback already said O(✓) in position 3.  
     This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
     Assuming the second feedback is correct, the only resolution is that O is NOT in position 3, which would contradict the first feedback.  
     Therefore, the second feedback must be interpreted as O being in the word but NOT in position 3, implying the first feedback’s O(✓) was actually a typo and O is NOT in position 3.  
     Re-evaluating: the secret word does NOT contain O, and E is in position 5.  
     The letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, C.  
     Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
     We still need to determine positions 1-4.

   - Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
   - Remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out).

   Good candidate letters: T, N, L, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.

   Let’s try a word that uses new common letters and ends in E.  
   “UNTIE” – but I is ruled out.  
   “PLUME” – uses P, L, U, M, E.  
   - P, L, U, M are new letters.  
   - Ends in E (position 5).  
   - No ruled-out letters used.

   Therefore, “PLUME” is a strong next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3).  
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5).  
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - This directly contradicts the first feedback (O(✓) in position 3).  
   - The only way both can be true is if the second feedback’s O(-) was intended to mean “O is in the word but not in position 3,” which would invalidate the first interpretation.  
   - Therefore, the correct interpretation is:  
     – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
     – E is correct in position 5.  
     – Additional letters ruled out: V, I, C.

3. plume → P(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - Letters ruled out: P, L, U, M.

Current state:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  (E is fixed in position 5)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, P, L, U, M.
- Remaining common letters: T, N, D, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4) and uses none of the ruled-out letters.

Possible candidates:
- BONED (but N and D are allowed, B is allowed; however O is in position 2, which is allowed)
- FROZE (but R is ruled out)
- GONER (but R is ruled out)
- HONEY (but H, N, Y are allowed, but O is in position 2)
- DONNE (but N is repeated and allowed)
- TONER (but R is ruled out)
- WONDER (but R is ruled out and it’s 6 letters)
- HONED (H, N, D allowed, O in position 2)

Best choice: HONED
- H, N, D are not yet ruled out.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O must be in the word but not in position 3).
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).

Therefore, HONED is a valid next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.

So the word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S  
We still need to determine the first and second letters, and the fourth letter.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep the known O and E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid A, R, S in any position.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out).

Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- O and E are already fixed, so this keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.  
- P, I, N, T are all new letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
- However, “POINT” has only 4 letters, so it’s invalid (needs to be 5 letters).

Let’s try “VOICE”:
- V, O, I, C, E  
- O is in position 3 (good), E in position 5 (good).  
- V, I, C are new letters.  
- This fits the pattern _ _ O _ E.

Another good candidate is “DOING”:
- D, O, I, N, G  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but “DOING” ends in G, not E, so this doesn’t fit).

Let’s try “MOIST”:
- M, O, I, S, T  
- S is already ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“COVEY”:
- C, O, V, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is in position 4 here, so this is bad).

“FOLEY”:
- F, O, L, E, Y  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“GOLEM”:
- G, O, L, E, M  
- O in position 3, E in position 4 (but E needs to be in position 5), so this is bad.

“HOIST”:
- H, O, I, S, T  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“JOINT”:
- J, O, I, N, T  
- O in position 3, E in position 5 (but E is missing), so this is bad.

“LOVER”:
- L, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“MOVER”:
- M, O, V, E, R  
- R is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“NOISE”:
- N, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“POISE”:
- P, O, I, S, E  
- S is ruled out (x), so this is bad.

“VOICE” seems the best among these:  
- C, O, V, I, E  
- O in position 3, E in position 5.  
- C, V, I are new letters.  

Let’s go with “VOICE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: voice -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern so far: _ _ O _ E
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S
   - O and E are locked in positions 3 and 5.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5 (✓).
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
     This contradicts the first feedback where O was marked ✓ in position 3.  
     Wait—let me re-read carefully: the second feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position.  
     But the first feedback already said O(✓) in position 3.  
     This is impossible unless the feedback was mis-typed.  
     Assuming the second feedback is correct, the only resolution is that O is NOT in position 3, which would contradict the first feedback.  
     Therefore, the second feedback must be interpreted as O being in the word but NOT in position 3, implying the first feedback’s O(✓) was actually a typo and O is NOT in position 3.  
     Re-evaluating: the secret word does NOT contain O, and E is in position 5.  
     The letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, C.  
     Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
     We still need to determine positions 1-4.

   - Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
   - Remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out).

   Good candidate letters: T, N, L, D, M, P, U, G, H, etc.

   Let’s try a word that uses new common letters and ends in E.  
   “UNTIE” – but I is ruled out.  
   “PLUME” – uses P, L, U, M, E.  
   - P, L, U, M are new letters.  
   - Ends in E (position 5).  
   - No ruled-out letters used.

   Therefore, “PLUME” is a strong next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3).  
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5).  
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - This directly contradicts the first feedback (O(✓) in position 3).  
   - The only way both can be true is if the second feedback’s O(-) was intended to mean “O is in the word but not in position 3,” which would invalidate the first interpretation.  
   - Therefore, the correct interpretation is:  
     – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
     – E is correct in position 5.  
     – Additional letters ruled out: V, I, C.

3. plume → P(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - Letters ruled out: P, L, U, M.

Current state:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  (E is fixed in position 5)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, P, L, U, M.
- Remaining common letters: T, N, D, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4) and uses none of the ruled-out letters.

Possible candidates:
- BONED (but N and D are allowed, B is allowed; however O is in position 2, which is allowed)
- FROZE (but R is ruled out)
- GONER (but R is ruled out)
- HONEY (but H, N, Y are allowed, but O is in position 2)
- DONNE (but N is repeated and allowed)
- TONER (but R is ruled out)
- WONDER (but R is ruled out and it’s 6 letters)
- HONED (H, N, D allowed, O in position 2)

Best choice: HONED
- H, N, D are not yet ruled out.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O must be in the word but not in position 3).
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).

Therefore, HONED is a valid next guess.

Let’s carefully re-examine all the feedback so far.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (3).  
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (5).  
   - Letters ruled out: A, R, S.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - This contradicts the first feedback.  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the second feedback’s “O(-)” was intended to mean “O is in the word but not in position 3,” which invalidates the first feedback’s O(✓).  
   - Therefore, the correct state is:  
     – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
     – E is correct in position 5.  
     – Additional letters ruled out: V, I, C.

3. plume → P(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) E(✓)  
   - E is still correct in position 5.  
   - Letters ruled out: P, L, U, M.

4. honed → H(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)  
   - E is in position 5, but feedback shows E(-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   - This contradicts the earlier E(✓).  
   - The only resolution is that the feedback for E in honed was a typo and should have been E(✓).  
   - Therefore, E is fixed in position 5, and the feedback for honed should be interpreted as:  
     – H(x), O(-), N(-), E(✓), D(x).  
   - Additional letters ruled out: H, D.

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, P, L, U, M, H, D.

Remaining common letters: T, N, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (positions 1, 2, or 4) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BONED → B, O, N, E, D → D is ruled out  
- FROZE → R is ruled out  
- GONER → R is ruled out  
- HONEY → H is ruled out  
- DONNE → N is repeated but D is ruled out  
- WONDER → R is ruled out and 6 letters  
- TONER → R is ruled out  
- BOGIE → I is ruled out  
- NOBLE → B, N, L, E → L is ruled out  
- GONIE → I is ruled out  
- BONEY → N is allowed, but Y is allowed: B, O, N, E, Y → N is allowed (only once), Y is allowed.  
- FOGIE → I is ruled out  
- GONIE → I is ruled out  
- TONEY → T, O, N, E, Y → T, N, Y are allowed; O is in position 2 (allowed since O not in 3).

Best candidate: TONEY  
- T, N, Y are not yet ruled out.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).

Therefore, TONEY is a valid next guess.

Let’s carefully re-examine every line of feedback so far.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   - O is in position 3 and correct.  
   - E is in position 5 and correct.  
   - Ruled out: A, R, S.

2. voice → V(x) O(-) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
   - E is correct in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Ruled out: V, I, C.

3. plume → P(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) E(✓)  
   - E is correct in position 5.  
   - Ruled out: P, L, U, M.

4. honed → H(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)  
   - E is in position 5 but feedback shows E(-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   - This contradicts the earlier E(✓).  
   - The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for E in honed was a typo and should have been E(✓).  
   - Therefore, the feedback for honed is:  
     – H(x), O(-), N(-), E(✓), D(x).  
   - Ruled out: H, D.

5. toney → T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) Y(x)  
   - E is in position 5 but feedback shows E(-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   - Again, this contradicts the earlier E(✓).  
   - Therefore, the feedback for toney must have been intended as:  
     – T(x), O(-), N(-), E(✓), Y(x).  
   - Ruled out: T, Y.

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, P, L, U, M, H, D, T, Y.

Remaining common letters: N, G, B, F, K, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (positions 1, 2, or 4) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BONED → D is ruled out  
- FROZE → R is ruled out  
- GONER → R is ruled out  
- HONEY → H is ruled out  
- DONNE → D is ruled out  
- WONDER → R is ruled out and 6 letters  
- BONEY → N is allowed, Y is ruled out  
- GONIE → I is ruled out  
- FOGIE → I is ruled out  
- BONIE → I is ruled out  
- FOGUE → U is ruled out  
- GONNE → N is allowed, but double N  
- BONNE → N is allowed, but double N  

Best candidate: GONNE  
- G, O, N, N, E → G, N, O, E are all allowed.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O not in 3).  
- Ends with E (position 5 correct).

Therefore, GONNE is a valid next guess.
