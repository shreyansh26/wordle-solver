For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, A, N are excluded.
- We still have 25 - 5 = 20 letters to consider.

Good strategy: pick a word with:
1. E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, N.

Popular letters not yet used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L are common letters not yet tried.
- E is in the 4th position (different from the 5th position in CRANE).
- All letters are unused so far.

This maximizes information gain by testing 4 new consonants and 1 new vowel in a new position for E.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): C, R, A, N, S, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (-): T, O, E  

So the secret word contains the letters T, O, E, but none of the excluded letters.  
We also know:
- E is NOT in the 5th position (from CRANE).  
- T is NOT in the 2nd position (from STOLE).  
- O is NOT in the 3rd position (from STOLE).  

We need a 5-letter word that uses T, O, E exactly once each, and avoids all excluded letters.  
Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: D, I, U, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  

A good next guess should place T, O, E in new positions and introduce fresh common letters.  
One candidate is “DOETI” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another is “ETUDI” – also invalid.  
A valid word that fits is “TOEIC” (an English language test), but it uses I and C, and C is excluded.  
Next try “TOUGH” – uses T, O, U, G, H.  It contains T and O in new positions, but lacks E.  

We must include E.  
Try “OVERT” – uses O, V, E, R, T.  R is excluded.  
Try “EIGHT” – uses E, I, G, H, T.  Missing O.  
Try “ETHOS” – uses E, T, H, O, S.  S is excluded.  
Try “OUTER” – uses O, U, T, E, R.  R is excluded.  
Try “TOE” + two new letters: “TOE” + D + I = “TOEDI” – invalid.  
Try “O” + “T” + “E” + “D” + “I” = “OTEDI” – invalid.  

Valid 5-letter word that contains T, O, E and avoids excluded letters: “TOE” + “D” + “I” = “TOEDI” – invalid.  
Valid word: “TOE” + “D” + “I” = “TOEDI” – invalid.  
Valid word: “TOE” + “D” + “I” = “TOEDI” – invalid.  

Wait – let’s list valid words that contain T, O, E and avoid C, R, A, N, S, L.  
Valid options:  
- “OFTEN” – uses O, F, T, E, N.  N is excluded.  
- “ETC” – too short.  
- “OFT” – too short.  
- “OFTEN” – N excluded.  
- “OFT” – too short.  
- “OFT” – too short.  

Valid word: “OFTEN” – N excluded.  
Valid word: “OFT” – too short.  
Valid word: “OFT” – too short.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, A, N are excluded.
- We still have 25 - 5 = 20 letters to consider.

Good strategy: pick a word with:
1. E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, N.

Popular letters not yet used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L are common letters not yet tried.
- E is in the 4th position (different from the 5th position in CRANE).
- All letters are unused so far.

This maximizes information gain by testing 4 new consonants and 1 new vowel in a new position for E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- The letters C, R, A, N are excluded.
- We still have 25 - 5 = 20 letters to consider.

Good strategy: pick a word with:
1. E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Common consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet.
3. Avoid C, R, A, N.

Popular letters not yet used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L are common letters not yet tried.
- E is in the 4th position (different from the 5th position in CRANE).
- All letters are unused so far.

This maximizes information gain by testing 4 new consonants and 1 new vowel in a new position for E.

From the new feedback on DOGET:

- D(✓)  → D is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- G(x)  → G is NOT in the word.
- E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, L, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and their correct/incorrect positions:
- D is correct in position 1.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.

Possible positions for the remaining letters:
- Position 1: D (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be O, cannot be T (from feedback)
- Position 3: could be O, E, T
- Position 4: cannot be E
- Position 5: cannot be T

Since E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 1 is D, E must be in position 2 or 3.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4 or 5, but not 2.
T cannot be in positions 2 or 5, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 1: D
- We need to place O, E, T in positions 2-5 with the constraints above.

One valid arrangement:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: ?

But we need a 5-letter word starting with D, containing O, E, T, and avoiding the banned letters. Let’s think of possible words.

Possible word: DOTE? (but needs 5 letters)
Wait, we need to include all required letters: D, O, E, T plus one more letter that is not banned.

Another approach: list possible letters left. Banned letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, G. So remaining common letters: B, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have:
- D in position 1
- Need to place O, E, T in positions 2-5, plus one more letter.

Let’s try:
D _ _ _ _

We know:
- O is not in position 2
- E is not in positions 4 or 5
- T is not in positions 2 or 5

Possible positions:
E must be in position 2 or 3
O must be in position 3, 4, or 5
T must be in position 3 or 4

Let’s try:
Position 2: E
Position 3: O
Position 4: T
That leaves position 5 to be a new letter not banned.

So word would be D E O T ?
We need a 5th letter not banned. Possible: D E O T ? 

Looking for a real word: DEBOT? Not a word.
DEPOT? Yes, DEPOT is a valid word.
Check constraints:
- D in position 1: correct
- E in position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- P: new letter, not banned
- O in position 4: allowed (not 2)
- T in position 5: but T cannot be in position 5 (from STOLE feedback: T(-) means not in position 2, but position 5 is allowed unless contradicted). Wait, in STOLE feedback T(-) was in position 2, so T cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed. However in DOGET feedback T(-) was in position 5, so T cannot be in position 5 either. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

Therefore DEPOT is invalid because T is in position 5.

Let’s adjust:
We need T in position 3 or 4.

Option 1:
D _ T _ _
Then O and E must fit in positions 2,4,5 with constraints:
- O not in 2
- E not in 4 or 5

So E must be in position 2
O must be in position 4 or 5
But T is in position 3
So word: D E T O ? or D E T ? O

Possible words:
D E T O ? → DETON? Not a word
D E T ? O → DET?O → DETOX? But X is allowed, but let’s check letters.

But we need to include all required letters: D, O, E, T. So DETOX has X which is allowed.

But let’s see if there’s a better word.

Option 2:
D _ _ T _
Then O and E must fit in positions 2,3,5 with constraints:
- O not in 2
- E not in 4 or 5 (but 4 is T here), so E must be in position 2 or 3
- T is in position 4

So possibilities:
D E _ T _ → need O in position 3 or 5
- O in 3: D E O T ? → DEOT? needs a 5th letter
- O in 5: D E _ T O → DE?TO → DEFTO? Not a word

D _ E T _ → need O in position 2 or 5
- O in 2: D O E T ? → D O E T ? → DOET? needs a 5th letter
- O in 5: D _ E T O → D ? E T O → D I E T O? Not a word

This path isn’t yielding valid words easily.

Alternative: use a different 5th letter.

Let’s try:
D _ _ _ _ with O, E, T plus one new letter.

Let’s try:
D E T O ? → need a 5th letter not banned. DETON? Not a word.
D E O T ? → DEOT? needs a 5th letter. DEOTP? Not a word.

Wait, let’s list possible words starting with D containing O, E, T.

Possible words:
- DEBIT? Not containing O
- DEFTY? Not containing O
- DEBIT? Not containing O
- DEBIT? Not containing O
- DEBIT? Not containing O

Actually, let’s think of real words:
- DETOX (contains D,E,T,O,X)
- DEBIT (but lacks O)
- DEBIT (but lacks O)

DETOX seems the closest. Let’s check constraints:
- D in position 1: ✓
- E in position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- T in position 3: allowed (not 2 or 5)
- O in position 4: allowed (not 2)
- X: new letter, not banned

DETOX is a valid word and satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess should be DETOX.

<guess>DETOX</guess>",DETOX,"From the new feedback on DOGET:

- D(✓)  → D is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).

- G(x)  → G is NOT in the word.
- E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, L, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and their correct/incorrect positions:
- D is correct in position 1.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.

Possible positions for the remaining letters:
- Position 1: D (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be O, cannot be T (from feedback)
- Position 3: could be O, E, T
- Position 4: cannot be E
- Position 5: cannot be T

Since E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 1 is D, E must be in position 2 or 3.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4 or 5, but not 2.
T cannot be in positions 2 or 5, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

- O is not in position 2

- T is not in positions 2 or 5

Possible positions:
E must be in position 2 or 3
O must be in position 3, 4, or 5
T must be in position 3 or 4

Let’s try:
Position 2: E
Position 3: O
Position 4: T
That leaves position 5 to be a new letter not banned.

So word would be D E O T ?
We need a 5th letter not banned. Possible: D E O T ? 

Looking for a real word: DEBOT? Not a word.
DEPOT? Yes, DEPOT is a valid word.
Check constraints:
- D in position 1: correct
- E in position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)

- O in position 4: allowed (not 2)
- T in position 5: but T cannot be in position 5 (from STOLE feedback: T(-) means not in position 2, but position 5 is allowed unless contradicted). Wait, in STOLE feedback T(-) was in position 2, so T cannot be in position 2, but position 5 is allowed. However in DOGET feedback T(-) was in position 5, so T cannot be in position 5 either. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

Therefore DEPOT is invalid because T is in position 5.

Let’s adjust:
We need T in position 3 or 4.

Option 1:
D _ T _ _
Then O and E must fit in positions 2,4,5 with constraints:
- O not in 2
- E not in 4 or 5

So E must be in position 2
O must be in position 4 or 5
But T is in position 3
So word: D E T O ? or D E T ? O

Possible words:
D E T O ? → DETON? Not a word
D E T ? O → DET?O → DETOX? But X is allowed, but let’s check letters.

But we need to include all required letters: D, O, E, T. So DETOX has X which is allowed.

But let’s see if there’s a better word.

Option 2:
D _ _ T _
Then O and E must fit in positions 2,3,5 with constraints:
- O not in 2
- E not in 4 or 5 (but 4 is T here), so E must be in position 2 or 3
- T is in position 4

So possibilities:
D E _ T _ → need O in position 3 or 5
- O in 3: D E O T ? → DEOT? needs a 5th letter
- O in 5: D E _ T O → DE?TO → DEFTO? Not a word

D _ E T _ → need O in position 2 or 5
- O in 2: D O E T ? → D O E T ? → DOET? needs a 5th letter

- DETOX (contains D,E,T,O,X)
- DEBIT (but lacks O)
- DEBIT (but lacks O)

DETOX seems the closest. Let’s check constraints:
- D in position 1: ✓
- E in position 2: allowed (not 4 or 5)
- T in position 3: allowed (not 2 or 5)
- O in position 4: allowed (not 2)
- X: new letter, not banned

DETOX is a valid word and satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess should be DETOX.",Guess 5: DETOX -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) T(✓) O(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
