For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common consonants and vowels.

- RODIO (O, D, I, O – but has O twice, and D is ok)
- ROUGE (U, G, E – but E is out)

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2 in ROILS and marked “-”, so O is not in position 2).
- I and L and S are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R (from CRANE feedback), but R is not in position 1 (from ROILS feedback). This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted carefully. Wait, no: CRANE feedback said R is in the correct position (position 2), but ROILS feedback says R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 in ROILS). This means R must be in position 2, because in CRANE it was in position 2 and marked ✓, and in ROILS it was in position 1 and marked -, so R is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- Position 1: C is not in the word.
- Position 2: R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is in position 2).
- Positions 3,4,5: A, N, E are not in the word.

ROILS: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)

- Position 2: O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S are not in the word.

So the word has:
- R in position 2.
- O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, I, L, S.
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, Y, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2.
- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5).
- No C, A, N, E, I, L, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ R _ _ _ (with R fixed in position 2)
- O must appear once, and can be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Let’s brainstorm words fitting _ R _ _ _ with no forbidden letters and including O.

Examples:
- BROOK (but O appears twice, and we don’t know if O is allowed twice – but we don’t have info against it)
- DROOP (but P is allowed, O appears twice)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all letters allowed)
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P – O appears twice)
- GROAN (but A is forbidden)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N – N is forbidden)
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E – E is forbidden)
- FROST (S is forbidden)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – all allowed)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all allowed)

PROUD seems like a good candidate:
- P (allowed)
- R (correct position 2)
- O (must appear, and not in position 2)
- U (allowed)
- D (allowed)

Let’s verify:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

- ROILS (I, L, S – but O is a vowel, and we haven’t ruled out O yet)

Actually, O is still allowed because the feedback only ruled out A, E. So ROILS is valid:
R (✓), O, I, L, S – none of C, A, N, E appear.

Another option is RHYME but E is out. So ROILS seems good.

Let’s go with ROILS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROILS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROILS:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 in ROILS and marked “-”, so R is not in position 1).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2 in ROILS and marked “-”, so O is not in position 2).
- I and L and S are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R (from CRANE feedback), but R is not in position 1 (from ROILS feedback). This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted carefully. Wait, no: CRANE feedback said R is in the correct position (position 2), but ROILS feedback says R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 in ROILS). This means R must be in position 2, because in CRANE it was in position 2 and marked ✓, and in ROILS it was in position 1 and marked -, so R is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- Position 1: C is not in the word.
- Position 2: R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is in position 2).
- Positions 3,4,5: A, N, E are not in the word.

ROILS: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)
This means:
- Position 1: R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which matches CRANE feedback).
- Position 2: O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S are not in the word.

So the word has:
- R in position 2.
- O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, I, L, S.
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, Y, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2.
- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5).
- No C, A, N, E, I, L, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ R _ _ _ (with R fixed in position 2)
- O must appear once, and can be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Let’s brainstorm words fitting _ R _ _ _ with no forbidden letters and including O.

Examples:
- BROOK (but O appears twice, and we don’t know if O is allowed twice – but we don’t have info against it)
- DROOP (but P is allowed, O appears twice)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all letters allowed)
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P – O appears twice)
- GROAN (but A is forbidden)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N – N is forbidden)
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E – E is forbidden)
- FROST (S is forbidden)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – all allowed)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all allowed)

PROUD seems like a good candidate:
- P (allowed)
- R (correct position 2)
- O (must appear, and not in position 2)
- U (allowed)
- D (allowed)

Let’s verify:
Letters used: P, R, O, U, D – none of the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E, I, L, S) appear. O is in position 3 (not position 2), which fits the feedback.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the word starts with R
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. First letter is R
2. No C, A, N, E appear anywhere else in the word

We need a 5-letter word starting with R that doesn’t contain C, A, N, or E.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let’s look for words starting with R that use only these letters. Some options:
- ROBIN (but has B and N, and N is out)
- RODIO (O, D, I, O – but has O twice, and D is ok)
- ROUGE (U, G, E – but E is out)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common consonants and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (✓) – so the word starts with R
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. First letter is R
2. No C, A, N, E appear anywhere else in the word

We need a 5-letter word starting with R that doesn’t contain C, A, N, or E.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let’s look for words starting with R that use only these letters. Some options:
- ROBIN (but has B and N, and N is out)
- RODIO (O, D, I, O – but has O twice, and D is ok)
- ROUGE (U, G, E – but E is out)
- RHYME (H, Y, M, E – but E is out)
- RATIO (T, I, O – but A is out)
- ROILS (I, L, S – but O is a vowel, and we haven’t ruled out O yet)

Actually, O is still allowed because the feedback only ruled out A, E. So ROILS is valid:
R (✓), O, I, L, S – none of C, A, N, E appear.

Another option is RHYME but E is out. So ROILS seems good.

Let’s go with ROILS.

<guess>ROILS</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROILS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROILS:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 in ROILS and marked “-”, so R is not in position 1).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2 in ROILS and marked “-”, so O is not in position 2).
- I and L and S are not in the word at all (x).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R (from CRANE feedback), but R is not in position 1 (from ROILS feedback). This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted carefully. Wait, no: CRANE feedback said R is in the correct position (position 2), but ROILS feedback says R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 in ROILS). This means R must be in position 2, because in CRANE it was in position 2 and marked ✓, and in ROILS it was in position 1 and marked -, so R is in position 2.

Wait, let me re-express:

CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- Position 1: C is not in the word.
- Position 2: R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is in position 2).
- Positions 3,4,5: A, N, E are not in the word.

ROILS: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)
This means:
- Position 1: R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which matches CRANE feedback).
- Position 2: O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S are not in the word.

So the word has:
- R in position 2.
- O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, I, L, S.
- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, Y, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2.
- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5).
- No C, A, N, E, I, L, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ R _ _ _ (with R fixed in position 2)
- O must appear once, and can be in positions 1,3,4,5.

Let’s brainstorm words fitting _ R _ _ _ with no forbidden letters and including O.

Examples:
- BROOK (but O appears twice, and we don’t know if O is allowed twice – but we don’t have info against it)
- DROOP (but P is allowed, O appears twice)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all letters allowed)
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P – O appears twice)
- GROAN (but A is forbidden)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N – N is forbidden)
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E – E is forbidden)
- FROST (S is forbidden)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – all allowed)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all allowed)

PROUD seems like a good candidate:
- P (allowed)
- R (correct position 2)
- O (must appear, and not in position 2)
- U (allowed)
- D (allowed)

Let’s verify:
Letters used: P, R, O, U, D – none of the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E, I, L, S) appear. O is in position 3 (not position 2), which fits the feedback.

Letters already ruled out: C, A, N, E, I, L, S, U, D.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, M, T, Y, plus any others not yet used.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining pool, and forming a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PRO"".

Possible endings:
- PROXY (but Y is allowed, X is allowed)
- PROWL (but W is allowed, L is already out)
- PROBE (B is allowed, E is out)
- PROXY, PROWL, PROXY, PROXY...

Looking at valid words:
- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y – all letters allowed.
- PROWL: P, R, O, W, L – but L is out.
- PROBE: E is out.
- PROXY seems valid.

Let’s check PROXY:
Letters: P, R, O, X, Y – none of the forbidden letters appear, and it fits the pattern PRO _ _.

Therefore, PROXY is the logical next guess.

This means R must be in position 2, because in CRANE it was in position 2 and marked ✓, and in ROILS it was in position 1 and marked -, so R is in position 2.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nCRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nThis means:\n- Position 1: C is not in the word.\n- Position 2: R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is in position 2).\n- Positions 3,4,5: A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nROILS: R(-) O(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)\nThis means:\n- Position 1: R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, which matches CRANE feedback).\n- Position 2: O is in the word but NOT in position 2.\n- Positions 3,4,5: I, L, S are not in the word.\n\nSo the word has:\n- R in position 2.\n- O is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, I, L, S.\n- Remaining possible letters (excluding the above): B, D, F, G, H, M, P, T, U, Y, plus O.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with:\n- R in position 2.\n- O somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5).\n- No C, A, N, E, I, L, S.\n\nPossible patterns:\n- _ R _ _ _ (with R fixed in position 2)\n- O must appear once, and can be in positions 1,3,4,5.\n\nLet’s brainstorm words fitting _ R _ _ _ with no forbidden letters and including O.\n\nExamples:\n- BROOK (but O appears twice, and we don’t know if O is allowed twice – but we don’t have info against it)\n- DROOP (but P is allowed, O appears twice)\n- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all letters allowed)\n- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P – O appears twice)\n- GROAN (but A is forbidden)\n- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N – N is forbidden)\n- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E – E is forbidden)\n- FROST (S is forbidden)\n- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – all allowed)\n- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – all allowed)\n\nPROUD seems like a good candidate:\n- P (allowed)\n- R (correct position 2)\n- O (must appear, and not in position 2)\n- U (allowed)\n- D (allowed)\n\nLet’s verify:\nLetters used: P, R, O, U, D – none of the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E, I, L, S) appear.

From the latest feedback on PROMO:
- P, R, O are confirmed in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- M is not in the word (x).
- The final O is marked “-”, meaning:
  – O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word pattern is: P R O _ O  (but O cannot be in position 5, so the last letter must be something else and O must appear once more in positions 4 or 5, yet 5 is forbidden, so O must be in position 4).

Wait, the feedback says O(-) for the last letter, which means O is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 1-3 are already P R O, the only remaining spot for O is position 4.

Hence the word must be: P R O O _

Letters ruled out so far: C, A, N, E, I, L, S, U, D, X, Y, M.

Remaining possible letters for position 5: B, F, G, H, T, W, plus any others not yet used.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching P R O O _:
- PROOF – F is allowed and not yet ruled out.
- PROOF is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:
- P, R, O in positions 1-3 ✓
- O in position 4 ✓ (only remaining spot)
- F in position 5 ✓ (not ruled out)

Therefore, the correct word is PROOF.
