1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I can form a word that uses several of them. ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses O in a different position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduces several new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any letters already ruled out (A, R, S, E).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Uses O in position 2 (different from position 3 in arose).
- Uses P, I, N, T - none of which have been tested yet.
- All letters are common and likely to give more information.

Let me check if ""POINT"" is valid - yes, it’s a common English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I can form a word that uses several of them. ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses O in a different position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduces several new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any letters already ruled out (A, R, S, E).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Uses O in position 2 (different from position 3 in arose).
- Uses P, I, N, T - none of which have been tested yet.
- All letters are common and likely to give more information.

Let me check if ""POINT"" is valid - yes, it’s a common English word.

   - P, I, N, T are all absent.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (fixed in position 2)

So far we have:

- Position 4: D or another allowed consonant

Next: “DOVY?” – not a word.  
“DOMY?” – not a word.  
“DOFFY” – too long.

Try D in position 4: _ O _ D Y  
We need first and third letters from allowed set.  
A valid word: “FOXY” – too short.  
“MOODY” – but O is already in position 2, and we’d have two O’s, which might be allowed, but we need to check if M and D are allowed.  
“MOODY” uses M, O, O, D, Y.  
- M is allowed.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- D is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).  
- No forbidden letters.  
“MOODY” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
M – allowed

Allowed letters left: D, F, H, K, M, V, W, plus any others not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern:  
- Position 1: D or another allowed consonant  
- Position 2: O  
- Position 3: any allowed consonant (but not D, since D must go in 1 or 4)  
- Position 4: D or another allowed consonant  
- Position 5: Y

Let’s try D in position 1: D O _ _ Y  
We need two more consonants from allowed set.  
A good candidate is “DOUGH” but G is out.  
Next: “DOVY?” – not a word.  
“DOMY?” – not a word.  
“DOFFY” – too long.

Try D in position 4: _ O _ D Y  
We need first and third letters from allowed set.  
A valid word: “FOXY” – too short.  
“MOODY” – but O is already in position 2, and we’d have two O’s, which might be allowed, but we need to check if M and D are allowed.  
“MOODY” uses M, O, O, D, Y.  
- M is allowed.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- D is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).  
- No forbidden letters.  
“MOODY” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
M – allowed  
O – position 2 (✓)  
O – duplicate, but allowed  
D – position 4 (allowed)  
Y – position 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints.",Guess 5: moody -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) O(-) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

Looking at these, I can form a word that uses several of them. ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses O in a different position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduces several new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any letters already ruled out (A, R, S, E).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Uses O in position 2 (different from position 3 in arose).
- Uses P, I, N, T - none of which have been tested yet.
- All letters are common and likely to give more information.

Let me check if ""POINT"" is valid - yes, it’s a common English word.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so the word has O in slot 2.  
   - P, I, N, T are all absent.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T  
Letters we know ARE in the word: O (fixed in position 2)  
Remaining unused common letters: D, L, U, C, M, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2  
- No letters from the forbidden set above  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “COULD”:
- C, U, L, D are all new letters.  
- O is in position 2 as required.

Let me check: COULD is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters.

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – P, I, N, T are absent.

3. could → C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(-)  
   – O is still in position 2 (✓).  
   – C, U, L are absent.  
   – D is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
O (fixed in position 2), D (somewhere except position 5)

Remaining unused common letters:  
B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we have not yet tested: none left (A, E, I, U are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2  
- Contains D somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set  
- Is a valid English word

Let’s try to place D in position 4 and pick two fresh consonants.  
A good candidate is “BROAD”:
- B, R, O, A, D  
But R and A are already ruled out, so this fails.

Next try “MOUND”:
- M, O, U, N, D  
U and N are ruled out.

Try “GLOOM” – but L and G are allowed? L is out.

Try “WOMBY” – W, O, M, B, Y.  
All letters are allowed: W, O, M, B, Y.  
O is in position 2, D is not present, so this misses our requirement to include D.

We must include D. Let’s try “BODGY”:
- B, O, D, G, Y  
All letters allowed, O in position 2, D in position 3.  
This satisfies every constraint.

“BODGY” is a valid English word meaning “common or unattractive”.

Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – P, I, N, T are absent.

3. could → C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(-)  
   – O is still in position 2 (✓).  
   – C, U, L are absent.  
   – D is in the word but not in position 5.

4. bodgy → B(x) O(✓) D(-) G(x) Y(✓)  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – B and G are absent.  
   – D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So far we have:

- Fixed letters: O in position 2, Y in position 5.  
- Must include D somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5.  
  Therefore D must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G.

Allowed letters left: D, F, H, K, M, V, W, plus any others not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern:  
- Position 1: D or another allowed consonant  
- Position 2: O  
- Position 3: any allowed consonant (but not D, since D must go in 1 or 4)  
- Position 4: D or another allowed consonant  
- Position 5: Y

Let’s try D in position 1: D O _ _ Y  
We need two more consonants from allowed set.  
A good candidate is “DOUGH” but G is out.  
Next: “DOVY?” – not a word.  
“DOMY?” – not a word.  
“DOFFY” – too long.

Try D in position 4: _ O _ D Y  
We need first and third letters from allowed set.  
A valid word: “FOXY” – too short.  
“MOODY” – but O is already in position 2, and we’d have two O’s, which might be allowed, but we need to check if M and D are allowed.  
“MOODY” uses M, O, O, D, Y.  
- M is allowed.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- D is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).  
- No forbidden letters.  
“MOODY” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify:  
M – allowed  
O – position 2 (✓)  
O – duplicate, but allowed  
D – position 4 (allowed)  
Y – position 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback on “moody”:

- M(x) – M is not in the word.  
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already fixed).  
- O(-) – There is another O in the word, but it is **not** in position 3.  
- D(✓) – D is in position 4 (already fixed).  
- Y(✓) – Y is in position 5 (already fixed).

So the pattern is now:

1: ?  
2: O  
3: ? (cannot be O, and cannot be any of the forbidden letters)  
4: D  
5: Y

Forbidden letters still in play: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G, M.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: any not yet ruled out, especially common consonants like F, H, K, V, W, plus the second O (but position 3 cannot be O, so that must go elsewhere).

Wait – the second O must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 **cannot** be O (because feedback said O(-) for position 3 in moody). So the second O must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: O O _ D Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word starting with OO. The only common one is “OOFDY” – but that’s not a word. Let me think again.

Actually, the second O could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 **cannot** be O (because feedback says O(-) for position 3 in moody). Therefore the second O must be in position 1.

So pattern: O O _ D Y.

Valid English word: “OOODY” – not valid. “OODLY” – not valid. “OODLE” – but L is out.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback:

- moody → M(x) O(✓) O(-) D(✓) Y(✓)

The O(-) means the letter O is in the word but **not** in position 3. It does **not** necessarily mean there is another O. It could be a different letter that’s in the word and in the wrong position. But the feedback also shows O(✓) in position 2, so O is confirmed in position 2. The O(-) in position 3 is just reiterating that O is not in position 3, which we already knew.

Therefore, the word has:
- O in position 2
- D in position 4
- Y in position 5
- No M
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: F, H, K, V, W, plus any others not ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ O _ D Y.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- FOODY – but F is allowed, O is in position 2, D is in 4, Y in 5. FOODY is a valid word.
- HOODY – H is allowed.
- KOODY – not a word.
- VOODY – not a word.
- WOODY – W is allowed.

All of FOODY, HOODY, WOODY are valid. Let’s pick one – I’ll go with “WOODY”.

Check letters:
- W – allowed
- O – position 2 (✓)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- D – position 4 (✓)
- Y – position 5 (✓)

No forbidden letters used.

- Y(✓) – Y is in position 5 (already fixed).

So the pattern is now:

1: ?  
2: O  
3: ? (cannot be O, and cannot be any of the forbidden letters)  
4: D  
5: Y

Forbidden letters still in play: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G, M.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: any not yet ruled out, especially common consonants like F, H, K, V, W, plus the second O (but position 3 cannot be O, so that must go elsewhere).

Wait – the second O must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 **cannot** be O (because feedback said O(-) for position 3 in moody). So the second O must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: O O _ D Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word starting with OO. The only common one is “OOFDY” – but that’s not a word. Let me think again.

Actually, the second O could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 **cannot** be O (because feedback says O(-) for position 3 in moody). Therefore the second O must be in position 1.

So pattern: O O _ D Y.

Valid English word: “OOODY” – not valid. “OODLY” – not valid. “OODLE” – but L is out.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback:

- moody → M(x) O(✓) O(-) D(✓) Y(✓)

The O(-) means the letter O is in the word but **not** in position 3. It does **not** necessarily mean there is another O. It could be a different letter that’s in the word and in the wrong position. But the feedback also shows O(✓) in position 2, so O is confirmed in position 2. The O(-) in position 3 is just reiterating that O is not in position 3, which we already knew.

Therefore, the word has:
- O in position 2
- D in position 4
- Y in position 5
- No M
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: F, H, K, V, W, plus any others not ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ O _ D Y.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- FOODY – but F is allowed, O is in position 2, D is in 4, Y in 5. FOODY is a valid word.
- HOODY – H is allowed.
- KOODY – not a word.
- VOODY – not a word.
- WOODY – W is allowed.

All of FOODY, HOODY, WOODY are valid. Let’s pick one – I’ll go with “WOODY”.

Check letters:
- W – allowed
- O – position 2 (✓)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- D – position 4 (✓)
- Y – position 5 (✓)

No forbidden letters used.",Guess 6: woody -> FEEDBACK: W(-) O(✓) O(-) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
