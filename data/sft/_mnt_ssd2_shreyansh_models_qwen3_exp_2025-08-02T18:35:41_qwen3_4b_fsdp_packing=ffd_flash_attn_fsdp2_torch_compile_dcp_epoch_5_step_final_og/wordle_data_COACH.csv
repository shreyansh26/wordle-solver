For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely OUT: R, S, E.
- Letters definitely IN: A, O.
- A cannot be in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test new consonants while keeping A and O. The word ""ADOPT"" uses A (position 2) and O (position 3), but O cannot be in position 3, so that's invalid. ""COAT"" is 4 letters. ""COBIA"" is 5 letters but has an I and B. ""COBIA"" would be: C, O, B, I, A. This fits all constraints: A is in position 5 (not 1), O is in position 2 (not 3), and no R, S, E. 

Another option is ""PLAID"" but it has an E in the feedback, so that's out. ""COBIA"" seems like a solid choice to test C, B, I.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, B, I

Exact positions so far:

- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from arose) and NOT in position 5 (from COBIA).  
  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far is:
C O _ _ _  
with A somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding R, S, E, B, I).

Remaining possible letters (excluding R, S, E, B, I):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A which must go in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try A in position 3:
C O A _ _

We need two more letters. Good consonants left: D, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

A common word that fits: COAT_ – but T is allowed and COAT_ is 4 letters.  
A valid 5-letter word: COALA (but L is allowed, A is already used in position 3, but COALA has A twice – not sure if that’s allowed; words can reuse letters if they appear in the secret word).  
However, COALA is 5 letters: C O A L A.  
But A is already known to be in the word, and this uses A again.  
But we have no restriction against it. However, we need to check if COALA is a valid English word. Yes, it is.

But let me think of a better word. COAPT is a word (to seize by force), but P is allowed.  
C O A P T – but that’s 5 letters: COAPT.  
But we have no info on P or T yet.  

Another option: C O A L _ – COAL_ is 4 letters.  
COALS is 6 letters.  
COAX_ – COAX is 4 letters.  
COAPT seems valid.

But let me think of a word with A in position 4:  
C O _ A _

Possible: C O M A _ – COMA_ is 4 letters.  
C O P A _ – COPA_ – COPAS is 5 letters but S is excluded.  
C O N A _ – CONA_ – CONAL is 5 letters but L is allowed.  

CONAL is a valid word (a ridge of sand or gravel).

A valid 5-letter word: COALA (but L is allowed, A is already used in position 3, but COALA has A twice – not sure if that’s allowed; words can reuse letters if they appear in the secret word).  
However, COALA is 5 letters: C O A L A.  
But A is already known to be in the word, and this uses A again.  
But we have no restriction against it. However, we need to check if COALA is a valid English word. Yes, it is.

But let me think of a better word. COAPT is a word (to seize by force), but P is allowed.  
C O A P T – but that’s 5 letters: COAPT.  
But we have no info on P or T yet.  

Another option: C O A L _ – COAL_ is 4 letters.  
COALS is 6 letters.  
COAX_ – COAX is 4 letters.  
COAPT seems valid.

But let me think of a word with A in position 4:  
C O _ A _

Possible: C O M A _ – COMA_ is 4 letters.  
C O P A _ – COPA_ – COPAS is 5 letters but S is excluded.  
C O N A _ – CONA_ – CONAL is 5 letters but L is allowed.  

CONAL is a valid word (a ridge of sand or gravel).  

Between COAPT and CONAL, COAPT seems more common. Let me go with COAPT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely OUT: R, S, E.
- Letters definitely IN: A, O.
- A cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test new consonants while keeping A and O. The word ""ADOPT"" uses A (position 2) and O (position 3), but O cannot be in position 3, so that's invalid. ""COAT"" is 4 letters. ""COBIA"" is 5 letters but has an I and B. ""COBIA"" would be: C, O, B, I, A. This fits all constraints: A is in position 5 (not 1), O is in position 2 (not 3), and no R, S, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, B, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: C, O, A  
Exact positions so far:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from arose) and NOT in position 5 (from COBIA).  
  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far is:
C O _ _ _  
with A somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding R, S, E, B, I).

Remaining possible letters (excluding R, S, E, B, I):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A which must go in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try A in position 3:
C O A _ _

We need two more letters. Good consonants left: D, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

A common word that fits: COAT_ – but T is allowed and COAT_ is 4 letters.  
A valid 5-letter word: COALA (but L is allowed, A is already used in position 3, but COALA has A twice – not sure if that’s allowed; words can reuse letters if they appear in the secret word).

But A is already known to be in the word, and this uses A again.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely OUT: R, S, E.
- Letters definitely IN: A, O.
- A cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test new consonants while keeping A and O. The word ""ADOPT"" uses A (position 2) and O (position 3), but O cannot be in position 3, so that's invalid. ""COAT"" is 4 letters. ""COBIA"" is 5 letters but has an I and B. ""COBIA"" would be: C, O, B, I, A. This fits all constraints: A is in position 5 (not 1), O is in position 2 (not 3), and no R, S, E. 

Another option is ""PLAID"" but it has an E in the feedback, so that's out. ""COBIA"" seems like a solid choice to test C, B, I.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, B, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: C, O, A  
Exact positions so far:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from arose) and NOT in position 5 (from COBIA).  
  So A must be in position 3 or 4.

So the pattern so far is:
C O _ _ _  
with A somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet (excluding R, S, E, B, I).

Remaining possible letters (excluding R, S, E, B, I):  
D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A which must go in position 3 or 4.

Let’s try A in position 3:
C O A _ _

We need two more letters. Good consonants left: D, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

A common word that fits: COAT_ – but T is allowed and COAT_ is 4 letters.  
A valid 5-letter word: COALA (but L is allowed, A is already used in position 3, but COALA has A twice – not sure if that’s allowed; words can reuse letters if they appear in the secret word).  
However, COALA is 5 letters: C O A L A.  
But A is already known to be in the word, and this uses A again.  
But we have no restriction against it. However, we need to check if COALA is a valid English word. Yes, it is.

But let me think of a better word. COAPT is a word (to seize by force), but P is allowed.  
C O A P T – but that’s 5 letters: COAPT.  
But we have no info on P or T yet.  

Another option: C O A L _ – COAL_ is 4 letters.  
COALS is 6 letters.  
COAX_ – COAX is 4 letters.  
COAPT seems valid.

But let me think of a word with A in position 4:  
C O _ A _

Possible: C O M A _ – COMA_ is 4 letters.  
C O P A _ – COPA_ – COPAS is 5 letters but S is excluded.  
C O N A _ – CONA_ – CONAL is 5 letters but L is allowed.  

CONAL is a valid word (a ridge of sand or gravel).  

Between COAPT and CONAL, COAPT seems more common. Let me go with COAPT.

Guess 3: COAPT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) A(✓) P(x) T(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)

So the pattern is:
C O A _ _

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, B, I, P, T

Letters still available (excluding the above): D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Common 5-letter words that fit COA__ and use only allowed letters:

COALS – but S is excluded  
COAXY – X is allowed, but Y might be stretch  
COATED – T is excluded  
COGENT – G, N, T – T excluded  
COALY – L, Y allowed, but 5 letters? COALY is 5 letters (C O A L Y) – valid word.

COALY is a valid English word meaning “pertaining to coal” or “coal-like”.  
It uses L and Y, both allowed.

Another candidate: COAGU – but U is allowed, but COAGU isn’t a standard word.  
COAGY isn’t valid.  
COAMM – invalid.  
COALY seems the best.

So guess: COALY
