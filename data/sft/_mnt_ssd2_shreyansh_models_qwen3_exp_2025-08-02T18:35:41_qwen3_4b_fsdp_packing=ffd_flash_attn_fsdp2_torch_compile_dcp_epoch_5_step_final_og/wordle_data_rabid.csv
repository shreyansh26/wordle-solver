### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Possible positions:

- We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding O, S, E, T, N).
- Common remaining letters: D, L, C, U, G, M, P, etc.

- C, R, A, M, P.
- R is in position 2 (was position 2 in train, so this re-tests R in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2, so CRAMP won’t work).

Another candidate is “GRAIL”:
- G, R, A, I, L.
- I is at position 4.
- R is in position 2 (again, same issue).

Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R, A, D, I, O.
- O is excluded.

“CARDS”:
- C, A, R, D, S.
- S is excluded.

“RADIX”:
- X is allowed, but E is excluded.

“RADAR”:
- R is in position 1 and 5, but A is in positions 2 and 4. But I must be at 4, so this would be R, A, D, I, R. But A would be in position 2 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests A in position 2, which is new). R is in position 1 and 5 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests R in position 1).

Let’s check RADAR:
- Letters: R, A, D, I, R.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none are present.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 1 (new position).
- I is in position 4 (correct).
- D is a new letter.

This seems valid.

Let’s parse the new feedback from “radar”:

R(✓)  → R is in position 1 (correct)
A(✓)  → A is in position 2 (correct)
D(-)  → D is in the word but not in position 3
A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know A is in position 2, so this is redundant)
R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know R is in position 1, so this is redundant)

So far we know:
- Exact letters and positions: R A _ _ _
- Must include D somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N
- Positions 4 and 5 are still open.

Since D cannot be in position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 4 is currently open, and position 5 is open too. But we also know from earlier that A is in position 2, and we have no restriction yet on positions 3, 4, 5 except for D.

But wait: the word is R A _ _ _. We need a 5-letter word starting with RA, containing D not in position 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- RADAR (already tried)
- RACED (but E is excluded)
- RAPID (but P is allowed, let’s see)
- RAVEN (but N is excluded)
- RALLY (but L is allowed, but we need D)
- RASPY (but S is excluded)
- RATCH (but C and H are allowed)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEL (E excluded)
- RAVIN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

Wait, let’s think systematically. We need R A _ _ _ with D in 4 or 5, and no O, S, E, T, N.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

D must be in 4 or 5.

Case 1: D in position 4 → R A _ D _
Case 2: D in position 5 → R A _ _ D

Let’s look for valid words in each case.

Case 1: R A _ D _
Possible letters for position 3: must be from allowed set and not already used (R, A, D are used). Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RABID
- RACID (not a word)
- RAGED (E excluded)
- RAKED (E excluded)
- RALPH (but H is allowed, but we need D in 4)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

RABID fits: R A B I D
- Letters: R, A, B, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed, since D must be in 4 or 5)
- I is allowed (not excluded)
- B is allowed

This seems valid.

Case 2: R A _ _ D
Looking for words:
- RACED (E excluded)
- RAVED (E excluded)
- RAPID (P is allowed, but D is in 5)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)

RAPID is R A P I D, but D is in 5, which is allowed. However, we know from feedback that D is in the word but not in position 3, so position 5 is fine. But let’s check:
- RAPID: R, A, P, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed)
- This seems valid too.

Between RABID and RAPID, both fit, but we need to choose one. Let’s pick RAPID as it tests P and I in new positions.

But wait, we already have I in position 4 from train feedback (I was in position 4 and got ✓). So I is already fixed at position 4. Therefore, the word must be R A _ I _.

So the structure is R A _ I _ with D somewhere not in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 3: must be from allowed letters (not R, A, D, I)
- Position 5: must be from allowed letters

And D must be in position 5 (since position 3 is between A and I, and D cannot be in position 3).

So the word must be R A _ I D.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RACID (not a word)
- RAVID (V is allowed)
- RABID (B is allowed)

Both RAVID and RABID fit:
- RAVID: R A V I D
- RABID: R A B I D

Both are valid. Let’s choose RABID as it tests B.

</think>

From the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- I is fixed in position 4
- D must be in the word but not in position 3 → therefore D must be in position 5
- Position 3 is still open and must be a new letter (not R, A, D, I)

The only remaining slot is position 3. We need a letter that hasn't been excluded and hasn't been used yet. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R A _ I D:
- RABID (B is allowed)
- RAVID (V is allowed)

Both are valid, but RABID uses B which hasn't been tested yet.

<guess",rabil,"Let’s parse the new feedback from “radar”:

R(✓)  → R is in position 1 (correct)
A(✓)  → A is in position 2 (correct)
D(-)  → D is in the word but not in position 3
A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know A is in position 2, so this is redundant)
R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know R is in position 1, so this is redundant)

So far we know:
- Exact letters and positions: R A _ _ _
- Must include D somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N
- Positions 4 and 5 are still open.

Since D cannot be in position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 4 is currently open, and position 5 is open too. But we also know from earlier that A is in position 2, and we have no restriction yet on positions 3, 4, 5 except for D.

But wait: the word is R A _ _ _. We need a 5-letter word starting with RA, containing D not in position 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- RADAR (already tried)
- RACED (but E is excluded)
- RAPID (but P is allowed, let’s see)
- RAVEN (but N is excluded)
- RALLY (but L is allowed, but we need D)
- RASPY (but S is excluded)
- RATCH (but C and H are allowed)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEL (E excluded)
- RAVIN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

Wait, let’s think systematically. We need R A _ _ _ with D in 4 or 5, and no O, S, E, T, N.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

D must be in 4 or 5.

Case 1: D in position 4 → R A _ D _
Case 2: D in position 5 → R A _ _ D

Let’s look for valid words in each case.

Case 1: R A _ D _
Possible letters for position 3: must be from allowed set and not already used (R, A, D are used). Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RABID
- RACID (not a word)
- RAGED (E excluded)
- RAKED (E excluded)
- RALPH (but H is allowed, but we need D in 4)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

RABID fits: R A B I D
- Letters: R, A, B, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed, since D must be in 4 or 5)
- I is allowed (not excluded)
- B is allowed

This seems valid.

Case 2: R A _ _ D
Looking for words:
- RACED (E excluded)
- RAVED (E excluded)
- RAPID (P is allowed, but D is in 5)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)

RAPID is R A P I D, but D is in 5, which is allowed. However, we know from feedback that D is in the word but not in position 3, so position 5 is fine. But let’s check:
- RAPID: R, A, P, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed)
- This seems valid too.

Between RABID and RAPID, both fit, but we need to choose one. Let’s pick RAPID as it tests P and I in new positions.

But wait, we already have I in position 4 from train feedback (I was in position 4 and got ✓). So I is already fixed at position 4. Therefore, the word must be R A _ I _.

So the structure is R A _ I _ with D somewhere not in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 3: must be from allowed letters (not R, A, D, I)
- Position 5: must be from allowed letters

And D must be in position 5 (since position 3 is between A and I, and D cannot be in position 3).

So the word must be R A _ I D.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RACID (not a word)
- RAVID (V is allowed)
- RABID (B is allowed)

Both RAVID and RABID fit:
- RAVID: R A V I D
- RABID: R A B I D

Both are valid. Let’s choose RABID as it tests B.From the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- I is fixed in position 4
- D must be in the word but not in position 3 → therefore D must be in position 5
- Position 3 is still open and must be a new letter (not R, A, D, I)

The only remaining slot is position 3. We need a letter that hasn't been excluded and hasn't been used yet. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R A _ I D:
- RABID (B is allowed)
- RAVID (V is allowed)

Both are valid, but RABID uses B which hasn't been tested yet.",Guess 4: rabil -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) B(✓) I(✓) L(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: O, S, E.
- Letters to keep: A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and R (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. Puts A and R in new positions to test their correct spots.
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so this tests a new position for R).
- A is now in position 3 (was position 1 in “arose”, so this tests a new position for A).
- T, I, N are new letters that will help narrow down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - T and N are not in the word.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is still in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, I (with I fixed at position 4).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, N.
- Positions to avoid for A: 1, 3.
- Positions to avoid for R: 1, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, I (with I at position 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, N.
- Places A and R in new positions that haven’t been tested yet.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be A or R.
- Position 2: cannot be R.
- Position 3: cannot be A.
- Position 4: must be I.
- Position 5: any letter except the excluded ones.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- I is fixed at position 4.
- We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding O, S, E, T, N).
- Common remaining letters: D, L, C, U, G, M, P, etc.

One candidate is “CRAMP”:
- C, R, A, M, P.
- R is in position 2 (was position 2 in train, so this re-tests R in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2, so CRAMP won’t work).

Another candidate is “GRAIL”:
- G, R, A, I, L.
- I is at position 4.
- R is in position 2 (again, same issue).

Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R, A, D, I, O.
- O is excluded.

“CARDS”:
- C, A, R, D, S.
- S is excluded.

“RADIX”:
- X is allowed, but E is excluded.

“RADAR”:
- R is in position 1 and 5, but A is in positions 2 and 4. But I must be at 4, so this would be R, A, D, I, R. But A would be in position 2 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests A in position 2, which is new). R is in position 1 and 5 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests R in position 1).

Let’s check RADAR:
- Letters: R, A, D, I, R.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none are present.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 1 (new position).
- I is in position 4 (correct).
- D is a new letter.

This seems valid.

R(✓)  → R is in position 1 (correct)

D(-)  → D is in the word but not in position 3

Let’s look for valid words in each case.

Case 1: R A _ D _
Possible letters for position 3: must be from allowed set and not already used (R, A, D are used). Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RABID
- RACID (not a word)
- RAGED (E excluded)
- RAKED (E excluded)
- RALPH (but H is allowed, but we need D in 4)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

RABID fits: R A B I D
- Letters: R, A, B, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed, since D must be in 4 or 5)
- I is allowed (not excluded)
- B is allowed

This seems valid.

Case 2: R A _ _ D
Looking for words:
- RACED (E excluded)
- RAVED (E excluded)
- RAPID (P is allowed, but D is in 5)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)

RAPID is R A P I D, but D is in 5, which is allowed. However, we know from feedback that D is in the word but not in position 3, so position 5 is fine. But let’s check:
- RAPID: R, A, P, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed)
- This seems valid too.

Between RABID and RAPID, both fit, but we need to choose one. Let’s pick RAPID as it tests P and I in new positions.

But wait, we already have I in position 4 from train feedback (I was in position 4 and got ✓). So I is already fixed at position 4. Therefore, the word must be R A _ I _.

So the structure is R A _ I _ with D somewhere not in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 3: must be from allowed letters (not R, A, D, I)
- Position 5: must be from allowed letters

And D must be in position 5 (since position 3 is between A and I, and D cannot be in position 3).

So the word must be R A _ I D.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RACID (not a word)
- RAVID (V is allowed)
- RABID (B is allowed)

Both RAVID and RABID fit:
- RAVID: R A V I D
- RABID: R A B I D

Both are valid. Let’s choose RABID as it tests B.From the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- I is fixed in position 4
- D must be in the word but not in position 3 → therefore D must be in position 5
- Position 3 is still open and must be a new letter (not R, A, D, I)

The only remaining slot is position 3. We need a letter that hasn't been excluded and hasn't been used yet. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R A _ I D:
- RABID (B is allowed)
- RAVID (V is allowed)

Both are valid, but RABID uses B which hasn't been tested yet.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: O, S, E.
- Letters to keep: A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and R (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. Puts A and R in new positions to test their correct spots.
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- R is now in position 2 (was position 2 in “arose”, so this tests a new position for R).
- A is now in position 3 (was position 1 in “arose”, so this tests a new position for A).
- T, I, N are new letters that will help narrow down possibilities.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - T and N are not in the word.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is still in the word but not in positions 1 or 3.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, I (with I fixed at position 4).
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, N.
- Positions to avoid for A: 1, 3.
- Positions to avoid for R: 1, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, I (with I at position 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, N.
- Places A and R in new positions that haven’t been tested yet.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be A or R.
- Position 2: cannot be R.
- Position 3: cannot be A.
- Position 4: must be I.
- Position 5: any letter except the excluded ones.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- I is fixed at position 4.
- We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding O, S, E, T, N).
- Common remaining letters: D, L, C, U, G, M, P, etc.

One candidate is “CRAMP”:
- C, R, A, M, P.
- R is in position 2 (was position 2 in train, so this re-tests R in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2, so CRAMP won’t work).

Another candidate is “GRAIL”:
- G, R, A, I, L.
- I is at position 4.
- R is in position 2 (again, same issue).

Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R, A, D, I, O.
- O is excluded.

“CARDS”:
- C, A, R, D, S.
- S is excluded.

“RADIX”:
- X is allowed, but E is excluded.

“RADAR”:
- R is in position 1 and 5, but A is in positions 2 and 4. But I must be at 4, so this would be R, A, D, I, R. But A would be in position 2 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests A in position 2, which is new). R is in position 1 and 5 (was position 1 in arose, so this tests R in position 1).

Let’s check RADAR:
- Letters: R, A, D, I, R.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none are present.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- R is in position 1 (new position).
- I is in position 4 (correct).
- D is a new letter.

This seems valid.

Guess 3: radar -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>

Let’s parse the new feedback from “radar”:

R(✓)  → R is in position 1 (correct)
A(✓)  → A is in position 2 (correct)
D(-)  → D is in the word but not in position 3
A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know A is in position 2, so this is redundant)
R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know R is in position 1, so this is redundant)

So far we know:
- Exact letters and positions: R A _ _ _
- Must include D somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N
- Positions 4 and 5 are still open.

Since D cannot be in position 3, it must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 4 is currently open, and position 5 is open too. But we also know from earlier that A is in position 2, and we have no restriction yet on positions 3, 4, 5 except for D.

But wait: the word is R A _ _ _. We need a 5-letter word starting with RA, containing D not in position 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- RADAR (already tried)
- RACED (but E is excluded)
- RAPID (but P is allowed, let’s see)
- RAVEN (but N is excluded)
- RALLY (but L is allowed, but we need D)
- RASPY (but S is excluded)
- RATCH (but C and H are allowed)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVEN (N excluded)

Wait, let’s think systematically. We need R A _ _ _ with D in 4 or 5, and no O, S, E, T, N.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

D must be in 4 or 5.

Case 1: D in position 4 → R A _ D _
Case 2: D in position 5 → R A _ _ D

Let’s look for valid words in each case.

Case 1: R A _ D _
Possible letters for position 3: must be from allowed set and not already used (R, A, D are used). Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- RAVEN (N excluded)

RABID fits: R A B I D
- Letters: R, A, B, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed, since D must be in 4 or 5)
- I is allowed (not excluded)
- B is allowed

This seems valid.

Case 2: R A _ _ D
Looking for words:
- RACED (E excluded)
- RAVED (E excluded)
- RAPID (P is allowed, but D is in 5)
- RAVEN (N excluded)
- RAVOK (O excluded)

RAPID is R A P I D, but D is in 5, which is allowed. However, we know from feedback that D is in the word but not in position 3, so position 5 is fine. But let’s check:
- RAPID: R, A, P, I, D
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, T, N – none present
- D is in position 5 (allowed)
- This seems valid too.

Between RABID and RAPID, both fit, but we need to choose one. Let’s pick RAPID as it tests P and I in new positions.

But wait, we already have I in position 4 from train feedback (I was in position 4 and got ✓). So I is already fixed at position 4. Therefore, the word must be R A _ I _.

So the structure is R A _ I _ with D somewhere not in position 3.

Thus:
- Position 3: must be from allowed letters (not R, A, D, I)
- Position 5: must be from allowed letters

And D must be in position 5 (since position 3 is between A and I, and D cannot be in position 3).

So the word must be R A _ I D.

Looking for 5-letter words:
- RACID (not a word)
- RAVID (V is allowed)
- RABID (B is allowed)

Both RAVID and RABID fit:
- RAVID: R A V I D
- RABID: R A B I D

Both are valid. Let’s choose RABID as it tests B.From the feedback:
- R is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 2
- I is fixed in position 4
- D must be in the word but not in position 3 → therefore D must be in position 5
- Position 3 is still open and must be a new letter (not R, A, D, I)

The only remaining slot is position 3. We need a letter that hasn't been excluded and hasn't been used yet. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting R A _ I D:
- RABID (B is allowed)
- RAVID (V is allowed)

Both are valid, but RABID uses B which hasn't been tested yet.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: radar -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) D(-) A(-) R(-)
Guess 4: rabil -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) B(✓) I(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on “rabil”:
- R(✓) – R is in position 1 (confirmed)
- A(✓) – A is in position 2 (confirmed)
- B(✓) – B is in position 3 (confirmed)
- I(✓) – I is in position 4 (confirmed)
- L(x) – L is not in the word

So the secret word must be R A B I _ (positions 1-4 fixed), and the last letter must be any letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Excluded letters so far: O, S, E, T, N, L  
Allowed letters for position 5: any remaining alphabet letter not in the excluded set.

Common 5-letter words that start with RAB I:
- RABID
- RABIS (not a valid English word)
- RABID is the only common, valid word left.

Therefore the only possible word is RABID.
