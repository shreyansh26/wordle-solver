1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, helping me narrow down possibilities quickly.

The feedback from the first guess (arose) shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information, I need a second guess that uses entirely different common letters.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I cover the remaining vowels.
- N, T, L are very common consonants not yet tested.
- No letters overlap with the first guess.

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, but:
- U is not in position 1  
- N is not in position 2  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N  
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
3. Places U somewhere other than position 1  
4. Places N somewhere other than position 2  

Available letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the required U and N.

We need a valid English word that uses these letters.  
Let’s list possible combinations:

- Must include U and N.  
- Possible positions for U: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints yields “FUNNY”:
- F, U, N, N, Y  
- Contains both U and N  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- N appears twice, positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L)  
- It’s a valid English word.

This seems like the best next guess.

This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, helping me narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The feedback from the first guess (arose) shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word at all.  \nThat means I should avoid every word that contains any of those letters.  \nTo maximize information, I need a second guess that uses entirely different common letters.  \nGood consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  \nGood vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).\n\nA strong candidate is “UNTIL”:\n- U and I cover the remaining vowels.\n- N, T, L are very common consonants not yet tested.\n- No letters overlap with the first guess.\n\nThis should help identify new letters and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>until</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses so far we know:\n\nLetters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  \nLetters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U, N  \n\nSo the secret word contains both U and N, but:\n- U is not in position 1  \n- N is not in position 2  \n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

From the new feedback on “FUNNY”:

F(✓)  → F is correct in position 1  
U(✓)  → U is correct in position 2  
N(✓)  → N is correct in position 3  
N(-)  → the second N is in the word but not in position 4  
Y(✓)  → Y is correct in position 5  

So the secret word must be:

F U N _ Y  (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)  
The fourth letter must be a letter that:
- is in the word (because the second N is in the word but not in position 4, so the word must contain another N somewhere, but position 3 already has N, so the only possible spot is position 4, but N(-) says it’s not there. This seems contradictory unless the word has two Ns, one in position 3 and another somewhere else. But positions 1,2,3,5 are already F,U,N,Y. The only remaining position is 4, but N(-) says N is not in position 4. This implies the word must have exactly one N, which is in position 3. So the fourth letter must be something else.)

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: funny → F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is correct in position 1
- U is correct in position 2
- N is correct in position 3
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (but position 4 is the only remaining spot for another N, which is impossible because position 3 already has N and we have a 5-letter word. This suggests the word has exactly one N, which is in position 3, and the fourth letter is something else.)

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y, with the fourth letter being any letter except the already eliminated ones (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L) and not repeating N in position 4.

Available letters for position 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with FUN and ending with Y:

FUNNY – already tried  
FUNNY is the only common word, but it conflicts with the feedback. This suggests the word must be FUNCY or FUNNY, but FUNNY was tried. Since FUNNY was tried and gave N(-) for position 4, the word cannot be FUNNY. The only other possibility is FUNCY.

Let me check FUNCY:

F U N C Y – positions 1,2,3,5 are correct, and position 4 is C. C has not been tested yet, and it’s allowed.

This seems to be the correct word.
</think>

The feedback from “FUNNY” shows that:
- F, U, N, Y are in the correct positions (1, 2, 3, 5).
- The second N is in the word but not in position 4 (which is impossible if the word already has N in position 3 and only 5 letters). This implies the word has only one N in position 3.

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y. The only common letter left for position 4 that hasn’t been eliminated is C, forming the word “FUNCY”.

F(✓)  → F is correct in position 1  
U(✓)  → U is correct in position 2  
N(✓)  → N is correct in position 3  
N(-)  → the second N is in the word but not in position 4  
Y(✓)  → Y is correct in position 5  

So the secret word must be:

F U N _ Y  (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)  
The fourth letter must be a letter that:
- is in the word (because the second N is in the word but not in position 4, so the word must contain another N somewhere, but position 3 already has N, so the only possible spot is position 4, but N(-) says it’s not there. This seems contradictory unless the word has two Ns, one in position 3 and another somewhere else. But positions 1,2,3,5 are already F,U,N,Y. The only remaining position is 4, but N(-) says N is not in position 4. This implies the word must have exactly one N, which is in position 3. So the fourth letter must be something else.)

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: funny → F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is correct in position 1
- U is correct in position 2
- N is correct in position 3
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (but position 4 is the only remaining spot for another N, which is impossible because position 3 already has N and we have a 5-letter word. This suggests the word has exactly one N, which is in position 3, and the fourth letter is something else.)

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y, with the fourth letter being any letter except the already eliminated ones (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L) and not repeating N in position 4.

Available letters for position 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with FUN and ending with Y:

FUNNY – already tried  
FUNNY is the only common word, but it conflicts with the feedback. This suggests the word must be FUNCY or FUNNY, but FUNNY was tried. Since FUNNY was tried and gave N(-) for position 4, the word cannot be FUNNY. The only other possibility is FUNCY.

Let me check FUNCY:

F U N C Y – positions 1,2,3,5 are correct, and position 4 is C. C has not been tested yet, and it’s allowed.

This seems to be the correct word.The feedback from “FUNNY” shows that:
- F, U, N, Y are in the correct positions (1, 2, 3, 5).
- The second N is in the word but not in position 4 (which is impossible if the word already has N in position 3 and only 5 letters). This implies the word has only one N in position 3.

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y. The only common letter left for position 4 that hasn’t been eliminated is C, forming the word “FUNCY”.",Guess 4: funny -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, helping me narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from the first guess (arose) shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information, I need a second guess that uses entirely different common letters.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I cover the remaining vowels.
- N, T, L are very common consonants not yet tested.
- No letters overlap with the first guess.

This should help identify new letters and their positions efficiently.

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, but:
- U is not in position 1  
- N is not in position 2  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N  
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
3. Places U somewhere other than position 1  
4. Places N somewhere other than position 2  

Available letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the required U and N.

We need a valid English word that uses these letters.  
Let’s list possible combinations:

- Must include U and N.  
- Possible positions for U: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints yields “FUNNY”:
- F, U, N, N, Y  
- Contains both U and N  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- N appears twice, positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L)  
- It’s a valid English word.

This seems like the best next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters confirmed in their exact positions: F (pos 1), U (pos 2), N (pos 3), Y (pos 5)  
- The fourth letter must be a single remaining letter that:
  – has not been eliminated
  – is not N (because N(-) in position 4 contradicts the single N already in position 3)

Available letters for position 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

The only common English 5-letter word that fits F U N _ Y is FUNNY, but that was already guessed and gave N(-) for position 4, which would require a second N. Since we have only 5 positions and N is already confirmed in position 3, the word must contain exactly one N, so the fourth letter must be something else.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only plausible word is FUNCY, but that’s not common. Another possibility is FUNGY, but G has not been tested yet.

However, the feedback from Guess 3 and Guess 4 shows that the second N in position 4 is marked “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. This implies the word must have another N somewhere, but positions 1,2,3,5 are already F,U,N,Y. The only remaining position is 4, which is excluded.

- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters confirmed in their exact positions: F (pos 1), U (pos 2), N (pos 3), Y (pos 5)  
- The fourth letter must be a single remaining letter that:
  – has not been eliminated

The only common English 5-letter word that fits F U N _ Y is FUNNY, but that was already guessed and gave N(-) for position 4, which would require a second N.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only plausible word is FUNCY, but that’s not common. Another possibility is FUNGY, but G has not been tested yet.

However, the feedback from Guess 3 and Guess 4 shows that the second N in position 4 is marked “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. This implies the word must have another N somewhere, but positions 1,2,3,5 are already F,U,N,Y. The only remaining position is 4, which is excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, helping me narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from the first guess (arose) shows that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information, I need a second guess that uses entirely different common letters.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- U and I cover the remaining vowels.
- N, T, L are very common consonants not yet tested.
- No letters overlap with the first guess.

This should help identify new letters and their positions efficiently.

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U, N  

So the secret word contains both U and N, but:
- U is not in position 1  
- N is not in position 2  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N  
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
3. Places U somewhere other than position 1  
4. Places N somewhere other than position 2  

Available letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the required U and N.

We need a valid English word that uses these letters.  
Let’s list possible combinations:

- Must include U and N.  
- Possible positions for U: 2, 3, 4, 5  
- Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2)  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints yields “FUNNY”:
- F, U, N, N, Y  
- Contains both U and N  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- N appears twice, positions 3 and 4 (both allowed)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L)  
- It’s a valid English word.

This seems like the best next guess.

Guess 3: funny -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “FUNNY”:

F(✓)  → F is correct in position 1  
U(✓)  → U is correct in position 2  
N(✓)  → N is correct in position 3  
N(-)  → the second N is in the word but not in position 4  
Y(✓)  → Y is correct in position 5  

So the secret word must be:

F U N _ Y  (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)  
The fourth letter must be a letter that:
- is in the word (because the second N is in the word but not in position 4, so the word must contain another N somewhere, but position 3 already has N, so the only possible spot is position 4, but N(-) says it’s not there. This seems contradictory unless the word has two Ns, one in position 3 and another somewhere else. But positions 1,2,3,5 are already F,U,N,Y. The only remaining position is 4, but N(-) says N is not in position 4. This implies the word must have exactly one N, which is in position 3. So the fourth letter must be something else.)

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: funny → F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- F is correct in position 1
- U is correct in position 2
- N is correct in position 3
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (but position 4 is the only remaining spot for another N, which is impossible because position 3 already has N and we have a 5-letter word. This suggests the word has exactly one N, which is in position 3, and the fourth letter is something else.)

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y, with the fourth letter being any letter except the already eliminated ones (A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L) and not repeating N in position 4.

Available letters for position 4: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with FUN and ending with Y:

FUNNY – already tried  
FUNNY is the only common word, but it conflicts with the feedback. This suggests the word must be FUNCY or FUNNY, but FUNNY was tried. Since FUNNY was tried and gave N(-) for position 4, the word cannot be FUNNY. The only other possibility is FUNCY.

Let me check FUNCY:

F U N C Y – positions 1,2,3,5 are correct, and position 4 is C. C has not been tested yet, and it’s allowed.

This seems to be the correct word.The feedback from “FUNNY” shows that:
- F, U, N, Y are in the correct positions (1, 2, 3, 5).
- The second N is in the word but not in position 4 (which is impossible if the word already has N in position 3 and only 5 letters). This implies the word has only one N in position 3.

Therefore, the word must be F U N _ Y. The only common letter left for position 4 that hasn’t been eliminated is C, forming the word “FUNCY”.
