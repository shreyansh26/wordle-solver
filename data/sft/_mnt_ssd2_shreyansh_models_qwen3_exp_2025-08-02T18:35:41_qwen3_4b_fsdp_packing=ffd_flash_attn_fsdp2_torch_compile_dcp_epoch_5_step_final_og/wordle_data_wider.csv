1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help reveal several letters early on, giving good coverage for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- contains the letter E somewhere other than the 5th position.
- does **not** contain S, L, A, or T.

Next, we want a word that:
1. Keeps E in a different position (1-4).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A strong candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N, E.
- E is moved to position 4.
- Uses C, R, O, N (all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out).

Another candidate could be “MONEY”, but N is in position 3 and E in 4, which is also good. Between CRONE and MONEY, CRONE has slightly higher letter frequency for C and R.

I’ll go with CRONE.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help reveal several letters early on, giving good coverage for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- contains the letter E somewhere other than the 5th position.
- does **not** contain S, L, A, or T.

Next, we want a word that:
1. Keeps E in a different position (1-4).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A strong candidate is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N, E.
- E is moved to position 4.
- Uses C, R, O, N (all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out).

Another candidate could be “MONEY”, but N is in position 3 and E in 4, which is also good. Between CRONE and MONEY, CRONE has slightly higher letter frequency for C and R.

I’ll go with CRONE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, N  
Letters definitely IN the word (but in the wrong positions): E, R  
Positions ruled out for E: 5th and 4th  
Positions ruled out for R: 2nd  

So the secret word:
- contains E and R
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3
- R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, O, N

Remaining high-frequency consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (E is already known to be present)

We need a 5-letter word that uses E and R exactly once each, avoids the forbidden letters, and places E and R in still-allowed positions.

Possible patterns:
- E _ R _ _  (E in 1st, R in 3rd)
- _ E _ R _  (E in 2nd, R in 4th)
- _ _ E R _  (E in 3rd, R in 4th) – but this would put R in 4th which is allowed
- _ _ _ E R  (E in 4th is forbidden, so skip)
- R _ _ _ E  (R in 1st, E in 5th is forbidden, so skip)

Let’s pick the pattern _ E _ R _ (E in 2nd, R in 4th) and fill with allowed consonants.

Good consonants left: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y

Try “PERKY”:
- P, E, R, K, Y
- E in 2nd (allowed), R in 4th (allowed)
- All letters are allowed (no forbidden ones)
- Uses high-frequency letters P, K, Y

Another option is “BERGY”, but “PERKY” is more common.

  – Check letters: E, I, D, E, R – but we know E is only once? No, we don’t know if E is once.  
  – Actually, we don’t have info on duplicates.  
  – “EIDER” uses E twice – but we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.  
  – Let’s try “EIDER” anyway.

Another:  
“EIDER” – E, I, D, E, R – seems valid.  

Another:  
“EIDER” is valid.

Let’s try “EIDER”.

Check letters:  
E – allowed positions (1st)  
I – allowed  
D – allowed  
E – allowed (no info against duplicates)  
R – allowed positions (5th)  

Looks good.

Let’s go with EIDER.

From the latest feedback on EIDER:

- E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- I(✓) → I is in the word AND in position 2  
- D(✓) → D is in the word AND in position 3  
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4  
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 5  

So the secret word is now fully determined:

Position 1: not E  
Position 2: I  
Position 3: D  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: R  

Hence the word must be _ I D E R, where the first letter is any letter NOT yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out (x in any position): S, L, A, T, C, O, N, P, K, Y, E (for position 1), plus any others that appeared in previous guesses but were marked x or -.

Remaining possible first letters (from alphabet minus the ruled-out set): B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet used).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these letters and ends with IDER.

Quick scan of common words:
- BIDER – not a standard word  
- FIDER – not standard  
- GIDER – not standard  
- HIDER – not standard  
- MIDER – not standard  
- WIDER – valid word  
- HIDER – valid word (variant spelling of “hider”)  
- BIDER – valid word (rare but exists)  

The most common and likely correct word is WIDER.

Let’s verify:
- W not yet ruled out  
- I, D, E, R positions all match ✓  
- WIDER is a valid English word.

Therefore, WIDER is the only logical next guess.
