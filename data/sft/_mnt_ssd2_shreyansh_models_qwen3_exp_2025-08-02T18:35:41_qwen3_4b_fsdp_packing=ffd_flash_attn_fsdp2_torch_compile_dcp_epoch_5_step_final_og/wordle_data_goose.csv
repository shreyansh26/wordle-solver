### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, T, N, S, L and vowels like A, E, I, O are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" covers several common letters and vowels, which can help identify which letters are in the word and their positions. This is a classic starting word in Wordle strategies.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the third letter is O
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E: in the word but wrong position (-) – so E appears somewhere else

We know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Must contain S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- Cannot contain A or R

Good next guesses would place S and E in new positions while keeping O in place. A word like ""HOUSE"" fits:
- H: new letter
- O: correct position (3rd)
- U: new letter
- S: placed in 4th position (new position)
- E: placed in 5th position (new position)

This maximizes information gain by testing new letters and positions for S and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ _ O S E  (positions 3,4,5 are O,S,E in that order)
2. Letters not in the word at all: A, R, H, U
3. Therefore the first two letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, H, U.

We need two distinct consonants (or one consonant and one vowel) that have not been ruled out.  
Good candidates that haven’t been tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple word that fits the pattern _ _ O S E is “POSE” but P is allowed and hasn’t been ruled out.  
Another is “LOSE” (L and E, but E is already known to be in position 5).  
“MOUSE” would fit but U is already ruled out.  
“COBSE” isn’t a valid word.  
“BOOSE” isn’t valid either.  
“DOUSE” is valid and fits: D, O, U, S, E – but U is ruled out.  
“GOOSE” is valid and fits: G, O, O, S, E – but O is already in position 3 and we don’t know about duplicates yet.

The simplest valid word that fits is “GOOSE” (G and O in positions 1 and 2, but O is already confirmed in position 3).  
Wait, that would be G O O S E – but position 3 is already O, so this would have two O’s.  
Is that allowed? The game doesn’t forbid duplicate letters, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet.

A better choice is “POSE” (P, O, S, E) but position 3 must be O, so P O S E – but that’s only 4 letters.  
Wait, the pattern is _ _ O S E, so positions 1 and 2 are unknown, 3 is O, 4 is S, 5 is E.  
So the word must be [letter][letter]OSE.

Valid words that fit: BOSE? (no), COSE? (no), DOSE? (no), FOSE? (no), GOSE? (no), JOSE? (no), LOSE? (no), MOSE? (no), NOSE? (no), POSE? (no), ROSE? (R is ruled out), SOSE? (no), TOSE? (no), VOSE? (no).

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in OSE:  
- BOOSE (archaic, but valid)  
- COBSE (invalid)  
- DOUSE (invalid because U is ruled out)  
- GOOSE (valid)  
- LOUSE (invalid because U is ruled out)  
- MOOSE (invalid because U is ruled out)  
- NOOSE (invalid because U is ruled out)  
- POOSE (invalid)  
- ROOSE (invalid because R is ruled out)  
- TOOSE (invalid)  
- VOOSE (invalid)  

The only valid word fitting _ _ O S E is “GOOSE” (G, O, O, S, E).  
But position 3 is already O, and we don’t know if O appears twice.  
However, “GOOSE” is the only valid word that fits the pattern and hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “GOOSE”.
