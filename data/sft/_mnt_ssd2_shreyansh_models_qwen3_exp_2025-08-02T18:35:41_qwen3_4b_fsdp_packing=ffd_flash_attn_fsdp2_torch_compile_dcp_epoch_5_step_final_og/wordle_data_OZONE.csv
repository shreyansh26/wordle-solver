For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate the information we now have:

   - E is fixed in position 5.

2. CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is fixed in position 5.

3. BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
   - N is fixed in position 4.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it shows “-”, meaning it’s in the word but wrong position).
   - B, U, D are absent.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: N
- O is somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 2 or 5).
  - From CHORE, O cannot be in position 3 (it was marked “-” there, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).
  - From BOUND, O cannot be in position 2 (it was marked “-” there, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2).
  - Therefore O must be in position 1.

Forbidden letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D.

Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O and N and E already placed).

Word structure: O _ _ N E

We need a 5-letter word starting with O, ending with NE, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- OFENE – not a valid word
- OXENE – not valid
- OMENE – not valid
- OPINE – uses P, I (both allowed) and fits: O P I N E

“OPINE” is a valid English word that fits all constraints:
- Starts with O (position 1)
- Has I in position 3 (allowed)
- Has N in position 4 (fixed)
- Ends with E (fixed)
- Uses only allowed letters (P and I are not forbidden)

Therefore, OPINE is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all absent from the word.
- E is present and is in the correct final position (5th letter).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Does not contain S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Looking at remaining common letters: R, N, I, O, C, H, U, M, Y, D, etc.

A good candidate is ""CHORE"":
- Ends with E
- Uses C, H, O, R (none of which are excluded)
- Contains common letters to test new possibilities

From the two rounds of feedback:

2. CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - C, H, R are absent.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ E
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, R
- Still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Looking at common words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOUND → uses B, O, U, N, D (all allowed)
- FOUND → uses F, O, U, N, D (all allowed)
- GONE? → only 4 letters
- MOUND → uses M, O, U, N, D (all allowed)

""BOUND"" seems good because:
- B, U, N, D are all allowed and common.
- It tests new letters quickly.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.

2. CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
   – N is fixed in position 4.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.

4. OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
   – O is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – P and I are absent.  
   – N and E remain fixed in positions 4 and 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined:

Position 1: O  
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Position 3: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Position 4: N  
Position 5: E  

Forbidden letters accumulated: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D, P, I.

Allowed letters left: F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form O _ _ N E using only allowed letters.

Scanning the dictionary:

- OFENE – invalid  
- OGONE – invalid  
- OJENE – invalid  
- OKENE – invalid  
- OMENE – invalid  
- OXENE – invalid  
- OYENE – invalid  
- OZENE – invalid  

Wait – let’s try O _ _ N E with allowed consonants:

- O M N E – too short  
- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting O _ _ N E is “OMNIE” (archaic plural of “omne”), but it’s obscure and uses M (allowed) and I (forbidden).  

Another candidate: “OGONE” – invalid.  

“OFENE” – invalid.  

“OGONE” – invalid.  

“OMENE” – invalid.  

“OVENE” – invalid.  

“OWENE” – invalid.  

“OXENE” – invalid.  

“OYENE” – invalid.  

“OZENE” – invalid.  

Hmm, none of the common words fit. Let me reconsider – perhaps I missed a valid word.  

Wait – “OVINE” comes to mind, but it uses V and I. I is forbidden.  

“OGONE” – invalid.  

“OMGNE” – invalid.  

Actually, the only valid word left is “OMNIE”, but I is forbidden.  

Let me check again: allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking at O _ _ N E:

- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  
- O M V N E – invalid  
- O M K N E – invalid  
- O M Y N E – invalid  
- O M X N E – invalid  
- O M Z N E – invalid  
- O M Q N E – invalid  
- O M W N E – invalid  

None of these are valid English words.  

Wait – let me think of other possibilities. Maybe “OZONE” – but Z is allowed, O is already used in position 1, Z is allowed, but O is already used.  

“OZONE” has O in position 1 and 3, but O is already fixed in position 1 and we know O is not in position 3 (from CHORE feedback).  

“OZONE” would have O in position 3, which is forbidden.  

Another candidate: “OXYNE” – invalid.  

“OXENE” – invalid.  

“OVENE” – invalid.  

“OWENE” – invalid.  

“OYENE” – invalid.  

“OZENE” – invalid.  

This is puzzling – let me check if I missed any letters.  

Wait – the allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Let me try:

- O M V N E – invalid  
- O M K N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  
- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M Y N E – invalid  
- O M X N E – invalid  
- O M Z N E – invalid  
- O M Q N E – invalid  
- O M W N E – invalid  

None of these are valid words.  

I must have missed a valid word. Let me think differently – maybe “OMNIE” is acceptable despite I being forbidden? No, I is forbidden.  

Wait – let me recheck the feedback:  

From CHORE: O(✓) – this means O is in the word and in the correct position. But in CHORE, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, which seems contradictory.  

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  

This means:  
- C, H, R are absent.  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

But this contradicts my earlier interpretation. Actually, the “✓” in CHORE means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3), and E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Similarly, in BOUND: B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  

This means:  
- B, U, D are absent.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

So now the pattern is:

- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D.  

Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

So the word is of the form: _ _ O N E  

Now I need a 5-letter word ending in ONE with the middle letters from the allowed set.  

Valid English words ending in ONE:  
- FROWN – uses F, R, O, W, N – R is forbidden.  
- GONE – 4 letters.  
- JONES – uses J, O, N, E, S – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- QONE – too short.  
- VOGUE – ends in E, but not ONE.  
- WOKEN – uses W, O, K, E, N – K is allowed, W is allowed.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

“WOKEN” is 5 letters, ends in ONE, uses W and K (both allowed), and does not use any forbidden letters.  

Let me verify:  
- W – allowed  
- O – fixed in position 3  
- K – allowed  
- E – fixed in position 5  
- N – fixed in position 4  

So the word is: _ _ O N E → W O K N E? No, WOKEN is W O K E N.  

Wait, WOKEN is W O K E N – positions: 1-W, 2-O, 3-K, 4-E, 5-N. But we know N is in position 4 and E in 5, so this doesn’t fit.  

I need a word ending in ONE, i.e., positions 3-O, 4-N, 5-E.  

So the pattern is: _ _ O N E  

Valid 5-letter English words ending in ONE:  
- FROWN – R is forbidden.  
- GONE – 4 letters.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

Actually, the only common word is “FROWN”, but R is forbidden.  

Wait – let me think of other possibilities.  

“MONGE” – invalid.  

“PONGE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E, not ONE.  

“XONE” – too short.  

“YONE” – too short.  

“ZONE” – 4 letters.  

This is tricky. Let me check if there are any other valid words.  

“MONGE” – invalid.  

“KNOBE” – invalid.  

“JONES” – S is forbidden.  

“FROWN” – R is forbidden.  

“WOKEN” – ends in E N, not O N E.  

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O N E, so the third letter is O, fourth N, fifth E.  

So the word is: _ _ O N E  

Possible words:  
- FROZE – ends in E, not O N E.  
- GONER – R is forbidden.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

I must have missed something. Let me think of other possibilities.  

Actually, “MONGE” is not a valid word.  

“KNOBE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E.  

“VOGUE” is V O G U E – ends in E, not O N E.  

“VOGUE” doesn’t fit.  

Another candidate: “KNOBE” – invalid.  

“XONE” – too short.  

“YONE” – too short.  

“ZONE” – 4 letters.  

Wait, let me think of “KNOBE” – invalid.  

This is perplexing. Let me recheck the allowed letters and pattern.  

Pattern: _ _ O N E  
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D  
Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Valid 5-letter English words ending in ONE:  
- FROZE – ends in E.  
- GONER – R is forbidden.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

Actually, the word “MONGE” is not valid.  

“PONGE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E.  

“VOGUE” is V O G U E – ends in E.  

I realize now that the only possible valid word left is “WOKEN”, but it ends in E N, not O N E.  

This suggests I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
This means:  
- C, H, R are absent.  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Guess 3: BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
This means:  
- B, U, D are absent.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

Guess 4: OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
This means:  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
- P, I are absent.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

So the pattern is now:  
- Position 1: O (from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

But this would require the word to have O in both positions 1 and 3, which is impossible in a 5-letter word without repeating letters.  

This contradiction means my earlier interpretation must be wrong.  

Re-reading the feedback:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
The “✓” symbol in CHORE for O and E means:  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Guess 3: BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
The “-” symbol for O means O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
The “✓” symbol for N means N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

Guess 4: OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
The “✓” symbol for O means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
The “-” symbol for N would mean N is in the word but NOT in position 4, but here it is “✓”, so N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
The “✓” symbol for E means E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

So the pattern is:  
- Position 1: O (from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

This is impossible because position 1 and 3 both have O, which would require the word to have two O’s, but position 3 was already marked as correct by CHORE, and position 1 is now marked as correct by OPINE.  

This suggests the word must have O in both positions 1 and 3, which is possible in words like “OZONE” (O Z O N E).  

Let’s check “OZONE”:  
- O in position 1: ✓ (matches OPINE feedback)  
- Z: not yet tested, but allowed.  
- O in position 3: ✓ (matches CHORE feedback)  
- N in position 4: ✓ (matches BOUND feedback)  
- E in position 5: ✓ (matches SLATE feedback)  

“OZONE” uses only allowed letters (Z is allowed) and fits all constraints.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is OZONE.
</think>

From all feedback, the pattern is now:

- Position 1: O (✓ from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (✓ from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (✓ from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (✓ from SLATE)  

The only valid 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is:

<guess>OZONE</guess>",OZONE,"From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.

2. CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
   – N is fixed in position 4.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 2.

4. OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
   – O is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – P and I are absent.  
   – N and E remain fixed in positions 4 and 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined:

Position 1: O  
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Position 3: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Position 4: N  
Position 5: E  

Forbidden letters accumulated: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D, P, I.

Allowed letters left: F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form O _ _ N E using only allowed letters.

Scanning the dictionary:

- OFENE – invalid  
- OGONE – invalid  
- OJENE – invalid  
- OKENE – invalid  
- OMENE – invalid  
- OXENE – invalid  
- OYENE – invalid  
- OZENE – invalid  

Wait – let’s try O _ _ N E with allowed consonants:

- O M N E – too short  
- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  

Actually, the only common English word fitting O _ _ N E is “OMNIE” (archaic plural of “omne”), but it’s obscure and uses M (allowed) and I (forbidden).  

Another candidate: “OGONE” – invalid.  

“OFENE” – invalid.  

“OGONE” – invalid.  

“OMENE” – invalid.  

“OVENE” – invalid.  

“OWENE” – invalid.  

“OXENE” – invalid.  

“OYENE” – invalid.  

“OZENE” – invalid.  

Hmm, none of the common words fit. Let me reconsider – perhaps I missed a valid word.  

Wait – “OVINE” comes to mind, but it uses V and I. I is forbidden.  

“OGONE” – invalid.  

“OMGNE” – invalid.  

Actually, the only valid word left is “OMNIE”, but I is forbidden.  

Let me check again: allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Looking at O _ _ N E:

- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  
- O M V N E – invalid  
- O M K N E – invalid  
- O M Y N E – invalid  
- O M X N E – invalid  
- O M Z N E – invalid  
- O M Q N E – invalid  
- O M W N E – invalid  

None of these are valid English words.  

Wait – let me think of other possibilities. Maybe “OZONE” – but Z is allowed, O is already used in position 1, Z is allowed, but O is already used.  

“OZONE” has O in position 1 and 3, but O is already fixed in position 1 and we know O is not in position 3 (from CHORE feedback).  

“OZONE” would have O in position 3, which is forbidden.  

Another candidate: “OXYNE” – invalid.  

“OXENE” – invalid.  

“OVENE” – invalid.  

“OWENE” – invalid.  

“OYENE” – invalid.  

“OZENE” – invalid.  

This is puzzling – let me check if I missed any letters.  

Wait – the allowed letters are F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

Let me try:

- O M V N E – invalid  
- O M K N E – invalid  
- O M F N E – invalid  
- O M G N E – invalid  
- O M Y N E – invalid  
- O M X N E – invalid  
- O M Z N E – invalid  
- O M Q N E – invalid  
- O M W N E – invalid  

None of these are valid words.  

I must have missed a valid word. Let me think differently – maybe “OMNIE” is acceptable despite I being forbidden? No, I is forbidden.  

Wait – let me recheck the feedback:  

From CHORE: O(✓) – this means O is in the word and in the correct position. But in CHORE, O was in position 3 and marked “-”, which seems contradictory.  

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  

This means:  
- C, H, R are absent.  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

But this contradicts my earlier interpretation. Actually, the “✓” in CHORE means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3), and E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Similarly, in BOUND: B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  

This means:  
- B, U, D are absent.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

So now the pattern is:

- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D.  

Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

So the word is of the form: _ _ O N E  

Now I need a 5-letter word ending in ONE with the middle letters from the allowed set.  

Valid English words ending in ONE:  
- FROWN – uses F, R, O, W, N – R is forbidden.  
- GONE – 4 letters.  
- JONES – uses J, O, N, E, S – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- QONE – too short.  
- VOGUE – ends in E, but not ONE.  
- WOKEN – uses W, O, K, E, N – K is allowed, W is allowed.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

“WOKEN” is 5 letters, ends in ONE, uses W and K (both allowed), and does not use any forbidden letters.  

Let me verify:  
- W – allowed  
- O – fixed in position 3  
- K – allowed  
- E – fixed in position 5  
- N – fixed in position 4  

So the word is: _ _ O N E → W O K N E? No, WOKEN is W O K E N.  

Wait, WOKEN is W O K E N – positions: 1-W, 2-O, 3-K, 4-E, 5-N. But we know N is in position 4 and E in 5, so this doesn’t fit.  

I need a word ending in ONE, i.e., positions 3-O, 4-N, 5-E.  

So the pattern is: _ _ O N E  

Valid 5-letter English words ending in ONE:  
- FROWN – R is forbidden.  
- GONE – 4 letters.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

Actually, the only common word is “FROWN”, but R is forbidden.  

Wait – let me think of other possibilities.  

“MONGE” – invalid.  

“PONGE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E, not ONE.  

“XONE” – too short.  

“YONE” – too short.  

“ZONE” – 4 letters.  

This is tricky. Let me check if there are any other valid words.  

“MONGE” – invalid.  

“KNOBE” – invalid.  

“JONES” – S is forbidden.  

“FROWN” – R is forbidden.  

“WOKEN” – ends in E N, not O N E.  

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O N E, so the third letter is O, fourth N, fifth E.  

So the word is: _ _ O N E  

Possible words:  
- FROZE – ends in E, not O N E.  
- GONER – R is forbidden.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

I must have missed something. Let me think of other possibilities.  

Actually, “MONGE” is not a valid word.  

“KNOBE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E.  

“VOGUE” is V O G U E – ends in E, not O N E.  

“VOGUE” doesn’t fit.  

Another candidate: “KNOBE” – invalid.  

“XONE” – too short.  

“YONE” – too short.  

“ZONE” – 4 letters.  

Wait, let me think of “KNOBE” – invalid.  

This is perplexing. Let me recheck the allowed letters and pattern.  

Pattern: _ _ O N E  
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, B, U, D  
Allowed letters: F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Valid 5-letter English words ending in ONE:  
- FROZE – ends in E.  
- GONER – R is forbidden.  
- JONES – S is forbidden.  
- KNOBE – invalid.  
- MONGE – invalid.  
- PONGE – invalid.  
- WOKEN – ends in E N, not O N E.  
- YOKEL – invalid.  
- ZONE – 4 letters.  

Actually, the word “MONGE” is not valid.  

“PONGE” – invalid.  

“VOGUE” – ends in E.  

“VOGUE” is V O G U E – ends in E.  

I realize now that the only possible valid word left is “WOKEN”, but it ends in E N, not O N E.  

This suggests I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
This means:  
- C, H, R are absent.  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Guess 3: BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
This means:  
- B, U, D are absent.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

Guess 4: OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
This means:  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
- P, I are absent.  
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

So the pattern is now:  
- Position 1: O (from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

But this would require the word to have O in both positions 1 and 3, which is impossible in a 5-letter word without repeating letters.  

This contradiction means my earlier interpretation must be wrong.  

Re-reading the feedback:  

Guess 2: CHORE → C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)  
The “✓” symbol in CHORE for O and E means:  
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

Guess 3: BOUND → B(x) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
The “-” symbol for O means O is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
The “✓” symbol for N means N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  

Guess 4: OPINE → O(✓) P(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)  
The “✓” symbol for O means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
The “-” symbol for N would mean N is in the word but NOT in position 4, but here it is “✓”, so N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
The “✓” symbol for E means E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).  

So the pattern is:  
- Position 1: O (from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (from SLATE)  

This is impossible because position 1 and 3 both have O, which would require the word to have two O’s, but position 3 was already marked as correct by CHORE, and position 1 is now marked as correct by OPINE.  

This suggests the word must have O in both positions 1 and 3, which is possible in words like “OZONE” (O Z O N E).  

Let’s check “OZONE”:  
- O in position 1: ✓ (matches OPINE feedback)  
- Z: not yet tested, but allowed.  
- O in position 3: ✓ (matches CHORE feedback)  
- N in position 4: ✓ (matches BOUND feedback)  
- E in position 5: ✓ (matches SLATE feedback)  

“OZONE” uses only allowed letters (Z is allowed) and fits all constraints.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is OZONE.From all feedback, the pattern is now:

- Position 1: O (✓ from OPINE)  
- Position 3: O (✓ from CHORE)  
- Position 4: N (✓ from BOUND)  
- Position 5: E (✓ from SLATE)  

The only valid 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is:",Guess 5: OZONE -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) Z(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
