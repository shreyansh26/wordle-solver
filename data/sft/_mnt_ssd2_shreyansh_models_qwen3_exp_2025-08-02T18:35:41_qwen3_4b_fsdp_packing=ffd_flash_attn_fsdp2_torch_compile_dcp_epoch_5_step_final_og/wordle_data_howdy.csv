### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will help identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoid A, R, S, E).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try “POINT”:
- Contains O (and it’s in position 2, not 3 – satisfies the feedback).
- Uses P, I, N, T – all new letters.
- This should tell us about P, I, N, T and confirm where O is.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)

So we know:

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- We still need to test other common letters (e.g., C, U, D, L, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W).

A good next word should:
- Keep O in position 2.
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested.
- Prefer common remaining letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “COMBO”:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- C, M, B are new letters.
- But O appears twice, which might not be optimal for testing new letters.

Instead, let’s try “COULD”:
- O in position 2.
- C, U, L, D are all new letters.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will help identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoid A, R, S, E).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try “POINT”:
- Contains O (and it’s in position 2, not 3 – satisfies the feedback).
- Uses P, I, N, T – all new letters.
- This should tell us about P, I, N, T and confirm where O is.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - P, I, N, T are all NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- We still need to test other common letters (e.g., C, U, D, L, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W).

A good next word should:
- Keep O in position 2.
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested.
- Prefer common remaining letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “COMBO”:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- C, M, B are new letters.
- But O appears twice, which might not be optimal for testing new letters.

Instead, let’s try “COULD”:
- O in position 2.
- C, U, L, D are all new letters.

This tests four new letters while keeping O in the correct position.

Let's digest the latest feedback:

Guess 4: bodgy → B(x) O(✓) D(-) G(x) Y(✓)

What we now know for certain:
- Position 2 is O (✓).
- Position 5 is Y (✓).
- D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from bodgy) and NOT in position 5 (from could).  Therefore D must be in position 1 or 4.
- B and G are not in the word (x).

Letters we have not yet tried that are common and still available:
F, H, K, M, V, W, plus the confirmed letters O, D, Y.

Structure so far:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = Y
- Position 1 or 4 = D

Let's consider the two possibilities for D:

1) D _ O _ Y
2) _ O _ D Y

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G are all out).

Good remaining consonants: F, H, K, M, V, W
Good remaining vowels: none left except O and Y (which we already have)

Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns.

Option 1: D _ O _ Y
Possible: D O O _ Y (invalid, double O), D _ O _ Y
Looking at possible letters for position 3 and 4: need two different letters from F, H, K, M, V, W
D F O H Y → ""dfohy"" not a word
D H O M Y → ""dho my"" not a word
D M O V Y → ""dmo vy"" not a word
D V O K Y → ""dvoky"" not a word
D W O K Y → ""dwoky"" not a word
D H O K Y → ""dho ky"" not a word
D F O K Y → ""dfo ky"" not a word
D M O F Y → ""dmo fy"" not a word
D V O F Y → ""dvofy"" not a word
D W O F Y → ""dwofy"" not a word
D H O V Y → ""dho vy"" not a word
D F O V Y → ""dfo vy"" not a word
D M O H Y → ""dmo hy"" not a word
D V O H Y → ""dvohy"" not a word
D W O H Y → ""dwohy"" not a word

None of these seem to form valid words.

Option 2: _ O _ D Y
Possible: F O _ D Y → ""fo_dy"" but we need a valid word
H O _ D Y → ""ho_dy""
K O _ D Y → ""ko_dy""
M O _ D Y → ""mo_dy""
V O _ D Y → ""vo_dy""
W O _ D Y → ""wo_dy""

Looking at valid English words:
- ""FOGY"" is 4 letters, not 5
- ""HOODY"" is 5 letters, but O is in position 2 (correct), D is in position 4 (correct), Y is in position 5 (correct)
- ""KODDY"" - not a valid word
- ""MOODY"" - M, O, O, D, Y - but O is already in position 2, so double O would be position 3, which is not ruled out, but we need to check if M, D, Y are allowed
- ""VOGUE"" - but G is ruled out
- ""WOOZY"" - but Z is not ruled out yet, but W is allowed, but we need to check

""HOODY"" seems valid:
H O O D Y
- H: new letter
- O: position 2 (correct)
- O: position 3 - not ruled out
- D: position 4 (correct)
- Y: position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Another possibility: ""MOODY""
M O O D Y
- M: new letter
- O: position 2 (correct)
- O: position 3 - not ruled out
- D: position 4 (correct)
- Y: position 5 (correct)

Both ""HOODY"" and ""MOODY"" fit. Between these, ""MOODY"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

Let me verify:
Letters used: M, O, O, D, Y
- M: new letter, not ruled out
- O: correct position
- O: position 3 - allowed
- D: position 4 - allowed
- Y: correct position

This seems like the best next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will help identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoid A, R, S, E).
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try “POINT”:
- Contains O (and it’s in position 2, not 3 – satisfies the feedback).
- Uses P, I, N, T – all new letters.
- This should tell us about P, I, N, T and confirm where O is.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - P, I, N, T are all NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- We still need to test other common letters (e.g., C, U, D, L, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, V, W).

A good next word should:
- Keep O in position 2.
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested.
- Prefer common remaining letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “COMBO”:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- C, M, B are new letters.
- But O appears twice, which might not be optimal for testing new letters.

Instead, let’s try “COULD”:
- O in position 2.
- C, U, L, D are all new letters.

This tests four new letters while keeping O in the correct position.

Current information:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).

3. could → C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(-)  
   – O is still in position 2 (✓).  
   – D is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L.

Letters confirmed present: O (position 2), D (somewhere else).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 2.
- D somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4).
- Only letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try “BODGY”:
- B, G, Y are new letters.
- D is in position 3 (not 5, satisfies feedback).
- O is in position 2 (correct).

This tests three new letters (B, G, Y) and places D in position 3.

Guess 4: bodgy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) D(-) G(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the latest feedback:

Guess 4: bodgy → B(x) O(✓) D(-) G(x) Y(✓)

What we now know for certain:
- Position 2 is O (✓).
- Position 5 is Y (✓).
- D is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from bodgy) and NOT in position 5 (from could).  Therefore D must be in position 1 or 4.
- B and G are not in the word (x).

Letters we have not yet tried that are common and still available:
F, H, K, M, V, W, plus the confirmed letters O, D, Y.

Structure so far:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = Y
- Position 1 or 4 = D

Let's consider the two possibilities for D:

1) D _ O _ Y
2) _ O _ D Y

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G are all out).

Good remaining consonants: F, H, K, M, V, W
Good remaining vowels: none left except O and Y (which we already have)

Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns.

Option 1: D _ O _ Y
Possible: D O O _ Y (invalid, double O), D _ O _ Y
Looking at possible letters for position 3 and 4: need two different letters from F, H, K, M, V, W
D F O H Y → ""dfohy"" not a word
D H O M Y → ""dho my"" not a word
D M O V Y → ""dmo vy"" not a word
D V O K Y → ""dvoky"" not a word
D W O K Y → ""dwoky"" not a word
D H O K Y → ""dho ky"" not a word
D F O K Y → ""dfo ky"" not a word
D M O F Y → ""dmo fy"" not a word
D V O F Y → ""dvofy"" not a word
D W O F Y → ""dwofy"" not a word
D H O V Y → ""dho vy"" not a word
D F O V Y → ""dfo vy"" not a word
D M O H Y → ""dmo hy"" not a word
D V O H Y → ""dvohy"" not a word
D W O H Y → ""dwohy"" not a word

None of these seem to form valid words.

Option 2: _ O _ D Y
Possible: F O _ D Y → ""fo_dy"" but we need a valid word
H O _ D Y → ""ho_dy""
K O _ D Y → ""ko_dy""
M O _ D Y → ""mo_dy""
V O _ D Y → ""vo_dy""
W O _ D Y → ""wo_dy""

Looking at valid English words:
- ""FOGY"" is 4 letters, not 5
- ""HOODY"" is 5 letters, but O is in position 2 (correct), D is in position 4 (correct), Y is in position 5 (correct)
- ""KODDY"" - not a valid word
- ""MOODY"" - M, O, O, D, Y - but O is already in position 2, so double O would be position 3, which is not ruled out, but we need to check if M, D, Y are allowed
- ""VOGUE"" - but G is ruled out
- ""WOOZY"" - but Z is not ruled out yet, but W is allowed, but we need to check

""HOODY"" seems valid:
H O O D Y
- H: new letter
- O: position 2 (correct)
- O: position 3 - not ruled out
- D: position 4 (correct)
- Y: position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Another possibility: ""MOODY""
M O O D Y
- M: new letter
- O: position 2 (correct)
- O: position 3 - not ruled out
- D: position 4 (correct)
- Y: position 5 (correct)

Both ""HOODY"" and ""MOODY"" fit. Between these, ""MOODY"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

Let me verify:
Letters used: M, O, O, D, Y
- M: new letter, not ruled out
- O: correct position
- O: position 3 - allowed
- D: position 4 - allowed
- Y: correct position

This seems like the best next guess.

Let’s update what we now know after five guesses.

Confirmed positions:
- Position 2 = O (from every guess so far)
- Position 5 = Y (from bodgy and moody)

Confirmed letters elsewhere:
- D is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from could and moody).  
  Therefore D must be in position 1.

So the word structure is:
D O _ _ Y

Letters ruled out completely (x in any position):
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G, M

Letters still available and not yet placed:
F, H, K, V, W

We need two distinct letters from {F, H, K, V, W} to fill positions 3 and 4.

Possible 5-letter words of the form D O ? ? Y:
