For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help reveal as much information as possible. A good strategy is to use words with distinct, frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A classic first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination provides a good mix of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

- L is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter) (L ✓).
- A is not in the word (A x).
- T is not in the word (T x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (E -).

So far we know:
- Word is _ _ L _ _ with L at position 3.
- It must contain E, and E is NOT at position 5 (since E - means it’s in the word but not in position 5).
- It must NOT contain S, A, or T.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps L in position 3.
2. Uses E in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be at 5).
3. Avoids S, A, T.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is ""FLIER"":
- F: new consonant to test.
- L: already confirmed in position 3.
- I: new vowel to test.
- E: placed in position 4 (valid since E can’t be at 5).
- R: new consonant to test.

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

- P: not in the word (x)

Therefore the pattern so far:

- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, F, I, P, O
- Still allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends in “ER” (positions 4–5 = E R)
- Contains L exactly once, somewhere in positions 1–3
- Contains no forbidden letters

Possible candidate words:
– “CUBER” – contains U, B, E, R but no L → invalid
– “LUGER” – L in position 1, U, G, E, R → valid
– “LUMER” – not in dictionary
– “LACER” – contains A (forbidden) → invalid
– “LONER” – contains O (forbidden) → invalid
– “LADER” – contains A (forbidden) → invalid

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help reveal as much information as possible. A good strategy is to use words with distinct, frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A classic first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination provides a good mix of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:
- S is not in the word (S x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter) (L ✓).
- A is not in the word (A x).
- T is not in the word (T x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (E -).

So far we know:
- Word is _ _ L _ _ with L at position 3.
- It must contain E, and E is NOT at position 5 (since E - means it’s in the word but not in position 5).
- It must NOT contain S, A, or T.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps L in position 3.
2. Uses E in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be at 5).
3. Avoids S, A, T.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

A good candidate is ""FLIER"":
- F: new consonant to test.
- L: already confirmed in position 3.
- I: new vowel to test.
- E: placed in position 4 (valid since E can’t be at 5).
- R: new consonant to test.

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

2. Letters known to be in the word: L (fixed at 3), E (fixed at 4), R (fixed at 5).
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, F, I.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ L E R that does not contain S, A, T, F, I.

Possible candidates:
- B L E N D? No, pattern is _ _ L E R so last letter must be R.
- B L E R _? No, last letter must be R so it must be _ _ L E R.
- C L E R _? No, same issue.

Looking for words ending in ""LER"":
- M U L E R? Not a valid word.

- P O L E R? Valid (one who uses a pole).
- H O L E R? Valid (one who makes holes).
- B O L E R? Not a valid word.
- G O L E R? Not valid.

Best valid options seem to be COLER, POLER, HOLER. POLER is more common.

Let's go with POLER.

Let's update our working information after the four guesses:

1. The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4-5 confirmed).
2. L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from LUGER feedback: L -).
3. U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from LUGER feedback: U -).
4. G is NOT in the word (from LUGER feedback: G x).
5. Forbidden letters so far: S, A, T, F, I, P, O, G.
6. L must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 - but position 5 is R, so L must be in position 2 or 3.
7. U must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 - but positions 4-5 are E R, so U must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- If L is in position 2: _ L _ E R
  Then U must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 would be after L.
  So possible forms: U L _ E R or _ L U E R
  But _ L U E R would put U in position 3, which is allowed (U - just means not in position 2).

- If L is in position 3: _ _ L E R
  Then U must be in position 1 (since position 2 is after L).
  So form: U _ L E R

Looking at valid words:
1. _ L _ E R with L in position 2:
   - UL CER - not a word
   - UL MER - not a word
   - UL VER - not a word

   - U N L E R - ""UNLER"" - not a word
   - U C L E R - ""UCLER"" - not a word

3. _ L U E R with L in position 2 and U in position 3:
