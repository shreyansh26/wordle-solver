For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help identify which vowels and consonants are present. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - lots of vowels)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, I'll go with **CRANE** because it has:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (extremely common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good mix of letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- E is confirmed as the last letter (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x in all four positions).

That means:
1. The word ends in E.
2. The first four letters are NOT C, R, A, N.

I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, N. Good fresh letters to test now include S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, B, etc. I want to probe several new common letters at once.

Candidate words:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E – all new letters)
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E)
- DOUSE (D, O, U, S, E)
- SLIME (S, L, I, M, E)

STILE tests S, T, I, and L in one shot, covering high-frequency letters not yet tried. That seems optimal for maximizing information.

Refining what we know:
- Position 5 must be E (✓ twice in a row).
- Letters **not** in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, I.
- The letter L **is** somewhere in the word (L got “-” in STILE → present but wrong spot).

2. Uses L in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. Introduces several fresh common consonants and vowels.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help identify which vowels and consonants are present. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - lots of vowels)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, I'll go with **CRANE** because it has:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (extremely common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good mix of letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E is confirmed as the last letter (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x in all four positions).

That means:
1. The word ends in E.
2. The first four letters are NOT C, R, A, N.

I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, N. Good fresh letters to test now include S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, B, etc. I want to probe several new common letters at once.

Candidate words:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E – all new letters)
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E)
- DOUSE (D, O, U, S, E)
- SLIME (S, L, I, M, E)

STILE tests S, T, I, and L in one shot, covering high-frequency letters not yet tried. That seems optimal for maximizing information.

Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) I(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Refining what we know:
- Position 5 must be E (✓ twice in a row).
- Letters **not** in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, I.
- The letter L **is** somewhere in the word (L got “-” in STILE → present but wrong spot).

That leaves four unknown slots (positions 1-4) with the following allowed letters:
All letters except C, R, A, N, S, T, I.

And we **must** place L somewhere in 1-4, but **not** in position 4 (since L was at 4 in STILE and was marked “-”).

To gather more information while keeping L, I’ll look for a word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Uses L in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. Introduces several fresh common consonants and vowels.

Possible fresh consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Possible fresh vowels: O, U

Candidate words:
- BLUME (B, L, U, M, E) – L moves to 2, tests B, U, M.
- HOLME (H, O, L, M, E) – L moves to 3, tests H, O, M.
- MOLDE (M, O, L, D, E) – L moves to 3, tests M, O, D.
- GLOVE (G, L, O, V, E) – L at 2, tests G, O, V.

BLUME seems best because it tests three entirely new letters (B, U, M) while shifting L to position 2.
