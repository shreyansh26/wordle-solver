For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Let me go with RAISE as my first guess.

The feedback from RAISE tells us:

- A, I, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word does not contain A, I, S, E.  
It must contain R somewhere (positions 2-5).

Because the second position is now known not to be A, and vowels A, I, E are ruled out, the only remaining common vowels are O and U.
