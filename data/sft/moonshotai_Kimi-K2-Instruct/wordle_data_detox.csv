As this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to analyze. The best strategy for the first guess is to choose a word with common letters that can provide maximum information. Common letters in English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. 

A good first guess should contain a mix of these common letters. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities regardless of the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the unknown word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S.
- Contains both O and E, but O ≠ 3rd, E ≠ 5th.
- Still has five unknown positions, but we know letters we can eliminate and letters we must include.

Good next step: choose a word that
1. Uses O and E (they must be present),
2. Avoids A, R, S,
3. Tries fresh common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) and possibly a second vowel if needed to place O and E in new positions.

Candidate template: _ _ _ _ _ with O and E somewhere except 3rd and 5th respectively.

One efficient guess is “OCEAN”, but that has an A (eliminated) and C (okay).  
Better: “TOKEN” – uses T, K, N (new consonants), keeps O and E, and has them in new positions (O at 2, E at 4).  
Another good one: “DONUT” – but it duplicates O.  
Simplest five-letter word that satisfies constraints: “TONEY” (common letters, places O at 2, E at 4).

I’ll go with TOKEN to test T, K, N while moving O and E to fresh positions.

Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE)
- A, R, S are absent.
- O is present but not in position 3.
- E is present but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TOKEN)
- T, K, N are absent.
- O is present but NOT in position 2 either.
- E is present but NOT in position 4 either.

Consolidated facts about the secret word:
- Letters that are definitely in: O and E.
- Letters that are definitely out: A, R, S, T, K, N.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – O cannot be in 2 or 3.
  – E cannot be in 4 or 5.

Hence the possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, or 3.

We also need three additional consonants (since we already have O and E).  
Available consonants not ruled out include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses O and E in fresh positions.
2. Avoids all banned letters.
3. Introduces new common consonants for maximum information.

Possible template: O or E in 1, the other vowel in a permissible slot, plus three new consonants.

One good candidate that satisfies these constraints: “DOPEY”
- D, P, Y are new consonants.
- O is in position 2? Wait, position 2 is forbidden for O (from TOKEN feedback), so “DOPEY” is invalid.

Another candidate: “COMET” – but T is banned.

Another: “POEM” – only four letters, invalid.

Try “VOICE” – but I and C aren’t banned; however O is in position 2 (forbidden).

Next attempt: “EPOCH”
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 3 (forbidden from AROSE feedback).

Next: “BORED” – but R, D are allowed but R is banned.

Let’s systematically list:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in 1, O in 4 → pattern E _ _ O _
Possible consonants in 2,3,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
One convenient word: E B O N Y – but N is banned.

E L O P E – but P, L are okay, but we already have E twice, which might waste info.

E C O L D – not a valid word.

E B O L D – not valid.

E L O P E (again) – duplicate E.

3. Tries fresh common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) and possibly a second vowel if needed to place O and E in new positions.

Candidate template: _ _ _ _ _ with O and E somewhere except 3rd and 5th respectively.

One efficient guess is “OCEAN”, but that has an A (eliminated) and C (okay).  
Better: “TOKEN” – uses T, K, N (new consonants), keeps O and E, and has them in new positions (O at 2, E at 4).  
Another good one: “DONUT” – but it duplicates O.  
Simplest five-letter word that satisfies constraints: “TONEY” (common letters, places O at 2, E at 4).

I’ll go with TOKEN to test T, K, N while moving O and E to fresh positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TOKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) K(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE)
- A, R, S are absent.
- O is present but not in position 3.
- E is present but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TOKEN)
- T, K, N are absent.
- O is present but NOT in position 2 either.
- E is present but NOT in position 4 either.

Consolidated facts about the secret word:
- Letters that are definitely in: O and E.
- Letters that are definitely out: A, R, S, T, K, N.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – O cannot be in 2 or 3.
  – E cannot be in 4 or 5.

Hence the possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, or 3.

We also need three additional consonants (since we already have O and E).  
Available consonants not ruled out include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses O and E in fresh positions.
2. Avoids all banned letters.
3. Introduces new common consonants for maximum information.

Possible template: O or E in 1, the other vowel in a permissible slot, plus three new consonants.

One good candidate that satisfies these constraints: “DOPEY”
- D, P, Y are new consonants.
- O is in position 2? Wait, position 2 is forbidden for O (from TOKEN feedback), so “DOPEY” is invalid.

Another candidate: “COMET” – but T is banned.

Another: “POEM” – only four letters, invalid.

Try “VOICE” – but I and C aren’t banned; however O is in position 2 (forbidden).

Next attempt: “EPOCH”
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 3 (forbidden from AROSE feedback).

Next: “BORED” – but R, D are allowed but R is banned.

Let’s systematically list:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in 1, O in 4 → pattern E _ _ O _
Possible consonants in 2,3,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
One convenient word: E B O N Y – but N is banned.

E L O P E – but P, L are okay, but we already have E twice, which might waste info.

E C O L D – not a valid word.

E B O L D – not valid.

E L O P E (again) – duplicate E.

Let’s try E in 1, O in 5: E _ _ _ O
Need 3 consonants in 2,3,4.
Possible word: E C H O – no, needs 5 letters.

E C H O O – invalid.

E D I T O – but T is banned.

E D G E O – not a word.

E L M O – 4 letters.

Next pattern: O in 1, E in 2 or 3.
O E _ _ _
Need 3 consonants: C, D, L, M, P, etc.
Word: O E L I C – not valid.

O E L D – 4 letters.

O P E N – 4 letters, N banned.

O B E L I – not valid.

O B E Y S – S banned.

O B E Y – 4 letters.

Next pattern: O in 4, E in 1, 2, or 3.
_ _ _ O E
But E cannot be in 5 (already ruled out), so _ _ _ O E is fine.
Need 3 consonants in 1,2,3: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.
Possible word: B L O C K – K banned.

C L O V E – C, L, V okay, O in 4, E in 5 (allowed).
C L O V E is a valid 5-letter word, uses new letters C, L, V, and keeps O and E in permissible positions.

From the three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - O and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - A, R, S are absent.

2. TOKEN → T(-) O(-) K(x) E(-) N(x)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T, K, N are absent.

3. CLOVE → C(x) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(-)
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - C, L, V are absent.

Consolidated facts:
- Must contain: O and E.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → O must be in position 1 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters so far: A, R, S, T, K, N, C, L, V.

Since both O and E must appear, and they cannot both be in position 1, the only viable positions are:
- If O is in 1, E must be in 2 or 3.
- If O is in 5, E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try O in 1 and E in 2: O E _ _ _

Possible word: O E D I P – not valid.
O E M P H – not valid.
O E D G Y – not valid.

Need two consonants for 2 and 4, and one for 5.
Possible word: O B E L D – not valid.
O B E Y S – S banned.
O B E Y D – not valid.

Next try O in 5: _ _ _ _ O
E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Need three consonants for 2,3,4: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y.
Possible word: E B O L D – not valid.
E D I B O – not valid.
E M I D O – not valid.
E D G Y O – not valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, T, K, N, C, L, V  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, E  

Position constraints:
- O cannot be in 3rd, 2nd, or 4th position (from AROSE, TOKEN, CLOVE).  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5.  
- E cannot be in 5th, 4th, or 5th position (from AROSE, TOKEN, CLOVE).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We need a word of the form
[O or E] [remaining letters]  
with O in 1 or 5 and E in 1, 2, or 3, plus three fresh consonants drawn from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
1. O _ _ _ E  (but E is not allowed in 5th ⇒ invalid)
2. O E _ _ _  (E in 2 ⇒ valid)
3. E _ _ _ O  (E in 1, O in 5 ⇒ valid)
4. _ E _ O _  (E in 2, O in 4 ⇒ invalid for O)
5. _ _ E O _  (E in 3, O in 4 ⇒ invalid for O)

So only patterns 2 and 3 are still possible.

Look for valid English words:

Pattern 2: OE _ _ _  
OE plus three letters: OE is not a common start, and I can’t think of any 5-letter English word that begins “OE…” and avoids excluded letters.

Pattern 3: E _ _ _ O  
We need three consonants (or I/U) in positions 2-4.  
Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y.

Possible candidate: E D I T O – but T is banned.  
E D G A R – R banned.  
E D G O – 4 letters.  
E D G A – 4 letters.  
E D I C T – C banned.  
E D G E – 4 letters.  
E P O C H – C, H okay, but O is in 3 (forbidden).  
E M B E D – ends in D, not O.  
E M I L O – not a word.

Another candidate: E M I G O – not valid.  
E G I S O – not a word.  
E M I D O – not a word.  
E P O X Y – P, X, Y okay, but O in 3 (forbidden).  
E P I C O – not a word.

Try “E D I T O” again – C and T excluded.  
Try “E B O L O” – not a word.

Try “E G G O” – 4 letters.

Try “E L I O T” – L, T excluded.

Try “E P I C O” – C excluded.

Try “E D I T O” – T again.

Next simple candidate: “E B O L O” – not valid.

Notice we haven’t used D, M, P, B, F, G, H, I, U, W, Y freely.

Try E D I O – no, 4 letters.

Try E D I T O – T banned.

Try E M I G O – not a word.

Try E P I C O – C banned.

I must be missing a simple word.

Let me list every consonant in order:

Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y  
Need 3 letters in positions 2-4.

One valid English word that satisfies
E _ _ _ O
is “E P O C H” – but O is in 3 (invalid).

Another candidate: “E M B E R” – R banned.

Another candidate: “E D I T O” – T banned.

Another candidate: “E D I T O” – again.

Another candidate: “E D I T O” – again.

Another candidate: “E D I T O” – again.

Another candidate: “E D I T O” – again.

I’m missing something.

Let me try brute force: generate any 5-letter word that fits the pattern E _ _ _ O using only allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y.

Try E B I D O – not a word.

I’m stuck; let me change the pattern and instead use O in 1 and E in 2 or 3.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,detox,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>As this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to analyze. The best strategy for the first guess is to choose a word with common letters that can provide maximum information. Common letters in English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. 

A good first guess should contain a mix of these common letters. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities regardless of the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the unknown word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S.
- Contains both O and E, but O ≠ 3rd, E ≠ 5th.
- Still has five unknown positions, but we know letters we can eliminate and letters we must include.

Good next step: choose a word that
1. Uses O and E (they must be present),
2. Avoids A, R, S,
3. Tries fresh common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) and possibly a second vowel if needed to place O and E in new positions.

Candidate template: _ _ _ _ _ with O and E somewhere except 3rd and 5th respectively.

One efficient guess is “OCEAN”, but that has an A (eliminated) and C (okay).  
Better: “TOKEN” – uses T, K, N (new consonants), keeps O and E, and has them in new positions (O at 2, E at 4).  
Another good one: “DONUT” – but it duplicates O.  
Simplest five-letter word that satisfies constraints: “TONEY” (common letters, places O at 2, E at 4).

I’ll go with TOKEN to test T, K, N while moving O and E to fresh positions.

<guess>TOKEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TOKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(-) K(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE)
- A, R, S are absent.
- O is present but not in position 3.
- E is present but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TOKEN)
- T, K, N are absent.
- O is present but NOT in position 2 either.
- E is present but NOT in position 4 either.

Consolidated facts about the secret word:
- Letters that are definitely in: O and E.
- Letters that are definitely out: A, R, S, T, K, N.
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – O cannot be in 2 or 3.
  – E cannot be in 4 or 5.

Hence the possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, or 3.

We also need three additional consonants (since we already have O and E).  
Available consonants not ruled out include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses O and E in fresh positions.
2. Avoids all banned letters.
3. Introduces new common consonants for maximum information.

Possible template: O or E in 1, the other vowel in a permissible slot, plus three new consonants.

One good candidate that satisfies these constraints: “DOPEY”
- D, P, Y are new consonants.
- O is in position 2? Wait, position 2 is forbidden for O (from TOKEN feedback), so “DOPEY” is invalid.

Another candidate: “COMET” – but T is banned.

Another: “POEM” – only four letters, invalid.

Try “VOICE” – but I and C aren’t banned; however O is in position 2 (forbidden).

Next attempt: “EPOCH”
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 3 (forbidden from AROSE feedback).

Next: “BORED” – but R, D are allowed but R is banned.

Let’s systematically list:
- O must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in 1, O in 4 → pattern E _ _ O _
Possible consonants in 2,3,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
One convenient word: E B O N Y – but N is banned.

E L O P E – but P, L are okay, but we already have E twice, which might waste info.

E C O L D – not a valid word.

E B O L D – not valid.

E L O P E (again) – duplicate E.

Let’s try E in 1, O in 5: E _ _ _ O
Need 3 consonants in 2,3,4.
Possible word: E C H O – no, needs 5 letters.

E C H O O – invalid.

E D I T O – but T is banned.

E D G E O – not a word.

E L M O – 4 letters.

Next pattern: O in 1, E in 2 or 3.
O E _ _ _
Need 3 consonants: C, D, L, M, P, etc.
Word: O E L I C – not valid.

O E L D – 4 letters.

O P E N – 4 letters, N banned.

O B E L I – not valid.

O B E Y S – S banned.

O B E Y – 4 letters.

Next pattern: O in 4, E in 1, 2, or 3.
_ _ _ O E
But E cannot be in 5 (already ruled out), so _ _ _ O E is fine.
Need 3 consonants in 1,2,3: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.
Possible word: B L O C K – K banned.

C L O V E – C, L, V okay, O in 4, E in 5 (allowed).
C L O V E is a valid 5-letter word, uses new letters C, L, V, and keeps O and E in permissible positions.

Let’s choose CLOVE.

From all feedback so far:

Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, T, K, N, C, L, V  
Letters definitely present: O and E  

Position constraints on O:
- not in 3 (from AROSE)
- not in 2 (from TOKEN)
- not in 4 (from CLOVE)
So O can only be in 1 or 5.

Position constraints on E:
- not in 5 (from AROSE)
- not in 4 (from TOKEN)
- not in 5 again (from CLOVE)
So E can only be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need three additional consonants from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Let’s test the two possible O positions:

1. O in position 1: O _ _ _ _
   Then E must go in 2 or 3.
   Possible word: O B E Y _ – too short.
   Valid 5-letter options: O B E L D (invalid), O B E Y A (A banned), etc.

   Good candidate: O B E G E – double E, but legal; or O B E Y S (S banned).
   Best clean word: O B E Y E – but double E is not useful.

   Another: O B E L T – T banned.

   Another: O B E L D – not a known word.

   Another: O B E S E – S banned.

   Another: O B E G A – A banned.

   Another: O B E Y D – invalid.

   Another: O B E Y E – already tried.

   Let’s try O B E Y E – but we need unique letters for information.
   Perhaps O B E D E – again double E.

   Actually, let’s use fresh consonants.  Try O M E G A – A banned.

   Seems tricky.  Let’s try the other O position.

2. O in position 5: _ _ _ _ O
   Then E must be in 1, 2, or 3.
   Need three consonants for the other spots from allowed set.

   Try E in 1: E _ _ _ O
   Need three consonants for 2,3,4.
   Possible word: E M B E D – but D is okay, positions fit.
   E M B E D: letters are E, M, B, E, D – double E again, but legal.

   Another: E M B O D – doesn’t fit.

   Another: E M B E D seems best so far, but let’s see if we can do better.

   Try E in 2: _ E _ _ O
   Word: M E D I O – I not yet tested, but O is 5, E is 2.
   M E D I O: letters M, E, D, I, O – all allowed so far.
   I has not been ruled out yet, so this is acceptable.

   Another candidate: D E M O N – N banned.

   Another: P E M O N – N banned.

   Another: G E M O N – N banned.

   Another: B E G O D – D at end, but O is 5, so B E G O D: O not at 5.

   Let’s use M E D I O.

   But I has not been tested, so it’s acceptable.

   However, let’s check simpler word: B E D O O – invalid.

   Good clean word: B E D O N – N banned.

   Another: D E B O X – X not good.

   Another: B E D O G – G okay, but O at 4 (forbidden).

   Another: B E D O Y – O at 4 forbidden.

   Another: B E D O W – same.

   Let’s return to _ E _ _ O pattern with new consonants.

   Try H E B O D – but O must be at 5.

   Let’s try G E D O B – but O at 4 forbidden.

   Simplest valid word: M E D I O.

   Let’s choose B E D O N – N banned.

   Wait, let’s list all possible _ E _ _ O words with allowed letters:

   Allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y, etc.

   Try: F E B O D – not a word.

   G E M O D – not a word.

   B E G O D – not a word.

   P E M O D – not a word.

   D E B O P – not a word.

   M E D I O is valid.

   Let’s use M E D I O.

   But I is untested and acceptable.

   However, to avoid I, let’s try B E D O O – invalid.

   Let’s try simpler: B E D O W – O at 4 forbidden.

   Another pattern: E in position 3: _ _ E _ O
   Word: P I E D O – but I is untested, P, D okay.
   P I E D O – valid 5-letter word.

   Let’s choose P I E D O.

   But I has not been ruled out, and P, D are allowed.

   So P I E D O seems good.

   Let’s select P I E D O.

   Double-check letters: P, I, E, D, O – all allowed so far.

   So guess P I E D O.
