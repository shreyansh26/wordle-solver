1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, C, I. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers different positions of these letters

This should give good feedback on multiple common letters which can help narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is the 2nd letter and is in the correct position.
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _

I need a word where:
- The 2nd letter is R (fixed).
- It does NOT contain A, O, S, E.
- It must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking for common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, H, I, U, Y.
And remaining vowel: I, U, Y.

I want to test new common letters in the remaining positions. Good candidates:
- TRUCK (but has U and C, K)
- DRINK (but has I, N, K)
- BRICK (but has I, C, K)
- GRIND (but has I, N, D)

I'll choose ""DRINK"" because:
- It fits _ R _ _ _ with R in 2nd position.
- It introduces D, I, N, K - all new letters not yet tested.
- It uses common letters that could appear in many words.

- N is in position 4 (fixed).

- D is in the word but not in position 1.

Remaining unused common letters: T, L, C, G, B, M, P, H, U, Y, W, F, V.
