For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with:

1. Common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I)
2. No repeated letters (to maximize the number of unique letters tested)
3. A good balance of vowels and consonants

Looking at common starting words, some good options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, E and gives me good coverage across different letter types.

- Avoid A and L
- Prefer common letters we haven’t tested yet (like R, N, I, C, H, O)

A word that satisfies those constraints and uses fresh common letters is “STORE”:

A good balance of vowels and consonants\n\nLooking at common starting words, some good options are:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n\nI\'ll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes the very common letters S, L, A, T, E and gives me good coverage across different letter types.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1  \n- L(x) – L is not in the word at all  \n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all  \n- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4  \n- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in position 5  \n\nSo we know the mystery word:\n1.

Let’s extract the new information from the latest feedback on TRIES:

- T(✓) – T is in the word and in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5.

Recap of everything we now know:

Positions:
1: T (locked)
5: E (locked)

Letters we know are in the word: T, R, E, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, O, I  

For positions 2, 3, 4 we must:
- place R somewhere other than 2
- place S somewhere other than 5
- use only remaining allowed letters

Possible remaining consonants: N, C, H, D, B, G, P, M, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with T and ends with E, contains R and S exactly once each, avoids L, A, O, I.

Quick candidates that fit:
- T _ R _ E   (S would go in position 3)
- T _ S _ E   (R would go in position 3)

Scanning my mental word list, “TERSE” matches the T _ R _ E pattern and uses only letters we have not ruled out:

T E R S E → positions:
1: T ✓
2: E (still needs to be placed somewhere; allowed since E can appear more than once)
3: R
4: S
5: E

All constraints satisfied.
