For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters.

Looking at these letters, I can form the word ""RAISE"" which uses R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, and it does not contain I, S, or E.

Next, I want to use other common English letters that haven’t been excluded. Good candidates are O, T, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc. I also want to place R and A in different positions from their previous ones.

Let’s try to put A in position 1 (since it cannot be in position 2). Then R can go in positions 2,3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1). I’ll choose a word that uses other common letters and places R and A in new positions. A good candidate is “ROAST,” but it contains S which we know is not in the word. Another option is “RATIO,” but it uses I which is excluded. Instead, I can use “RACON,” but that’s not common. “ROUND” doesn’t use A. “CART” is too short. 

A better option is “TORA,” but it’s 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word. How about “TORAH” – but that’s a proper noun. Not ideal. Another option is “ALTAR,” but that uses A twice. 

Let me think differently: place A in position 3 or 4, and R in a new position. A good word is “TRAIN,” but it uses I which is excluded. “TRAMP” uses P, which is less common. “TRACK” uses C, K – C is common. Let’s try “TRACK.” 

But A is in position 3 here (T-R-A-C-K), which is new, and R is in position 2 – also new. This uses new common letters (T, C, K) while avoiding I, S, E.

So my next guess is TRACK.

1. The second letter of the secret word is R.
2. The word contains A and C somewhere, but A is NOT in position 3 and C is NOT in position 4.
3. The letters I, S, E, T, K are NOT in the word.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter R.
- Contains A and C somewhere else (but A not in position 3, C not in position 4).
- Does not contain I, S, E, T, K.

Possible structure: _ R _ _ _

Let’s list possible positions for A and C:

A cannot be in position 2 (already R) or 3 (from feedback). So A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

C cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So C can be in 1, 3, or 5.

We need to assign A and C to these positions without overlap.

Option 1: A in 1, C in 3 → A R C _ _
Option 2: A in 1, C in 5 → A R _ _ C
Option 3: A in 4, C in 1 → C R _ A _
Option 4: A in 4, C in 3 → _ R C A _ (but C is in 3, A in 4 - allowed)
Option 5: A in 5, C in 1 → C R _ _ A
Option 6: A in 5, C in 3 → _ R C _ A

We should pick a valid English word fitting one of these patterns.

From Option 1: A R C _ _ → Possible: ARCHED (6 letters). ARC__ is not yielding common words.
From Option 2: A R _ _ C → ARBOR (B is allowed), but needs to be 5 letters. ARBOR is 5 letters but has B and O - allowed. But does it fit? A in 1, R in 2, B in 3, O in 4, R in 5. But we don’t know about B or O yet.
From Option 3: C R _ A _ → CRANE - but E is excluded. CRAMP - P is allowed, M is allowed. CRAMP: C in 1, R in 2, A in 4, M in 3, P in 5. A in 4 is allowed (not 3), C in 1 is allowed (not 4). This seems valid.
From Option 4: _ R C A _ → BRCAM? Not a word. DRCAP? No.
From Option 5: C R _ _ A → CRAGA? No. CRAB? 4 letters. CR__A is not yielding words.
From Option 6: _ R C _ A → BRCAA? No.

The best candidate seems CRAMP (C in 1, R in 2, A in 4, M in 3, P in 5). It uses new common letters (M, P) and fits all constraints.

- R is fixed at position 2.

A valid word fitting these constraints is **CRAMP**:

- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively, and it does not contain I, S, or E.

Next, I want to use other common English letters that haven’t been excluded. Good candidates are O, T, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc. I also want to place R and A in different positions from their previous ones.

Let’s try to put A in position 1 (since it cannot be in position 2). Then R can go in positions 2,3,4, or 5 (cannot be 1). I’ll choose a word that uses other common letters and places R and A in new positions. A good candidate is “ROAST,” but it contains S which we know is not in the word. Another option is “RATIO,” but it uses I which is excluded. Instead, I can use “RACON,” but that’s not common. “ROUND” doesn’t use A. “CART” is too short. 

A better option is “TORA,” but it’s 4 letters. I need a 5-letter word. How about “TORAH” – but that’s a proper noun. Not ideal. Another option is “ALTAR,” but that uses A twice. 

Let me think differently: place A in position 3 or 4, and R in a new position. A good word is “TRAIN,” but it uses I which is excluded. “TRAMP” uses P, which is less common. “TRACK” uses C, K – C is common. Let’s try “TRACK.” 

But A is in position 3 here (T-R-A-C-K), which is new, and R is in position 2 – also new. This uses new common letters (T, C, K) while avoiding I, S, E.

So my next guess is TRACK.

<guess>TRACK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRACK -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) C(-) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TRACK:

- T: not in the word (x)
- R: is in the word AND is in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- A: is in the word but NOT in the correct position (- at position 3)
- C: is in the word but NOT in the correct position (- at position 4)
- K: not in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The second letter of the secret word is R.
2. The word contains A and C somewhere, but A is NOT in position 3 and C is NOT in position 4.
3. The letters I, S, E, T, K are NOT in the word.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter R.
- Contains A and C somewhere else (but A not in position 3, C not in position 4).
- Does not contain I, S, E, T, K.

Possible structure: _ R _ _ _

Let’s list possible positions for A and C:

A cannot be in position 2 (already R) or 3 (from feedback). So A can be in 1, 4, or 5.

C cannot be in position 4 (from feedback). So C can be in 1, 3, or 5.

We need to assign A and C to these positions without overlap.

Option 1: A in 1, C in 3 → A R C _ _
Option 2: A in 1, C in 5 → A R _ _ C
Option 3: A in 4, C in 1 → C R _ A _
Option 4: A in 4, C in 3 → _ R C A _ (but C is in 3, A in 4 - allowed)
Option 5: A in 5, C in 1 → C R _ _ A
Option 6: A in 5, C in 3 → _ R C _ A

We should pick a valid English word fitting one of these patterns.

From Option 1: A R C _ _ → Possible: ARCHED (6 letters). ARC__ is not yielding common words.
From Option 2: A R _ _ C → ARBOR (B is allowed), but needs to be 5 letters. ARBOR is 5 letters but has B and O - allowed. But does it fit? A in 1, R in 2, B in 3, O in 4, R in 5. But we don’t know about B or O yet.
From Option 3: C R _ A _ → CRANE - but E is excluded. CRAMP - P is allowed, M is allowed. CRAMP: C in 1, R in 2, A in 4, M in 3, P in 5. A in 4 is allowed (not 3), C in 1 is allowed (not 4). This seems valid.
From Option 4: _ R C A _ → BRCAM? Not a word. DRCAP? No.
From Option 5: C R _ _ A → CRAGA? No. CRAB? 4 letters. CR__A is not yielding words.
From Option 6: _ R C _ A → BRCAA? No.

The best candidate seems CRAMP (C in 1, R in 2, A in 4, M in 3, P in 5). It uses new common letters (M, P) and fits all constraints.From the combined feedback:
- R is fixed at position 2.
- A exists but not at position 3.
- C exists but not at position 4.
- Forbidden letters so far: I, S, E, T, K.

A valid word fitting these constraints is **CRAMP**:
- C (allowed at 1)
- R (must be at 2)
- M (new common letter)
- A (allowed at 4)
- P (new letter)
