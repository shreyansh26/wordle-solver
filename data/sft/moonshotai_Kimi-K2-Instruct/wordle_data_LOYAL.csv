For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities

A common strategy for first guesses is to use words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S) which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word regardless of what it is.

Remaining common consonants that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels that have not been eliminated: I, U

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O.
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is 2: _ O _ A _

Let's try a word that fits these patterns. One candidate is ""COBRA"" but R and S are already ruled out. Another candidate is ""MANOA"" but that's not a common word. A better candidate is ""CANOA"" but that's also uncommon.

- O is in position 2 (valid spot)

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (so A must be in position 3 or 5).

Known excluded letters (x):
R, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I.

Therefore the pattern is:
_ O _ _ _   OR   _ O _ _ A

Allowed letters left (common ones): F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, Y.

We need:
- A in position 3 or 5.
- Only the above consonants plus vowels A, O, U (since E, I are out).

Plausible pattern with A in position 5:
_ O _ _ A

Simple common word fitting: “GONNA” – but N appears twice and we have no info on duplicates.
“FOYLA” is obscure.

Better candidate: “MOCHA” – but H is allowed and C is excluded (already x).
“FOCAL” – C excluded.

Wait, we need to use only remaining letters. A is the only vowel left (other than U).

Let’s try “FOYAL” – but Y can be used as a vowel-like. Not common.

Actually, a more common word is “KOALA”:
- K, O, A, L allowed.
- Positions: _ O _ _ A → K O A L A, but that has two A’s.

But the word must be 5-letter distinct or not? No restriction on duplicates.

However, since we don't know about duplicates yet, let's try a simpler word: “KOALA”.

But KOALA has A in position 3, which is allowed (as A must be in 3 or 5). However, this has two A’s and we don’t know if A appears once or twice. To avoid risking duplicate, let's try “KOALA” as it’s a valid word.

Alternatively, a better word with A in position 5: “MOLAR” – but R is excluded. “VOLAR” – L and R excluded.

Another approach: word must be _ O _ _ A with allowed consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W.

A common word: “HOTEL” – but T, E excluded.

Wait, let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ A with allowed letters:
  - F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W plus A, O, U.

“GONAD” – D excluded.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities

A common strategy for first guesses is to use words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S) which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word regardless of what it is.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
1. A(-): the letter A is in the word, but not in position 1.
2. R(x): the letter R is not in the word at all.
3. O(-): the letter O is in the word, but not in position 3.
4. S(x): the letter S is not in the word.
5. E(x): the letter E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Contains: A, O
- Does NOT contain: R, S, E
- A must be in positions 2-5
- O must be in positions 1-2 or 4-5

Next guess should:
- Include A and O in different positions
- Exclude R, S, E
- Use other common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, etc.)

A good candidate: “ADOPT”
- Includes A and O
- Places A in position 2 (new spot)
- Places O in position 4 (new spot)
- Uses T and P (common consonants not ruled out)

Guess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now have the following constraints:

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A (must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 because it was wrong in positions 1 and 2)
- O (must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 because it was wrong in positions 3 and 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, S, E, D, P, T

Remaining common consonants that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels that have not been eliminated: I, U

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O.
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O in positions 1, 2, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is 5: _ _ A _ O or _ _ _ A O

Let's try a word that fits these patterns. One candidate is ""COBRA"" but R and S are already ruled out. Another candidate is ""MANOA"" but that's not a common word. A better candidate is ""CANOA"" but that's also uncommon.

Wait, ""CANOA"" is not a valid English word. Let's think of common words:

""COBIA"" - uses C, B, I, A, O. Checks all constraints:
- A is in position 4 (valid spot)
- O is in position 2 (valid spot)
- Uses only allowed letters

Another option is ""COBRA"" but R is invalid. ""CABIN"" - but no O. 

""COBIA"" seems like the best fit as it's a valid English word (a type of fish) and satisfies all constraints.Based on the feedback, we know:
- Letters in the word: A (must be in positions 3-5), O (must be in positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T

A valid word meeting these criteria is ""COBIA"", as it places A in position 4 and O in position 2, while only using uneliminated letters (C, B, I).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities

A common strategy for first guesses is to use words with:
- High-frequency vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S) which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word regardless of what it is.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
1. A(-): the letter A is in the word, but not in position 1.
2. R(x): the letter R is not in the word at all.
3. O(-): the letter O is in the word, but not in position 3.
4. S(x): the letter S is not in the word.
5. E(x): the letter E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Contains: A, O
- Does NOT contain: R, S, E
- A must be in positions 2-5
- O must be in positions 1-2 or 4-5

Next guess should:
- Include A and O in different positions
- Exclude R, S, E
- Use other common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, etc.)

A good candidate: “ADOPT”
- Includes A and O
- Places A in position 2 (new spot)
- Places O in position 4 (new spot)
- Uses T and P (common consonants not ruled out)

<guess>ADOPT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now have the following constraints:

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A (must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 because it was wrong in positions 1 and 2)
- O (must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 because it was wrong in positions 3 and 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, S, E, D, P, T

Remaining common consonants that have not been eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels that have not been eliminated: I, U

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and O.
2. Places A in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Places O in positions 1, 2, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible positions:
- If O is 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is 5: _ _ A _ O or _ _ _ A O

Let's try a word that fits these patterns. One candidate is ""COBRA"" but R and S are already ruled out. Another candidate is ""MANOA"" but that's not a common word. A better candidate is ""CANOA"" but that's also uncommon.

Wait, ""CANOA"" is not a valid English word. Let's think of common words:

""COBIA"" - uses C, B, I, A, O. Checks all constraints:
- A is in position 4 (valid spot)
- O is in position 2 (valid spot)
- Uses only allowed letters

Another option is ""COBRA"" but R is invalid. ""CABIN"" - but no O. 

""COBIA"" seems like the best fit as it's a valid English word (a type of fish) and satisfies all constraints.Based on the feedback, we know:
- Letters in the word: A (must be in positions 3-5), O (must be in positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, D, P, T

A valid word meeting these criteria is ""COBIA"", as it places A in position 4 and O in position 2, while only using uneliminated letters (C, B, I).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4 (so A must be in position 3 or 5).

Known excluded letters (x):
R, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I.

Therefore the pattern is:
_ O _ _ _   OR   _ O _ _ A

Allowed letters left (common ones): F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, Y.

We need:
- A in position 3 or 5.
- Only the above consonants plus vowels A, O, U (since E, I are out).

Plausible pattern with A in position 5:
_ O _ _ A

Simple common word fitting: “GONNA” – but N appears twice and we have no info on duplicates.
“FOYLA” is obscure.

Better candidate: “MOCHA” – but H is allowed and C is excluded (already x).
“FOCAL” – C excluded.

Wait, we need to use only remaining letters. A is the only vowel left (other than U).

Let’s try “FOYAL” – but Y can be used as a vowel-like. Not common.

Actually, a more common word is “KOALA”:
- K, O, A, L allowed.
- Positions: _ O _ _ A → K O A L A, but that has two A’s.

But the word must be 5-letter distinct or not? No restriction on duplicates.

However, since we don't know about duplicates yet, let's try a simpler word: “KOALA”.

But KOALA has A in position 3, which is allowed (as A must be in 3 or 5). However, this has two A’s and we don’t know if A appears once or twice. To avoid risking duplicate, let's try “KOALA” as it’s a valid word.

Alternatively, a better word with A in position 5: “MOLAR” – but R is excluded. “VOLAR” – L and R excluded.

Another approach: word must be _ O _ _ A with allowed consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W.

A common word: “HOTEL” – but T, E excluded.

Wait, let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ A with allowed letters:
  - F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W plus A, O, U.

A common word: “HONDA” – but D excluded.
“GONAD” – D excluded.
“FOYAL” – obscure.

Actually, let’s try “KOALA” even with two A’s, as it is common and fits the pattern with A in position 3 which is allowed.

But let me check another: “VOGMA” – obscure. 

“KOALA” is the most common word fitting the constraints.

Let’s go with “KOALA”.We now know:
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- R, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I are all absent.
- Remaining usable letters: A, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for a common word fitting _ O _ _ A or _ O _ A _ (but A is already excluded from pos 2,4).

Valid pattern: _ O _ _ A.

The word “KOALA” fits this pattern exactly: K O A L A.
(It uses A twice, but duplicates are allowed.)

To avoid risking duplicate, let's try “KOALA” as it’s a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, a better word with A in position 5: “MOLAR” – but R is excluded. “VOLAR” – L and R excluded.\n\nAnother approach: word must be _ O _ _ A with allowed consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W.\n\nA common word: “HOTEL” – but T, E excluded.\n\nWait, let’s list possible words:\n- _ O _ _ A with allowed letters:\n  - F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W plus A, O, U.\n\nA common word: “HONDA” – but D excluded.\n“GONAD” – D excluded.\n“FOYAL” – obscure.\n\nActually, let’s try “KOALA” even with two A’s, as it is common and fits the pattern with A in position 3 which is allowed.\n\nBut let me check another: “VOGMA” – obscure. \n\n“KOALA” is the most common word fitting the constraints.\n\nLet’s go with “KOALA”.We now know:\n- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).\n- A must be in position 3 or 5.\n- R, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I are all absent.\n- Remaining usable letters: A, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.\n\nLooking for a common word fitting _ O _ _ A or _ O _ A _ (but A is already excluded from pos 2,4).\n\nValid pattern: _ O _ _ A.\n\nThe word “KOALA” fits this pattern exactly: K O A L A.\n(It uses A twice, but duplicates are allowed.)\n\n<guess>KOALA</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)\nGuess 4: KOALA -> FEEDBACK: K(x) O(✓) A(-) L(-) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From all feedback:\n\nLetters we know:\n- O is in position 2 (✓).  \n- A is in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (because it was “-” in 1, 4, 5 and “wrong place” in 2).  \n  Therefore A **must** be in position 3.\n\nLetters that are **not** in the word:\nR, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I, K, L.\n\nPattern so far:\n_ O A _ _\n\nRemaining legal alphabet (after excluding the letters above):\nF, G, H, M, N, Q, U, V, W, Y (plus A and O already placed).\n\nWe need two consonants for positions 1 and 4 that are still allowed, and position 5 can be any remaining consonant or the vowel U (the only other vowel not yet eliminated).\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words matching _ O A _ _:\n\n- GOATS – T, S excluded  \n- GOAD – too short  \n- FOAMY – F, M, Y allowed; word is FOAMY  \n- HOAGY – H, G, Y allowed; word is HOAGY  \n- MOANS – M, N, S – S excluded  \n- HOARY – Y allowed, R excluded  \n- VOAMY – not a word  \n\nThe clearest valid English word that uses only remaining letters is FOAMY.\n\nPattern check:\nF O A M Y → positions 1, 4, 5 use F, M, Y, all still legal.\n\n<guess>FOAMY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(-) P(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)\nGuess 4: KOALA -> FEEDBACK: K(x) O(✓) A(-) L(-) A(-)\nGuess 5: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) A(-) M(x) Y(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let's update everything we now know.

Known facts:
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but may **not** appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (all these gave “-” or “x” for A).
  Therefore A **must** be in position 3.

Pattern so far:
_ O A _ _

Letters already ruled out:
R, S, E, D, P, T, C, B, I, K, L, F, M

Remaining letters still allowed:
G, H, N, Q, U, V, W, Y  (plus the already-placed O and A)

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5 chosen only from the remaining list.

Allowed consonants for position 1: G, H, N, Q, V, W, Y
Allowed letters for position 5: G, H, N, Q, U, V, W, Y (position 5 may even be the vowel U)

Among common English words fitting _OA__, the only one made entirely of the remaining letters is “HOAGY” (which we already saw). Since it is still valid and only H, G, Y remain untested from that set, let’s use a different legal combination.

A valid, common word using only remaining letters is “GOATY” – but T is ruled out.
“VOYAG” – too obscure.

Next simple combination:
G O A N Y → word “GOANY” – not a word.
H O A G Y → already HOAGY.
N O A G Y → “NOAGY” – not a word.

The only clearly valid English word left fitting the constraints is **HOAGY** (a submarine sandwich), which we haven’t yet guessed and uses only H, O, A, G, Y – all still legal.

So we’ll guess HOAGY.
