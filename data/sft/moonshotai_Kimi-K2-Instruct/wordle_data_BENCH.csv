For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The top 5 most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, followed by I, N, S, H, L, etc. A good starting word should cover multiple vowels and common consonants. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This maximizes the chance of hitting at least one correct letter/position early on.

Summary of feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - letters eliminated: A, R, O, S
   - E is present (but not in 5th position)

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - letters newly eliminated: U, T, I
   - N is present (but not in 2nd position)
   - E is still present (but not in 5th or 3rd positions)

Therefore:
- Known letters: E (must be in 1st, 2nd or 4th spot), N (must be somewhere other than 2nd)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, I
- Still usable common letters: D, L, G, B, C, M, F, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- uses E and N
- does NOT use any eliminated letters
- places E and N in positions that satisfy the constraints

Let’s try to cover additional unused common consonants and see where E and N might fit.

Possible placements:
- E _ _ _ _ (position 1)
- _ E _ _ _ (position 2)
- _ _ _ E _ (position 4)

Let’s try “DWELT”:

- Uses E in 4th position (satisfies E not in 3rd or 5th)
- Uses N? No, so let’s try another word.

Next idea: use N somewhere else. Let’s try “BLEND”:

- B, L, E, N, D
- E in 3rd position – but feedback already says E is not in 3rd (from untie), so invalid.

Try “BLEED”:

- E in 2nd and 4th positions – 2nd position hasn’t been ruled out, but double E may not help.

Try “FENCE”:

- F, E, N, C, E
- E in 2nd and 5th – 5th is invalid.

Try “NEVER”:

- N in 1st, E in 2nd and 4th – both positions for E are possible (2nd and 4th), and N hasn’t been tried in 1st.

But R is eliminated, so “NEVER” is invalid.

Try “ENDED”:

- E in 1st, 3rd (invalid), 5th (invalid) – won’t work.

Try “LINED”:

- L, I, N, E, D – I is eliminated.

Try “NEWLY”:

- N, E, W, L, Y – all letters OK, and positions:
  - N in 1st
  - E in 2nd
  - W, L, Y new letters
- No eliminated letters used.

Summary of all constraints so far:

Letters definitely in the word:
- E (now confirmed in position 2)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, T, I, W, L, Y

Letters of unknown status (still allowed):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z, plus the letter N which we know exists but is NOT in positions 1 or 2.

Known pattern:
- Position 2: E
- N must appear exactly once, somewhere among positions 3, 4 or 5
- Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be chosen from the still-allowed letters.

To maximize information I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps E in position 2
- places N in a new spot
- introduces several fresh consonants that haven’t been tried yet.

Candidate: “BENCH”
- B, C, H are fresh letters
- E in correct spot (2)
- N in new spot (3)  
- C and H are brand-new letters; B is also new.

Eliminated letters check: none of A,R,O,S,U,T,I,W,L,Y are used, so BENCH is valid.
