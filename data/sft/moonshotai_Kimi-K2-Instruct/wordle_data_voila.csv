For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the information I get about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters. Some good starting words are:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates. This should give good coverage to help narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (-) → A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R (x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O (-) → O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S (x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and O (but A not in spot 1, O not in spot 3).
- Must NOT contain R, S, E.
- Letters already known to be absent: R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word without R, S, E, but with A and O somewhere (except in the positions ruled out).

Possible common letters left: T, N, I, L, U, M, C, D, P, B, H, G, Y, etc.

Good candidates that include A and O without banned letters:
- ADOPT – but contains E (no), wait it has an E, so discard.
- ABOUT – A (-) in pos 1? no, A is allowed elsewhere, but O is in pos 2? no restriction on O yet except not pos 3. B, U, T are allowed. Let's consider ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T – no R/E/S. A is in pos 1 – but feedback says A is not in pos 1 (-). So A must be in 2-5.
- AFOOT – double O is okay, but A is pos 1 (invalid).
- ALOFT – A pos 1 invalid.
- PIANO – P, I, A, N, O – no R/S/E. A is pos 3, O is pos 5. Both allowed so far.
- MANGO – M, A, N, G, O – A pos 2, O pos 5. No R/S/E. Seems good.
- PIANO and MANGO are both good, but MANGO has more common letters.

Between these, MANGO seems slightly better as it tests new letters M, N, G. 

Let's verify:
- M: not yet tested.
- A: must be in word, pos 2 – allowed.
- N: new letter.

From the two clues so far:

AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

Interpretation of every symbol:

Letters that are definitely **absent**  
- R, S, E, M, N, G  (all received ✗)

Letters that must be present **somewhere**  
- A and O  (both received – in every guess so far, so they are in the word but never in the spot they occupied)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, 2  
- O: not 3, 5  

So A must sit in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
O must sit in positions 1, 2, or 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and O (exactly once each)  
- uses none of the letters {R, S, E, M, N, G}  
- places A in {3,4,5} and O in {1,2,4}

Remaining common consonants: D, L, T, B, C, H, Y, P, F, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for words that satisfy all constraints.  
A quick scan of common patterns:

- O _ _ A _  (O in 1, A in 4)  
- _ O _ A _  (O in 2, A in 4)  
- _ _ A O _  (A in 3, O in 4)  
- O _ _ _ A  (O in 1, A in 5)  
- _ O _ _ A  (O in 2, A in 5)

Candidate words (with only allowed letters):

1. FLOAT  – F(x not tested), L, O, A, T  
   – A in 4 (allowed)  
   – O in 2 (allowed)  
   – Letters used: F, L, T (all still possible)

2. COBRA – contains R (forbidden) → discard  
3. PASTA – contains S (forbidden) → discard  
4. ADOPT – contains D and P (allowed) but also O is 4 and A is 1 (A can’t be 1) → discard  
5. POLAR – contains R → discard  
6. LOVAT – contains V and T; A=4, O=2 → allowed, but V is less common → keep as backup  
7. FOALy – not a valid word  
8. COACT – C, C, A, C, T – but C is allowed; A=3, O=2 → allowed, but A is in 3 (allowed) and O in 2 (allowed), but double C is okay.

Between FLOAT and COACT, FLOAT tests three new letters (F, L, T) and is more common, so it’s a slightly better probe.

Check FLOAT against constraints:
- Letters: F, L, O, A, T – none are in the forbidden set.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the information I get about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters. Some good starting words are:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates. This should give good coverage to help narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (-) → A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R (x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O (-) → O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S (x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and O (but A not in spot 1, O not in spot 3).
- Must NOT contain R, S, E.
- Letters already known to be absent: R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word without R, S, E, but with A and O somewhere (except in the positions ruled out).

Possible common letters left: T, N, I, L, U, M, C, D, P, B, H, G, Y, etc.

Good candidates that include A and O without banned letters:
- ADOPT – but contains E (no), wait it has an E, so discard.
- ABOUT – A (-) in pos 1? no, A is allowed elsewhere, but O is in pos 2? no restriction on O yet except not pos 3. B, U, T are allowed. Let's consider ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T – no R/E/S. A is in pos 1 – but feedback says A is not in pos 1 (-). So A must be in 2-5.
- AFOOT – double O is okay, but A is pos 1 (invalid).
- ALOFT – A pos 1 invalid.
- PIANO – P, I, A, N, O – no R/S/E. A is pos 3, O is pos 5. Both allowed so far.
- MANGO – M, A, N, G, O – A pos 2, O pos 5. No R/S/E. Seems good.
- PIANO and MANGO are both good, but MANGO has more common letters.

Between these, MANGO seems slightly better as it tests new letters M, N, G. 

Let's verify:
- M: not yet tested.
- A: must be in word, pos 2 – allowed.
- N: new letter.
- G: new letter.
- O: must be in word, pos 5 – allowed.

Thus, MANGO is a strong second guess.

<guess>MANGO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
MANGO → M(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)

Interpretation of every symbol:

Letters that are definitely **absent**  
- R, S, E, M, N, G  (all received ✗)

Letters that must be present **somewhere**  
- A and O  (both received – in every guess so far, so they are in the word but never in the spot they occupied)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, 2  
- O: not 3, 5  

So A must sit in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
O must sit in positions 1, 2, or 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and O (exactly once each)  
- uses none of the letters {R, S, E, M, N, G}  
- places A in {3,4,5} and O in {1,2,4}

Remaining common consonants: D, L, T, B, C, H, Y, P, F, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for words that satisfy all constraints.  
A quick scan of common patterns:

- O _ _ A _  (O in 1, A in 4)  
- _ O _ A _  (O in 2, A in 4)  
- _ _ A O _  (A in 3, O in 4)  
- O _ _ _ A  (O in 1, A in 5)  
- _ O _ _ A  (O in 2, A in 5)

Candidate words (with only allowed letters):

1. FLOAT  – F(x not tested), L, O, A, T  
   – A in 4 (allowed)  
   – O in 2 (allowed)  
   – Letters used: F, L, T (all still possible)

2. COBRA – contains R (forbidden) → discard  
3. PASTA – contains S (forbidden) → discard  
4. ADOPT – contains D and P (allowed) but also O is 4 and A is 1 (A can’t be 1) → discard  
5. POLAR – contains R → discard  
6. LOVAT – contains V and T; A=4, O=2 → allowed, but V is less common → keep as backup  
7. FOALy – not a valid word  
8. COACT – C, C, A, C, T – but C is allowed; A=3, O=2 → allowed, but A is in 3 (allowed) and O in 2 (allowed), but double C is okay.

Between FLOAT and COACT, FLOAT tests three new letters (F, L, T) and is more common, so it’s a slightly better probe.

Check FLOAT against constraints:
- Letters: F, L, O, A, T – none are in the forbidden set.  
- A is in position 4 (allowed).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  

Perfect.

Step 1 – Re-express all constraints  
Forbidden letters (✗): R S E M N G F T  
Letters that must appear (– everywhere): A and O  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- A: not 1, 2, 4  ⇒ must be 3 or 5  
- O: not 3, 5, 2  ⇒ must be 1 or 4  

Step 2 – Build legal patterns  
Case 1: O in 1, A in 3 → pattern O _ A _ _  
Case 2: O in 1, A in 5 → pattern O _ _ _ A  
Case 3: O in 4, A in 3 → pattern _ _ A O _  
Case 4: O in 4, A in 5 → pattern _ _ _ O A  

Step 3 – Find an English word that fits any of these patterns, uses only the still-allowed alphabet {A B C D H I J K L O P Q U V W X Y Z}, and contains each of A and O exactly once.

Scanning common vocabulary:
- Case 1: O _ A _ _ → “OVALY” (invalid), “OBAID” (invalid), “OBAMA” (invalid), “OPALS” (S forbidden) → none  
- Case 2: O _ _ _ A → “OCEAN” (N,E forbidden), “ORGAN” (R,N,G forbidden) → none  
- Case 3: _ _ A O _ → “CAHO_” (H,O allowed but no completion), “BALOO” (two O’s) → none  
- Case 4: _ _ _ O A → “VILLA”-like endings don’t work … until we reach “KOALA” → K,O,A,L,A (two A’s) invalid; “BOOBA” likewise fails.  
Wait, “ABOARD” is 6 letters, skip.  
Re-examine Case 3: _ _ A O _ with remaining letters.  
Allowed remaining consonants: B C D H I J K L P Q U V W X Y Z  
We need three more letters (total 5) taken only from the allowed set, placed in spots 1, 2, 5.

Try D I _ _ _ → DI A O _ → 5-letter word DI A O ?  “DI A O D” – not valid.  
Try C O D A _ – but O must be 4.  
Try “BIALO” – not a word.  
Try “COBIA” – contains forbidden letters.  
Eventually we find “COBRA” – R forbidden.  
After exhausting small consonant sets, one valid combination that remains is:

_ B A O _ with 5th letter among still-allowed letters.  
“C” + “B” + “A” + “O” + “D” → CB A O D – not a word.  
“B” + “L” + “A” + “O” + “W” → BL A O W – “BLAOW” – invalid.  
We finally recognize the common word “BOARD” but it uses R (forbidden).  
Another possibility: “COAT_” no.  

Re-checking Case 4 with the same constraints:  
Letters left: A and O must appear once each; positions 3,4,5 must be _ _ _ O A.  
Thus we need a 3-letter prefix made of allowed letters.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and O but only once each).  

Scan 3-letter prefixes:  
B L U → “BLUOA” – nonsense  
C L O → already uses O twice  
D I V → “DIVOA” – nonsense  
P U L → “PULOA” – nonsense  
Eventually we realize “CLOAK” – but K is allowed, yet word length is 5 and we have C L O A K → positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), K(5).  
Check against ruled-out positions:  
- O must not be 3 (from Guess 2: AROSE… but wait, in Guess 3 FLOAT feedback, O was “-” in position 3 of FLOAT, so O cannot be 3.  Hence CLOAK fails.  

Next possibility: “CLOUD” – no A.  
“CLOMP” – no A.  
“PLUCK” – no A.  
“CLOAK” already failed.  
Back to Case 1: O _ A _ _ with remaining letters.  
We need letters 2,4,5 from allowed pool.  
Possible word: O C A _ _ → O C A L A – two A’s, invalid.  
Another: O B A D H – 5 letters “OBADH” – not English.  

Eventually the only remaining common word that satisfies the constraints is “KOALA” but it has two A’s.  
After exhaustive search, the valid 5-letter English word that fits the constraints is:

CLOUD – but lacks A.  
Finally, we realize we missed the word “ABOOL” which is not standard.  

Upon careful re-examination, a correct common word fitting Case 3 (_ _ A O _) with allowed letters is “BLOAT” – but T is forbidden.  
Another correct word is “CLOAC” – invalid.  

Eventually, the only remaining candidate that works is:

CLOAK – but O is position 3 which is forbidden.  
We must accept that the constraints are tight.  

Re-try Case 2 pattern: O _ _ _ A  
Try O V A L A – two A’s.  
O B A L A – two A’s.  

Finally, the word “ABOMA” – but has two A’s and M is forbidden.  

It appears the only valid English word left is “ABOUT” – but we’ve used B, O, U, T and A.  
Check:  
A: in position 1 (forbidden) – discard.  

After deeper search, the word “ABOON” – two O’s – discard.  
Eventually, we land on:

“CLOAK” fails (O at 3).  
“VOILA” – I and L allowed, A at 5, O at 2, but O must not be at 2 (from Guess 2 MANGO feedback O at 2 was “–”).  
Guess 2 had O in position 4 (M A N G O).  The feedback for O was “–” meaning O is in word but wrong position.  So O is allowed to be in positions 1,2,4,5 except 3.  Thus position 2 is still possible.

Hence “VOILA” is invalid because it has I which was never tested, but feedback shows O at 2 was “–” in MANGO (position 4), so position 2 is allowed.  However, L and V are allowed, but we need to test new letters.  

We realize we have not exhausted the word “COBIA” – but I is allowed, B, C, O, A are allowed.  Let’s check positions: C O B I A – positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), A(5).  
Check constraints:  
- A must be 3 or 5 – here 5, okay.  
- O must be 1 or 4 – here 2, which is allowed (only 2 was “–” in Guess 3 FLOAT but not forbidden).  
- Letters used: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed (none in forbidden set).  

Thus “COBIA” is a valid word under constraints.  
It is an actual English word (a fish), and it introduces C, B, I, giving maximal new information.

We realize we have not exhausted the word “COBIA” – but I is allowed, B, C, O, A are allowed.  Let’s check positions: C O B I A – positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), A(5).  
Check constraints:  
- A must be 3 or 5 – here 5, okay.  
- O must be 1 or 4 – here 2, which is allowed (only 2 was “–” in Guess 3 FLOAT but not forbidden).  
- Letters used: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed (none in forbidden set).  

Thus “COBIA” is a valid word under constraints.  
It is an actual English word (a fish), and it introduces C, B, I, giving maximal new information.",Guess 4: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(-) A(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the information I get about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters, ideally with no repeated letters. Some good starting words are:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E

I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it includes 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates. This should give good coverage to help narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (-) → A is in the word, but not in the first position.
- R (x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O (-) → O is in the word, but not in the third position.
- S (x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E (x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must contain A and O (but A not in spot 1, O not in spot 3).
- Must NOT contain R, S, E.
- Letters already known to be absent: R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word without R, S, E, but with A and O somewhere (except in the positions ruled out).

Possible common letters left: T, N, I, L, U, M, C, D, P, B, H, G, Y, etc.

Good candidates that include A and O without banned letters:
- ADOPT – but contains E (no), wait it has an E, so discard.
- ABOUT – A (-) in pos 1? no, A is allowed elsewhere, but O is in pos 2? no restriction on O yet except not pos 3. B, U, T are allowed. Let's consider ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T – no R/E/S. A is in pos 1 – but feedback says A is not in pos 1 (-). So A must be in 2-5.
- AFOOT – double O is okay, but A is pos 1 (invalid).
- ALOFT – A pos 1 invalid.
- PIANO – P, I, A, N, O – no R/S/E. A is pos 3, O is pos 5. Both allowed so far.
- MANGO – M, A, N, G, O – A pos 2, O pos 5. No R/S/E. Seems good.
- PIANO and MANGO are both good, but MANGO has more common letters.

Between these, MANGO seems slightly better as it tests new letters M, N, G. 

Let's verify:
- M: not yet tested.
- A: must be in word, pos 2 – allowed.
- N: new letter.
- G: new letter.
- O: must be in word, pos 5 – allowed.

Thus, MANGO is a strong second guess.

<guess>MANGO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
MANGO → M(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)

Interpretation of every symbol:

Letters that are definitely **absent**  
- R, S, E, M, N, G  (all received ✗)

Letters that must be present **somewhere**  
- A and O  (both received – in every guess so far, so they are in the word but never in the spot they occupied)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1, 2  
- O: not 3, 5  

So A must sit in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
O must sit in positions 1, 2, or 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and O (exactly once each)  
- uses none of the letters {R, S, E, M, N, G}  
- places A in {3,4,5} and O in {1,2,4}

Remaining common consonants: D, L, T, B, C, H, Y, P, F, K, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for words that satisfy all constraints.  
A quick scan of common patterns:

- O _ _ A _  (O in 1, A in 4)  
- _ O _ A _  (O in 2, A in 4)  
- _ _ A O _  (A in 3, O in 4)  
- O _ _ _ A  (O in 1, A in 5)  
- _ O _ _ A  (O in 2, A in 5)

Candidate words (with only allowed letters):

1. FLOAT  – F(x not tested), L, O, A, T  
   – A in 4 (allowed)  
   – O in 2 (allowed)  
   – Letters used: F, L, T (all still possible)

2. COBRA – contains R (forbidden) → discard  
3. PASTA – contains S (forbidden) → discard  
4. ADOPT – contains D and P (allowed) but also O is 4 and A is 1 (A can’t be 1) → discard  
5. POLAR – contains R → discard  
6. LOVAT – contains V and T; A=4, O=2 → allowed, but V is less common → keep as backup  
7. FOALy – not a valid word  
8. COACT – C, C, A, C, T – but C is allowed; A=3, O=2 → allowed, but A is in 3 (allowed) and O in 2 (allowed), but double C is okay.

Between FLOAT and COACT, FLOAT tests three new letters (F, L, T) and is more common, so it’s a slightly better probe.

Check FLOAT against constraints:
- Letters: F, L, O, A, T – none are in the forbidden set.  
- A is in position 4 (allowed).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  

Perfect.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
Guess 3: FLOAT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) O(-) A(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Re-express all constraints  
Forbidden letters (✗): R S E M N G F T  
Letters that must appear (– everywhere): A and O  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- A: not 1, 2, 4  ⇒ must be 3 or 5  
- O: not 3, 5, 2  ⇒ must be 1 or 4  

Step 2 – Build legal patterns  
Case 1: O in 1, A in 3 → pattern O _ A _ _  
Case 2: O in 1, A in 5 → pattern O _ _ _ A  
Case 3: O in 4, A in 3 → pattern _ _ A O _  
Case 4: O in 4, A in 5 → pattern _ _ _ O A  

Step 3 – Find an English word that fits any of these patterns, uses only the still-allowed alphabet {A B C D H I J K L O P Q U V W X Y Z}, and contains each of A and O exactly once.

Scanning common vocabulary:
- Case 1: O _ A _ _ → “OVALY” (invalid), “OBAID” (invalid), “OBAMA” (invalid), “OPALS” (S forbidden) → none  
- Case 2: O _ _ _ A → “OCEAN” (N,E forbidden), “ORGAN” (R,N,G forbidden) → none  
- Case 3: _ _ A O _ → “CAHO_” (H,O allowed but no completion), “BALOO” (two O’s) → none  
- Case 4: _ _ _ O A → “VILLA”-like endings don’t work … until we reach “KOALA” → K,O,A,L,A (two A’s) invalid; “BOOBA” likewise fails.  
Wait, “ABOARD” is 6 letters, skip.  
Re-examine Case 3: _ _ A O _ with remaining letters.  
Allowed remaining consonants: B C D H I J K L P Q U V W X Y Z  
We need three more letters (total 5) taken only from the allowed set, placed in spots 1, 2, 5.

Try D I _ _ _ → DI A O _ → 5-letter word DI A O ?  “DI A O D” – not valid.  
Try C O D A _ – but O must be 4.  
Try “BIALO” – not a word.  
Try “COBIA” – contains forbidden letters.  
Eventually we find “COBRA” – R forbidden.  
After exhausting small consonant sets, one valid combination that remains is:

_ B A O _ with 5th letter among still-allowed letters.  
“C” + “B” + “A” + “O” + “D” → CB A O D – not a word.  
“B” + “L” + “A” + “O” + “W” → BL A O W – “BLAOW” – invalid.  
We finally recognize the common word “BOARD” but it uses R (forbidden).  
Another possibility: “COAT_” no.  

Re-checking Case 4 with the same constraints:  
Letters left: A and O must appear once each; positions 3,4,5 must be _ _ _ O A.  
Thus we need a 3-letter prefix made of allowed letters.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and O but only once each).  

Scan 3-letter prefixes:  
B L U → “BLUOA” – nonsense  
C L O → already uses O twice  
D I V → “DIVOA” – nonsense  
P U L → “PULOA” – nonsense  
Eventually we realize “CLOAK” – but K is allowed, yet word length is 5 and we have C L O A K → positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), K(5).  
Check against ruled-out positions:  
- O must not be 3 (from Guess 2: AROSE… but wait, in Guess 3 FLOAT feedback, O was “-” in position 3 of FLOAT, so O cannot be 3.  Hence CLOAK fails.  

Next possibility: “CLOUD” – no A.  
“CLOMP” – no A.  
“PLUCK” – no A.  
“CLOAK” already failed.  
Back to Case 1: O _ A _ _ with remaining letters.  
We need letters 2,4,5 from allowed pool.  
Possible word: O C A _ _ → O C A L A – two A’s, invalid.  
Another: O B A D H – 5 letters “OBADH” – not English.  

Eventually the only remaining common word that satisfies the constraints is “KOALA” but it has two A’s.  
After exhaustive search, the valid 5-letter English word that fits the constraints is:

CLOUD – but lacks A.  
Finally, we realize we missed the word “ABOOL” which is not standard.  

Upon careful re-examination, a correct common word fitting Case 3 (_ _ A O _) with allowed letters is “BLOAT” – but T is forbidden.  
Another correct word is “CLOAC” – invalid.  

Eventually, the only remaining candidate that works is:

CLOAK – but O is position 3 which is forbidden.  
We must accept that the constraints are tight.  

Re-try Case 2 pattern: O _ _ _ A  
Try O V A L A – two A’s.  
O B A L A – two A’s.  

Finally, the word “ABOMA” – but has two A’s and M is forbidden.  

It appears the only valid English word left is “ABOUT” – but we’ve used B, O, U, T and A.  
Check:  
A: in position 1 (forbidden) – discard.  

After deeper search, the word “ABOON” – two O’s – discard.  
Eventually, we land on:

“CLOAK” fails (O at 3).  
“VOILA” – I and L allowed, A at 5, O at 2, but O must not be at 2 (from Guess 2 MANGO feedback O at 2 was “–”).  
Guess 2 had O in position 4 (M A N G O).  The feedback for O was “–” meaning O is in word but wrong position.  So O is allowed to be in positions 1,2,4,5 except 3.  Thus position 2 is still possible.

Hence “VOILA” is invalid because it has I which was never tested, but feedback shows O at 2 was “–” in MANGO (position 4), so position 2 is allowed.  However, L and V are allowed, but we need to test new letters.  

We realize we have not exhausted the word “COBIA” – but I is allowed, B, C, O, A are allowed.  Let’s check positions: C O B I A – positions: C(1), O(2), B(3), I(4), A(5).  
Check constraints:  
- A must be 3 or 5 – here 5, okay.  
- O must be 1 or 4 – here 2, which is allowed (only 2 was “–” in Guess 3 FLOAT but not forbidden).  
- Letters used: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed (none in forbidden set).  

Thus “COBIA” is a valid word under constraints.  
It is an actual English word (a fish), and it introduces C, B, I, giving maximal new information.

Let’s digest the new information from COBIA:

C(x)  → C is not in the word.  
O(✓)  → O is correct in position 2.  
B(x)  → B is not in the word.  
I(-)  → I is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at 4).  
A(✓)  → A is correct in position 5.

So we now know:

- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ A  
- Required letters still to place: I (but not in position 4)  
- Forbidden letters accumulated: R, S, E, M, N, G, F, T, C, B  
- Remaining letters we may still use: D, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-known I.

We need a 5-letter English word with:
- O in position 2 and A in position 5  
- I somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)  
- No forbidden letters above.

Possible patterns:
1. I O _ _ A   (I at 1, O at 2) – but I is at 1 and O at 2; I at 1 is allowed.  
2. _ O I _ A   (I at 3) – allowed.  
3. _ O _ I A   (I at 4) – but I was at 4 in COBIA and got “-”, so I cannot be 4; discard.

So only patterns 1 and 2 are possible.

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns using only allowed letters.

Pattern 1: I O _ _ A  
Need 2 letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining allowed alphabet {D, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
Looking for combinations that form real words:  
- I O D _ A – IODIA (not a word)  
- I O D Y A – IODYA (not a word)  
- I O L A A – invalid  
- I O L D A – IOLDA (not a word)  
- I O L K A – IOLKA (not a word)  
- I O L L A – IOLLA (not a word)  
- I O L V A – IOLVA (not a word)  
- I O J A – too short  
This path seems fruitless.

Pattern 2: _ O I _ A  
Need 1 letter for position 1 and 1 letter for position 4 from remaining allowed letters.  
Looking for real words:  
- D O I D A – DOIDA (not a word)  
- D O I L A – DOILA (not a word)  
- D O I K A – DOIKA (not a word)  
- H O I D A – HOIDA (not a word)  
- H O I L A – HOILA (not a word)  
- H O I K A – HOIKA (not a word)  
- L O I D A – LOIDA (not a word)  
- L O I L A – LOILA (not a word)  
- L O I K A – LOIKA (not a word)  
- P O I D A – POIDA (not a word)  
- P O I L A – POILA (not a word)  
- P O I K A – POIKA (not a word)  
- V O I D A – VOIDA (not a word)  
- V O I L A – VOILA (this is a 5-letter word meaning “there it is” or “behold”).  
Check VOILA against constraints:  
- V(1) – allowed  
- O(2) – correct  
- I(3) – acceptable (I not at 4)  
- L(4) – allowed  
- A(5) – correct  
- No forbidden letters: V, O, I, L, A – all allowed.  

Thus, VOILA satisfies every constraint.
