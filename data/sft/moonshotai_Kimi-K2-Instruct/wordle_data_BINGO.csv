I'm starting fresh with no prior feedback. My goal is to choose a strong opening word that contains common letters and maximizes information gathering. 

Common starting strategies include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring letters (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Including vowels to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
3. Avoiding double letters in the first guess to maximize letter coverage

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, RAISE, AUDIO, ADIEU, etc. These all contain multiple high-frequency letters and good vowel coverage.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants
- No letter repeats
- Covers different parts of the alphabet

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word at all
- R: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- N: in the word but in the wrong position (so not in position 4)
- E: not in the word at all

So we now know:
- The word contains N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 possible).
- It definitely does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We need a word that:
1. Has N in it (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

I'll try a word that incorporates N and some of the remaining common letters. ""POINT"" would normally be good but contains I and O which are still possible. However, it uses T which is common. Let me think of a better one.

Actually, let me try ""STING"":
- S, T, I, N, G - all still possible letters
- N is in a different position (4) than before (but we know N is in word, just not position 4, so this is okay as a probe)
But wait, this might not be optimal since N is again in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Better: ""STONG"" isn't valid. ""STING"" has N in 4 again.

Summary of known facts  
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, O

From Guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
From Guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 2, and O is in the word but not in position 3.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both N and O  
- places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4  
- places O somewhere other than position 3  
- avoids the excluded letters C, R, A, E, S, U, T

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common, still-allowed letters (e.g., D, I, L, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.).

A straightforward candidate: “INBOX”
- contains both I (new vowel) and N, O  
- N is in position 2 – but we know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “BLOND”
- contains N and O  
- N is in position 4 – but we already know N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “DINGO”
- N in position 3 (allowed)  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- uses D, I, G (all still allowed)  
- no forbidden letters  
→ looks good.

Let me verify:  
D I N G O  
- N is in position 3 (allowed)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- avoids all excluded letters  
- uses common new letters D, I, G.

Therefore “DINGO” is a strong next guess.

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, O

From Guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
From Guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 2, and O is in the word but not in position 3.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both N and O  
- places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4  
- places O somewhere other than position 3  
- avoids the excluded letters C, R, A, E, S, U, T

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common, still-allowed letters (e.g., D, I, L, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.).

A straightforward candidate: “INBOX”
- contains both I (new vowel) and N, O  
- N is in position 2 – but we know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “BLOND”
- contains N and O  
- N is in position 4 – but we already know N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “DINGO”
- N in position 3 (allowed)  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- uses D, I, G (all still allowed)  
- no forbidden letters  
→ looks good.

Let me verify:  
D I N G O  
- N is in position 3 (allowed)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- avoids all excluded letters  
- uses common new letters D, I, G.

Therefore “DINGO” is a strong next guess.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters

- No letter repeats
- Covers different parts of the alphabet

So we now know:
- The word contains N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 possible).
- It definitely does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We need a word that:
1. Has N in it (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

I'll try a word that incorporates N and some of the remaining common letters. ""POINT"" would normally be good but contains I and O which are still possible. However, it uses T which is common. Let me think of a better one.

Actually, let me try ""STING"":
- S, T, I, N, G - all still possible letters
- N is in a different position (4) than before (but we know N is in word, just not position 4, so this is okay as a probe)
But wait, this might not be optimal since N is again in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Better: ""STONG"" isn't valid. ""STING"" has N in 4 again.

Among these, the simplest 5-letter word that is valid and fits the pattern _ I N G O is “MINGO” (since BINGO, PINGO, etc. are also valid, but M is a very common initial letter).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BINGO,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>I'm starting fresh with no prior feedback. My goal is to choose a strong opening word that contains common letters and maximizes information gathering. 

Common starting strategies include:
1. Using words with frequently occurring letters (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Including vowels to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
3. Avoiding double letters in the first guess to maximize letter coverage

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, RAISE, AUDIO, ADIEU, etc. These all contain multiple high-frequency letters and good vowel coverage.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- C, R, A, N, E are all very common letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants
- No letter repeats
- Covers different parts of the alphabet

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word at all
- R: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- N: in the word but in the wrong position (so not in position 4)
- E: not in the word at all

So we now know:
- The word contains N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 possible).
- It definitely does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We need a word that:
1. Has N in it (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants still available: S, T, L, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

I'll try a word that incorporates N and some of the remaining common letters. ""POINT"" would normally be good but contains I and O which are still possible. However, it uses T which is common. Let me think of a better one.

Actually, let me try ""STING"":
- S, T, I, N, G - all still possible letters
- N is in a different position (4) than before (but we know N is in word, just not position 4, so this is okay as a probe)
But wait, this might not be optimal since N is again in position 4 which we know is wrong.

Better: ""STONG"" isn't valid. ""STING"" has N in 4 again. 

Let me choose ""SNOUT"":
- S, N, O, U, T - all valid letters from remaining pool
- N is in position 2 (different from position 4 before)
- Uses O and U to test new vowels

<guess>SNOUT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, S, U, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, O

From Guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
From Guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 2, and O is in the word but not in position 3.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both N and O  
- places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4  
- places O somewhere other than position 3  
- avoids the excluded letters C, R, A, E, S, U, T

Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common, still-allowed letters (e.g., D, I, L, M, P, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.).

A straightforward candidate: “INBOX”
- contains both I (new vowel) and N, O  
- N is in position 2 – but we know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “BLOND”
- contains N and O  
- N is in position 4 – but we already know N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE feedback)  
→ discard.

Try “DINGO”
- N in position 3 (allowed)  
- O in position 5 (allowed)  
- uses D, I, G (all still allowed)  
- no forbidden letters  
→ looks good.

Let me verify:  
D I N G O  
- N is in position 3 (allowed)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- avoids all excluded letters  
- uses common new letters D, I, G.

Therefore “DINGO” is a strong next guess.

The only character still unknown is the letter in position 1.

Letters already ruled out across all guesses:  
C, R, A, E, S, U, T, D

We need a consonant that hasn’t been tried yet and fits at the front of the pattern:

_ I N G O

Common unused consonants: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Of these, “L,” “M,” “P,” “B,” “K,” and “F” all can begin valid English words.  
The most common first letter for “_INGO” words is “L” (as in “LINGO” itself), but that might be too obvious. Let’s think of the simplest valid word: LINGO.

LINGO satisfies:
- Starts with L  
- Matches the confirmed pattern _ I N G O.

So the only sensible next guess is the word that fits the pattern exactly.

(There’s no need for further exploration; we have four letters locked in place.)
