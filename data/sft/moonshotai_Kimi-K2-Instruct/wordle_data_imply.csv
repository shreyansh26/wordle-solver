For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The word should also have distinct letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Some good first guesses include words like:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- SLANT
- STARE

Among these, CRANE is a strong choice because:
1. It contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
2. These letters appear in many English words
3. All letters are distinct, giving maximum information

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

The feedback for CRANE shows all letters are wrong (x for each letter). This gives us two key pieces of information:
1. The secret word does NOT contain any of C, R, A, N, E.
2. We need to choose a word with entirely different letters for the next guess.

Common letters not used yet: S, T, O, L, I, D, U, M, P, etc.  
A strong second guess should use a fresh set of high-frequency letters to maximize information. 

Good options:
- STOLI (S, T, O, L, I) – hits common consonants and vowels.
- DOUBT (D, O, U, B, T) – includes U and common consonants.
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – uses S, L, U, M, P.

SLUMP is a solid choice because:
- S and L are very common consonants.
- U is a high-frequency vowel.
- M and P are also common.
- No overlap with CRANE.

Let’s go with SLUMP.
