### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained. Common strategies include:
1. Using a word with frequently occurring letters (like vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoiding repeated letters to test more unique characters
3. Choosing a word with good letter distribution

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers common letters S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should help identify which of these key letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

So the unknown word:
1. Contains the letter A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Has letters drawn from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

Next steps:
- Introduce new, common letters (especially vowels and high-frequency consonants) while avoiding C, R, N, E and keeping A in a new spot.
- Good consonants to test now: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H.
- Good vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

Let’s test a word that:
- Uses A in a different position.
- Packs in other common, untested letters (S, T, L, O, etc.).

A strong candidate is “SALTY”:
- S, T, L, Y are all common, untested letters.
- A is moved to position 2.
- No repeats of banned letters (C, R, N, E).

Another good choice is “GHAST”:
- G, H, S, T are untested.
- A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong; so discard this.

“SALTY” seems best: fresh letters, moves A, tests S/T/L.

Current deductions:
- Forbidden letters (never appear): C, R, N, E, S, L, T, Y, U, I
- Present letters:
  – A (must appear, but NOT in positions 1 or 2)
  – D (must appear in position 3)
- O is somewhere in the word (but not in position 5, since AUDIO got O(-) in position 5)
- Remaining usable letters: A, D, O, plus any of B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Pattern so far: _ _ D _ _
Positions A can occupy: 3 is taken by D, so A can be in 4 or 5.
Positions O can occupy: not 5 (because of the feedback), so 1, 2, or 4.
We need a word that:
1. Has D in position 3
2. Has A in position 4 or 5
3. Has O somewhere else (1, 2, or 4, but 4 might be taken by A)
4. All other letters must be from the still-allowed set {B,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Z}

Candidate constructions:
- If A is in 4: _ O D A _  → need a valid word like PODAH? no.
- If A is in 5: _ O D _ A  → second letter O, fifth letter A, third letter D
  – BODGA? no.
  – GODSA? no.
  – HODJA? no.
  – MODGA? no.
  – POGDA? no.
  – Looking for common words: “PAGOD” is archaic.
  – “GOOD” is 4 letters.
  – Actually “PAGODA” is 6 letters.
  – Let’s list 5-letter real words:

Real 5-letter words fitting _ O D _ A:
- BODGE: but G and E; E is forbidden.
- MODAL: but L is forbidden.
- GODAN: not a word.
- PODIA: but I is forbidden.
- CODA? – 4 letters and C forbidden.
- HOAGY: H O A G Y – Y is forbidden.
- A real one: BODHA? Not English.
- Another: GONDA? No.
- Finally: MODUS? S and U are forbidden.
- Check dictionary: “PODGY” – Y out, “HODAD” – second D? no.
- Actually: “HODAD” has two D’s (second D is extra), not allowed.
- “GOUDA” – U forbidden.
- “BUMPY” – Y forbidden.
- “GUMMY” – Y forbidden.
- “PUPPY” – Y forbidden.
- “VODKA” – K is allowed and A is allowed in 5, O in 2, D in 3, V and K are allowed.

VODKA:
- Letters: V (allowed), O (allowed), D (position 3 ✓), K (allowed), A (position 5 ✓)
- No forbidden letters.
- Real English word.

So the logical next guess is VODKA.
