Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that can maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters. The word should ideally have:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
- No repeating letters to cover more possibilities

A classic strong first guess is ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of the most frequent English letters while avoiding repetition.

From the feedback:

R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
I(-) – I is in the word, but not in position 3.  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.  

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter I, but NOT in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, S, E.

Because those letters are eliminated, I should pick a word that:
  – has I somewhere (but not in position 3)
  – uses none of R, A, S, E
  – uses other common consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (T, N, L, C, H, D, etc.)
  – ideally avoids repeating any letter to maximize new information.

A good candidate is “UNITY”:
- U, N, T, Y are all still possible
- I is present (in position 4, not 3, satisfying the feedback)
- No R, A, S, E
All constraints are satisfied.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters. The word should ideally have:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
- No repeating letters to cover more possibilities

A classic strong first guess is ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of the most frequent English letters while avoiding repetition.

R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
I(-) – I is in the word, but not in position 3.  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.  

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter I, but NOT in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, S, E.

Because those letters are eliminated, I should pick a word that:
  – has I somewhere (but not in position 3)
  – uses none of R, A, S, E
  – uses other common consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (T, N, L, C, H, D, etc.)
  – ideally avoids repeating any letter to maximize new information.

A good candidate is “UNITY”:
- U, N, T, Y are all still possible
- I is present (in position 4, not 3, satisfying the feedback)
- No R, A, S, E

Possible combinations:
  1. C I N C Y → “cinch” is 5 letters, but “CINCY” is obscure.
  2. F I N F Y → not a word.
  3. H I N H Y → no.

  7. W I N W Y → no.
  8. Z I N Z Y → no.

But wait — “C” and “F” are the most common remaining.

  - I is confirmed in position 2.

  - N is already used in position 3, so position 4 needs a new letter: “N” again would be duplicate, and “Y” is already in position 5.  
  - “FINNY” uses F, I, N, N, Y — but we have no constraint against duplicate letters (only that the letter must be in the word somewhere). The feedback never indicated that letters cannot repeat.

Thus “FINNY” is a valid next guess.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

Letters known to be absent: R, A, S, E, U, T  
Letters known to be present (but position unknown): I, N  
Position 5 is definitely Y.  
So our word ends with ...Y.  
I must appear somewhere in positions 1,2,4 (since position 3 was excluded by Guess 1 and position 5 is Y).  
N must appear somewhere not in position 2.

We have only five letters left to place: I, N, and three yet-to-be-tested consonants, with Y fixed at the end.

Popular consonants still available: D, L, C, G, H, B, M, etc.

A simple next word that satisfies all constraints:  
- ends in Y  
- contains I and N somewhere (I not in position 3)  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out  
- introduces new common consonants

Candidate: “DINGY”  
- consonants D, N, G are new tests  
- I in position 2 (allowed)  
- N in position 3 (allowed this time, since only Guess 2 said “wrong position”; nothing prevents it now)  
- ends with Y  
- no letters already ruled out

Guess 3: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. RAISE: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)  
   → no R A S E; I exists but not in position 3.

2. UNITY: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)  
   → no U T; I exists but not in 3; N exists but not in 2; Y is correct in position 5.

3. DINGY: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)  
   → no D G; I is now pinned at position 2; N is now pinned at position 3; Y is at position 5.

So we know the structure:  
_ I N _ Y

Letters already ruled out: R, A, S, E, U, T, D, G

Still allowed consonants: C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z, etc.

We want a common English word with pattern _ I N _ Y.

Common choices:  
- M I N C Y (but C is allowed, word “MINCY” is obscure)  
- F I N C Y (also obscure)  
- P I N K Y (common enough, and all letters allowed)  
- V I N C Y (obscure)

Between these, “PINKY” is the most common English word and satisfies every constraint.

Letters used: P, I, N, K, Y  
- P: new test  
- I: confirmed in position 2  
- N: confirmed in position 3  
- K: new test  
- Y: confirmed in position 5  

No ruled-out letters appear.

Guess 4: PINKY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) N(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all the feedback:

- Pattern so far: _ I N _ Y (positions 2 = I, 3 = N, 5 = Y)
- Letters excluded altogether: R, A, S, E, U, T, D, G, P, K
- Remaining consonants that could still go in positions 1 or 4: C, F, H, L, M, V, W, Z, (and others, but sticking to common ones)

We need a common 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ I N _ Y and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Looking at common English words:

- C, F, H, L, M, V, W, Z can occupy positions 1 or 4.

Possible combinations:
  1. C I N C Y → “cinch” is 5 letters, but “CINCY” is obscure.
  2. F I N F Y → not a word.
  3. H I N H Y → no.
  4. L I N L Y → “linaly” is not standard.
  5. M I N M Y → no.
  6. V I N V Y → no.
  7. W I N W Y → no.
  8. Z I N Z Y → no.

But wait — “C” and “F” are the most common remaining.  
“FINNY” is a known English word (relating to fins or fish) and fits:
  - F is allowed (not ruled out).
  - I is confirmed in position 2.
  - N is confirmed in position 3.
  - N is already used in position 3, so position 4 needs a new letter: “N” again would be duplicate, and “Y” is already in position 5.  
  - “FINNY” uses F, I, N, N, Y — but we have no constraint against duplicate letters (only that the letter must be in the word somewhere). The feedback never indicated that letters cannot repeat.

Thus “FINNY” is a valid next guess.

We need a 5-letter word of the form C _ I N N Y or H _ I N N Y, etc.

The only common English word that fits the exact pattern _ I N N Y is:

CINNY — but that’s not a standard word.

WINNY — not standard.

MINNY — not standard.

LINNY — not standard.

VINNY — this is a proper noun (nickname for Vincent), but not a standard dictionary word.

HINNY — yes! “HINNY” is in the dictionary: it’s the offspring of a male horse and a female donkey.

It fits perfectly:
- H is not excluded.
- I, N, N, Y are already confirmed.
