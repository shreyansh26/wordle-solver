For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy. 

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T) in good positions. 

""STARE"" is also strong - it has three top consonants (S, T, R) and two top vowels (A, E).

After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" - it has:

- _ _ _ N I → e.g. ""M _ _ N I"" but M untested

A balanced word that tests new consonants while keeping N fixed and placing I in a new spot: ""SING_"" would repeat N, so better choice is ""DINGO"" but O is out. Next: ""MINTY"" uses M, I (position 2), N (4), T (5), Y (5) but T is out.

Best simple candidate fitting constraints: ""DING_"" is invalid (O out), so try ""MINTY"" → T is out.

Looking at letter frequency in English, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy. 

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T) in good positions. 

""STARE"" is also strong - it has three top consonants (S, T, R) and two top vowels (A, E).

   ⇒ Letters now also ruled out: P, O, T  
   ⇒ Updated pattern: _ _ _ N _ with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5

Common 5-letter words that fit _ _ _ N _ and contain I (not in 3rd) include:
- S _ I N _  (but T is out, so S might be next best consonant)
- _ I _ N _  (I in 2nd)
- _ _ I N _  (I in 3rd is invalid per feedback)
- _ _ _ N I (I in 5th)

Testing I in 2nd and 5th positions:
- S _ I N _  → ""S"" is still possible
- _ I _ N _  → e.g. ""DING_"" but G is untested
- _ _ _ N I → e.g. ""M _ _ N I"" but M untested

A balanced word that tests new consonants while keeping N fixed and placing I in a new spot: ""SING_"" would repeat N, so better choice is ""DINGO"" but O is out. Next: ""MINTY"" uses M, I (position 2), N (4), T (5), Y (5) but T is out.

Best simple candidate fitting constraints: ""DING_"" is invalid (O out), so try ""MINTY"" → T is out. 

Re-evaluate: must have I in position 2 or 5, with N at 4. Valid words:
- ""LINGO"" – O is out
- ""SINUS"" – U/S untested, but S and U are new, N fixed, I in 2
- ""WINCH"" – C is out
- ""MINUS"" – fits: M, I (2), N (4), U, S

""MINUS"" tests new letters M, U, S while keeping I in 2nd and N in 4th.

1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy. 

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T) in good positions. 

""STARE"" is also strong - it has three top consonants (S, T, R) and two top vowels (A, E).

After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" - it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R, N (very common consonants)
- A, E (top vowels)
This gives good coverage across common letters without being too vowel-heavy.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)

So the word looks like: _ _ _ N _

Letters to avoid entirely: C, R, A, E  
Letters we know are in the word: N (fixed at position 4)

We need to test new consonants and vowels. Good next candidates should:
1. Keep N in the 4th spot
2. Introduce new common letters like S, T, L, M, D, O, I, U
3. Avoid C, R, A, E

Possible structures:
- _ I _ N _  (trying I as a vowel)
- _ O _ N _  (trying O)
- _ U _ N _  (trying U)
- S _ _ N _  (testing S)
- T _ _ N _  (testing T)

Combining these, ""POINT"" is a strong candidate - it introduces P, O, I, T (all new letters) while keeping N in the correct spot. Other options like ""SLING"" or ""BLOND"" repeat letters we haven't confirmed, but ""POINT"" gives maximum new information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, ""AROSE"" might be too vowel-heavy. 

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T) in good positions. 

""STARE"" is also strong - it has three top consonants (S, T, R) and two top vowels (A, E).

After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"" - it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R, N (very common consonants)
- A, E (top vowels)
This gives good coverage across common letters without being too vowel-heavy.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)

So the word looks like: _ _ _ N _

Letters to avoid entirely: C, R, A, E  
Letters we know are in the word: N (fixed at position 4)

We need to test new consonants and vowels. Good next candidates should:
1. Keep N in the 4th spot
2. Introduce new common letters like S, T, L, M, D, O, I, U
3. Avoid C, R, A, E

Possible structures:
- _ I _ N _  (trying I as a vowel)
- _ O _ N _  (trying O)
- _ U _ N _  (trying U)
- S _ _ N _  (testing S)
- T _ _ N _  (testing T)

Combining these, ""POINT"" is a strong candidate - it introduces P, O, I, T (all new letters) while keeping N in the correct spot. Other options like ""SLING"" or ""BLOND"" repeat letters we haven't confirmed, but ""POINT"" gives maximum new information.

Let me choose ""POINT"" to test P, O, I, T with N fixed.

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word pattern: _ _ _ N _  
   ⇒ Letters definitely out: C, R, A, E

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(-) N(✓) T(x)  
   ⇒ I is in the word but **not** in position 3  
   ⇒ Letters now also ruled out: P, O, T  
   ⇒ Updated pattern: _ _ _ N _ with I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5

Common 5-letter words that fit _ _ _ N _ and contain I (not in 3rd) include:
- S _ I N _  (but T is out, so S might be next best consonant)
- _ I _ N _  (I in 2nd)
- _ _ I N _  (I in 3rd is invalid per feedback)
- _ _ _ N I (I in 5th)

Testing I in 2nd and 5th positions:
- S _ I N _  → ""S"" is still possible
- _ I _ N _  → e.g. ""DING_"" but G is untested
- _ _ _ N I → e.g. ""M _ _ N I"" but M untested

A balanced word that tests new consonants while keeping N fixed and placing I in a new spot: ""SING_"" would repeat N, so better choice is ""DINGO"" but O is out. Next: ""MINTY"" uses M, I (position 2), N (4), T (5), Y (5) but T is out.

Best simple candidate fitting constraints: ""DING_"" is invalid (O out), so try ""MINTY"" → T is out. 

Re-evaluate: must have I in position 2 or 5, with N at 4. Valid words:
- ""LINGO"" – O is out
- ""SINUS"" – U/S untested, but S and U are new, N fixed, I in 2
- ""WINCH"" – C is out
- ""MINUS"" – fits: M, I (2), N (4), U, S

""MINUS"" tests new letters M, U, S while keeping I in 2nd and N in 4th.

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, M, U, S
3. Remaining common consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, V, W, Y
4. Remaining common vowels to test: none (A, E, O, U ruled out; I already placed)
