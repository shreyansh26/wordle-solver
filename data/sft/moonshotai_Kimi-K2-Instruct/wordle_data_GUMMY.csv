For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters and can help me quickly identify patterns. The best starting words often use common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""STARE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- T (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on STARE (S T A R E all marked x), we now know:

- None of the letters S, T, A, R, E appear in the secret word at all.
- So the word must be formed entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize new information quickly, I should pick a next guess that uses five completely new letters and also covers common letters that were not in STARE. The most common letters not yet used are: I, N, O, L, U, D, C, etc.

A good candidate word that uses five fresh, fairly common letters is “MOUND”:

- M – common consonant
- O – common vowel
- U – common vowel
- N – frequent consonant
- D – frequent consonant

None of these letters (M, O, U, N, D) were in STARE, so they are all untested. This guess should give us new information on the presence of any of these letters or their positions.

Let's update our knowledge:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
S, T, A, R, E, O, N, D, L, C, H

Letters known to be in the word:
- U is in the word and is in position 2 (because MULCH gave U(✓)).

We still know M is somewhere in the word (from MOUND), but not in position 1.

So the word has structure: _ U _ _ _

Letters we have not yet tested (ignoring the excluded list):
B, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus M.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains M somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the untested set above.

Candidate words:
- BUMPY – uses B, P, Y (all untested)
- FUMPY – F, P, Y
- GUMMY – G, M, Y (but M would repeat, which is allowed, but not ideal)
- JUMPY – J, P, Y
- MUMMY – repeats M too much

- U is in the word and is in position 2 (because MULCH gave U(✓)).

Letters we have not yet tested (ignoring the excluded list):

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains M somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the untested set above.

Candidate words:
- BUMPY – uses B, P, Y (all untested)
- FUMPY – F, P, Y

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best starting words often use common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""STARE"" because it includes:
- S (very common)
- T (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

- None of the letters S, T, A, R, E appear in the secret word at all.
- So the word must be formed entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize new information quickly, I should pick a next guess that uses five completely new letters and also covers common letters that were not in STARE. The most common letters not yet used are: I, N, O, L, U, D, C, etc.

A good candidate word that uses five fresh, fairly common letters is “MOUND”:

- M – common consonant
- O – common vowel
- U – common vowel
- N – frequent consonant
- D – frequent consonant

None of these letters (M, O, U, N, D) were in STARE, so they are all untested. This guess should give us new information on the presence of any of these letters or their positions.

Current known facts:

Pattern fixed so far: _ U M _ Y

Letters already ruled out (x in any position): S,T,A,R,E,O,N,D,L,C,H,B,P,F,K

Letters still allowed for the two open slots (positions 1 and 4):  
G, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form ? U M ? Y using only those remaining letters.

Quick scan:
- G U M _ Y → GUMMY (invalid, double M)  
- J U M _ Y → JUMPY (P already excluded)  
- V U M _ Y → VUMMY (V + M + M + Y, invalid)  
- I U M _ Y → IUMKY (not a word)  
- Q U M _ Y → QUMMY (invalid)  
- W U M _ Y → WUMMY (invalid)  
- G U M M Y (invalid)  
- G U M B Y (B excluded)  
- G U M I Y (I is allowed, but “GUMIY” is not English)

Wait—let’s try “GUMMY”: M appears twice (already placed once), but the letters themselves are not ruled out.  
However, the target word has only one M (because M appears in position 3 once). Therefore GUMMY is invalid due to double M.

The only remaining valid dictionary word that fits **? U M ? Y** with the allowed letters is:

G U M M Y – invalid  
Actually, none of the above combinations give a valid English word except **GUMMY**, which is disallowed for the double-M reason.

Realization: the only workable single letter for position 4 is “I”, and the only workable single letter for position 1 is “G”, but **G U M I Y** is not a recognized English word.

Next possibility: **J U M I Y** – again not a word.

The only valid word that fits **? U M ? Y** with the remaining letters is **GUMMY**, but it has a repeated M—this should not be an issue for the game (the target word could have two M’s). The feedback only told us the first M is in position 3; nothing prevents another M elsewhere.

Therefore the best, and in fact only, remaining candidate is:

GUMMY
