For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best starting words typically contain a good mix of common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently occurring consonants (like S, T, R, N, L, etc.). 

Looking at letter frequencies in English words, some great starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Each of these contains a balanced mix of vowels and consonants. SLATE is particularly good because it includes S (very common in English words), plus three vowels (A, E) and common consonants L and T. This should help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions quickly.

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

From the first feedback:

- CLIMB - but T is eliminated, so can't use B (unless it's allowed? Wait no, B wasn't eliminated)

SLATE is particularly good because it includes S (very common in English words), plus three vowels (A, E) and common consonants L and T.

Current constraints:

1. B is in position 1: B _ _ _ _
2. L is in position 2: _ L _ _ _
   → Word starts with BL: B L _ _ _
3. I is somewhere in the word (from Guess 2) and not yet placed correctly.
4. N is in the word and must occupy either position 3, 4, or 5 (from Guess 3).
5. Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, M, P, K.

We now have:

Position 1: B (✓)
Position 2: L (✓)

Positions 3–5: must contain both I and N, plus one more letter that hasn’t been eliminated.
Possible arrangements of I and N in the last three slots:

- I in 3, N in 4 or 5
- I in 4, N in 3 or 5
- I in 5, N in 3 or 4

Let’s list valid English words starting with BL and containing both I and N in positions 3–5, avoiding the eliminated letters (S, A, T, E, M, P, K).

Valid words:
BLIND (I in 3, N in 4, D in 5)
BLINI (I in 3, N in 4, I in 5) – but I already used in 3
BLING (but G not eliminated yet)
BLINY (Y not eliminated)

BLIND uses only letters not yet ruled out and fits perfectly.
