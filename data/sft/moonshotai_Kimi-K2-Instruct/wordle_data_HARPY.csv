For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Common strong starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

These words are chosen because they cover a good range of common vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses A, R, I, S, E - covering three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the first feedback:

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain I, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Since S and E are ruled out, and we already know A and R must appear, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. Common remaining letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, etc. We also want to check different positions for A and R.

A strategic second guess would place A and R in new positions and introduce other common letters. A good candidate is “TAROT” – it has:
- T (common consonant, new)
- A (must appear, now in position 2)
- R (must appear, now in position 3)
- O (new vowel)
- T (again, but acceptable for testing)

But “TAROT” repeats T. A better choice with no repeats might be “RATIO” but it has I (already known to be absent). Another option: “CART” is 4 letters. “CARON” isn’t a word. “CAROL” is a word, uses A in position 2, R in position 3, and introduces C, O, L.

So “CAROL” seems good: C, A, R, O, L – no repeats, covers new letters, and places A and R in new spots.

Wait, positions: in ARISE, A was pos 1 (wrong spot), R pos 2 (wrong spot). In CAROL:
- A is now pos 2 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 1)
- R is now pos 3 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 2)
- C, O, L are new letters.

Thus, CAROL is a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain I, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Since S and E are ruled out, and we already know A and R must appear, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. Common remaining letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, etc. We also want to check different positions for A and R.

A strategic second guess would place A and R in new positions and introduce other common letters. A good candidate is “TAROT” – it has:
- T (common consonant, new)
- A (must appear, now in position 2)
- R (must appear, now in position 3)
- O (new vowel)
- T (again, but acceptable for testing)

But “TAROT” repeats T. A better choice with no repeats might be “RATIO” but it has I (already known to be absent). Another option: “CART” is 4 letters. “CARON” isn’t a word. “CAROL” is a word, uses A in position 2, R in position 3, and introduces C, O, L.

So “CAROL” seems good: C, A, R, O, L – no repeats, covers new letters, and places A and R in new spots.

Wait, positions: in ARISE, A was pos 1 (wrong spot), R pos 2 (wrong spot). In CAROL:
- A is now pos 2 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 1)
- R is now pos 3 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 2)

- Remaining letters to fill: positions 1, 4, 5.
- Allowed letters: any except C, I, L, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (the only vowel left that hasn’t been ruled out).

We need common words that fit _ A R _ _.  
Likely candidates: DARBY, FARCE, MARRY, PARTY, TARDY, etc.  
But we must avoid letters I, S, E, C, O, L.

Check:
- PARTY → uses P, A, R, T, Y. All letters are allowed. Pattern P A R T Y fits _ A R _ _.
- TARDY → T, A, R, D, Y. Also fits and uses new letters.

Either is plausible. I’ll pick PARTY because the Y at the end is common and will test another high-frequency consonant (Y) and a mid-frequency T.

The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Common strong starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

These words are chosen because they cover a good range of common vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses A, R, I, S, E - covering three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain I, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Since S and E are ruled out, and we already know A and R must appear, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. Common remaining letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, etc. We also want to check different positions for A and R.

A strategic second guess would place A and R in new positions and introduce other common letters. A good candidate is “TAROT” – it has:
- T (common consonant, new)
- A (must appear, now in position 2)
- R (must appear, now in position 3)
- O (new vowel)
- T (again, but acceptable for testing)

But “TAROT” repeats T. A better choice with no repeats might be “RATIO” but it has I (already known to be absent). Another option: “CART” is 4 letters. “CARON” isn’t a word. “CAROL” is a word, uses A in position 2, R in position 3, and introduces C, O, L.

So “CAROL” seems good: C, A, R, O, L – no repeats, covers new letters, and places A and R in new spots.

Wait, positions: in ARISE, A was pos 1 (wrong spot), R pos 2 (wrong spot). In CAROL:
- A is now pos 2 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 1)
- R is now pos 3 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 2)
- C, O, L are new letters.

Thus, CAROL is a strong second guess.

From Guess 4 (HARDY) we now know:

- H is correct in position 1 → H _ _ _ _
- A is correct in position 2 → H A _ _ _
- R is correct in position 3 → H A R _ _
- Y is correct in position 5 → H A R _ Y
- D is not in the word at all.

So the pattern is exactly H A R _ Y with the missing letter in position 4.  
Letters already eliminated: C, D, I, L, O, P, S, T, E.

Allowed letters for position 4: B, F, G, K, M, N, U, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words of the form H A R _ Y:

- H A R B Y (valid word: HARBY, though less common)
- H A R V Y (but V is allowed, HARVY is not a recognized word)
- H A R K Y (HARKY isn’t a word)
- H A R M Y (HARMY isn’t recognized)
- H A R N Y (HARNY isn’t recognized)
- H A R G Y (HARGY isn’t a word)
- H A R B Y → seems the only plausible English word.

Thus the word must be HARBY, even though it’s less common (it’s an archaic term for “harbor”). In Wordle word-lists, HARBY may appear.

Another candidate: HARPY (mythical creature). H A R P Y → but P was marked as wrong in position 1 in Guess 3 (PARTY), and P is not in the word at all. So HARPY is invalid.

Thus, the only possible word left is HARBY.

However, if HARBY is not in the word list, we might have overlooked something. Re-examining common English words:

Actually, ""HARPY"" is common, but P is eliminated, so it's out.  
""HARSH"" isn’t possible (S is eliminated).  
""HARRY"" has double R, but R is already in position 3, so invalid.  
Thus, HARBY is the only remaining candidate.

But let’s cross-check: is there another word?  
No, after eliminating D and P, and checking all common consonants, HARBY stands as the only possible choice in standard word lists.

Therefore, the word is HARBY.

- R is correct in position 3 → H A R _ _
- Y is correct in position 5 → H A R _ Y
- D is not in the word at all.

So the pattern is exactly H A R _ Y with the missing letter in position 4.  
Letters already eliminated: C, D, I, L, O, P, S, T, E.

Allowed letters for position 4: B, F, G, K, M, N, U, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words of the form H A R _ Y:

- H A R B Y (valid word: HARBY, though less common)
- H A R V Y (but V is allowed, HARVY is not a recognized word)
- H A R K Y (HARKY isn’t a word)
- H A R M Y (HARMY isn’t recognized)
- H A R N Y (HARNY isn’t recognized)
- H A R G Y (HARGY isn’t a word)
- H A R B Y → seems the only plausible English word.

Thus the word must be HARBY, even though it’s less common (it’s an archaic term for “harbor”). In Wordle word-lists, HARBY may appear.

Another candidate: HARPY (mythical creature). H A R P Y → but P was marked as wrong in position 1 in Guess 3 (PARTY), and P is not in the word at all. So HARPY is invalid.

Thus, the only possible word left is HARBY.

However, if HARBY is not in the word list, we might have overlooked something. Re-examining common English words:

Actually, ""HARPY"" is common, but P is eliminated, so it's out.  
""HARSH"" isn’t possible (S is eliminated).  
""HARRY"" has double R, but R is already in position 3, so invalid.  
Thus, HARBY is the only remaining candidate.

But let’s cross-check: is there another word?  
No, after eliminating D and P, and checking all common consonants, HARBY stands as the only possible choice in standard word lists.

Therefore, the word is HARBY.",Guess 5: HARBY -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) B(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Common strong starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)

These words are chosen because they cover a good range of common vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses A, R, I, S, E - covering three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain I, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Since S and E are ruled out, and we already know A and R must appear, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. Common remaining letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, etc. We also want to check different positions for A and R.

A strategic second guess would place A and R in new positions and introduce other common letters. A good candidate is “TAROT” – it has:
- T (common consonant, new)
- A (must appear, now in position 2)
- R (must appear, now in position 3)
- O (new vowel)
- T (again, but acceptable for testing)

But “TAROT” repeats T. A better choice with no repeats might be “RATIO” but it has I (already known to be absent). Another option: “CART” is 4 letters. “CARON” isn’t a word. “CAROL” is a word, uses A in position 2, R in position 3, and introduces C, O, L.

So “CAROL” seems good: C, A, R, O, L – no repeats, covers new letters, and places A and R in new spots.

Wait, positions: in ARISE, A was pos 1 (wrong spot), R pos 2 (wrong spot). In CAROL:
- A is now pos 2 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 1)
- R is now pos 3 – allowed (since it wasn’t correct in pos 2)
- C, O, L are new letters.

Thus, CAROL is a strong second guess.

Guess 2: CAROL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) O(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - Word must contain A and R, but A≠pos1 and R≠pos2.
   - Letters I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. CAROL → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) O(x) L(x)  
   - A is in the correct position: pos2 = A.  
   - R is also in the correct position: pos3 = R.  
   - Letters C, O, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- Remaining letters to fill: positions 1, 4, 5.
- Allowed letters: any except C, I, L, O, S, E.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (the only vowel left that hasn’t been ruled out).

We need common words that fit _ A R _ _.  
Likely candidates: DARBY, FARCE, MARRY, PARTY, TARDY, etc.  
But we must avoid letters I, S, E, C, O, L.

Check:
- PARTY → uses P, A, R, T, Y. All letters are allowed. Pattern P A R T Y fits _ A R _ _.
- TARDY → T, A, R, D, Y. Also fits and uses new letters.

Either is plausible. I’ll pick PARTY because the Y at the end is common and will test another high-frequency consonant (Y) and a mid-frequency T.

- H A R V Y  
- H A R K Y is the most common among these.

HARVY is not a valid word, HARNY is not a word, HARMY is not a word, but HARKY is not recognized either. 

Let me double-check common English words:  
HARKY isn’t standard, but HARK is a 4-letter word.  
HARSY - invalid (S ruled out).  
HARFY - invalid (no F).  
HARLY - L ruled out.  
HARVY - invalid.  
HARQY - invalid.  

Wait, actually, ""HARPY"" is valid, but P is already ruled out.  
""HARRY"" - double R, but R already correct in pos 3, so invalid.  

This seems like we're missing something. Let me re-examine the allowed letters.  

Looking carefully: H A R _ Y with allowed letters for position 4: F, G, K, M, N, U, V, W, Z.  

Valid words:  
- H A R K Y (HARKY - not standard)  
- H A R M Y (HARMY - not standard)  
- H A R N Y (HARNY - not standard)  
- H A R V Y (HARVY - not standard)  

But ""HARPY"" was valid but P is ruled out.  

This indicates the only remaining possible word is ""HARKY"" which is unlikely.  

However, upon reviewing the original word lists used in Wordle, ""HARPY"" is valid but P is ruled out, and ""HARSH"" is invalid (S ruled out), leaving us with ""HARPY"" impossible.  

But we have H(1) A(2) R(3) _ Y(5) and only allowed letters: F, G, K, M, N, U, V, W, Z for position 4.  

The only actual valid English word fitting this is ""HARKY"" which is not standard.  

This suggests we might have missed ""HARSY"" but S is ruled out.  

Upon deeper reflection, the actual standard word that fits is ""HARPY"" but P is ruled out. This implies the word must be ""HARKY"" or the dictionary is unusual.  

Rechecking: The standard Wordle word list includes ""HARPY"", but since P was ruled out, this is impossible.  

This indicates the word must be ""HARVY"" but it's not standard.  

Upon careful re-evaluation, the only valid remaining standard word is:  

""HARKY"" is not standard, but ""HARPY"" is invalid.  

This suggests the word is actually ""HARPY"" and that P feedback may have been misinterpreted, but looking back:  

Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) means P is in the word but wrong position. However in Guess 3, P was in position 1, and feedback was P(-), meaning P is in the word but not position 1.  

Wait! This is critical.  

Earlier I misread Guess 3 feedback.  

Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) means P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  

This changes everything.  

Re-evaluating:

From Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)

- A, R, Y are correctly placed.  
- T is not in the word.  
- P is IN the word but not in position 1.  

Thus the word must contain P somewhere else.  

Given pattern: H A R _ Y with P present, the only possible placement for P is position 4.  

Thus the word is H A R P Y.  

But wait, in Guess 5 we tried HARBY and got B(x), so B is not in the word.  

This confirms the word must be HARPY, as P must appear in position 4.  

Therefore, the word is HARPY.

HARKY isn’t standard, but HARK is a 4-letter word.  
HARSY - invalid (S ruled out).  
HARFY - invalid (no F).  
HARLY - L ruled out.  
HARVY - invalid.  
HARQY - invalid.  

Wait, actually, ""HARPY"" is valid, but P is already ruled out.  
""HARRY"" - double R, but R already correct in pos 3, so invalid.  

This seems like we're missing something. Let me re-examine the allowed letters.  

Looking carefully: H A R _ Y with allowed letters for position 4: F, G, K, M, N, U, V, W, Z.  

Valid words:  
- H A R K Y (HARKY - not standard)  
- H A R M Y (HARMY - not standard)  
- H A R N Y (HARNY - not standard)  
- H A R V Y (HARVY - not standard)  

But ""HARPY"" was valid but P is ruled out.  

This indicates the only remaining possible word is ""HARKY"" which is unlikely.  

However, upon reviewing the original word lists used in Wordle, ""HARPY"" is valid but P is ruled out, and ""HARSH"" is invalid (S ruled out), leaving us with ""HARPY"" impossible.  

But we have H(1) A(2) R(3) _ Y(5) and only allowed letters: F, G, K, M, N, U, V, W, Z for position 4.  

The only actual valid English word fitting this is ""HARKY"" which is not standard.  

This suggests we might have missed ""HARSY"" but S is ruled out.  

Upon deeper reflection, the actual standard word that fits is ""HARPY"" but P is ruled out. This implies the word must be ""HARKY"" or the dictionary is unusual.  

Rechecking: The standard Wordle word list includes ""HARPY"", but since P was ruled out, this is impossible.  

This indicates the word must be ""HARVY"" but it's not standard.  

Upon careful re-evaluation, the only valid remaining standard word is:  

""HARKY"" is not standard, but ""HARPY"" is invalid.  

This suggests the word is actually ""HARPY"" and that P feedback may have been misinterpreted, but looking back:  

Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) means P is in the word but wrong position. However in Guess 3, P was in position 1, and feedback was P(-), meaning P is in the word but not position 1.  

Wait! This is critical.  

Earlier I misread Guess 3 feedback.  

Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) means P is in the word but NOT in position 1.  

This changes everything.  

Re-evaluating:

From Guess 3: PARTY → P(-) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(✓)

- A, R, Y are correctly placed.  
- T is not in the word.  
- P is IN the word but not in position 1.  

Thus the word must contain P somewhere else.  

Given pattern: H A R _ Y with P present, the only possible placement for P is position 4.  

Thus the word is H A R P Y.  

But wait, in Guess 5 we tried HARBY and got B(x), so B is not in the word.  

This confirms the word must be HARPY, as P must appear in position 4.  

Therefore, the word is HARPY.",Guess 6: HARPY -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) P(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
