For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters in English and has no repeats. This should give us good initial information about the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely out: S, T, E
- Letters that are in but misplaced: A, R
- Positions 1 and 5 are still completely open
- A and R must be somewhere else – they cannot be in positions 3 and 4 respectively

A good second guess should:
1. Include both A and R (since we know they’re in)
2. Avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for R
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (avoiding S, T, E)
4. Use a fresh set of consonants and vowels like C, L, N, O, I, etc.

Candidate words satisfying these rules:
- CRANK – keeps R in position 2 (allowed) and A in 3 (allowed because it’s “wrong” vs “correct”), but repeats no letters
- DRAIN – puts R in position 2, A in 4 (but R was in position 4 originally, so 4 is still disallowed for R)
- CRONY – too many untested letters, but only uses A and R
- RANCH – puts R in position 1 (OK), A in 2 (OK)

Among these, “CRANK” seems solid because:
- C, N, K have not been used yet

Letters NOT in the word so far:

- In STARE, R was in position 4 (-) → R ≠ 4  

- In CRANK, A was in position 3 (-) → reinforces A ≠ 3

So we know:

- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 5

1. Contains both A and R exactly once each, satisfying the positional bans above.  
2. Introduces three new letters that haven’t been tested.  
3. Is a valid English 5-letter word.

Let’s consolidate all the information we have so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x marks):
S, T, E, C, N, K, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ from RAPID)
- R is in the word but has never been in the right place yet (- in all guesses)

Positions already ruled out for R:
- Guess 1 (STARE) had R in position 4 → R ≠ 4
- Guess 2 (CRANK) had R in position 2 → R ≠ 2
- Guess 3 (RAPID) had R in position 1 → R ≠ 1

So R must be in position 3 or 5.

Current skeleton:
_ A _ _ _
with either R in 3 or 5, and two new letters (never used) in the other three slots.

Fresh letters not yet tried: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want common consonants and maybe a vowel besides A.
Good candidates: L, M, B, G, O, Y, etc.

Let’s explore both R positions.

Option 1: R in position 3 → pattern _ A R _ _
Need two new letters for positions 1 and 5. Common choices: B, L, M, G, Y, etc.
- BAR_ _ → BARMY (Y unused), but M and Y are okay. However, BARFY is uncommon.
- MARRY → repeats R, invalid.
- BARGE → G and B new, E already out.

L A R V A → V,A already used or invalid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters in English and has no repeats. This should give us good initial information about the secret word.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely out: S, T, E
- Letters that are in but misplaced: A, R
- Positions 1 and 5 are still completely open
- A and R must be somewhere else – they cannot be in positions 3 and 4 respectively

A good second guess should:
1. Include both A and R (since we know they’re in)
2. Avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for R
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (avoiding S, T, E)
4. Use a fresh set of consonants and vowels like C, L, N, O, I, etc.

Candidate words satisfying these rules:
- CRANK – keeps R in position 2 (allowed) and A in 3 (allowed because it’s “wrong” vs “correct”), but repeats no letters
- DRAIN – puts R in position 2, A in 4 (but R was in position 4 originally, so 4 is still disallowed for R)
- CRONY – too many untested letters, but only uses A and R
- RANCH – puts R in position 1 (OK), A in 2 (OK)

Among these, “CRANK” seems solid because:
- C, N, K have not been used yet
- R is tested in position 2 (allowed)
- A is tested in position 3 (allowed)
- And it’s a common word

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Letters NOT in the word so far:  
S, T, E, C, N, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown):  
A, R (each has so far always been marked “wrong position”)

Additional positional constraints from guesses:
- In STARE, A was in position 3 (-) → A ≠ 3  
- In STARE, R was in position 4 (-) → R ≠ 4  

- In CRANK, A was in position 3 (-) → reinforces A ≠ 3  
- In CRANK, R was in position 2 (-) → R ≠ 2  

So we know:
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 5  

We still need 3 fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The most common remaining consonants: L, D, B, G, M, P, F, V, Y, etc.  
Common vowels we haven’t used: I, O, U (though U is less common).  

Let’s look for a word that:
1. Contains both A and R exactly once each, satisfying the positional bans above.  
2. Introduces three new letters that haven’t been tested.  
3. Is a valid English 5-letter word.

Candidate words fitting:
- RADIO – but already used A, and O and D new, but R is 1, A is 2: allowed.  
- RAID – too short.  
- DRAIN – D, I, N: but N already ruled out.  
- RAPID – P new, I new, D new, R in 1, A in 2: allowed.  
- RAPID satisfies all constraints.

So let’s guess RAPID.

Option B – R in 5: _ A _ _ R
   Need three new letters for 1, 3, 4.
   Common words:

   LAUGH has L, A, U, G, H – letters L, U, G, H all new. Fits _ A _ _ R? Wait, LAUGH ends in H, not R. So LAUGH is _ A U G H – does not place R at 5. My mistake.

Re-evaluate Option B with R at 5: need _ A _ _ R
   Valid words:
        B A N G R → not valid
        F A U C R → not valid
        B A R D R → not valid
        L A U G R → not valid

        L A U N R → not valid
        G A I R Y → I out
        B A R F Y → ends with Y, not R
Actually the only viable pattern seems _ A _ _ R.
After scanning, the only common 5-letter English words fitting _ A _ _ R with fresh letters are:
        H A U L R – invalid
        G A U L R – invalid
        F A U N R – invalid
        B A U M R – invalid
        V A U L T – ends with T (out)
It appears no clean common word fits _ A _ _ R with fresh letters.

Therefore Option A (R in 3) is preferable. Among BARFY, FARFY, etc., BARFY is a valid English word.

So we’ll guess BARFY.

So we’ll guess BARFY.",Guess 5: BARFY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) F(x) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,HARPY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters in English and has no repeats. This should give us good initial information about the secret word.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely out: S, T, E
- Letters that are in but misplaced: A, R
- Positions 1 and 5 are still completely open
- A and R must be somewhere else – they cannot be in positions 3 and 4 respectively

A good second guess should:
1. Include both A and R (since we know they’re in)
2. Avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for R
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (avoiding S, T, E)
4. Use a fresh set of consonants and vowels like C, L, N, O, I, etc.

Candidate words satisfying these rules:
- CRANK – keeps R in position 2 (allowed) and A in 3 (allowed because it’s “wrong” vs “correct”), but repeats no letters
- DRAIN – puts R in position 2, A in 4 (but R was in position 4 originally, so 4 is still disallowed for R)
- CRONY – too many untested letters, but only uses A and R
- RANCH – puts R in position 1 (OK), A in 2 (OK)

Among these, “CRANK” seems solid because:
- C, N, K have not been used yet
- R is tested in position 2 (allowed)
- A is tested in position 3 (allowed)
- And it’s a common word

<guess>CRANK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Letters NOT in the word so far:  
S, T, E, C, N, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown):  
A, R (each has so far always been marked “wrong position”)

Additional positional constraints from guesses:
- In STARE, A was in position 3 (-) → A ≠ 3  
- In STARE, R was in position 4 (-) → R ≠ 4  

- In CRANK, A was in position 3 (-) → reinforces A ≠ 3  
- In CRANK, R was in position 2 (-) → R ≠ 2  

So we know:
- A must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 5  

We still need 3 fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
The most common remaining consonants: L, D, B, G, M, P, F, V, Y, etc.  
Common vowels we haven’t used: I, O, U (though U is less common).  

Let’s look for a word that:
1. Contains both A and R exactly once each, satisfying the positional bans above.  
2. Introduces three new letters that haven’t been tested.  
3. Is a valid English 5-letter word.

Candidate words fitting:
- RADIO – but already used A, and O and D new, but R is 1, A is 2: allowed.  
- RAID – too short.  
- DRAIN – D, I, N: but N already ruled out.  
- RAPID – P new, I new, D new, R in 1, A in 2: allowed.  
- RAPID satisfies all constraints.

So let’s guess RAPID.

<guess>RAPID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
Guess 3: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate all the information we have so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x marks):
S, T, E, C, N, K, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ from RAPID)
- R is in the word but has never been in the right place yet (- in all guesses)

Positions already ruled out for R:
- Guess 1 (STARE) had R in position 4 → R ≠ 4
- Guess 2 (CRANK) had R in position 2 → R ≠ 2
- Guess 3 (RAPID) had R in position 1 → R ≠ 1

So R must be in position 3 or 5.

Current skeleton:
_ A _ _ _
with either R in 3 or 5, and two new letters (never used) in the other three slots.

Fresh letters not yet tried: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want common consonants and maybe a vowel besides A.
Good candidates: L, M, B, G, O, Y, etc.

Let’s explore both R positions.

Option 1: R in position 3 → pattern _ A R _ _
Need two new letters for positions 1 and 5. Common choices: B, L, M, G, Y, etc.
- BAR_ _ → BARMY (Y unused), but M and Y are okay. However, BARFY is uncommon.
- MARRY → repeats R, invalid.
- BARGE → G and B new, E already out.
Actually, let’s pick L and Y → L A R G Y? Not a standard word.
Better: L A R C H → but C is out.
L A R G E → E is out.
L A R V A → V,A already used or invalid.
L A R G O → G, O new. LARGO is a valid word.

Option 2: R in position 5 → pattern _ A _ _ R
Need three new letters for positions 1, 3, 4.
Common words: F A M E R? Not standard.
M A J O R → J, O new, M new. MAJOR is valid.

Between LARGO (R in 3) and MAJOR (R in 5), MAJOR uses three fresh letters and is a very common word. Let’s pick MAJOR.

Letters IN: A (must be 2nd), R (must be 3rd or 5th)

Confirmed pattern:
_ A _ _ _ with A locked in position 2.

R cannot be in 1 (from RAPID), 2 (CRANK), 4 (STARE), so R must be in 3 or 5.

We need three fresh letters not yet tried: common remaining consonants are B, F, G, H, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels U and Y (A is already used).

Option A – R in 3: _ A R _ _
   Need two new letters for 1 and 5.
   Common words:
        B A R F Y → valid, uses B, F, Y
        F A R G O → G, F, O; but O already out
        B A R G E → E out
        H A R P Y → P out
   Best: BARFY (B, F, Y fresh)

Option B – R in 5: _ A _ _ R
   Need three new letters for 1, 3, 4.
   Common words:
        B A L L Y → repeats L
        F A U L Y → not a word
        B A K E R → K, E out
        G A U L S → G, U, L fresh; but GAULS plural?
        B A Y E R → E out
        F A U S T → S, T out
        B A R G E → E out
        F A L C O → many letters out
        H A U L R → not a word
        F A U N Y → not a word
        B A N G R → not a word
        L A U G H → G, H, L fresh and LAUGH valid
   LAUGH has L, A, U, G, H – letters L, U, G, H all new. Fits _ A _ _ R? Wait, LAUGH ends in H, not R. So LAUGH is _ A U G H – does not place R at 5. My mistake.

Re-evaluate Option B with R at 5: need _ A _ _ R
   Valid words:
        B A N G R → not valid
        F A U C R → not valid
        B A R D R → not valid
        L A U G R → not valid
        B A R K R → not valid
        F A I R Y → I out
        B A R R Y → double R
        G A I N R → not valid
        F A U N R → not valid
        L A U N R → not valid
        G A I R Y → I out
        B A R F Y → ends with Y, not R
Actually the only viable pattern seems _ A _ _ R.
After scanning, the only common 5-letter English words fitting _ A _ _ R with fresh letters are:
        H A U L R – invalid
        G A U L R – invalid
        F A U N R – invalid
        B A U M R – invalid
        V A U L T – ends with T (out)
It appears no clean common word fits _ A _ _ R with fresh letters.

Therefore Option A (R in 3) is preferable. Among BARFY, FARFY, etc., BARFY is a valid English word.

So we’ll guess BARFY.

From the new feedback on BARFY:

- B(x) – B is NOT in the word  
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2  
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 3  
- F(x) – F is NOT in the word  
- Y(✓) – Y is correct in position 5  

So the pattern we now know is:

 _ A R _ Y

with the remaining letter (position 4) still unknown.

Letters used and ruled out so far:  
S, T, E, C, N, K, I, D, M, J, O, P, B, F  

Fresh letters not yet tried: G, H, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits:
X A R _ Y  (where X is position 1 and the blank is position 4).

Possible common English words:
- W A R _ Y → WARMY? No.  
- G A R _ Y → GARDY? No.  
- H A R _ Y → HARDY  (H, D new – D already out)  
- L A R _ Y → LARDY (D out), LARKY (K out), LARVY? no.  
- V A R _ Y → VARDY? no.  
- QUARRY → repeats letters.  
- G A R _ Y → GARDY? no.  

The only recognizable common word is HARDY, but D has been ruled out (D(x) in RAPID).  
Next option: G A R _ Y → GARDY not common.

Actually, another common word: CARVY? C is out.

Go through alphabet for position 4 (must be new letter not used before):

Available letters: G, H, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Try each:

G → G A R G Y (double G, invalid)  
H → H A R H Y (double H)  
L → H A R L Y (H not used yet) → HARLY not a word  
L A R L Y (double L)  
V → V A R V Y (double V)  
W → W A R W Y (double W)  
Q → Q A R Q Y (double Q)  
U → H A R U Y? no.  
Looking at English vocabulary, the only valid word that fits _ A R _ Y and uses fresh letters is:

H A R P Y – but P is out.

Wait, opening a dictionary in mind:  
G A R L Y? no.  
H A R L Y? no.  
V A R L Y? no.  
Z A R Z Y? no.  

Actually the word is:

H A R L Y – but HARLY is not a word.

Let me rethink.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ""ARY"" or ""ARY"" sounds don't fit.

Wait: the pattern is _ A R _ Y  

The only common English word that fits is:  
V A R L Y? no.  

Actually, the correct common word is: G A R L Y (not common).  
But there is a word: V A R L Y – no.

Another check: the word ""H A R L Y"" is not recognized.  
Realizing now: the word is ""HARPY"" – H, A, R, P, Y.  
But P was marked as P(x) in RAPID, so P is NOT in the word.  
Thus HARPY is invalid.

Back to thinking: fresh letters for position 4:  
Letters not used yet: G, H, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

We need a valid word _ A R _ Y.  
The only common one left is: G A R L Y? no.

Another realization: the word ""CARLY"" – C is out.  

There is a word: V A R L Y – no.  
Actually, the word is ""HARPY"" – but P is out.  

Next realization: the word ""GARLY"" is not in common use.  

Wait – the word ""GARLY"" – perhaps a variant spelling? Not standard.  

But the word ""LARLY"" – no.  

Another check against common words:
