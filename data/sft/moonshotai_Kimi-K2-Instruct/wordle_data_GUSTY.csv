For the first guess, I want a word that covers as many common letters as possible to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (third most common vowel)
This gives me a good spread of top letters to test.

- A: x (not in the word at all)
- I: x (not in the word at all)
- S: - (in the word, but not in the 4th position)

So none of the letters R, A, I, E appear in the secret word, but S does appear somewhere else.  
My next word should avoid all of those ruled-out letters and still try to test fresh, common letters while placing S in a different spot.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
   – R, A, I, E are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STOUT → S(-), T(-), O(x), U(-), T(-)  
   – S is again marked “-”, confirming S is in the word but not in position 1 (or 4, from first guess).  
   – T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5.  
   – O is not in the word.  
   – U is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, T, U.  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, O.  
- Possible positions:  
  – S can be 2, 3, or 5.  
  – T can be 1, 3, or 4.  
  – U can be 1, 2, 3, or 5.  

We still need to test more common consonants (N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and the vowel Y.

- Y: ✓ – Y is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So the known pattern so far is: _ U S T Y

We still need to determine the first letter. From previous feedback (RAISE and STOUT), we know the following letters are NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, O, L.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, etc. Let's pick a common one like D, B, or N.

A strong candidate would be DUSTY, BUSTY, or MUSTY. Since D, B, M have not been ruled out, any of these could be correct. 

Let's go with DUSTY to test D.

_ U S T Y

Letters already ruled out for the first position (because they were marked “x” earlier or used in a word that was rejected) include:
R, A, I, E, O, L, D.

Common first-letter candidates that have not been tried yet among remaining English consonants: B, C, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s pick a frequent one. “MUSTY” is a well-known English word and fits the pattern _ U S T Y perfectly, and “M” has not been tested.

Therefore, our next logical guess is MUSTY.
