This is the first guess, so we have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we can gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Some good starting words are: ADIEU, SLATE, CRANE, STARE, AROSE, etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of the letters A, R, O, S.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in E, with none of A, R, O, S, and must include other common letters to maximize information.

Let’s list possible consonants and vowels still allowed (excluding A, R, O, S):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U

Choosing a word with common letters in the remaining set:  
- T, I, N, L are good candidates.  
A good candidate is “INLET”:
- Ends with E (matches known info)
- Contains none of the excluded letters (A, R, O, S)

4. Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
5. Remaining vowels: U

Since E must appear again, and it can’t be in positions 2 (already there), 3, or 5, the only possible additional positions for E are 1 or 4. But position 1 is the first letter, and having E as the first letter is less common. We should test E in 4th position.

A good candidate is “DEMUX” but X is rare. Instead, let’s use “MEDIC”:
- Has E in 2nd position (matches ✓)
- Has E in 4th position (new test)
- Uses C and D, which are common and haven’t been tested yet

But wait, “MEDIC” has I which we know is absent (from INLET). So that’s invalid.

Alternative: “JEMMY” – but Y is excluded.

Next option: “HEXED” – but X and D haven’t been excluded, but let’s check letters:
H, E, X, E, D. Letters: H, E, X, D. None are in the excluded list (except E which is confirmed in word). But X is rare.

Better is “KEDGE”:
- K, D, G are new consonants
- E in 2nd position
- E again in 4th position
- Ends with E, but we know E is not in 5th position from INLET (E was – in 5th), so this would be invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine E positions:
- E is in 2nd position (✓ from BEEFY)
- E is also in word somewhere else, but cannot be:
  - Position 3 (from BEEFY: E was – in 3rd)
  - Position 5 (from INLET: E was – in 5th)
So E must appear in position 1, 2, or 4. But 2 is already taken, so possible positions for the second E are 1 or 4.

Thus we need a word with E in 2nd position, and another E in 1st or 4th, using only allowed letters.

Possible word: “EERIE” – but I is excluded.

Next: “CEDER” – but R is excluded.

Next: “EGGED” – but G and D are new, letters: E, G, G, E, D. All allowed so far.
- E in 1st, 2nd, 4th positions
- G, D are new letters

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- E in 2nd: matches ✓
- E in 1st and 4th: tests positions for additional E
- Uses new consonants G, D

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,deuce,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so we have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we can gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Some good starting words are: ADIEU, SLATE, CRANE, STARE, AROSE, etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of the letters A, R, O, S.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in E, with none of A, R, O, S, and must include other common letters to maximize information.

Let’s list possible consonants and vowels still allowed (excluding A, R, O, S):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U

Choosing a word with common letters in the remaining set:  
- T, I, N, L are good candidates.  
A good candidate is “INLET”:
- Ends with E (matches known info)
- Contains none of the excluded letters (A, R, O, S)
- Uses I, N, L, T (all common)

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on INLET:

- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (it moved from ✓ to –).  
- I, N, L, T are NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word contains E, but E is NOT in position 5.
2. The letters A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T are all absent.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U  
E is the only vowel confirmed so far.

To maximize information, pick a word with new consonants and keep E in a different position (not 5th).  
A good candidate is “BEEFY”:
- Contains E twice (will quickly test E positions 2, 3)  
- Introduces new consonants B, F, Y  
- Doesn’t reuse any excluded letters

Other possibilities: “CHEEK”, “FEMME”, “DWEEB”, but “BEEFY” gives good letter coverage.

Let’s go with “BEEFY”.

<guess>BEEFY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: BEEFY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) E(-) F(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on BEEFY:

- First E is now ✓: E is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- Second E is –: E is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
- B, F, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ E _ _ _
2. E also appears somewhere else (not in 3rd or 5th).
3. Letters NOT present: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y.
4. Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
5. Remaining vowels: U

Since E must appear again, and it can’t be in positions 2 (already there), 3, or 5, the only possible additional positions for E are 1 or 4. But position 1 is the first letter, and having E as the first letter is less common. We should test E in 4th position.

A good candidate is “DEMUX” but X is rare. Instead, let’s use “MEDIC”:
- Has E in 2nd position (matches ✓)
- Has E in 4th position (new test)
- Uses C and D, which are common and haven’t been tested yet

But wait, “MEDIC” has I which we know is absent (from INLET). So that’s invalid.

Alternative: “JEMMY” – but Y is excluded.

Next option: “HEXED” – but X and D haven’t been excluded, but let’s check letters:
H, E, X, E, D. Letters: H, E, X, D. None are in the excluded list (except E which is confirmed in word). But X is rare.

Better is “KEDGE”:
- K, D, G are new consonants
- E in 2nd position
- E again in 4th position
- Ends with E, but we know E is not in 5th position from INLET (E was – in 5th), so this would be invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine E positions:
- E is in 2nd position (✓ from BEEFY)
- E is also in word somewhere else, but cannot be:
  - Position 3 (from BEEFY: E was – in 3rd)
  - Position 5 (from INLET: E was – in 5th)
So E must appear in position 1, 2, or 4. But 2 is already taken, so possible positions for the second E are 1 or 4.

Thus we need a word with E in 2nd position, and another E in 1st or 4th, using only allowed letters.

Possible word: “EERIE” – but I is excluded.

Next: “CEDER” – but R is excluded.

Next: “EGGED” – but G and D are new, letters: E, G, G, E, D. All allowed so far.
- E in 1st, 2nd, 4th positions
- G, D are new letters

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- E in 2nd: matches ✓
- E in 1st and 4th: tests positions for additional E
- Uses new consonants G, D

From the latest feedback on EGGED:

- 1st E is “-”: E is in the word but NOT in position 1

- 3rd E is “-”: E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
- Both G’s are “x”: G is not in the word  
- D is “-”: D is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:

2. E must appear somewhere else besides position 2  
   - Allowed extra E positions: 3 (since 1, 4, 5 are now ruled out)  
3. D is in the word but not in position 5

5. Remaining common consonants to test: C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
6. Remaining vowels: U (since E is already present and other vowels are ruled out)

Putting this together:

- Position 2 is E  
- Either position 3 is E, or there’s another E someplace impossible (but only position 3 is left for an extra E)  
- D must fit in positions 1, 3, or 4

- _ E _ D _  → “_ E _ D _”  
- _ E _ _ D  → but D is already ruled out of position 5

“CHEED” – H and C are allowed, but second E position 3 is okay?  
No, D is already ruled out of position 5, but here D is in 4 – allowed.

C H E E D  
- C, H, E, E, D

Allowed letters: C is allowed.

“CHEED” – H and C are allowed, but second E position 3 is okay?  
No, D is already ruled out of position 5, but here D is in 4 – allowed.

But let me check:  
C H E E D  
- C, H, E, E, D  
- All letters are allowed (no forbidden ones)  
- E in 2 ✓ and E in 3 –  
- D in 4 –  

This seems valid and tests the letters C, H, D.

Let’s go with “CHEED”.",Guess 5: CHEED -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) E(-) E(-) D(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,deuce,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so we have no information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we can gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Some good starting words are: ADIEU, SLATE, CRANE, STARE, AROSE, etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of the letters A, R, O, S.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in E, with none of A, R, O, S, and must include other common letters to maximize information.

Let’s list possible consonants and vowels still allowed (excluding A, R, O, S):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U

Choosing a word with common letters in the remaining set:  
- T, I, N, L are good candidates.  
A good candidate is “INLET”:
- Ends with E (matches known info)
- Contains none of the excluded letters (A, R, O, S)
- Uses I, N, L, T (all common)

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on INLET:

- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (it moved from ✓ to –).  
- I, N, L, T are NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word contains E, but E is NOT in position 5.
2. The letters A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T are all absent.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U  
E is the only vowel confirmed so far.

To maximize information, pick a word with new consonants and keep E in a different position (not 5th).  
A good candidate is “BEEFY”:
- Contains E twice (will quickly test E positions 2, 3)  
- Introduces new consonants B, F, Y  
- Doesn’t reuse any excluded letters

Other possibilities: “CHEEK”, “FEMME”, “DWEEB”, but “BEEFY” gives good letter coverage.

Let’s go with “BEEFY”.

<guess>BEEFY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: BEEFY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) E(-) F(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on BEEFY:

- First E is now ✓: E is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- Second E is –: E is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
- B, F, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ E _ _ _
2. E also appears somewhere else (not in 3rd or 5th).
3. Letters NOT present: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y.
4. Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
5. Remaining vowels: U

Since E must appear again, and it can’t be in positions 2 (already there), 3, or 5, the only possible additional positions for E are 1 or 4. But position 1 is the first letter, and having E as the first letter is less common. We should test E in 4th position.

A good candidate is “DEMUX” but X is rare. Instead, let’s use “MEDIC”:
- Has E in 2nd position (matches ✓)
- Has E in 4th position (new test)
- Uses C and D, which are common and haven’t been tested yet

But wait, “MEDIC” has I which we know is absent (from INLET). So that’s invalid.

Alternative: “JEMMY” – but Y is excluded.

Next option: “HEXED” – but X and D haven’t been excluded, but let’s check letters:
H, E, X, E, D. Letters: H, E, X, D. None are in the excluded list (except E which is confirmed in word). But X is rare.

Better is “KEDGE”:
- K, D, G are new consonants
- E in 2nd position
- E again in 4th position
- Ends with E, but we know E is not in 5th position from INLET (E was – in 5th), so this would be invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine E positions:
- E is in 2nd position (✓ from BEEFY)
- E is also in word somewhere else, but cannot be:
  - Position 3 (from BEEFY: E was – in 3rd)
  - Position 5 (from INLET: E was – in 5th)
So E must appear in position 1, 2, or 4. But 2 is already taken, so possible positions for the second E are 1 or 4.

Thus we need a word with E in 2nd position, and another E in 1st or 4th, using only allowed letters.

Possible word: “EERIE” – but I is excluded.

Next: “CEDER” – but R is excluded.

Next: “EGGED” – but G and D are new, letters: E, G, G, E, D. All allowed so far.
- E in 1st, 2nd, 4th positions
- G, D are new letters

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- E in 2nd: matches ✓
- E in 1st and 4th: tests positions for additional E
- Uses new consonants G, D

<guess>EGGED</guess>

<guess>EGGED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: BEEFY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) E(-) F(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: EGGED -> FEEDBACK: E(-) G(x) G(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback on EGGED:

- 1st E is “-”: E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- 2nd E is “✓”: E is in the word AND in position 2 (confirms earlier finding)  
- 3rd E is “-”: E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
- Both G’s are “x”: G is not in the word  
- D is “-”: D is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:

1. Word pattern so far: _ E _ _ _  
2. E must appear somewhere else besides position 2  
   - Allowed extra E positions: 3 (since 1, 4, 5 are now ruled out)  
3. D is in the word but not in position 5  
   - Allowed D positions: 1, 3, 4  
4. Forbidden letters accumulated so far:  
   A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y, G  
5. Remaining common consonants to test: C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
6. Remaining vowels: U (since E is already present and other vowels are ruled out)

Putting this together:

- Position 2 is E  
- Either position 3 is E, or there’s another E someplace impossible (but only position 3 is left for an extra E)  
- D must fit in positions 1, 3, or 4  
- All other letters must come from the still-allowed set

Word skeleton possibilities:

- D E E _ _  → but then D must be in position 1 and E in 2 and 3; “DEE _ _”  
- _ E D _ _  → “_ E D _ _”  
- _ E _ D _  → “_ E _ D _”  
- _ E _ _ D  → but D is already ruled out of position 5

Let’s fill in the blanks while avoiding forbidden letters and using fresh, common ones.

Candidate 1: D E E P _  
Deep_ isn’t a word, but “DEEPS” uses S which is ruled out.

Candidate 2: C E D E _  
C and E are allowed. “CEDER” uses R (forbidden) and E again at position 4 (forbidden) → invalid.

Candidate 3: P E D E _  
“PEDER” – R is forbidden.

Candidate 4: U E D E _  
“UEDEX” – X is rare.

Candidate 5: J E D E _  
“JEDES” – S is forbidden.

Candidate 6: M E D E _  
“MEDES” – S is forbidden.

Candidate 7: H E D E _  
“HEDER” – R is forbidden.

Candidate 8: W E D E _  
“WEDEL” – L is forbidden.

Candidate 9: K E D E _  
“KEDES” – S is forbidden.

Candidate 10: C E D E _  
Again “CEDER” ruled out.

Alternative structure: put an extra E in position 3 and D elsewhere.

Word skeleton: _ E E D _  
Allowed letters: C is allowed.

“CHEED” – H and C are allowed, but second E position 3 is okay?  
No, D is already ruled out of position 5, but here D is in 4 – allowed.

But let me check:  
C H E E D  
- C, H, E, E, D  
- All letters are allowed (no forbidden ones)  
- E in 2 ✓ and E in 3 –  
- D in 4 –  

This seems valid and tests the letters C, H, D.

Let’s go with “CHEED”.

Latest feedback on CHEED:
C(-) H(x) E(-) E(-) D(-)

Decoded:
- C is in the word but not in position 1
- H is NOT in the word
- First E is “-”: E is in the word but not in position 3
- Second E is “-”: E is in the word but not in position 4
- D is “-”: D is in the word but not in position 5

What we now know:
1. Position 2 is E (from BEEFY).
2. Additional E must appear exactly once (since we haven’t seen two ✓ yet).  
   Allowed positions for the second E: only position 3 has a “-” status, yet we just got “-” for position 3, so E cannot be there.  
   Therefore, the second E can only be in position 1 or 4.
   - Position 1: C is allowed here, but we just saw C(-) so C is allowed somewhere else.
   - Position 4: D must fit somewhere.

3. D must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   - Position 2 is already E.
   - Position 5 is ruled out for D.
4. C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
   - Position 2 is E.
   - Position 5 is open.
5. Forbidden letters accumulated: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y, G, H  
   Allowed consonants left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Remaining vowels: U, E (E already covered).

6. Possible patterns:
   - C _ E _ _  → but position 2 is E, so C _ E _ _  → C E E _ _  (second E in 3, but 3 is now ruled out for E) → invalid.
   - _ E C _ _  → but C must appear.
   - _ E _ C _  → possible.
   - _ E _ _ C  → possible (position 5).

Also, D must fit in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to fit C and D and the second E:

Option 1: D E _ E C  
But E in 4 is ruled out.

Option 2: _ E D E C  
E in 4 is ruled out.

Option 3: _ E _ D C  
D in 4 is allowed, C in 5 is allowed (C(-) means C is in word, and position 5 is open for C).

So pattern: _ E _ D C  
We need a consonant in position 1 and 3.

Letters left for positions 1 and 3: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U (but U is vowel, and we have no confirmation of U yet).

Let’s pick common consonants.

Possible words:
- W E X D C – not a word.
- M E W D C – not a word.
- J E K D C – not a word.
- V E J D C – not a word.

Let’s try to list real 5-letter words that fit _ E _ D C.

Lexicon check:
- MEDIC – I is forbidden.
- PEDIC – I is forbidden.
- VEDIC – I is forbidden.

Alternative pattern: C must appear somewhere else. Let’s try C in position 3.

Pattern: _ E C D _  
Need position 1 and 5 letters.

Letters left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

We need valid words like:
- J E C K S – S is forbidden.
- W E C K S – S is forbidden.
- M E C C A – A is forbidden.

Seems difficult. Let’s try pattern: _ E D _ C

Need position 1 and 3.
Valid word: W E D G E – G is forbidden.
M E D I C – I is forbidden.
P E D I C – I is forbidden.

Alternative pattern: D E _ _ C  
D in 1, E in 2, C in 5.

Need positions 3 and 4.

Letters left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible words:
- D E C K S – S is forbidden.
- D E M O C – O is forbidden.
- D E J E C – J, E, C are allowed. “DEJEC” is not a valid English word.

Another pattern: C must appear, and D must appear, and second E must appear.

Let’s try: C E D _ _  
C in 1, E in 2, D in 3.

Need positions 4 and 5.

Letters left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible words:
- C E D A R – A and R are forbidden.
- C E D E D – E is allowed, D is allowed. “CEDED” is a valid word.

Check letters:
C, E, D, E, D  
- C(-) – C is in word, here in position 1 (allowed, since C(-) means not in 1, but we have C in 1, which contradicts C(-) from CHEED where C was in position 1 and marked – (meaning C is in word but not in 1).  
Wait, in CHEED, C was in position 1 and marked –, meaning C is in word but not in position 1.  
Therefore, C cannot be in position 1 for this guess. So C must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try pattern: _ E _ D C  
This satisfies:
- C must be in 5 (allowed)
- D must be in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 2
- Need positions 1 and 3.

Letters left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

We need valid words like:
- P E W D C – not a word.
- J E W D C – not a word.
- M E X D C – not a word.

Let’s try position 3 with U (only remaining vowel):

Pattern: _ E U D C  
Need position 1 consonant: W gives “W E U D C” – not valid.
M gives “M E U D C” – not valid.

Alternative: introduce K in position 3.

Pattern: _ E K D C  
Need position 1: J, M, P, V, W, Z.

“J E K D C” – not a word.
“M E K D C” – not a word.

Let’s try pattern: _ E D C _  
C in 4, D in 3, E in 2.

Need positions 1 and 5.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- W E D C K – “WEDCK” not valid.
- M E D C K – not valid.

Pattern: _ E _ C D  
C in 3, D in 5 (but D cannot be in 5 from D(-) in EGGED), so invalid.

Pattern: _ E C _ D  
C in 3, D in 5 – but D cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern: D E C _ _  
D in 1, E in 2, C in 3.

Need positions 4 and 5.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- D E C K S – S forbidden.
- D E C O Y – O forbidden.

Pattern: _ E D _ C  
D in 3, C in 5.

Need positions 1 and 4.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible word: P E D U C – “PEDUC” not valid.
W E D U C – not valid.
J E D U C – not valid.

Re-evaluate: perhaps the second E is in position 1.

Pattern: E E _ _ C  
E in 1 and 2, C in 5.

Need positions 3 and 4.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U, D.

D must appear somewhere, so position 3 or 4.

- E E D D C – invalid.
- E E D K C – not a word.
- E E K D C – not a word.

Seems stuck. Let’s list all still-allowed consonants and see possible words.

Allowed consonants: C, D, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Allowed vowels: E, U  
E must appear twice (positions 2 and one other), C and D must appear.

Let’s try: D E C K U  
Check feedback constraints:
- E in 2: ✓
- C must be in word, here in 3
- D must be in word, here in 1
- All letters allowed
But “DECKU” is not a word.

Next: P E C K U – “PECKU” not a word.
M E C K U – not a word.

Try: J U D E C  
But E must be in position 2.

Try: D U C E E  
E must be in position 2, but here positions 4 and 5.

Better approach: limited valid words with known constraints.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with E in 2, C and D somewhere, and no forbidden letters.

Possible word: “CEDER” – R forbidden.
“DEUCE” – U is allowed, E in 2, C and D present, but positions need checking.

Let’s test “DEUCE”:
D E U C E  
Check constraints:
- E in 2: ✓
- E also in 5: but we have E(-) for position 5 from INLET, so E cannot be in 5. Invalid.

Next: “DUNCE” – N is forbidden.
“JUDGE” – G is forbidden.
“MUCID” – I is forbidden.

“PUCKED” – 6 letters.
“WUCKED” – 6 letters.

“EDUCE” – E in 1 and 3 (position 3 E is ruled out).
“EDUCT” – T is forbidden.

“JUKED” – K, E, U, D: valid 5-letter word.

Check constraints for JUKED:
J U K E D  
- E in 4: but we have E(-) for 4 from CHEED, so valid (just means E not in 4).  
But we need E in 2 (position 2 here is U) – invalid.

Re-examine: must have E in position 2.

Valid words with E in 2, and C and D elsewhere (C and D must appear), and no forbidden letters:

- D E C K U – not a word.
- C E D U M – not a word.

“WEDGE” – G is forbidden.

“PEDRO” – R, O forbidden.

“DEXIE” – I forbidden.

“JEMMY” – M, Y but Y forbidden.

“KEDGE” – G is forbidden.

“MEZED” – Z, E, D: valid word? “MEZED” is a word (variant of meze).

Check letters: M, E, Z, E, D  
- E in 2: ✓  
- E in 4: allowed (just –)  
- C must appear, but not in word – so invalid (we know C is in word).

“MEDIC” – I forbidden.

“CEDER” – R forbidden.

“DECKO” – O forbidden.

“WUXED” – W, U, X, E, D – not a word.

“ZEDEK” – K allowed, but not a word.

Realizing constraint: C must appear, and only positions 3, 4, 5 allowed for C (since C(-) in position 1).

Let’s try pattern: _ E C D _  
Need position 1 and 5.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible word: J E C K D – not a word.
M E C K D – not a word.
P E C K D – not a word.

Pattern: _ E D C _  
Need position 1 and 5.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible word: W E D C K – not a word.

Pattern: _ E _ C D  
Need position 1 and 3.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

Possible word: P E U C D – not a word.

Seems there are very few valid words left. Let’s try “WEDEC” – not valid.

Re-examining: perhaps the second E is in position 4, and C is in 3 or 5.

Pattern: _ E _ E C  
E in 2 and 4, C in 5.

Need position 1 and 3.

Letters: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, D, U.

Possible word: D E P E C – not a word.
M E D E C – not a word.
J E D E C – not a word.

“MEPEC” – not a word.

“WEDE C” – invalid.

This is proving difficult. Let me list all constraints clearly:

Known so far:
- Position 2: E ✓
- Additional E: only possible positions 1 or 4 (since 2 is taken, 3 and 5 ruled out)
- C must appear somewhere (positions 3,4,5)
- D must appear somewhere (positions 1,3,4)
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y, G, H

Valid consonants: C, D, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Valid vowels: E, U

Let’s try pattern: D E C E _  
D in 1, E in 2, C in 3, E in 4.

Need position 5 consonant: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible word: D E C E K – “DECEK” not valid.
D E C E P – “DECEP” not valid.

Pattern: J E C E D  
J in 1, E in 2, C in 3, E in 4, D in 5 – but D is ruled out for 5.

Pattern: C E D E _  
C in 1 is ruled out (C(-) in position 1 from CHEED).

Pattern: _ E D E C  
D in 3, E in 4, C in 5.

Need position 1 consonant: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible word: J E D E C – “JEDEC” not a word.
M E D E C – not a word.
P E D E C – “PEDEC” not a word.

Pattern: _ E C _ D  
C in 3, D in 5 – but D is ruled out for 5.

Pattern: _ E U _ C  
U as only remaining vowel, but we need D somewhere.

Realizing: must have both C and D, plus E in 2 and another E in 1 or 4.

Only possible valid word seems “DEUCE” but it has E in 4 (allowed) and 2, but C in 3 and D in 1, but U is present – but we have no info on U.

But let’s check “DEUCE” against all constraints:

D E U C E  
- E in 2: ✓  
- E in 4: allowed (only –)  
- C in 3: allowed  
- D in 1: allowed  
- U: no info, but not forbidden  
- No forbidden letters

This is the only plausible candidate remaining.

<guess>DEUCE</guess>
</think>

After carefully working through the constraints, the only remaining plausible 5-letter word that fits all the collected information is:

<guess>DEUCE</guess>",DEUCE,"Latest feedback on CHEED:
C(-) H(x) E(-) E(-) D(-)

Decoded:
- C is in the word but not in position 1
- H is NOT in the word
- First E is “-”: E is in the word but not in position 3
- Second E is “-”: E is in the word but not in position 4
- D is “-”: D is in the word but not in position 5

What we now know:
1. Position 2 is E (from BEEFY).
2. Additional E must appear exactly once (since we haven’t seen two ✓ yet).  
   Allowed positions for the second E: only position 3 has a “-” status, yet we just got “-” for position 3, so E cannot be there.  
   Therefore, the second E can only be in position 1 or 4.
   - Position 1: C is allowed here, but we just saw C(-) so C is allowed somewhere else.
   - Position 4: D must fit somewhere.

3. D must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
   - Position 2 is already E.
   - Position 5 is ruled out for D.
4. C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
   - Position 2 is E.
   - Position 5 is open.
5. Forbidden letters accumulated: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, F, Y, G, H  
   Allowed consonants left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Remaining vowels: U, E (E already covered).

6. Possible patterns:
   - C _ E _ _  → but position 2 is E, so C _ E _ _  → C E E _ _  (second E in 3, but 3 is now ruled out for E) → invalid.
   - _ E C _ _  → but C must appear.
   - _ E _ C _  → possible.
   - _ E _ _ C  → possible (position 5).

Also, D must fit in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to fit C and D and the second E:

Option 1: D E _ E C  
But E in 4 is ruled out.

Option 2: _ E D E C  
E in 4 is ruled out.

Option 3: _ E _ D C  
D in 4 is allowed, C in 5 is allowed (C(-) means C is in word, and position 5 is open for C).

So pattern: _ E _ D C  
We need a consonant in position 1 and 3.

Letters left for positions 1 and 3: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U (but U is vowel, and we have no confirmation of U yet).

Let’s pick common consonants.

Possible words:
- W E X D C – not a word.
- M E W D C – not a word.
- J E K D C – not a word.
- V E J D C – not a word.

Let’s try to list real 5-letter words that fit _ E _ D C.

Lexicon check:
- MEDIC – I is forbidden.
- PEDIC – I is forbidden.
- VEDIC – I is forbidden.

Alternative pattern: C must appear somewhere else. Let’s try C in position 3.

Pattern: _ E C D _

We need valid words like:

- W E C K S – S is forbidden.

Seems difficult. Let’s try pattern: _ E D _ C

Need position 1 and 3.
Valid word: W E D G E – G is forbidden.
M E D I C – I is forbidden.
P E D I C – I is forbidden.

Alternative pattern: D E _ _ C

Possible words:

Wait, in CHEED, C was in position 1 and marked –, meaning C is in word but not in position 1.  
Therefore, C cannot be in position 1 for this guess. So C must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try pattern: _ E _ D C  
This satisfies:
- C must be in 5 (allowed)
- D must be in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 2
- Need positions 1 and 3.

Letters left: J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.

We need valid words like:

Let’s try position 3 with U (only remaining vowel):

Need position 1 consonant: W gives “W E U D C” – not valid.
M gives “M E U D C” – not valid.

Alternative: introduce K in position 3.
