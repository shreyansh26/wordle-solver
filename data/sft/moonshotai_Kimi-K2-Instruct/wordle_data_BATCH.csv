For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters, so I can get feedback on multiple common letters at once.

A very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives me a good chance to learn about several letters in the secret word.

- O(x) – O is not in the word at all
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all

1. Letters definitely NOT present: R, O, S, E.
2. Letter A is somewhere in positions 2-5.
3. We still don’t know about many other common letters (T, L, N, I, D, etc.).

- Uses T, L, N, I, and D (the next most common letters),
- Keeps A in a different slot,
- Uses only 5 unique letters.

A good choice is “TAINT”: it contains A in position 2 (new position), plus T, I, and N which we haven’t tested yet. It also avoids the eliminated letters (R, O, S, E).

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE  
   A(-)  – A is present but not in slot 1  
   R(x) – R is absent  
   O(x) – O is absent  
   S(x) – S is absent  
   E(x) – E is absent  

2. TAINT  
   T(-) – T is present but not in slots 1 or 5  
   A(✓) – A is in slot 2  
   I(x) – I is absent  
   N(x) – N is absent  
   T(-) – (same as above)

Known facts:
- Word has the form _ A _ _ _
- The only letters confirmed present so far are A (fixed in slot 2) and T (somewhere in 3 or 4).
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, I, N
- Eliminated positions: A not in 1, T not in 1 or 5.

We still need to test common consonants like L, D, C, B, G, etc. and vowels like U.

A good next guess that fits the _ A _ _ _ pattern, uses the confirmed T in a new position (slot 3), and introduces fresh common letters is “CATCH”. However, CATCH reuses C and H which may not be optimal.  

A more balanced choice is “BALDY”:
- B, L, D, Y are new; A is fixed in slot 2; T is not used so we can test another slot for it later if needed.  
But we must include T somewhere since we know it’s in the word.

The word “PARTY” is invalid (P not tested, but we already know T is not in slot 5).

Instead, we can use “LATTE” but E is eliminated.

Better: “BATON” has O (eliminated) and N (eliminated).

Try “CARTY” – no R.

A valid option that places T in slot 3 and introduces new common letters is “MATED” (but E and D are fine, E is eliminated).

Wait: letters left to test include U, L, C, B, G, M, D, Y.  

A valid word: “CADET” – but E is eliminated.

“CABOT” – but O is eliminated.

“GAULT” – but U is untested and A is fixed in slot 2.

“VAULT” – V is okay.

But we know T must be in 3 or 4.  

Let’s choose “VAULT”:
- _ A _ _ _ pattern: V A U L T
- T in slot 5: but feedback said T is not in slot 5. So invalid.

“GAULT” – T in slot 5 again: no.

“TABBY” – T in slot 1: no (T not in slot 1).

“LATCH” – T in slot 4: allowed.

So “LATCH” seems valid:
- A in slot 2 (confirmed)
- T in slot 4 (allowed, not ruled out)
- L, C, H are fresh common letters

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letters, so I can get feedback on multiple common letters at once.\n\nA very popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats.

We now have:

- Pattern: _ A T C H
- Every letter in LATCH except L is in the correct place:
  – A is 2nd ✓
  – T is 3rd ✓
  – C is 4th ✓
  – H is 5th ✓
- Therefore the only unknown is the first letter.
- Letters already eliminated: R, O, S, E, I, N, L
- Remaining plausible first letters (common consonants/vowels not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
