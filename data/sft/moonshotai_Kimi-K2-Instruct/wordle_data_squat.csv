For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with diverse high-frequency letters.

One excellent starting word is ""SLATE"" because:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common letter in many positions
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently occurring letters that will help identify or eliminate many possibilities in the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

• S at position 1 is ✓ – so the word must start with “S”.
• A is in the word but not in position 3 – it must appear somewhere else.
• T is in the word but not in position 4 – it must appear somewhere else.
• L and E are NOT in the word at all.

So far we know: S _ _ _ _ with letters {A, T} present somewhere after the first position, and no L or E.

Good next-step words should:
1. keep S in position 1,
2. include the letters A and T in new positions,
3. introduce other common unused letters.

A word that satisfies this is “SATIN”:
- First letter S stays fixed.
- A moves to position 2 (new location).
- T moves to position 3 (new location).
- Brings in new letters I and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

This maximizes information for the second guess.

From the two clues so far:

1. slate → S ✓   L x   A – (wrong position)   T – (wrong position)   E x  
2. satin → S ✓   A – (wrong position)   T – (wrong position)   I x   N x

Known facts:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and T, but neither A nor T is in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from the two guesses).
- So A and T must both be in position 5 – impossible, because only one letter can occupy that slot.  
  ⇒ The only way both A and T can still be required is if one of them is actually in position 4 (since in “slate” T was position 4 and got “-”, and in “satin” T was position 3 and got “-”; that still lets T sit in position 2, 4 or 5. But A was position 3 in slate and 2 in satin, both “-”, so A must be in position 4 or 5.)

Let’s tabulate possible locations:

S _ _ _ _

- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Remaining slots: 4 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4. Remaining slots: 2 or 5.

Case 1: A in 4 and T in 2  
  S T _ A _

Case 2: A in 5 and T in 2  
  S T _ _ A

Case 3: A in 5 and T in 5 – impossible (conflict).

So only viable patterns are
S T _ A _   or   S T _ _ A.

From the new feedback on STRAP:

- S ✓ (position 1 correct)
- T – (in word but not position 2)
- A ✓ (position 4 correct)

Current certainty:
S _ _ A _
with T somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Letters eliminated so far: L, E, I, N, R, P.

We need a word that:
- starts with S
- has A in position 4
- contains T in position 3 or 5
- uses only remaining possible letters (no L/E/I/N/R/P)

Possible patterns:
S _ T A _ or S _ _ A T

Looking at common letters not yet used: C, H, M, O, U, Y, etc.

For S _ T A _: ""SUTAH"" (but H wasn't tested, and U is available)
For S _ _ A T: ""SCAHT"" (but C and H are new)

Between these, ""SCATT"" uses T twice which might be inefficient, and ""SUTAH"" uses U and H. Alternatively, ""SOAKT"" isn't valid. A better common word would be ""SCANT"" but N is already eliminated.

Actually, let's try ""SUTRA"" - but R is eliminated. ""SUTTA"" - double T is possible but not helpful.

The cleanest remaining option fitting S _ T A _ is ""SUTAH"" (though not super common), or better yet ""SWATH"" (but W wasn't eliminated yet).

Wait, let's consider ""SCANT"" has N (eliminated). ""SHALT"" has L (eliminated). ""SWATH"" has W and H, both possible.

But we need position 3 T, position 4 A, and a valid word.

""SWATH"" would give us S W A T H which doesn't fit our pattern.

Re-evaluating: We need position 4 A, and T must be in 3 or 5.

The only valid common word fitting S _ T A _ is ""SOTHA"" (invalid) or ""SETHA"" (E eliminated).

Actually, the pattern S _ T A _ with valid letters would be ""SOTHA"" (invalid), so perhaps better to try S _ _ A T with available letters.

Looking at S _ _ A T with remaining letters: C, H, M, O, U, Y...

""SOHAT"" (invalid), ""SUMAT"" (invalid), ""SCYAT"" (invalid), ""SHMAT"" (invalid).

The only possible valid word seems ""SWATH"" but that has A in 3.

Realizing my earlier oversight: The pattern must be S _ T A _ or S _ _ A T.

Valid words:
- S _ T A _: ""SPRAT"" (P,R eliminated) - no
- ""SUTRA"" (R eliminated) - no
- ""SOTTA"" (double T, O allowed, T in 3) - possible but double T

Actually, ""SOTTA"" is invalid. Next possible: ""SUTTA"" (same issue).

Looking back, the cleanest valid word fitting S _ T A _ is ""SUTRA"" but R is out.

Therefore, the only viable pattern left is S _ _ A T.

Valid words in this pattern:
- ""SQUAT"" (Q and U new)
- ""SCUAT"" (invalid)
- ""SHMAT"" (invalid)

""SQUAT"" is valid and uses Q and U which haven't been tested.

Let's verify:
S Q U A T
- S ✓ (position 1)
- Q new
- U new
- A ✓ (position 4)
- T would now be in position 5 - which we haven't tested yet for T.

This seems optimal as it places T in position 5 and tests two new letters (Q and U).
