For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, N, L. A good starting word should cover these without repeating letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with **CRANE** as it includes the very common letters C, R, A, N, E, giving good coverage for initial elimination.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.  
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong place (not in position 2).  
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong place (not in position 3).  
- N(x) – N is not in the word.  
- E(✓) – E is in the word and already in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- The secret word ends in E.
- It contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively, and does not contain C or N.
- We still need to determine the first two letters.

A good second guess would try common letters we haven’t used yet (like S, T, L, O, D, etc.) while placing R and A in new positions and keeping E fixed at the end.

Let’s try: “STORE”
- S, T, O are new letters.
- R is moved to position 3 (new spot).
- E remains in position 5.
- A is not used this turn (we’ll re-introduce it later if necessary).

However, since we already know A is definitely in the word, it’s better to use it now to discover its correct placement.  
A better choice is “STARE”:
- S, T are new.
- A is moved to position 2.
- R is moved to position 3.
- E remains at 5.

But R must not be in position 2 (already known), so R in position 3 is fine.

Let’s refine: “STARE” puts A in position 2 and R in position 3, which is acceptable.

Another option that moves A and R to fresh positions without repeating eliminated letters is “RAISE”:
- R in position 1 (new for R).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- I, S are new letters.
- E in position 5.

This is a strong candidate.

I’ll go with “RAISE”.
