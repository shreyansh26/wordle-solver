For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. This is typically done by selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words, and ideally covering multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some strong starting words include:
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet while using very common letters. I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → 'C' is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → 'R' is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) → 'N' is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → 'E' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: C, R, N
- Letters definitely present (but misplaced): A, E

The word contains A and E, but not where they appeared in CRANE.  
That means:
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that includes both A and E, avoids C, R, N, and doesn’t place A in position 3 or E in position 5.

A good next step is to find a word that shifts A and E to new positions while introducing other common letters not yet tested (like T, S, L, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- TEACH – but H hasn’t been tested much, and this places E in 1 and A in 3 (A cannot be in position 3).
- LEAST – L, E, A, S, T; includes A (position 3 invalid), so no.
- PEATS – P, E, A, T, S; A in position 3 is invalid.
- FLEAS – F, L, E, A, S; A in position 4, E in 3. Both letters are new positions, no C/R/N. Looks valid.

Let’s check FLEAS:
- Letters: F, L, E, A, S
- Contains: A (new position 4), E (new position 3)
- Excludes: C, R, N
- No conflicts with prior feedback.

- E: cannot be in positions 3 (from CRANE) or 2 (from FLEAS)

3. places  
   – A somewhere other than positions 3 or 4  
   – E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5  
   – L somewhere other than position 2  

Let’s test possible words systematically.

(We must use A, E, L; the remaining two letters must come from the other allowed letters.)

The missing letters must be drawn from {B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

- R(x) → 'R' is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) → 'N' is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → 'E' is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: C, R, N
- Letters definitely present (but misplaced): A, E

The word contains A and E, but not where they appeared in CRANE.  
That means:
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that includes both A and E, avoids C, R, N, and doesn’t place A in position 3 or E in position 5.

A good next step is to find a word that shifts A and E to new positions while introducing other common letters not yet tested (like T, S, L, M, P, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- TEACH – but H hasn’t been tested much, and this places E in 1 and A in 3 (A cannot be in position 3).
- LEAST – L, E, A, S, T; includes A (position 3 invalid), so no.
- PEATS – P, E, A, T, S; A in position 3 is invalid.
- FLEAS – F, L, E, A, S; A in position 4, E in 3. Both letters are new positions, no C/R/N. Looks valid.

Let’s check FLEAS:
- Letters: F, L, E, A, S
- Contains: A (new position 4), E (new position 3)
- Excludes: C, R, N
- No conflicts with prior feedback.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Known facts so far  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, F, S  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but all are in wrong positions so far): A, E, L  

Positions we can eliminate for each known letter  
- A: cannot be in positions 3 (from CRANE) or 4 (from FLEAS)  
- E: cannot be in positions 3 (from CRANE) or 2 (from FLEAS)  
- L: cannot be in position 2 (from FLEAS)

So we need a 5-letter word that  
1. contains the letters A, E, L  
2. does NOT contain C, R, N, F, S  
3. places  
   – A somewhere other than positions 3 or 4  
   – E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5  
   – L somewhere other than position 2  

Let’s test possible words systematically.

Candidate letters still allowed: A, B, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(We must use A, E, L; the remaining two letters must come from the other allowed letters.)

Try to put A in position 1, E in position 4, L in position 3 → “A _ L E _”  
The missing letters must be drawn from {B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
We want common ones to maximize information.  
Possible combinations:  
- A B L E D → ABLED – valid word.  
- A D L E T → ADLET – not a common word.  
- A P L E T → APLET – not valid.  
- A H L E Y → AHLEY – not valid.  
- A G L E T → AGLET – valid (a shoelace tip).  

Both ABLED and AGLET are valid. ABLED is more common, but we’re looking for anything that fits the constraints.

Let’s choose ABLED.

Check constraints quickly  
- Contains A, E, L → yes  
- Does not contain C, R, N, F, S → yes  
- Positioning:  
   – A is in 1 (allowed)

Summary of what we now know

Letters **in** the word: A, E, L  
Letters **out** of the word: C, R, N, F, S, B, D  

From the feedback on ABLED:
- A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.  
- E is in the word and now **correctly placed** in position 4.  
- L is in the word and now **correctly placed** in position 3.  

Current template

(letters 3 and 4 are locked)

Remaining letters allowed (not yet ruled out):  
G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must use A once and need one more consonant (or letter) to fill positions 1, 2 and 5.  
Constraints:
- A must appear in one of the remaining free positions (1, 2, or 5).  
- No repeats of letters already used (A, L, E).  
- All chosen letters must be from the “allowed” list above.

   T A L E A – no  

The only valid, common-enough word that satisfies every constraint is “PALET”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This is typically done by selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words, and ideally covering multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some strong starting words include:
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" seems particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet while using very common letters. I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

From Guess 4 (PALET):
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is now correctly fixed in position 2.
- L(✓) – L remains correctly fixed in position 3.
- E(✓) – E remains correctly fixed in position 4.
- T(✓) – T is now correctly fixed in position 5.

So the word has the form:
[?] A L E T

Only the first letter is still unknown.

Letters already excluded: C, R, N, F, S, B, D, P  
Letters still allowed: G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
(plus A, L, E, T which we already know are used)

We need a single letter to go in position 1 to form a valid English 5-letter word ending in A L E T.

Possible first letters:
- G → G A L E T — not a recognized English word.
- H → H A L E T — “halet” is not a standard word.
- I → I A L E T — invalid.
- J → J A L E T — invalid.
- K → K A L E T — invalid.
- M → M A L E T — “mallet” is 6 letters; “malet” is not standard.
- O → O A L E T — invalid.
- Q → Q A L E T — invalid.
- U → U A L E T — invalid.
- V → V A L E T — “valet” is a valid English word, and none of its letters conflict with any exclusions.

“VALET” perfectly fits:
- V is still allowed.
- Forms the word V A L E T that matches every known position and exclusion.

Therefore, the final guess is “VALET”.
