For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gained. Common first guess strategies include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage with 3 consonants and 2 vowels
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also strong with 3 consonants and 2 vowels
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - 2 vowels and 3 consonants, all very common letters

I think ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains 3 of the 5 most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It contains R and S which are among the most common consonants
3. All letters are in the top 10 most frequent letters in English words
4. Even if none are correct, it eliminates many possibilities

This should give good coverage for the first guess to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of possibilities.  
To maximize information on the second guess, I should pick a word that uses the next most common letters that were not tried yet.

The remaining “good” letters are: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc.  
A classic second-guess word that uses none of the eliminated letters and covers another five high-frequency letters is “UNITY”.  It gives us:

- U (vowel)  
- N (common consonant)  
- I (vowel)  
- T (common consonant)  
- Y (semi-common consonant)

Alternate choices might be “UNTIL” or “CHILD”, but “UNITY” cleanly avoids A, R, O, S, E and is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback analysis:
1. A, R, O, S, E are all ruled out (from AROSE).
2. U is in the word and in the correct first position.
3. N is in the word and in the correct second position.
4. I is in the word but not in position 3.
5. T is in the word but not in position 4.
6. Y is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Pattern so far: U N _ _ _
- Letters still to place: I and T must appear somewhere in positions 3–5 (but not where they just were), plus possibly one more letter.
- Allowed letters: anything not in {A, R, O, S, E, Y} plus I and T.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Starts with UN
- Moves I and T into different spots (positions 4 and 5 if possible)
- Introduces a new consonant in position 3.

Good candidate consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is “UNTIL”:
- Starts UN ✔
- T in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said T is not in position 4 of UNITY, and we’re moving it)
- I in position 5 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 3)
- L is a new consonant that hasn’t been tried.

This placement satisfies all constraints and should give us maximum information.
