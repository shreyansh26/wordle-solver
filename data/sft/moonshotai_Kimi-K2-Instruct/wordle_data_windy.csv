For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common letters and ideally includes several vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU,"" as they cover frequent letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives a good spread of frequent letters to maximize information gained from the feedback.

None of the letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) appear in the secret word.  
That means the word does **not** contain any of those five letters.  

To choose a good second guess, I should avoid those letters entirely and instead use the remaining common letters.  
Common consonants left: C, R, N, D, M, P, F, G, H, B, K  
Common vowels left: I, O, U, Y

So far we know:
- All letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the word.
- All letters in CRIMP (C, R, M, P) are NOT in the word, except I which is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Therefore, the word:
- Contains the letter I (and it’s not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P.

Remaining common letters to try:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, O, U (since E and A are already eliminated)

We still need to test O and U as possible vowels, and we need more consonant coverage.

A good word would place I in a different spot (not 3rd) and include O or U plus some fresh consonants.

Candidate words:
- “BINGO” – uses B, N, G, O, I. All letters are untested so far.  
- “DINGO” – same idea.  
- “HOUND” – uses H, O, U, N, D.

I’ll choose “HOUND” because it checks two new vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (H, D, N), while avoiding every eliminated letter and placing I in a new spot (it isn’t in HOUND, so we’ll see if any of O or U show up).

Wait – but I already know I is in the word, so “HOUND” doesn’t contain I. That’s bad because we need to confirm where I goes and keep testing other letters.

From the feedback so far:

Letters ruled OUT (x):  
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, M, P, B, G, O  

Letters confirmed IN and their positions:  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (-)  

So the word looks like:  
_ I _ _ _  

Known letters contained: I, N  

Remaining un-tested common letters:  
D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U  

Need a 5-letter word that:  
1. Starts with any letter except those ruled out.  
2. Has I fixed in position 2.  
3. Contains N in position 1, 4 or 5 (since it’s not in 3).  
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Good candidates:  
- ""DINER"" – but E is ruled out.  
- ""FINED"" – E is ruled out.  
- ""HINNY"" – Y is allowed, two Ns, but double N might be unlikely.  
- ""WINCH"" – C, H ruled out.  
- ""VINYL"" – L ruled out.  
- ""WITAN"" – T ruled out.  
- ""KININ"" – double I+N but K is allowed.  
- ""DINGY"" – G ruled out.  
- ""FINNY"" – F, Y, N allowed, two Ns.  

""FINNY"" fits:  
- F (untested)  
- I in position 2 (✓)  
- N not in position 3 (it’s in 3, wait – no, that’s bad! N must NOT be in position 3, so ""FINNY"" has N in positions 3 and 4 – position 3 is invalid.  

""KININ"" has N in positions 3 and 5 – position 3 is invalid.  

""VINYL"" – N is in position 3, invalid.  

""WIDEN"" – E ruled out, N in position 5 (valid), but E is out.  

""WINDY"" – D, Y allowed, N in position 4 (valid).  
Structure: W I N D Y  
- Letters: W, I, N, D, Y – none ruled out except N position is 4 (allowed).  

This seems perfect.  

Another check: ""FILMY"" – M, L, Y; M and L are out.  

So ""WINDY"" is a valid choice.

Alternative: ""VINID"" – not a word.  

""FUGIO"" – G, O, U ruled out.  

""WIMPY"" – M, P ruled out.  

Thus, best clean option is ""WINDY"".
