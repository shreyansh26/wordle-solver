For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English alphabet to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word would use these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information

From the feedback:
- A is correct in position 1.  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
  
That leaves us with:
- First letter is A.
- The remaining four letters must be chosen from the rest of the alphabet excluding R, O, S, E.

Letters still possible (excluding R, O, S, E):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a second guess that keeps A in the first position and uses four new letters to gather more information quickly. A good mix of common remaining consonants and vowels is ideal.

Current knowledge:

- Positions: A _ _ I T  (positions 1, 4, 5 are fixed and correct)
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B
- So the two missing letters (positions 2 and 3) must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B, I, T (since I and T are already placed correctly).

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with A, ends with IT, and uses two letters from the remaining set for positions 2 and 3.

Let's scan for such words:

- A C _ I T → ACUIT (not a word)
- A F _ I T → AFIT? (not valid)

- AHIT? (invalid)
- AKIT? (invalid)
- APIT? (invalid)
- AQUIT? (invalid)
- ASIT? (invalid)
- AWIT? (invalid)
- AYIT? (invalid)

Hmm, none seem valid. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me think differently: ""ACID"" is a word, but we need A _ _ I T.

Wait, what about ""AUDIT""? It fits A _ _ I T, but U is still available, D is still available, and I and T are already confirmed.

Let's check:
A U D I T → 
- A is correct position (known)
- U is new (position 2) - not yet tested
- D is new (position 3) - not yet tested
- I is correct (position 4)
- T is correct (position 5)

Is ""AUDIT"" a valid word? Yes.

Does it use only permitted letters? U and D have not been ruled out yet (they weren't in any of the previous guesses), and A, I, T are confirmed correct. The rest (R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B) are all excluded.

So ""AUDIT"" seems to fit perfectly.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English alphabet to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word would use these letters to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- It's a valid English word

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is correct in position 1.  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
  
That leaves us with:
- First letter is A.
- The remaining four letters must be chosen from the rest of the alphabet excluding R, O, S, E.

Letters still possible (excluding R, O, S, E):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a second guess that keeps A in the first position and uses four new letters to gather more information quickly. A good mix of common remaining consonants and vowels is ideal.

Good candidates:  
- A + B, I, L, T → ""ABILITY"" (too long)  
- A + L, I, N, T → ""ALINT"" (invalid)  
- A + M, I, N, T → ""AMINT"" (invalid)  
- A + L, I, C, K → ""ALICK"" (invalid)  
- A + B, I, L, T → ""ABILT"" (invalid)  
- A + T, I, N, Y → ""ATINY"" (invalid)  

A valid word with A fixed and new letters: ""ABIDE"" uses B, I, D, E but E is already excluded.  
""ALIBI"" uses A, L, I, B, I → but I is repeated and L, I, B are new.  
""ALMNT"" is invalid.  

A valid word with A and new letters: ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, D, I, O → but O is excluded.  
""AULIC"" uses A, U, L, I, C → valid, but rare.  

A better common word: ""ANVIL"" uses A, N, V, I, L → valid and uses new letters.  

Let's go with ""ANVIL"".

Guess 2: ANVIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(x) V(x) I(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. First letter: A (fixed in position 1).
2. Letters already proven absent: R, O, S, E, N, V, L.
3. Letters still possible for the remaining four slots: any letter **except** A, R, O, S, E, N, V, L.

Additionally, from Guess 2 we learned that:
- I is in the word and is in the **correct** position (position 4).
- So the pattern is now: A _ _ I _

We need three more letters that are **not** among R, O, S, E, N, V, L.
Common letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Aiming for a common word that satisfies A _ _ I _, a quick scan yields:
- AMBIT  – but B and M are still possible, T is possible, too.  (Valid 5-letter word.)
- ACTIN  – C, T possible.
- ACIDY  – but Y is less common and ""ACIDY"" is rarer.
- AGING  – G possible, but second G repeats and may waste info.
- APHID  – P, H, D possible.

""AMBIT"" feels like the best mix of common letters that fit the pattern and haven’t been ruled out.

Hmm, none seem valid. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me think differently: ""ACID"" is a word, but we need A _ _ I T.

Wait, what about ""AUDIT""? It fits A _ _ I T, but U is still available, D is still available, and I and T are already confirmed.

Let's check:
A U D I T → 
- A is correct position (known)
- U is new (position 2) - not yet tested
- D is new (position 3) - not yet tested
- I is correct (position 4)
- T is correct (position 5)

Is ""AUDIT"" a valid word? Yes.

Does it use only permitted letters? U and D have not been ruled out yet (they weren't in any of the previous guesses), and A, I, T are confirmed correct. The rest (R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B) are all excluded.

(invalid)\n- ASIT? (invalid)\n- AWIT? (invalid)\n- AYIT? (invalid)\n\nHmm, none seem valid. Maybe I\'m missing some. Let me think differently: ""ACID"" is a word, but we need A _ _ I T.\n\nWait, what about ""AUDIT""? It fits A _ _ I T, but U is still available, D is still available, and I and T are already confirmed.\n\nLet\'s check:\nA U D I T → \n- A is correct position (known)\n- U is new (position 2) - not yet tested\n- D is new (position 3) - not yet tested\n- I is correct (position 4)\n- T is correct (position 5)\n\nIs ""AUDIT"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nDoes it use only permitted letters? U and D have not been ruled out yet (they weren\'t in any of the previous guesses), and A, I, T are confirmed correct. The rest (R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B) are all excluded.\n\nSo ""AUDIT"" seems to fit perfectly.\n\n<guess>AUDIT</guess>\n\n<guess>AUDIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ANVIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(x) V(x) I(✓) L(x)\nGuess 3: AMBIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) B(x) I(✓) T(✓)\nGuess 4: AUDIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now know the pattern is A _ _ I T and the following letters are **eliminated** from positions 2 and 3:  
R, O, S, E, N, V, L, M, B, U, D.

Available letters (still unused and not eliminated):  
C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English 5-letter word with form A _ _ I T using only these remaining letters in positions 2 and 3.

Enumerating the few possibilities:

- A C _ I T → need 3rd letter from remaining set: A C F I T (invalid), A C G I T (invalid), …  
- A F _ I T → A F C I T (invalid), A F G I T (invalid), …  
- A G _ I T → A G C I T (invalid), A G F I T (invalid), …  
- A H _ I T → A H C I T (invalid), A H F I T (invalid), …  
- A K _ I T → A K C I T (invalid), A K F I T (invalid), …  
- A P _ I T → A P C I T (invalid), A P F I T (invalid), …  
- A Q _ I T → A Q C I T (invalid), …

Scanning the dictionary for every valid A _ _ I T word not yet ruled out:

- **AFKIT** – not a word  
- **AGFIT** – not a word  
- **AHKIT** – not a word  
- **AKCIT** – not a word  
- **APCIT** – not a word  
- **AQCIT** – not a word  
- **ACRIT** – invalid (R eliminated)  
- **AFFIT** – invalid (F still possible but “AFFIT” not a word)  
- **AGGOT** – doesn’t fit pattern  
- …

The only **valid** word that fits the pattern A _ _ I T and only uses still-allowed letters is:

A F C I T → **AFICT**? – not a word  
A F G I T → **AFGIT**? – not a word  
A F H I T → **AFHIT**? – not a word  
A F K I T → **AFKIT**? – not a word  
A F P I T → **AFPIT**? – not a word  

Wait – the correct word must be **AQUIT**? But U is eliminated.  

Let’s double-check a comprehensive list of A _ _ I T words:

- AFICT – no  
- AGIST – ends ST, not IT  
- ALEFT – ends FT  
- ALIST – ends ST  
- AMRIT – M eliminated  
- ANGEL – ends EL  
- ANGEL – ends EL  
- ANKIT – N eliminated  
- ARBIT – R eliminated  
- AULIC – ends IC  
- AWAIT – ends IT but W is allowed and A is already fixed, I is 4th.  

**AWAIT** – letters A, W, A, I, T.  
- A is fixed at position 1.  
- W is still allowed (never tested).  
- Second A: A is already confirmed in position 1, but can it repeat? Yes, letters can repeat as long as the feedback didn’t mark “A” as only once. All we know is A is correct in position 1; it might appear again.  

All letters in AWAIT are either confirmed correct or still allowed.  
Thus **AWAIT** is a valid guess fitting A _ _ I T and only using letters not yet eliminated.
