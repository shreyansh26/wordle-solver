For the first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters to quickly eliminate or confirm common letters. 

Looking at the most common letters in English (E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U), a strong first guess would be ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes 3 very common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage
- The positions are varied enough to give meaningful feedback about letter placement

We now know:
1. None of S, L, T, E are in the word at all (all marked x).
2. A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (marked -).

Since A is confirmed to be present, we need to try A in a different position.  
We also want to test new, common letters that we haven’t used yet (e.g., R, N, I, O, C, H, M, P, D, U).

A good next guess should:
- Move A to a new position (1st or 5th are best because we already tried 3rd).
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested.
- Be a valid 5-letter word.

A solid candidate is “RAINY”:
- It keeps A but moves it to 2nd position.
- Introduces R, I, N, Y (none of which have been tested).
- Y can sometimes act as a vowel, giving us more vowel coverage.

2. Letter confirmed IN the word but NOT in positions 3 or 2: A

What we now know:

1. Word structure so far: C _ _ M _
   - C is fixed in position 1 (✓).
   - M is fixed in position 4 (✓).

2. Letter A must appear somewhere (because it has always been marked “-”), but it is **not** allowed in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
   - Position 4 is already M, so A must be in position 5.

3. Letters that have been eliminated entirely:  
   S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, P (all received “x”).

4. Remaining positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters that we have not yet tried (from the remaining alphabet).

So the only possible pattern left is:  
C _ _ M A

We now need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3 that:
- Have not been used so far.
- Form a valid 5-letter English word with the fixed pattern C _ _ M A.

Common unused consonants: B, D, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus vowels I, O, U, but we already mandate A in position 5, so other vowels are not required).

Possible valid English words that fit C _ _ M A:
- COBMA – not a valid word.
- CUBMA – not a valid word.
- CODMA – not a valid word.
- COVMA – not a valid word.
- COIMA – not valid.
- CYMIA – not a 5-letter word.
- CUDMA – not valid.
- COGMA – not valid.
- COUMA – not valid.
- COXMA – not valid.
- COTMA – T is already eliminated.
- COBMA – again, invalid.
- COVMA – again, invalid.

Scanning a mental dictionary, the only common word that fits is:
- COBRA – but R is already eliminated.
- COMA_ – but we need 5 letters.
Wait, let’s reconsider: we need C _ _ M A.

Actually, the only common word that fits this exact pattern is **COBIA**, but B and I have not been tried. Let me check quickly:
- Cobia is a real fish (valid word).
- Letters: C, O, B, I, A – all allowed so far (O, B, I not yet tested).

Another valid word is **COYMA**, but “COYMA” is not a recognized English word.

The only solid candidate left is **COBIA**.

Let me double-check:
- C(✓) O _ B _ I _ A
- Fits: C _ _ M A → Actually, no, COBIA does not have M in position 4.

Oops, I made an error! The word must have M in position 4, so pattern is C _ _ M A.

Let me list all possible 5-letter words in English that match C _ _ M A:
- CUBMA – invalid
- CIMBA – invalid
- COBMA – invalid
- COIMA – invalid
- … actually, the only valid one is **COBMA**, but that is not a word.

Wait, let’s try **COMMA**:
- C O M M A – but M is repeated, and we already have M in position 4, but that’s allowed.
- Letters: C, O, M, M, A – none are eliminated except M is already confirmed valid.

But we have already used M in position 4, and it is allowed to appear again (feedback only marked P and H as invalid).

So possible candidates:
- **COBMA** – invalid.
- **COIMA** – invalid.
- **CYMIA** – invalid.
- **COMMA** – valid word.

COMMA is a valid word, fits C _ _ M A, and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So the only possible word left is **COMMA**.

Let me verify:
- C(✓) O _ M(✓) M A
- All letters: C, O, M, M, A – none are eliminated.

Thus, COMMA is the logical next guess.
