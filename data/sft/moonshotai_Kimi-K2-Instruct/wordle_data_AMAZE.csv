For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to gather as much information as possible. Common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N' and vowels like 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' are good candidates. A word like ""AROSE"" covers several of these common letters and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help us quickly eliminate or confirm the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 5.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ _ _ E

We need a five-letter word that starts with A and ends with E, and does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good next consonants to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, X, Z, J, Q (but Q almost always needs a U, so avoid).

Good vowel to test: I or U in the middle.

Let me think of common words with pattern A _ _ _ E and no R, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- ALINE (but has I and N, good letters)
- AGILE (but has G, I, L, E – but second E is already at end)
- AMBLE (has B, M, L – good letters)
- ANIME (but has N, I, M – good letters)
- ADIEU (but has D, I, U – good letters and tests U)

""ADIEU"" is a good choice because it tests the vowels I and U, plus the consonant D. It fits A _ _ _ E and avoids R, O, S.

Let me verify: A D I E U – positions:
1: A (✓ known correct)
5: U vs known E – wait, ADIEU ends in U, but we know position 5 is E. So ADIEU is invalid because it doesn't end in E.

Oops – so must end in E. Let me rethink.

Words ending in E, starting with A, no R, O, S:

- ALIKE – has L, I, K
- ALINE – has L, I, N
- AGILE – but ends in E? No, AGILE ends in E? Wait, AGILE is A G I L E – yes, ends in E.
- ANIME – ends in E, has N, I, M
- ABBEY – but Y is sometimes vowel, but has B, B, E, Y – but ends in Y, not E
- AWARE – but has W, R, but R is excluded
- ABIDE – has B, I, D – ends in E
- ABATE – has B, A, T – but A is already in position 1
- ACUTE – has C, U, T – ends in E

""ABIDE"" seems good: A B I D E – covers B, I, D, keeps A and E in correct spots, avoids R, O, S.

Another good one is ""ALIKE"": A L I K E – covers L, I, K.

Between ABIDE and ALIKE, ABIDE tests more new consonants (B, D) vs ALIKE testing L, K. Both good, but let's go with ABIDE first.

Good next consonants to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, X, Z, J, Q (but Q almost always needs a U, so avoid).

Good vowel to test: I or U in the middle.

Let me think of common words with pattern A _ _ _ E and no R, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- ALINE (but has I and N, good letters)
- AGILE (but has G, I, L, E – but second E is already at end)
- AMBLE (has B, M, L – good letters)
- ANIME (but has N, I, M – good letters)
- ADIEU (but has D, I, U – good letters and tests U)

""ADIEU"" is a good choice because it tests the vowels I and U, plus the consonant D. It fits A _ _ _ E and avoids R, O, S.

Let me verify: A D I E U – positions:
1: A (✓ known correct)
5: U vs known E – wait, ADIEU ends in U, but we know position 5 is E. So ADIEU is invalid because it doesn't end in E.

Oops – so must end in E. Let me rethink.

Words ending in E, starting with A, no R, O, S:

- ALIKE – has L, I, K
- ALINE – has L, I, N
- AGILE – but ends in E? No, AGILE ends in E? Wait, AGILE is A G I L E – yes, ends in E.
- ANIME – ends in E, has N, I, M
- ABBEY – but Y is sometimes vowel, but has B, B, E, Y – but ends in Y, not E
- AWARE – but has W, R, but R is excluded
- ABIDE – has B, I, D – ends in E
- ABATE – has B, A, T – but A is already in position 1
- ACUTE – has C, U, T – ends in E

""ABIDE"" seems good: A B I D E – covers B, I, D, keeps A and E in correct spots, avoids R, O, S.

Another good one is ""ALIKE"": A L I K E – covers L, I, K.

Between ABIDE and ALIKE, ABIDE tests more new consonants (B, D) vs ALIKE testing L, K. Both good, but let's go with ABIDE first.

<guess>ABIDE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ABIDE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. AROSE:
   - A(✓) – first letter correct
   - E(✓) – fifth letter correct
   - R, O, S are NOT in the word.

2. ABIDE:
   - A(✓) again
   - E(✓) again
   - B, I, D are NOT in the word.

So the word must be: A _ _ _ E, with no R, O, S, B, I, D.

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels we haven’t used yet (we've only confirmed A and E; U hasn’t been tested).

We need three middle letters from the remaining pool. Good candidates to test next: L, N, T, C, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

Possible words fitting A _ _ _ E and avoiding all excluded letters:
- ANGLE – but has G and L, G not yet excluded, but N, G, L are new
- AGILE – but has I and G, I is now excluded
- ALONE – but has O and N, O is excluded
- AMUSE – but has M, U, S, S is excluded
- ALURE – but U is allowed, L, R, but R is excluded
- ACUTE – has C, U, T, but second letter C, third U, fourth T
- AMBLE – B is excluded
- ANIME – I is excluded
- AGENE – but has G, N, but ending is E, but AGENE is not common
- AKENE – K is allowed, but seems obscure
- ALATE – T is allowed, L, A, but second A is already known in position 1
- ALANE – has L, A, N, but double A is not possible
- ACKEE – but has C, K, E, E, but ends in E, but seems obscure

""ACUTE"" is a valid word: A C U T E – fits the pattern and tests C, U, T (none excluded yet).

Another candidate: ""ANGLE"" – A N G L E – tests N, G, L.

""ACUTE"" tests more new letters (C, U, T) in one go. So let’s go with ACUTE.

- A is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 5.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ _ _ E

We need a five-letter word that starts with A and ends with E, and does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good next consonants to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, X, Z, J, Q (but Q almost always needs a U, so avoid).

Good vowel to test: I or U in the middle.

Let me think of common words with pattern A _ _ _ E and no R, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- ALINE (but has I and N, good letters)
- AGILE (but has G, I, L, E – but second E is already at end)
- AMBLE (has B, M, L – good letters)
- ANIME (but has N, I, M – good letters)
- ADIEU (but has D, I, U – good letters and tests U)

""ADIEU"" is a good choice because it tests the vowels I and U, plus the consonant D. It fits A _ _ _ E and avoids R, O, S.

Let me verify: A D I E U – positions:

5: U vs known E – wait, ADIEU ends in U, but we know position 5 is E. So ADIEU is invalid because it doesn't end in E.

""ABIDE"" seems good: A B I D E – covers B, I, D, keeps A and E in correct spots, avoids R, O, S.

Another good one is ""ALIKE"": A L I K E – covers L, I, K.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to gather as much information as possible. Common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N' and vowels like 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' are good candidates. A word like ""AROSE"" covers several of these common letters and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help us quickly eliminate or confirm the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- E is correct in position 5.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ _ _ E

We need a five-letter word that starts with A and ends with E, and does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good next consonants to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, X, Z, J, Q (but Q almost always needs a U, so avoid).

Good vowel to test: I or U in the middle.

Let me think of common words with pattern A _ _ _ E and no R, O, S.

Possible candidates:
- ALINE (but has I and N, good letters)
- AGILE (but has G, I, L, E – but second E is already at end)
- AMBLE (has B, M, L – good letters)
- ANIME (but has N, I, M – good letters)
- ADIEU (but has D, I, U – good letters and tests U)

""ADIEU"" is a good choice because it tests the vowels I and U, plus the consonant D. It fits A _ _ _ E and avoids R, O, S.

Let me verify: A D I E U – positions:
1: A (✓ known correct)
5: U vs known E – wait, ADIEU ends in U, but we know position 5 is E. So ADIEU is invalid because it doesn't end in E.

Oops – so must end in E. Let me rethink.

Words ending in E, starting with A, no R, O, S:

- ALIKE – has L, I, K
- ALINE – has L, I, N
- AGILE – but ends in E? No, AGILE ends in E? Wait, AGILE is A G I L E – yes, ends in E.
- ANIME – ends in E, has N, I, M
- ABBEY – but Y is sometimes vowel, but has B, B, E, Y – but ends in Y, not E
- AWARE – but has W, R, but R is excluded
- ABIDE – has B, I, D – ends in E
- ABATE – has B, A, T – but A is already in position 1
- ACUTE – has C, U, T – ends in E

""ABIDE"" seems good: A B I D E – covers B, I, D, keeps A and E in correct spots, avoids R, O, S.

Another good one is ""ALIKE"": A L I K E – covers L, I, K.

Between ABIDE and ALIKE, ABIDE tests more new consonants (B, D) vs ALIKE testing L, K. Both good, but let's go with ABIDE first.

<guess>ABIDE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ABIDE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. AROSE:
   - A(✓) – first letter correct
   - E(✓) – fifth letter correct
   - R, O, S are NOT in the word.

2. ABIDE:
   - A(✓) again
   - E(✓) again
   - B, I, D are NOT in the word.

So the word must be: A _ _ _ E, with no R, O, S, B, I, D.

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels we haven’t used yet (we've only confirmed A and E; U hasn’t been tested).

We need three middle letters from the remaining pool. Good candidates to test next: L, N, T, C, G, H, M, P, U, etc.

Possible words fitting A _ _ _ E and avoiding all excluded letters:
- ANGLE – but has G and L, G not yet excluded, but N, G, L are new
- AGILE – but has I and G, I is now excluded
- ALONE – but has O and N, O is excluded
- AMUSE – but has M, U, S, S is excluded
- ALURE – but U is allowed, L, R, but R is excluded
- ACUTE – has C, U, T, but second letter C, third U, fourth T
- AMBLE – B is excluded
- ANIME – I is excluded
- AGENE – but has G, N, but ending is E, but AGENE is not common
- AKENE – K is allowed, but seems obscure
- ALATE – T is allowed, L, A, but second A is already known in position 1
- ALANE – has L, A, N, but double A is not possible
- ACKEE – but has C, K, E, E, but ends in E, but seems obscure

""ACUTE"" is a valid word: A C U T E – fits the pattern and tests C, U, T (none excluded yet).

Another candidate: ""ANGLE"" – A N G L E – tests N, G, L.

""ACUTE"" tests more new letters (C, U, T) in one go. So let’s go with ACUTE.

- Still-allowed letters for the three middle positions: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with A, ends with E, and uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 2-4.

Candidate letters in each slot:
- Position 2: any of F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: any of A, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but A and E already fixed at ends)
- Position 4: same as position 2

Good common words to test:
- ANGLE – G and L are still allowed
- AMPLE – M, P, L are still allowed
- AGAVE – but A is already used in position 1 and 4, and V is allowed
- ALONE – but O is eliminated
- ALIKE – I is eliminated
- AGREE – but R is eliminated
- ANGEL – uses N, G, E, L; E is already fixed at end
- AMUSE – U and S are eliminated
- AGILE – I is eliminated
- ANIME – I is eliminated

The best remaining common words are:
- ANGLE
- AMPLE

Between these, ANGLE tests G and L, while AMPLE tests M and P. Let’s try ANGLE first to cover more new consonants.

Summary of what we now know:
1. Pattern: A _ A _ E  (positions 1,3,5 are locked in)
2. Letters absolutely NOT in the word anywhere:
   R, O, S, B, I, D, C, U, T, N, G, L, W, K
3. Still-allowed letters for positions 2 and 4:
   Consonants: F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
   (All vowels except A/E are already ruled out; A and E are fixed.)

We need two consonants that make a valid 5-letter word of the form A ? A ? E.

Scanning the remaining letters:
- H and M: AHAME – not a word  
- H and F: AHAFE – not a word  
- M and P: AMPAE – not a word  
- M and H: AMAHE – not a word  
- F and H: AF...E – nothing common  
- M and Z: AMAZE – valid word!  
  - Letters used: M (pos 2), Z (pos 4) – both still allowed.  
  - No forbidden letters appear.  

Therefore the only plausible remaining common word is AMAZE.
