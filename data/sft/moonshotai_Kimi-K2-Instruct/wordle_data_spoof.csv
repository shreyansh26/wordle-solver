Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy is to start with a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A word like ""STARE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters and is a good starting point because:
1. It covers multiple common vowels (A, E)
2. It includes common consonants (S, T, R)
3. It's a valid 5-letter word
4. It will give us information about several key letters right away

From the feedback for STARE:
- S ✓ (correct letter, correct position)
- T, A, R, E are all completely absent (x)

So the secret word starts with S and does not contain T, A, R, or E.

Next useful starting consonants after S: N, L, C, M, P, D, B, G, F, H.  
Useful vowels remaining: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and Y is sometimes a vowel).

I want a word that:
1. Begins with S
2. Uses none of T, A, R, E
3. Introduces new common letters quickly to maximize information

Popular 5-letter words fitting these constraints: SOUND, SOLID, SLUMP, SLING, SMOCK, SPUNK, SHOCK, SHOWN, SPOIL, etc.

“SOUND” is ideal because:
- Starts with S
- Uses three new vowels (O, U) and common consonants (N, D)
- Eliminates or confirms several high-frequency letters in one go

What we now know:

1. The word starts with S P O (✓✓✓).

3. We still have three correct letters in order: S P O _ _ .

5. Remaining vowels still possible: Y (since A, E, I, U are out and O is accounted for).

So we need a 5-letter word of the form **S P O _ _**, using only letters not yet eliminated.  
The two blanks must be drawn from the remaining alphabet: {B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Good common letters to test next: K, C, M, G, Y, W, F.

Candidate words:
- SPOCK (uses C and K)

- SPOOM (M)  
- SPOOR (R is ruled out)  
- SPORT (T, R ruled out)  
- SPOKY (Y)  
- SPOGY (informal and rare)

“SPOCK” and “SPOOK” stand out because:
- K and C/M are fairly common final consonants.
- Both are valid English words.

Let’s pick SPOOK (K is a high-value consonant to test).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to start with a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A word like ""STARE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters and is a good starting point because:
1. It covers multiple common vowels (A, E)
2. It includes common consonants (S, T, R)
3. It's a valid 5-letter word
4. It will give us information about several key letters right away

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for STARE:
- S ✓ (correct letter, correct position)
- T, A, R, E are all completely absent (x)

So the secret word starts with S and does not contain T, A, R, or E.

Next useful starting consonants after S: N, L, C, M, P, D, B, G, F, H.  
Useful vowels remaining: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and Y is sometimes a vowel).

I want a word that:
1. Begins with S
2. Uses none of T, A, R, E
3. Introduces new common letters quickly to maximize information

Popular 5-letter words fitting these constraints: SOUND, SOLID, SLUMP, SLING, SMOCK, SPUNK, SHOCK, SHOWN, SPOIL, etc.

“SOUND” is ideal because:
- Starts with S
- Uses three new vowels (O, U) and common consonants (N, D)
- Eliminates or confirms several high-frequency letters in one go

So far: S _ _ _ _
Forbidden: T, A, R, E, U, N, D
O must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Useful remaining consonants: L, C, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, W, V, Y, Z
Useful vowels: I, O, Y (sometimes)

I need a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains O but not in position 2
- Avoids all forbidden letters
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information

Good candidates: SPOIL (but P and I are ok), SCOWL (but C and L are ok), SLOTH (but T and H are ok - T is forbidden), SMOKY (M, K, Y are ok), SOGGY (but O can't be 2nd), SCOOP (but P is ok).

Let's pick ""SPOIL"":
- S ✓ first letter
- P, I, L are new and common
- O is in position 3 (acceptable since it can't be position 2)
- Avoids all forbidden letters

But wait - is O in position 3 acceptable? From feedback, O is in the word but wrong position in SOUND (was position 2), so positions 3,4,5 are possible for O.

SPOIL seems good.

Alternative: SHOWY (but W and Y are less common).

SPOIL is better as it tests P, I, L.

Let me verify: SPOIL - S is correct first letter, O is present but we don't know position yet, P, I, L are new tests.
