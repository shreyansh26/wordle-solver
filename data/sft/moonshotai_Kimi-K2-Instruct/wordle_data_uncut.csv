- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's generally optimal to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Classic opening choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" because they cover frequently used letters.

Looking at these:
- AROSE: Contains A, R, O, S, E - good coverage of common vowels and consonants
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers both common and some less common but still useful letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - very balanced with common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener that tests three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

The feedback tells us that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates a huge chunk of common starter words and makes the vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S unavailable.

Next best strategy:
1. Remove any words containing A, R, O, S, E.
2. Pick a new starter that uses fresh, high-frequency letters we haven’t tested yet.  
   Good remaining high-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, H, M, P, F  
   Remaining vowels we can test: I, U  
   A balanced word could be “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) which tests two new vowels plus three common consonants.

I’ll go with UNTIL.

Feedback summary so far  
- A, R, O, S, E, I, L are completely absent (x).  
- U is in the word and is already in the correct position (first letter).  
- N is in the word but not in the second position.  
- T is in the word but not in the third position.

We need a 5-letter word that  
1. Starts with U.  
2. Contains N somewhere after the first position.  
3. Contains T somewhere other than the third position.  
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no A, R, O, S, E, I, L).

Remaining high-frequency consonants we can still play: D, B, G, H, M, P, F, C, K, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowel available: none at the moment (A, E, I, O already ruled out; U is fixed in place).

Possible patterns:
U _ _ _ _  
with N in positions 2-5, and T in positions 2-5 but not 3.

Let’s list a few candidates quickly:
- U N D T _ – invalid (T can’t be 4 if N is 2)  
- U N _ T _ – e.g. U N D T ? (but we need another usable letter)  
- U _ N T _ – e.g. U B N T ? (but T can’t be 4)  
- U _ _ N T – e.g. U B C N T (but T would be 5, N 4, that fits)  

A quick dictionary search for real words:
U, N, T, plus two more of the still-allowed letters.

- UNCUT (U N C U T) – fits: U correct, N at 2, T at 5 (both allowed positions).  
- UNMET (U N M E T) – contains E, rejected.  
- UNAPT – contains A, rejected.  
- UNCUT passes all tests.

Therefore UNCUT is a valid next guess that maximizes information using new letters (C).
