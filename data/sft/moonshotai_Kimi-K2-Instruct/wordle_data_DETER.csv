- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by using a word that includes common letters in strategic positions. The top 10 most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word should cover as many of these as possible while avoiding repeats. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the top 10 letters. Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which includes A, R, O, S, E. Between these, ""SLATE"" is slightly better positioned for testing common consonant-starting words, so I'll go with that.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word does **not** contain S, L, A, but it **does** contain T and E, somewhere other than positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both T and E.
2. Places T somewhere other than position 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Uses no S, L, or A.

Popular letters remaining to test: R, O, N, I, C, H.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The top 10 most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word should cover as many of these as possible while avoiding repeats. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the top 10 letters. Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which includes A, R, O, S, E.

So the secret word does **not** contain S, L, A, but it **does** contain T and E, somewhere other than positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both T and E.
2. Places T somewhere other than position 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Uses no S, L, or A.

Popular letters remaining to test: R, O, N, I, C, H.

- “FUTER” – F, U, T all allowed, T is in position 3.

Among these, “NITER” is a valid English word and tests N, I, T in positions 1-3 while keeping E and R fixed.

Remaining common letters to consider: N, I, C, D, M, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- “INTER” – but I is position 1, N is 2, T is 3 (all allowed), no banned letters.
- “CIDER” – C, I, D are allowed, T is missing → invalid.
- “NITER” – N, I, T all allowed, T is in position 3.
- “MITER” – M, I, T all allowed, T is in position 3.
- “FUTER” – F, U, T all allowed, T is in position 3.

Among these, “NITER” is a valid English word and tests N, I, T in positions 1-3 while keeping E and R fixed.

(I also sanity-checked that “NITER” is in typical 5-letter word lists.)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) T(-) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: NITER -> FEEDBACK: N(x) I(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on NITER:
- N and I are NOT in the word (x).
- T is now correctly placed in position 3 (✓).
- E is correctly in position 4 (✓).
- R is correctly in position 5 (✓).

So the known pattern is:
_ _ T E R

We already know these letters are absent: S, L, A, O, H, N, I.

Available (unused) common letters: C, D, F, G, M, P, U, B, K, Y, W.

We need to fill the first two positions with letters from this pool, forming a real 5-letter word ending in “TER”.

Possible stems:
- C _ T E R → “CUTER” (C, U allowed)
- M _ T E R → “MUTER” (M, U allowed)
- B _ T E R → “BUTER” – invalid (not a word)
- F _ T E R → “FUTER” – also invalid
- G _ T E R → no common word
- P _ T E R → “PUTER” – invalid
- C _ T E R → “CUTER” is the only clear valid word.

“CUTER” uses C and U, which are both unused and present in the allowed set.

Let me double-check: CUTER is a valid English word (comparative of cute) and fits _ _ T E R with no banned letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know the secret word has the pattern:

_ _ T E R

Letters confirmed in the word: {T, E, R}  
Letters confirmed **not** in the word: {S, L, A, O, H, N, I, C, U}

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 2.  
Available common letters (English frequency) that have not yet been ruled out:  
D, F, G, M, P, B, K, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “TER” and using only still-allowed letters.

Candidate stems:
- D _ T E R → “DETER” (D, E, T, E, R) – but letter E already appears in positions 3 & 4, so the only E that can appear is in position 4 (and it already is). “DETER” only has one E in position 2, which is allowed. 
- G _ T E R → “GETER” – invalid
- M _ T E R → “METER” – but E already in position 4, so E in position 2 would duplicate E, which is fine (words can repeat letters).
- F _ T E R → “FETER” – archaic, not common
- B _ T E R → “BETER” – invalid
- P _ T E R → “PETER” – valid word, P and E are allowed

Between “DETER” and “PETER” both are valid; “PETER” is more common and tests P and E in position 2. (Remember, the E in position 2 is allowed because the only rule is we can’t use any of the banned letters, and we can repeat letters as long as they are not in the banned set.)

Let’s choose “PETER”.

Check: P and E are in the allowed set, and pattern _ _ T E R holds.
