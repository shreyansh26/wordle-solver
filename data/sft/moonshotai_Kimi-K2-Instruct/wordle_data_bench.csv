For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Covers a good distribution of vowels and consonants

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. Looking at vowels and consonants, a good starting word should contain common vowels like A, E, I, O and common consonants like T, N, S, R.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SNARE (S, N, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Covers a good distribution of vowels and consonants\n\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. Looking at vowels and consonants, a good starting word should contain common vowels like A, E, I, O and common consonants like T, N, S, R.\n\nSome popular starting words include:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- SNARE (S, N, A, R, E)\n- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is NOT in the word (x)\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- O is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n\nSo the secret word:\n1.

Summary of all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   E is in the word, **not in 5th spot**.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)  
   - E is still in the word, **not in 4th spot**.  
   - N is in the word, **not in 2nd spot**.

3. NEEDY → N(-) E(✓) E(-) D(x) Y(x)  
   - E is **correct in position 2**.  
   - Second E is **not in position 3**.  
   - N is **not in position 1**.  
   - D and Y are **not in the word**.

Known so far about the secret word:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- Must contain N (not in positions 1 or 2)
- May not contain: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, D, Y
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W

We also know E cannot appear anywhere else (because the second E in position 3 was marked “-”).

So far: _ E _ _ _ and N must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to place N in 3rd: _ E N _ _
Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W

A good candidate:  
BENCH – uses B, N, C, H; no forbidden letters and N is in 3rd.
