For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. I should pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. 

Good first guesses in Wordle often include words like:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, SLATE seems particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five of the top 10 most common letters. This gives me the best chance to get some positive feedback early on. 

Let me go with SLATE as my first guess.

All 5 letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I should avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.

I want a new 5-letter word that uses none of S, L, A, T, E. Good remaining high-frequency letters include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A strong candidate is “CRONY”, but that uses O and R, which are good, but I’ll pick a word that uses even more common consonants and vowels. A classic choice is “DORIC” but that has an O and an I. “BRICK” uses B, R, I, C, K — none of which were ruled out. Another excellent option is “CHORD”, but that has an O. “MURKY” uses M, U, R, K, Y — also fine.

I’ll go with “CHORD” because C, H, O, R, D are all still possible, and together they cover a broad set of common letters.

Wait — O isn’t ruled out, but I want to spread across other consonants and vowels too. Let me reconsider.

Another strong candidate is “BRICK” (B, R, I, C, K) – all new letters, hits a lot of common consonants and a high-frequency vowel.

So I’ll choose BRICK.

In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. I should pick a word that uses several of these letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. \n\nGood first guesses in Wordle often include words like:\n- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)\n- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)\n\nAmong these, SLATE seems particularly strong because it covers S, L, A, T, E - five of the top 10 most common letters. This gives me the best chance to get some positive feedback early on. \n\nLet me go with SLATE as my first guess.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All 5 letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  \nThat means I should avoid every one of those letters in my next guess.\n\nI want a new 5-letter word that uses none of S, L, A, T, E.

A classic choice is “DORIC” but that has an O and an I. “BRICK” uses B, R, I, C, K — none of which were ruled out. Another excellent option is “CHORD”, but that has an O. “MURKY” uses M, U, R, K, Y — also fine.\n\nI’ll go with “CHORD” because C, H, O, R, D are all still possible, and together they cover a broad set of common letters.\n\nWait — O isn’t ruled out, but I want to spread across other consonants and vowels too.

From the latest feedback (MOUND → M x, O ✓, U ✓, N ✓, D x) we now know:

- Positions:  
  – O is in position 2.  
  – U is in position 3.  
  – N is in position 4.  

- Letters definitely NOT in the word (so far):  
  S, L, A, T, E, B, R, I, C, K, M, D.

Remaining letters still allowed: F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any repeats of O, U, N already confirmed.

We need a 5-letter word whose pattern is:
_ O U N _

and whose first and last letters are drawn from the still-allowed set.

Scanning common English words that fit “_OUN_”, the only everyday word that matches is:
- FOUND (but D is already excluded)
- HOUND (H is allowed, D is excluded)
- WOUND (W is allowed, D is excluded)
- YOUNG (length 5, but ends in G which is allowed and uses allowed letters)

But YOUNG breaks the positional requirements (it would need the G in position 5, but then the word would be Y O U N G, which indeed ends with G — and all letters Y, O, U, N, G are still allowed).

So YOUNG is the only remaining valid candidate.
