For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
3. Doesn't have any duplicate letters to maximize information gain
4. Uses a good mix of vowels and consonants

Common starting strategies often use words with many vowels or common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)
- ARISE (good vowel coverage)
- STARE (common letters)
- CRANE (good consonant-vowel mix)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage of common letters and help eliminate or confirm many possibilities in the first guess.

All five letters in “CRANE” were marked “x”, which means **none** of those letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, every letter in the secret word must be drawn from the remaining 20 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess, I want to:
- Avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely.
- Pick a word with 5 distinct letters, again maximizing information.
- Prefer letters that are still quite common among the remaining pool: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good balanced choice is “SLUMP”:
- S, L, U, M, P are all still in play.
- It mixes vowels (U) with several common consonants (S, L, M, P).
- No duplicate letters.

This should help eliminate or confirm a new set of common letters quickly.

Strategy for the third guess:  
- Pick a word that uses five fresh letters from the remaining pool.  
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (T, D, G, H, B) plus vowels (I, O).  
- Avoid any repeats.

A strong candidate is “BIGHT”:
B, I, G, H, T – all still legal and cover three consonants plus two vowels.  
Another option is “THICK” but C, K are still allowed, and K is slightly less common.  
“BIGHT” feels more balanced.

Is a valid 5-letter English word\n2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words\n3. Doesn\'t have any duplicate letters to maximize information gain\n4. Uses a good mix of vowels and consonants\n\nCommon starting strategies often use words with many vowels or common consonants. Some popular choices include:\n- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)\n- ARISE (good vowel coverage)\n- STARE (common letters)\n- CRANE (good consonant-vowel mix)\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:\n- C (common consonant)\n- R (very common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- N (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis should give good coverage of common letters and help eliminate or confirm many possibilities in the first guess.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in “CRANE” were marked “x”, which means **none** of those letters (C, R, A, N, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  \nTherefore, every letter in the secret word must be drawn from the remaining 20 letters of the alphabet.\n\nFor the second guess, I want to:\n- Avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely.\n- Pick a word with 5 distinct letters, again maximizing information.\n- Prefer letters that are still quite common among the remaining pool: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nA good balanced choice is “SLUMP”:\n- S, L, U, M, P are all still in play.\n- It mixes vowels (U) with several common consonants (S, L, M, P).\n- No duplicate letters.\n\nThis should help eliminate or confirm a new set of common letters quickly.\n\n<guess>SLUMP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we have eliminated:  \nC, R, A, N, E, S, L, U, M, P\n\nThat’s ten distinct letters that are **not** in the secret word.\n\nRemaining common letters:  \nB, D, F, G, H, I, K, O, T, V, W, Y\n\nStrategy for the third guess:  \n- Pick a word that uses five fresh letters from the remaining pool.  \n- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (T, D, G, H, B) plus vowels (I, O).  \n- Avoid any repeats.\n\nA strong candidate is “BIGHT”:\nB, I, G, H, T – all still legal and cover three consonants plus two vowels.  \nAnother option is “THICK” but C, K are still allowed, and K is slightly less common.  \n“BIGHT” feels more balanced.\n\nI’ll go with “BIGHT”.\n\n<guess>BIGHT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: BIGHT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) G(✓) H(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have now ruled out 14 letters:

- Definitely absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, U, M, P, B  
- The feedback from BIGHT tells us the word is of the form:

  _ I G H T

(i.e., the last four letters are I G H T in that order).

I simply need to find the single missing initial consonant that hasn’t been excluded yet and forms a real English word with I G H T.

Checking remaining letters that have not appeared at all so far:

D, F, J, K, O, V, W, Y, Z (plus a few others).

Testing each one:
- DIGHT – valid (archaic past tense of “deck” or “adorn”, still in dictionaries).
- FIGHT – valid.
- JIGHT – invalid.
- KIGHT – invalid (“kight” is slang, not standard).
- MIGHT – M already ruled out.
- NIGHT – N ruled out.
- RIGHT – R ruled out.
- SIGHT – S ruled out.
- TIGHT – T already used in the last position (cannot repeat).
- WIGHT – valid.
- YIGHT – invalid.

Any of DIGHT, FIGHT, or WIGHT would fit, but FIGHT is by far the most common word among these. I’ll start with that.
