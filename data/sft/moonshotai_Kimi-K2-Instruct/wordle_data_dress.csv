For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as possible. The classic strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N. 

Some good first guesses are words like:
- SLATE (has S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (has C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (has S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains very common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the two guesses so far:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(-)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1
   - T, A are NOT in the word
   - R is in the word, not in position 4
   - E is in the word, not in position 5

2. RISEN → R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)
   - R is in the word, not in position 1
   - I, N are NOT in the word
   - S is in the word, not in position 3
   - E is in the word, not in position 4

Combining:

- Must contain: S, R, E (each appears exactly once)
- Cannot contain: T, A, I, N
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5

So positions for S, R, E:
- Possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (but 4, 5 are taken by R, E rules)
- Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

Also, remaining letters must be from consonants not yet excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me test possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then R and E must be in 3 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5) or 5 and 3 (E in 3). Then remaining letters in 1 and 4 must be from allowed consonants.
- If E is in position 1: then S must be in 2,4, or 5. R must be in 2,3,5.
  - E _ _ _ _ (E in 1)
  - S could be in 2,4,5
  - R could be in 2,3,5
  - Need to avoid conflicts and use remaining spots.

A good next guess is ""SERFS"":
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in 1 from first feedback) - invalid.

Alternative approach: Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and S cannot be in 1 or 3, and R cannot be in 1 or 4 - try ""CRESS"":
- C (new letter)
- R (in position 2 - allowed)
- E (in position 3 - allowed)
- S (in position 4 - allowed, because S cannot be in 1,3 but 4 is ok)
- S (duplicate S - probably not good since S appears only once)

Try ""HERSE"" - but E is in 5 which is invalid.

""SPEER"":
- S (1 - invalid)

""FRESH"":

- Possible positions for R: 2, 3, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

Also, remaining letters must be from consonants not yet excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me test possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then R and E must be in 3 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5) or 5 and 3 (E in 3). Then remaining letters in 1 and 4 must be from allowed consonants.
- If E is in position 1: then S must be in 2,4, or 5. R must be in 2,3,5.
  - E _ _ _ _ (E in 1)
  - S could be in 2,4,5
  - R could be in 2,3,5
  - Need to avoid conflicts and use remaining spots.

A good next guess is ""SERFS"":
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in 1 from first feedback) - invalid.

Alternative approach: Since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and S cannot be in 1 or 3, and R cannot be in 1 or 4 - try ""CRESS"":
- C (new letter)
- R (in position 2 - allowed)
- E (in position 3 - allowed)
- S (in position 4 - allowed, because S cannot be in 1,3 but 4 is ok)
- S (duplicate S - probably not good since S appears only once)

Try ""HERSE"" - but E is in 5 which is invalid.

""SPEER"":
- S (1 - invalid)
- P (allowed)
- E (3 - allowed)
- E (duplicate)

""FRESH"":
- F (allowed)
- R (2 - allowed)
- E (3 - allowed)
- S (4 - allowed)
- H (allowed)

This seems valid:
- Contains S, R, E
- S not in 1 or 3 (it's in 4) - ok
- R not in 1 or 4 (it's in 2) - ok
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's in 3) - ok
- No T, A, I, N
- All new letters: F, H are allowed

From all feedback so far:

1. STARE → S(-) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(-)
   – S is in the word, not in position 1
   – T, A are NOT in the word
   – R is in the word, not in position 4
   – E is in the word, not in position 5

2. RISEN → R(-) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)
   – R is in the word, not in position 1
   – I, N are NOT in the word
   – S is in the word, not in position 3
   – E is in the word, not in position 4

3. FRESH → F(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(✓) H(x)
   – F, H are NOT in the word
   – R is in the CORRECT position 2
   – E is in the CORRECT position 3
   – S is in the CORRECT position 4

So the pattern is now:  
_  R  E  S  _

Known facts:
- Letters already placed: R (pos 2), E (pos 3), S (pos 4)
- Letters already ruled out: T, A, I, N, F, H
- Remaining unused consonants (for positions 1 & 5): B, C, D, G, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- The word must also contain E (already placed) and S (already placed), so no additional vowel is needed in positions 1 or 5.

Quick scan of common 5-letter English words matching “?RES?”:
- BREES, CRESS, DRESS, GRESS, PRESS, TRESS (but T is out), WREST (T is out), etc.

Among these, the simplest common word is “DRESS”.
- D is still allowed.
- S at the end is allowed (no restriction yet on position 5 for S; earlier restrictions only said S not in 1 or 3).
