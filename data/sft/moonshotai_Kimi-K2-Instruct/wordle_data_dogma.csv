Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English
2. Covers vowels and consonants
3. Has no repeated letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words in Wordle often include ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""SLATE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses:
- A (most common vowel)
- R, S (very common consonants)
- O, E (other common vowels)
This gives good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback about which letters are present.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- Has 5 unique letters

Good letters we know are present: A, O  
Banned letters: R, S, E

We need a word that:
1. Has A and O in it
2. Has no R, S, E
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3

Possible candidates: 
- ADOBO → has E-like repetition, but E is banned
- AFOOT → has two O’s and E banned
- ALOOF → has S-like banned letters
- ABOUT → has S, E banned
- ALONE → has E, S banned

Wait, let me think of words with A and O that exclude R,S,E. Possible letters to use: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to form a word with A and O avoiding positions 1 and 3 for them.

A good candidate could be ""ADOPT"":
- Has A (position 1, but we know A must move) – but A is position 1 here, which we know is wrong. So A must be in positions 2-5.

Let me think of words where A is not first and O is not third. 

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" – but S is banned and T is allowed. Actually S is banned, but T is fine. However B is allowed, O is allowed (not 3rd), U is allowed, T is allowed. So ABOUT has:
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new letter)
- O in position 3 (forbidden, as per feedback O is not in position 3)
So ABOUT is invalid.

Next try: ""ABODE"" – but E is banned.

""ACORN"" – has R and N, but R is banned.

""ALOOF"" – has L, O (position 3 is forbidden), F → O is position 3, which is banned.

""ATOLL"" – has T, O (position 3 is banned), L, L → O is position 3, banned.

""AVOID"" – V, O (position 3 is banned), I, D → O is position 3, banned.

""AZOTH"" – Z, O (position 3 banned), T, H → O is position 3, banned.

""ANNOY"" – N, N, O, Y → has N twice but doesn't help, and O is position 3, banned.

""AXIOM"" – X, I, O, M → O is position 3, banned.

""AUDIO"" – U, D, I, O → O is position 4 (allowed), A is position 1 (forbidden). So A is position 1, which we know is wrong.

""ALOUD"" – A (position 1 is forbidden), L, O (position 3 is forbidden), U, D → both A and O are in forbidden positions.

""AMONG"" – A (position 1 forbidden), M, O (position 3 forbidden), N, G.

It seems hard to place both A and O correctly. Let me try ""COBRA"" – but R is banned.

""FOCAL"" – F, O, C, A, L → O is position 2, A is position 4. This satisfies:
- A not in position 1 (it's in 4)
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2)
- No R, S, E.

Let's process the new feedback on FOCAL:

1. F(x) – F is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is correct and already in the right place (position 2).
3. C(x) – C is not in the word.
4. A(–) – A is in the word but must move to a new position (not 4).
5. L(x) – L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is locked into position 2: _ O _ _ _
- A is somewhere in the remaining four positions (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), but not 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, F, C, L.

Available letters (common ones first): A, B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need five unique letters including A and O; O is already fixed in position 2. So the pattern is:
_ O A _ _ or _ O _ A _ or _ O _ _ A.

Let me brainstorm good candidates:

- B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, U, V – all these consonants are allowed.

Some possibilities:
1. BOGAN – repeats G and N, but G is ok. However B, G, N are allowed. But has N twice? No. So BOGAN – B, O, G, A, N – this fits: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with O in 2. But A is in position 4, which is allowed.

2. DOUGH – has G, H, but U is allowed. But E is banned (not present). D, O, U, G, H – no E. But O is position 2, so D, O, U, G, H – positions 1,2,3,4,5. This covers many letters. But A is required, and DOUGH doesn't have A.

3. GOATY – G, O, A, T, Y – O is position 2, A is position 3. This fits: G, O, A, T, Y. A is in position 3 (allowed, since A must be somewhere but not position 4). All letters are allowed. This seems good.

4. BOARD – has R, which is banned.

5. NOVAH – N, O, V, A, H. O is position 2, A is position 4 (but A cannot be position 4 from previous feedback). So this is invalid.

6. POKAY – P, O, K, A, Y. O is position 2, A is position 4 (invalid).

7. TOADY – T, O, A, D, Y. O is position 2, A is position 3. This works: T, O, A, D, Y. No forbidden letters.

Between GOATY and TOADY, TOADY uses more common letters. Let me choose TOADY.

<guess>TOADY</guess>",TOADY,"Let's process the new feedback on FOCAL:

1. F(x) – F is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is correct and already in the right place (position 2).
3. C(x) – C is not in the word.
4. A(–) – A is in the word but must move to a new position (not 4).
5. L(x) – L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is locked into position 2: _ O _ _ _
- A is somewhere in the remaining four positions (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), but not 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, F, C, L.

Available letters (common ones first): A, B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need five unique letters including A and O; O is already fixed in position 2. So the pattern is:
_ O A _ _ or _ O _ A _ or _ O _ _ A.

Let me brainstorm good candidates:

- B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, U, V – all these consonants are allowed.

Some possibilities:
1. BOGAN – repeats G and N, but G is ok. However B, G, N are allowed. But has N twice? No. So BOGAN – B, O, G, A, N – this fits: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with O in 2. But A is in position 4, which is allowed.

2. DOUGH – has G, H, but U is allowed. But E is banned (not present). D, O, U, G, H – no E. But O is position 2, so D, O, U, G, H – positions 1,2,3,4,5. This covers many letters. But A is required, and DOUGH doesn't have A.

3. GOATY – G, O, A, T, Y – O is position 2, A is position 3. This fits: G, O, A, T, Y. A is in position 3 (allowed, since A must be somewhere but not position 4). All letters are allowed. This seems good.

4. BOARD – has R, which is banned.

5. NOVAH – N, O, V, A, H. O is position 2, A is position 4 (but A cannot be position 4 from previous feedback). So this is invalid.

6. POKAY – P, O, K, A, Y. O is position 2, A is position 4 (invalid).

7. TOADY – T, O, A, D, Y. O is position 2, A is position 3. This works: T, O, A, D, Y. No forbidden letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,dogma,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English
2. Covers vowels and consonants
3. Has no repeated letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words in Wordle often include ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""SLATE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses:
- A (most common vowel)
- R, S (very common consonants)
- O, E (other common vowels)
This gives good coverage of the alphabet and should provide useful feedback about which letters are present.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (–)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- Has 5 unique letters

Good letters we know are present: A, O  
Banned letters: R, S, E

We need a word that:
1. Has A and O in it
2. Has no R, S, E
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3

Possible candidates: 
- ADOBO → has E-like repetition, but E is banned
- AFOOT → has two O’s and E banned
- ALOOF → has S-like banned letters
- ABOUT → has S, E banned
- ALONE → has E, S banned

Wait, let me think of words with A and O that exclude R,S,E. Possible letters to use: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try to form a word with A and O avoiding positions 1 and 3 for them.

A good candidate could be ""ADOPT"":
- Has A (position 1, but we know A must move) – but A is position 1 here, which we know is wrong. So A must be in positions 2-5.

Let me think of words where A is not first and O is not third. 

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" – but S is banned and T is allowed. Actually S is banned, but T is fine. However B is allowed, O is allowed (not 3rd), U is allowed, T is allowed. So ABOUT has:
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- B (new letter)
- O in position 3 (forbidden, as per feedback O is not in position 3)
So ABOUT is invalid.

Next try: ""ABODE"" – but E is banned.

""ACORN"" – has R and N, but R is banned.

""ALOOF"" – has L, O (position 3 is forbidden), F → O is position 3, which is banned.

""ATOLL"" – has T, O (position 3 is banned), L, L → O is position 3, banned.

""AVOID"" – V, O (position 3 is banned), I, D → O is position 3, banned.

""AZOTH"" – Z, O (position 3 banned), T, H → O is position 3, banned.

""ANNOY"" – N, N, O, Y → has N twice but doesn't help, and O is position 3, banned.

""AXIOM"" – X, I, O, M → O is position 3, banned.

""AUDIO"" – U, D, I, O → O is position 4 (allowed), A is position 1 (forbidden). So A is position 1, which we know is wrong.

""ALOUD"" – A (position 1 is forbidden), L, O (position 3 is forbidden), U, D → both A and O are in forbidden positions.

""AMONG"" – A (position 1 forbidden), M, O (position 3 forbidden), N, G.

It seems hard to place both A and O correctly. Let me try ""COBRA"" – but R is banned.

""FOCAL"" – F, O, C, A, L → O is position 2, A is position 4. This satisfies:
- A not in position 1 (it's in 4)
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2)
- No R, S, E.

This seems valid. So I'll guess ""FOCAL"".

4. A(–) – A is in the word but must move to a new position (not 4).
5. L(x) – L is not in the word.

2. DOUGH – has G, H, but U is allowed. But E is banned (not present). D, O, U, G, H – no E. But O is position 2, so D, O, U, G, H – positions 1,2,3,4,5. This covers many letters. But A is required, and DOUGH doesn't have A.

3. GOATY – G, O, A, T, Y – O is position 2, A is position 3. This fits: G, O, A, T, Y. A is in position 3 (allowed, since A must be somewhere but not position 4). All letters are allowed. This seems good.

4. BOARD – has R, which is banned.

5. NOVAH – N, O, V, A, H. O is position 2, A is position 4 (but A cannot be position 4 from previous feedback). So this is invalid.

6. POKAY – P, O, K, A, Y. O is position 2, A is position 4 (invalid).

7. TOADY – T, O, A, D, Y. O is position 2, A is position 3. This works: T, O, A, D, Y. No forbidden letters.

Between GOATY and TOADY, TOADY uses more common letters. Let me choose TOADY.
