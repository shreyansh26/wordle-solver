This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy for the first word in Wordle is to choose a word that contains common English letters, especially vowels and common consonants, to maximize information gain. 

Good starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid letters like Q, X, Z which are rare

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

Letters still available (not ruled out): A, B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(Note: A and E are already placed, so for positions 1 and 3 and 5 we need three *other* letters from the rest.)

We need a valid English word of the form ? A ? E ? with the remaining letters.  
Let’s list some candidates that fit:
- C A N E L  → CANEL (a valid but uncommon variant spelling of “channel”)
- G A P E D  → GAPED (valid past tense of gape)
- H A L E D  → HALED (valid past tense of hale, though archaic)
- H A V E N  → HAVEN (valid and common)
- L A P E L  → LAPEL (valid)
- N A V E L  → NAVEL (valid)
- P A N E L  → PANEL (valid, though E is already in position 4 so this would duplicate E; but the word itself is valid)
- V A L E D  → VALED (rare past tense of vale)

Common, high-frequency choices among these: HAVEN, PANEL, LAPEL, NAVEL.

PANEL has E twice, which is possible if the secret word allows repeated letters, but HAVEN uses five different letters and is very common.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LABEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

The optimal strategy for the first word in Wordle is to choose a word that contains common English letters, especially vowels and common consonants, to maximize information gain. 

Good starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid letters like Q, X, Z which are rare

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.
