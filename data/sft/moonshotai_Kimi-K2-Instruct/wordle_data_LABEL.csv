For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E are present; I and U are not, but that's okay)
- Common consonants R and S
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This allows me to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

Let’s decode the feedback:

A(-) – the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S  
- Letters that ARE in the word and must appear somewhere: A, E  
- No information yet about positions 1, 3, 5 (because the feedback only relates positions 2 and 4)

We want a new valid 5-letter English word that
1. contains both A and E,
2. does NOT contain R, O, or S,
3. uses unique letters elsewhere so we maximize information.

Possible consonants we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

A simple, high-information choice could be “BEACH”:
- Contains A and E (both needed).
- Contains consonants B, C, H which have not been tested.
- No R, O, S appear.
- All letters are distinct.

Let’s go with that.

3. Letters we have not yet tested:

Let’s add the latest feedback to our knowledge base.

1. Letters now **ruled out** (from all three guesses):  
   R, O, S, C, H, G, N

2. Letters **confirmed to be in the word** (but still not locked to positions):  
   A, E, L  
   – A must NOT be in positions 1, 3, 4 (it appeared with “-” in those spots)  
   – E must NOT be in positions 2, 3, 5  
   – L must NOT be in position 2

3. Therefore, possible positions for these letters:  
   - A: only positions 2 or 5 remain.  
   - E: only positions 1 or 4 remain.  
   - L: positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

4. We still need two more distinct letters that have **never been guessed** (they must come from the remaining untested alphabet: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

To maximize information, let’s pick two completely new consonants and arrange the three known letters in the only positions they can legally occupy.

Possible skeleton:
– Position 1: E (legal) or a new letter  
– Position 2: A (legal) or a new letter  
– Position 3: new letter or L  
– Position 4: E (legal) or L  
– Position 5: A (legal) or L

Let’s build a word that:
- uses A in position 2 (only legal spot still open for A),
- uses E in position 4 (only legal spot still open for E),
- uses L in position 5 (which is still legal),
- and fills the remaining two slots with brand-new letters.

That gives us a pattern: _ A _ E L

Choose two new consonants: D and I.

The word formed is “D” + “A” + “I” + “E” + “L” → “DAIEL”, but that isn’t an English word.

Swap the unused positions to an actual dictionary word:

Try “PLATE”:  
- Letters used: P (new), L, A (in 2), T (new), E (in 5)  
- But E is not legal in position 5 (it was “-” there in Guess 1), so discard.

Try “IDEAL”:  
- I (new), D (new), E, A, L  
- Check positions:  
  – A in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: A was “-” in 3)  
  – E in position 2 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 2)  
  – L in position 5 is legal, but the others conflict. Discard.

Try “FIELD”:  
- F, I, E, L, D → all new except E, L.  
- E is in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3). Discard.

Try “PIECE”:  
- Contains C (already eliminated) → discard.

Try “TWEAK”:  
- Contains K (new), W (new), plus A, E  
- A in position 4 → illegal (Guess 3: A was “-” in 4). Discard.

Try “FABLE”:  
- Contains B (already seen with “-” in Guess 2) → discard.

Try “PIXEL”:  
- Contains X (new), P (new), plus E, L  
- E in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3). Discard.

Try “WALED”:  
- W (new), A (in 2), L, E (in 4), D (new)  
- Check constraints:  
  – A in 2: legal  
  – E in 4: legal  
  – L in 3: legal (L has never been at 3 before)  
  – W and D are new  
  – “WALED” is a valid English word (past tense of wale).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LABEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E are present; I and U are not, but that's okay)
- Common consonants R and S
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This allows me to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s decode the feedback:

A(-) – the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S  
- Letters that ARE in the word and must appear somewhere: A, E  
- No information yet about positions 1, 3, 5 (because the feedback only relates positions 2 and 4)

We want a new valid 5-letter English word that
1. contains both A and E,
2. does NOT contain R, O, or S,
3. uses unique letters elsewhere so we maximize information.

Possible consonants we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

A simple, high-information choice could be “BEACH”:
- Contains A and E (both needed).
- Contains consonants B, C, H which have not been tested.
- No R, O, S appear.
- All letters are distinct.

Let’s go with that.

<guess>BEACH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: BEACH -> FEEDBACK: B(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we now know after two guesses.

1. Letters absent from the word:
   R, O, S (from Guess 1)  
   C, H (from Guess 2)

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but still unknown positions):
   A, E (both appeared with “-” feedback, so they’re in there somewhere)

3. Letters we have not yet tested:
   D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   plus the untested positions of A and E.

We still need:
- Two more letters (since we already have A and E).
- To place A and E so they don’t repeat the positions where they were marked “-”.

Positions used so far:
- A was in position 1 in Guess 1 and 3 in Guess 2 ⇒ it must NOT be 1 or 3.
- E was in position 5 in Guess 1 and 2 in Guess 2 ⇒ it must NOT be 2 or 5.

So A must be in 2, 4, or 5  
and E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Contains both A and E (once each),
- Uses three new letters from the untested set,
- Respects the positional exclusions above,
- Uses no letters already eliminated.

A candidate that fits is “GLEAN”:
- Contains G, L, N (all new),
- Contains A and E,
- A is in position 4 (acceptable),
- E is in position 3 (acceptable),
- No R, O, S, C, H.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LABEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E are present; I and U are not, but that's okay)
- Common consonants R and S
- No repeated letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This allows me to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s decode the feedback:

A(-) – the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S  
- Letters that ARE in the word and must appear somewhere: A, E  
- No information yet about positions 1, 3, 5 (because the feedback only relates positions 2 and 4)

We want a new valid 5-letter English word that
1. contains both A and E,
2. does NOT contain R, O, or S,
3. uses unique letters elsewhere so we maximize information.

Possible consonants we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

A simple, high-information choice could be “BEACH”:
- Contains A and E (both needed).
- Contains consonants B, C, H which have not been tested.
- No R, O, S appear.
- All letters are distinct.

Let’s go with that.

<guess>BEACH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BEACH -> FEEDBACK: B(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we now know after two guesses.

1. Letters absent from the word:
   R, O, S (from Guess 1)  
   C, H (from Guess 2)

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word (but still unknown positions):
   A, E (both appeared with “-” feedback, so they’re in there somewhere)

3. Letters we have not yet tested:
   D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   plus the untested positions of A and E.

We still need:
- Two more letters (since we already have A and E).
- To place A and E so they don’t repeat the positions where they were marked “-”.

Positions used so far:
- A was in position 1 in Guess 1 and 3 in Guess 2 ⇒ it must NOT be 1 or 3.
- E was in position 5 in Guess 1 and 2 in Guess 2 ⇒ it must NOT be 2 or 5.

So A must be in 2, 4, or 5  
and E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s look for a word that:
- Contains both A and E (once each),
- Uses three new letters from the untested set,
- Respects the positional exclusions above,
- Uses no letters already eliminated.

A candidate that fits is “GLEAN”:
- Contains G, L, N (all new),
- Contains A and E,
- A is in position 4 (acceptable),
- E is in position 3 (acceptable),
- No R, O, S, C, H.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s add the latest feedback to our knowledge base.

1. Letters now **ruled out** (from all three guesses):  
   R, O, S, C, H, G, N

2. Letters **confirmed to be in the word** (but still not locked to positions):  
   A, E, L  
   – A must NOT be in positions 1, 3, 4 (it appeared with “-” in those spots)  
   – E must NOT be in positions 2, 3, 5  
   – L must NOT be in position 2

3. Therefore, possible positions for these letters:  
   - A: only positions 2 or 5 remain.  
   - E: only positions 1 or 4 remain.  
   - L: positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

4. We still need two more distinct letters that have **never been guessed** (they must come from the remaining untested alphabet: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

To maximize information, let’s pick two completely new consonants and arrange the three known letters in the only positions they can legally occupy.

Possible skeleton:
– Position 1: E (legal) or a new letter  
– Position 2: A (legal) or a new letter  
– Position 3: new letter or L  
– Position 4: E (legal) or L  
– Position 5: A (legal) or L

Let’s build a word that:
- uses A in position 2 (only legal spot still open for A),
- uses E in position 4 (only legal spot still open for E),
- uses L in position 5 (which is still legal),
- and fills the remaining two slots with brand-new letters.

That gives us a pattern: _ A _ E L

Choose two new consonants: D and I.

The word formed is “D” + “A” + “I” + “E” + “L” → “DAIEL”, but that isn’t an English word.

Swap the unused positions to an actual dictionary word:

Try “PLATE”:  
- Letters used: P (new), L, A (in 2), T (new), E (in 5)  
- But E is not legal in position 5 (it was “-” there in Guess 1), so discard.

Try “IDEAL”:  
- I (new), D (new), E, A, L  
- Check positions:  
  – A in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: A was “-” in 3)  
  – E in position 2 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 2)  
  – L in position 5 is legal, but the others conflict. Discard.

Try “FIELD”:  
- F, I, E, L, D → all new except E, L.  
- E is in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3). Discard.

Try “PIECE”:  
- Contains C (already eliminated) → discard.

Try “TWEAK”:  
- Contains K (new), W (new), plus A, E  
- A in position 4 → illegal (Guess 3: A was “-” in 4). Discard.

Try “FABLE”:  
- Contains B (already seen with “-” in Guess 2) → discard.

Try “PIXEL”:  
- Contains X (new), P (new), plus E, L  
- E in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3). Discard.

Try “WALED”:  
- W (new), A (in 2), L, E (in 4), D (new)  
- Check constraints:  
  – A in 2: legal  
  – E in 4: legal  
  – L in 3: legal (L has never been at 3 before)  
  – W and D are new  
  – “WALED” is a valid English word (past tense of wale).

This fits all rules.

We still need two more distinct letters that have **never been guessed** (they must come from the remaining untested alphabet: D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nTo maximize information, let’s pick two completely new consonants and arrange the three known letters in the only positions they can legally occupy.\n\nPossible skeleton:\n– Position 1: E (legal) or a new letter  \n– Position 2: A (legal) or a new letter  \n– Position 3: new letter or L  \n– Position 4: E (legal) or L  \n– Position 5: A (legal) or L\n\nLet’s build a word that:\n- uses A in position 2 (only legal spot still open for A),\n- uses E in position 4 (only legal spot still open for E),\n- uses L in position 5 (which is still legal),\n- and fills the remaining two slots with brand-new letters.\n\nThat gives us a pattern: _ A _ E L\n\nChoose two new consonants: D and I.\n\nThe word formed is “D” + “A” + “I” + “E” + “L” → “DAIEL”, but that isn’t an English word.\n\nSwap the unused positions to an actual dictionary word:\n\nTry “PLATE”:  \n- Letters used: P (new), L, A (in 2), T (new), E (in 5)  \n- But E is not legal in position 5 (it was “-” there in Guess 1), so discard.\n\nTry “IDEAL”:  \n- I (new), D (new), E, A, L  \n- Check positions:  \n  – A in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: A was “-” in 3)  \n  – E in position 2 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 2)  \n  – L in position 5 is legal, but the others conflict. Discard.\n\nTry “FIELD”:  \n- F, I, E, L, D → all new except E, L.  \n- E is in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3). Discard.\n\nTry “PIECE”:  \n- Contains C (already eliminated) → discard.\n\nTry “TWEAK”:  \n- Contains K (new), W (new), plus A, E  \n- A in position 4 → illegal (Guess 3: A was “-” in 4). Discard.\n\nTry “FABLE”:  \n- Contains B (already seen with “-” in Guess 2) → discard.\n\nTry “PIXEL”:  \n- Contains X (new), P (new), plus E, L  \n- E in position 3 → illegal (Guess 2: E was “-” in 3).

Latest feedback tells us:

Confirmed positions:
1: L (✓)
2: A (✓)
4: E (✓)

Letters still to place in positions 3 and 5:
- We already know L, A, E are used once each and correctly placed.  
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the set that has never appeared and never been ruled out.

Letters eliminated so far (from all guesses):
R, O, S, C, H, G, N, W, D, T, X

Available, never-tested letters (still legal):
F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting pattern: L A _ E _

Scanning the remaining choices, the only common, legal 5-letter words are:
- L A M E D  → uses M and D, but D is already eliminated.
- L A V E R  → uses V and R, but R is already eliminated.
- L A K E R  → uses K and R, but R is already eliminated.
- L A M E R  → uses M and R, but R is already eliminated.
- L A P E L  → uses P and L, but L is already placed once.
- L A V E S  → uses V and S, but S is already eliminated.
- L A V E Y  → uses V and Y, both still allowed, and ""lavey"" is a real word (variant spelling/place name).

This is the only remaining legal word that fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters: L A V E Y.

There is no other common word left, so this must be the secret word. We will guess it now.
