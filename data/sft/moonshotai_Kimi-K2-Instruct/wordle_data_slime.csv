For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me gather as much information as possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and T. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that will help identify letters quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the word looks like: S L _ _ E

Letters we know are **in** the word and **correctly placed**: S, L, E (positions 1, 2, 5)
Letters we know are **not** in the word: A, T

Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with SL and ends with E, uses no A or T, and uses two more distinct letters in positions 3 and 4.

Some candidates:
- SLICE (I and C not yet ruled out)
- SLIDE (D and I not yet ruled out)
- SLIME (M and I not yet ruled out)
- SLIPE (P and I not yet ruled out)
- SLIVE (V and I not yet ruled out)

Among these, ""SLICE"" uses common letters (I, C) and is a familiar word. It tests C and I in the remaining slots without repeating any known absent letters.

So, my next guess is SLICE.

From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S ✓ L ✓ A x T x E ✓  
   Pattern: S L _ _ E

2. SLICE → S ✓ L ✓ I ✓ C x E ✓  
   Pattern: S L I _ E

3. SLIDE → S ✓ L ✓ I ✓ D x E ✓  
   Pattern: S L I _ E

We now know:
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are fixed: S L I _ E
- Letters not in the word so far: A, T, C, D
- The missing letter (position 4) must be any letter not already ruled out.

Looking at the remaining letters, common consonants that haven’t been used yet include: M, N, P, R, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SLI and ends with E, and whose middle letter (position 4) is not A, T, C, or D. Some possibilities:
- SLIME (M not yet ruled out)
- SLIPE (P not yet ruled out)
- SLIVE (V not yet ruled out)
- SLIRE (R not yet ruled out)

The most common among these is SLIME, so I’ll guess SLIME next.
