For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words cover frequently used letters in English and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

After evaluating these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter and plural marker
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Very common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters while forming a valid word.

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
  S, L, A, N, Y  (all marked x)

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown:
  E (now known to be in position 1 — ✓ in Guess 2)
  T (marked “-” both times, so it is in the word but not in position 3 or 4)
  R (marked “-” in Guess 2, so it is in the word but not in position 4)

So the mystery word:
- starts with E
- contains T and R somewhere (T cannot be 3rd or 4th; R cannot be 4th)
- does NOT contain S, L, A, N, Y

Viable positions for T: 2 or 5  
Viable positions for R: 1, 2, 3 or 5 (but 1 is already E) → 2, 3, 5

Let’s build a word that:
- starts with E
- uses T and R in new, legal positions
- adds other common unused letters (e.g., C, H, I, O, D, M, P, U)

Candidate word: ETHER
- E fixed at position 1
- T now at position 2 (legal)
- H new letter
- E already confirmed
- R at position 5 (legal)

It reuses E twice, but that’s allowed and will test T and R in fresh slots while adding H.

Another candidate is EDICT, but I’ll go with the simpler ETHER first because it tests T and R explicitly.

Current known facts:

Letters **in** the word (but still unsure of exact positions, except E is fixed at position 1):
- E (✓ at position 1)
- T (must be present, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)
- R (must be present, but not in positions 4 or 5)

Letters **excluded** (x in feedback so far):
- S, L, A, N, Y, H

Positions we can now deduce:

- T cannot be in 2,3,4 → only remaining spot is **position 5**.
- R cannot be in 4,5 → possible spots: 2,3.

So the word shape so far is:
E _ _ _ T
with R somewhere in positions 2 or 3 and one more letter still unknown.

We need a letter that hasn’t been used yet and is common. Unused consonants that are frequent: C, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Good candidates satisfying:
E R _ _ T or E _ R _ T (with R at 2 or 3).

Let’s pick the common pattern:
E R _ _ T and fill with a new letter in position 3.

Candidate: ERECT
- E at 1 (fixed)
- R at 2
- E (already confirmed in word, can repeat)
- C (new)
- T at 5 (now confirmed position)

Checks:
- No excluded letters (S,L,A,N,Y,H).
- Places T at the only remaining possible spot (5).
- Places R at 2 (allowed).
- Adds C, a common unused letter.

Seems like a solid next guess.
