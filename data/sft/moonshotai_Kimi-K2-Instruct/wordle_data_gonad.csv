For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify possible letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A strong starting word would be one that uses several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it uses A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This gives me a broad coverage of possible letters in the secret word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

- R is not in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (originally 3rd)

2. COATI → C(x) O(✓) A(-) T(x) I(x)

- A exists somewhere (positions 4 or 5, because it can’t be 1 or 3).  
- Letters that cannot appear: R, S, E, C, T, I.  
- We still need to test other common consonants/vowels.

A good next guess should:
  – Keep O in position 2.  
  – Place A in 4 or 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A strong starting word would be one that uses several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it uses A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This gives me a broad coverage of possible letters in the secret word. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (originally 1st)
- R is not in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (originally 3rd)
- S is not in the word
- E is not in the word

So the secret word contains: A and O, but not R, S, E.

We know:
- A and O are somewhere, but not in their original spots
- Letters already ruled out: R, S, E
- Letters we haven’t tested yet: many others (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses other letters we haven’t tested yet to gather more information

A good next guess would be ""COATI"":
- Uses C, O, A, T, I
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE)
- A is in position 3 (different from position 1 in AROSE)
- Introduces new letters: C, T, I
- Avoids R, S, E

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, wrong position (not 1st).  
   – O is in the word, wrong position (not 3rd).  
   – R, S, E are out.

2. COATI → C(x) O(✓) A(-) T(x) I(x)  
   – O is now correctly placed in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word, wrong position (not 3rd).  
   – C, T, I are out.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
- A exists somewhere (positions 4 or 5, because it can’t be 1 or 3).  
- Letters that cannot appear: R, S, E, C, T, I.  
- We still need to test other common consonants/vowels.

A good next guess should:
  – Keep O in position 2.  
  – Place A in 4 or 5.  
  – Introduce new untested letters.

Candidates:  
  – MOANS (but S is out) → invalid.  
  – BLOAT (T is out) → invalid.  
  – GONAD (A in 4).  
  – FOAMY (A in 4).  
  – HOARD (A in 5).

""HOARD"" seems strong: H, O, A, R, D.  
But R is already ruled out (from Guess 1), so HOARD is invalid.

Next: FOAMY – F, O, A, M, Y.  
- O is correct position 2.  
- A is in position 4 (new placement).  
- F, M, Y are new letters.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Avoids R, S, E
- Uses other letters we haven’t tested yet to gather more information

A good next guess would be ""COATI"":
- Uses C, O, A, T, I
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3 in AROSE)
- A is in position 3 (different from position 1 in AROSE)
- Introduces new letters: C, T, I
- Avoids R, S, E

<guess>COATI</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COATI -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) A(-) T(x) I(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, wrong position (not 1st).  
   – O is in the word, wrong position (not 3rd).  
   – R, S, E are out.

2. COATI → C(x) O(✓) A(-) T(x) I(x)  
   – O is now correctly placed in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word, wrong position (not 3rd).  
   – C, T, I are out.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _  
- A exists somewhere (positions 4 or 5, because it can’t be 1 or 3).  
- Letters that cannot appear: R, S, E, C, T, I.  
- We still need to test other common consonants/vowels.

A good next guess should:
  – Keep O in position 2.  
  – Place A in 4 or 5.  
  – Introduce new untested letters.

Candidates:  
  – MOANS (but S is out) → invalid.  
  – BLOAT (T is out) → invalid.  
  – GONAD (A in 4).  
  – FOAMY (A in 4).  
  – HOARD (A in 5).

""HOARD"" seems strong: H, O, A, R, D.  
But R is already ruled out (from Guess 1), so HOARD is invalid.

Next: FOAMY – F, O, A, M, Y.  
- O is correct position 2.  
- A is in position 4 (new placement).  
- F, M, Y are new letters.

<guess>FOAMY</guess>

Guess 2: COATI -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) A(-) T(x) I(x)
Guess 3: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) A(-) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far:
- Positional pattern: _ O _ _ _
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4. Therefore A must be in position 5.
- Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, C, T, I, F, M, Y.
- Letters not yet tested and still allowed: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We now know the structure: _ O _ _ A.

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) from the remaining pool. To maximize information, we should use three new, common letters. Good choices: B, D, H, L, N, P.

A strong candidate is ""BONDA"":
- B, N, D are all new letters.
- Structure: B O N D A → matches _ O _ _ A.
- All letters are allowed so far.

Another candidate could be ""HONDA"", but we should pick the one with most common untested letters. ""BONDA"" covers B, N, D.

Let's go with BONDA.

Guess 3: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) A(-) M(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: BONDA -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(✓) D(-) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have four pieces of feedback. Let’s consolidate what we know:

1. Pattern: _ O N _ A  (from Guess 4: O and N are fixed in positions 2 and 3).
2. D is in the word but not in position 4; so D must be in position 1.
3. A is in the word and already in position 5.

Therefore the only remaining structure is: D O N _ A. Only one letter remains to be determined for position 4.

Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, C, T, I, F, M, Y, B.  
Letters not yet ruled out (and not yet placed) include: G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, common English consonants are G, H, L, K, P.

We need a 5-letter word of the form DON_A that uses only allowed letters. Testing these:

- DON G A → “DONGA”
- DON H A → “DONHA” (not a valid English word)
- DON L A → “DONLA” (invalid)
- DON K A → “DONKA” (invalid)
- DON P A → “DONPA” (invalid)

The only valid English word in this set is “DONGA” (a South-African English word for a gully or ravine).

Therefore, our next guess should be:

<guess>DONGA</guess>

Current knowledge after Guess 5: DONGA → D(-) O(✓) N(✓) G(-) A(-)

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 2: O
   - Position 3: N

2. Letters that must appear somewhere:
   - D (wrong in position 1)
   - G (wrong in position 4)
   - A (wrong in position 5)

3. Letters ruled out:
   - R, S, E, C, T, I, F, M, Y, B

4. Pattern so far: _ O N _ _
   - D must go in positions 4 or 5, but A is also required and must be in positions 1-4 (since it’s not in position 5). Similarly, G must go in positions 1 or 5 (since it’s not in position 4).
   - However, A cannot be in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Position 3 is N, so A must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Similarly, D must be in positions 4 or 5 (but 5 is A), so D must be in position 4.
   - G must be in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is A), so G must be in position 1.

Thus the only possible word is: G O N D A.
