- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I'll choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Classic starting words often include common consonants and vowels like A, E, R, S, T. 

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- RAISE
- STARE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (third most common vowel)

This should give good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

We now know the word is _ A N D Y.
Letters tried in position 1 so far: R, M, C, H, B (all ruled out).
Remaining consonants that can start a 5-letter English word of this pattern: F, K, L, P, T, W.

Check each:
- FANDY – not a real word.
- LANDY – uncommon but valid.
- PANDY – valid in certain dialects (Scottish, Indian English).
- TANDY – a proper noun or rare, not standard.
- WANDY – not a valid word.

Between LANDY and PANDY, LANDY is more widely recognized (e.g., “Land Rover” nickname or surname).  
Hence the only remaining sensible guess is LANDY.
