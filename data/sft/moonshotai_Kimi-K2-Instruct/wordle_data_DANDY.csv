For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include vowels and frequently occurring consonants. Common strategic starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes the vowels A and E, along with common consonants S, L, and T.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is NOT in the word (marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).
- T is NOT in the word (marked x).
- E is NOT in the word (marked x).

So we now know:
- The word contains A (but not in the 3rd position).
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Thus the word has A somewhere other than position 3, and none of S, L, T, or E. To maximize information, our next guess should include A as well as other common letters not yet ruled out.

From these, common words are BANDY, CANDY, PANDY, RANDY, SANDY, TANDY. 

Looking back at previous feedback, we know which letters are not in the word:
- From SLATE: S, L, T, E are not in the word.
- From RADIO: R, I, O are not in the word.
- From HANDY: H is not in the word.

So the first letter cannot be: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, H.

Valid first letters from the list above:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

A good starting word should include vowels and frequently occurring consonants. Common strategic starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes the vowels A and E, along with common consonants S, L, and T.

- L is NOT in the word (marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

- E is NOT in the word (marked x).

So we now know:
- The word contains A (but not in the 3rd position).
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

Thus the word has A somewhere other than position 3, and none of S, L, T, or E. To maximize information, our next guess should include A as well as other common letters not yet ruled out.

Common remaining letters: R, N, O, I, C, U, D, H, K, B, etc. A good next guess might be something like ""CRANK"" or ""RADIO"". Let's pick ""RADIO"" to test R, D, I, O, and place A in position 2 (since position 3 is invalid for A).

- D is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, R, I, O.

- FANCY → F, A, N, C, Y: no D.  
- HANDY → H, A, N, D, Y: H, N, D, Y allowed, D in position 4.
