For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to cover as many vowels and common consonants as possible. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, N, R, L, C, D, M, P, B

A good starting word would include 2-3 vowels and 3-2 common consonants. Some examples of good starting words are:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives a good spread of letters to help narrow down the secret word quickly.

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but not in the first position (-).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (x).

So we know the word:
- Contains A, but not in slot 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- We have only one confirmed letter so far: A.

Next guess should try to test many new common letters while placing A in a different spot. Good consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc. Vowels still in play (because they weren’t tested) include I, U.

Let’s pick a word with a new set of letters and place A in the second position. A good candidate is “TAINT” (T, A, I, N, T) but T is repeated. Instead, “TAINT” is invalid because of the double T. A better word is “PAINT” (P, A, I, N, T) – all new letters except A, which we move to slot 2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

The goal is to cover as many vowels and common consonants as possible. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, N, R, L, C, D, M, P, B

A good starting word would include 2-3 vowels and 3-2 common consonants. Some examples of good starting words are:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives a good spread of letters to help narrow down the secret word quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but not in the first position (-).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (x).

So we know the word:
- Contains A, but not in slot 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- We have only one confirmed letter so far: A.

Next guess should try to test many new common letters while placing A in a different spot. Good consonants we haven’t tested yet include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc. Vowels still in play (because they weren’t tested) include I, U.

Let’s pick a word with a new set of letters and place A in the second position. A good candidate is “TAINT” (T, A, I, N, T) but T is repeated. Instead, “TAINT” is invalid because of the double T. A better word is “PAINT” (P, A, I, N, T) – all new letters except A, which we move to slot 2.

2. Letters that ARE in the word:

   - N (confirmed in the word but not in position 4)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and contains N somewhere other than position 4.

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Contains N not in position 4
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool

Good candidates could be:
- BANAL (but L is in position 5)
- CANAL (but L is in position 5)
- FANNY (but N is in position 4)
- MANGO (but O is ruled out)
- MANLY (N in position 3, which is allowed)

Let's try MANLY:
- M: new letter
- A: correct position 2 (matches our requirement)
- N: in position 3 (not position 4, so allowed)
- L: new letter
- Y: new letter

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know with certainty the five letters of the word in their exact positions:

1. Position 1: NOT C, M, P, R (and several others). Still legal common letters: F, G, H, J, K, V, W, etc.
2. Position 2: A (fixed)
3. Position 3: N (fixed)
4. Position 4: D (fixed)
5. Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the pattern is: _ A N D Y

We need a single letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out and that forms a valid English word.

Common consonants still allowed at position 1 include F, G, H, V, W, K. Checking each:

- F → FAN DY → FAN DY → FAN DY (no, not valid)
- G → GANDY? Not a common word.
- H → HANDY – yes, HANDY is a valid word.
- V → VANDY? Not standard.
- W → WANDY? Not standard.
- K → KANDY? Not standard.

Therefore, the only common and valid word left is HANDY.

We now have the fixed four-letter sequence **ANDY** in positions 2-5, and the only thing left is to determine the first letter.  
From the feedback:

- Position 1 cannot be: A, C, H, M, P, R (and others already eliminated).  
- Still-allowed consonants (common ones) that have not been ruled out: B, F, G, J, K, V, W, etc.

We need a valid English 5-letter word of the form ?ANDY.

Valid candidates:
- BANDY  
- FAN DY  → FAN DY is not a word (space added to show it’s not valid)  
- GANDY → uncommon/proper noun  
- KANDY → proper noun  
- VANDY → proper noun  
- WANDY → not standard  

The only common dictionary word left is **BANDY**.

Therefore, BANDY must be the secret word.
