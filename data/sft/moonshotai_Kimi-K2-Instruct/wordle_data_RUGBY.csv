For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives maximum information. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include: ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, RAINS, STARE, etc. 
I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- Good spread of letters across the alphabet

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word, but in the wrong position (it was at position 2 in ARISE).
- I(x), S(x), E(x) – none of these letters appear in the secret word at all.

So the secret word:
- Is 5 letters long.
- Contains the letter R, but NOT in position 2.
- Does NOT contain A, I, S, or E.

Next step: choose a word that includes R in a new position and avoids the eliminated letters. I also want to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (O, U, Y).

Candidate words: ROUND, COURT, BURNT, DROWN, etc.
“ROUND” looks good because:
- It keeps R but moves it to position 1.
- Includes O and U (vowels not yet tested).
- Adds common consonants N and D.
- Uses no eliminated letters (A, I, S, E).

Therefore, ROUND is a sensible next guess.

We know the word starts with R, must contain U somewhere other than position 3, and cannot include A, I, S, E, O, N, D.

Remaining possible vowels: U (must appear), Y is possible if needed.
Remaining common consonants to test: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with R that includes U but not in position 3. Let's try to place U in position 2 or 4.
