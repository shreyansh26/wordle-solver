For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel/consonant balance to maximize information gain. Some strategies:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, T, O, I, N, S, R, H, L)
2. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z
3. Include multiple vowels to test vowel positions
4. Common starting letters: S, C, B, T, P

A good first word is ""CRANE"" because:
- Contains common letters C, R, A, N, E
- Has 2 vowels (A, E) to test vowel positions
- Starts with common letter C
- Uses R and N which are frequent in English
- No repeating letters

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Letters known to be in the word:

Letters known NOT to be in the word (in any position):
C, A, N, O, D, T, S

Position information:
- R is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from CRANE, RODEO, TRIES).  
  Therefore R must be in position 5.
- I is in the word, but not in position 3 (from TRIES).  So I can be in positions 1, 2, or 5; but position 5 is taken by R, so I must be in position 1 or 2.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel/consonant balance to maximize information gain. Some strategies:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, T, O, I, N, S, R, H, L)
2. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z
3. Include multiple vowels to test vowel positions
4. Common starting letters: S, C, B, T, P

A good first word is ""CRANE"" because:
- Contains common letters C, R, A, N, E
- Has 2 vowels (A, E) to test vowel positions
- Starts with common letter C
- Uses R and N which are frequent in English
- No repeating letters

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E
- Does NOT contain C, A, or N
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters R and E
2. Avoid C, A, N
3. Place R and E in new positions
4. Add common consonants and vowels not yet tested

I’ll try “RODEO”:
- Keeps R and E, moving them to positions 1 and 4 respectively
- Adds O and D which are common and untested
- No forbidden letters (C, A, N)

- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Possible positions: 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is already taken by E, so R must be in position 3 or 5.

Next word should:
1. Confirm the position of R (3 or 5).
2. Introduce new, common letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, M, U, etc.).
3. Avoid all forbidden letters (C, A, N, O, D).

From the feedback on FIBER we have:

- Position 1: F is NOT in the word (x).
- Position 3: B is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:

Word form: _ I _ E R  
Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, O, D, T, S, L, V, F, B  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions fixed): I (pos 2), E (pos 4), R (pos 5)

Remaining unused common letters that can fill positions 1 and 3:
G, H, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y

Since we have only one guess left, we need to pick the most likely consonant pair. The most common remaining single-letter fits are:

- Position 1: G, H, M, P, W
- Position 3: G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y

Let’s choose the pair that forms a common word.  
Possible candidates: W I K E R, P I K E R, M I X E R, H I K E R, G I V E R (but V is out), so let’s test:

H I K E R – H and K are both allowed and make a valid word.

That’s our final attempt.
