For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R (very common consonant)
- S, O (also common letters)

This should give us good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S(x): S is NOT in the word.

Good candidate: ""DIAON"" isn't a word. ""CLOWN"" has O in 3rd but uses W (might be too restrictive).

Actually, ""FRONT"" would be bad (has R). ""POINT"" has I and N, but P and N are available.

""COBIA"" - but has B and ends with A. Let me pick something simpler.

How about ""CLOUD"": 
- C, L, U, D are all allowed letters (no R/S/E)
- O is in 3rd position ✓
- A is not present, but we know A is somewhere in word so this might not be optimal.

Better choice: ""FOCAL"" - has A and O in correct position, uses F/C/L.

But let's maximize new letters: ""TOXIN"" - but has X and I, and N.

Actually ""TAPIR"" has R which is bad.

""POLKA"" - O in 3rd, A in 5th (not 1st), uses P/L/K.

2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from AROSE and POLKA).

Let’s consolidate the facts that are now locked in after the first three guesses.

1. Position 3 must be “O” (from AROSE: O✓).
2. “A” is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (AROSE A- and POLKA A- and COBIA A-).  
    ⇒ A can only appear in position 4.
3. Letters we have proven are **not** in the word at all:  
   R, S, E, P, K, C, B, I.
4. Letters we have only placed in the wrong spot so far:  
   L (POLKA L-), but that doesn’t rule it in yet.
5. Remaining unused consonants of decent frequency:  
   D, F, G, H, M, N, T, V, W, Y, plus vowels U (A is already forced, E/I are out).

With position 3 = O and position 4 = A, the skeleton is:

_ _ O A _

We need two new consonants (or D/G/H/M/N/T/etc.) for positions 1 and 2, plus one for position 5, none of which have been eliminated.

A few candidate words that fit this pattern and use only still-allowed letters:

- FLOAT – but F, L, T are allowed; however L was marked “-” in POLKA, so it is IN the word but not in position 4. That’s fine, it could still be in 1,2,5.
- GLOAT – G, L, T.
- MOATS – but it would need a trailing S, which is banned.
- TOADY – ends in Y, uses T, D, but the 4th letter is A, not D.
- VOILA – but I is banned.
- GONAD – uses G,N,D and fits _ _ O A _.

Among these, GONAD (G-O-N-A-D) satisfies every constraint:
- G, N, D are all still legal letters.
- It places A correctly in position 4.
- It keeps O in position 3.
- It does not reuse any letters already ruled out.

Hence GONAD is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R (very common consonant)
- S, O (also common letters)

This should give us good information about which letters might be in the secret word.

- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has O in the 3rd position.
2. Contains A (but not in position 1).
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Looking for 5-letter words with O in the 3rd position, A somewhere (not 1st), and no R/S/E.

Possible letters now: consonants like D, L, N, T, P, etc. and vowels A, I, U (not E).

Example word: D A I O N → but this is 5 letters with O in 3rd. Wait, let me think of actual words.

Good candidate: ""DIAON"" isn't a word. ""CLOWN"" has O in 3rd but uses W (might be too restrictive).

Actually, ""FRONT"" would be bad (has R). ""POINT"" has I and N, but P and N are available.

""COBIA"" - but has B and ends with A. Let me pick something simpler.

How about ""CLOUD"": 
- C, L, U, D are all allowed letters (no R/S/E)
- O is in 3rd position ✓
- A is not present, but we know A is somewhere in word so this might not be optimal.

Better choice: ""FOCAL"" - has A and O in correct position, uses F/C/L.

But let's maximize new letters: ""TOXIN"" - but has X and I, and N.

Actually ""TAPIR"" has R which is bad.

""POLKA"" - O in 3rd, A in 5th (not 1st), uses P/L/K.

This seems good - new letters P, L, K plus known A and O.

3. Letters NOT in the word so far: R, S, E, P, K.

2. From GONAD:
   - G(✓)  → G is in position 1.  
   - A(✓)  → A is in position 4.  
   - N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.  
   - D(x)  → D is NOT in the word.

3. Letters so far confirmed **absent**:  
   R, S, E, P, K, C, B, I, N, D.

4. Letters so far confirmed **present** and in their correct spots:  
   G  (position 1)  
   O  (position 3)  
   A  (position 4)

Therefore the word currently looks like: G _ O A _

We still need a valid letter for position 2 and one for position 5, chosen only from the unused, still-legal alphabet.  
Consonants/vowels still allowed that have not been ruled out include: F, H, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a real 5-letter English word matching the pattern G _ O A _.

Candidate dictionary words fitting that pattern:
- GLOAT   (G-L-O-A-T)
- GLOAM   (G-L-O-A-M)   – but “gloam” is archaic.
- GLOAK   (not a valid word)
- GLOVE   – contains E (ruled out)
- GLOSS   – contains S (ruled out)

The only common, valid word in the above list is GLOAT, and all its letters (G, L, O, A, T) have not been eliminated yet:
- L was marked “-” in POLKA (in the word but not in position 3) – still allowed anywhere else.  
- T has not appeared at all.

Hence GLOAT is the only safe next guess.

<guess>GLOAT</guess>",GLOAT,"Let’s consolidate everything the feedback has told us so far.

1. Position 3 must still be O (from AROSE: O✓).  
   The GONAD feedback shows O(-) for position 3, which is consistent: it only says “O is in the word but not in position 3 for this guess.” Since O is locked into position 3 from the first feedback, that’s fine.
