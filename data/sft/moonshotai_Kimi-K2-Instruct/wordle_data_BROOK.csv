- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain rather than trying to guess the word correctly. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Common letters include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Among these, the combination ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words.
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which also appear frequently.

This word helps quickly eliminate or confirm several potentially correct letters and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A (x) – A is not in the word  
- R (✓) – R is in the word AND in position 2  
- O (✓) – O is in the word AND in position 3  
- S (x) – S is not in the word  
- E (x) – E is not in the word  

So we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed as R and O respectively  
- The word does NOT contain A, S, or E  

We now need a 5-letter word whose 2nd letter is R and 3rd letter is O, and that avoids A, S, E.  
Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
A plausible next probe is “broom”:
- B, R, O, O, M – uses B, M and a second O to gather info on double-O and the presence of B/M.  
- It satisfies all known constraints: R in slot 2, O in slot 3, and avoids A/S/E.
