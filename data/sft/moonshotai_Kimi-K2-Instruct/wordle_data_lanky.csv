For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should contain several of these. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRATE (contains C, R, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses five very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A and N are in the word, but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- A (somewhere, but not in position 3)
- N (somewhere, but not in position 4)
- No C, R, E

Good letters to keep using: A, N  
Good new letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, U, etc.

I want a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E
- Contains both A and N
- Has A not in position 3
- Has N not in position 4
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- STAND (S, T, A, N, D) – A in 3 is bad (from feedback), but N in 4 is bad. So skip.
- SNAIL (S, N, A, I, L) – A in 3 is bad, N in 2 is new for N, but A in 3 is invalid. Skip.
- PLANT (P, L, A, N, T) – A in 3 is bad, N in 4 is bad. Skip.
- MANLY (M, A, N, L, Y) – A in 2, N in 3: both new positions, no bad letters.

MANLY fits all constraints:
- No C, R, E
- Contains A (not in 3) and N (not in 4)
- Introduces M, L, Y as new letters

Let me update what I know:

Letters in the word with their correct positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
- L is somewhere in the word, but not position 4 (-)

Letters that are NOT in the word (from both guesses):
- C, R, E, M

So far the word looks like: _ A N _ Y, with the missing letters being from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, E, M), and L must be one of them because L is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 1 and 4 are open and L cannot be in 4, L must be in position 1.

This gives me: L A N _ Y

The only remaining position is 4, and the letter must not be any of the already eliminated letters (C, R, E, M), and must make a valid English word. Common letters that fit here: D, G, K, S, T, etc.

Looking at possible words:
- L A N D Y (LANDY) - not a common word
- L A N G Y (LANGY) - not a word
- L A N K Y (LANKY) - this is a valid word

LANKY fits all constraints:
- L in position 1 (which allows L to be in the word since position 4 is forbidden for L)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- N in position 3 (✓)
- K in position 4
- Y in position 5 (✓)
- No forbidden letters (C, R, E, M)

Therefore, my next guess is LANKY.
