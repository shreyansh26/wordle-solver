For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Popular choices among players include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words cover many frequently used letters in English.

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It includes common consonants R and S
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing coverage

Summary of what we now know:

1. The word ends with E.
2. R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
   → Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.  
   (Position 5 is already taken by E, so R must be in 3 or 4.)
3. O is in the word but not in position 3.
   → Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4.  
   (Position 5 is E, so 1, 2, 4 are open.)
4. Letters we have ruled out so far: A, D, I, S, V.

Next guess should:
- Place E in position 5.
- Place R in position 3 or 4 (let’s try 3 first).
- Place O in 1, 2, or 4 and avoid 3.
- Use new common consonants / vowels (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.).

Candidate: TORCE – repeats O and E but uses T and C.  
Better: TOWER – uses T, W, keeps O at 1 and R at 3.  
But we already know O can’t be at 3, which is fine here.  
Let’s try TOWER.

Check constraints:
- TOWER: ends with E ✓
- R is in position 3 ✓ (and 3 is allowed)
- O is in position 1 ✓ (position 1 is allowed)
- Letters not yet tested: T, W
- Avoids A, D, I, S, V ✓

Let’s consolidate what all the feedback now tells us.

1. E must be in position 5 and nowhere else (certainty from all three guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   ⇒ R must be in position 3 or 4.
3. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from guesses 2 and 3).
   ⇒ O must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters we have ruled out so far:
   A, D, I, S, V, T, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E,
- contains both R and O,
- has R in position 3 or 4,
- has O in position 2 or 4,
- and uses only the still-legal letters.

Possible valid patterns:

Case 1: R in 3, O in 2
   _ O R _ E

Case 2: R in 4, O in 2
   _ O _ R E

Case 3: R in 3, O in 4
   _ _ R O E  (but then O is in 4; we have no info against that)

Let’s test the most constrained pattern first (Case 1):
_ O R _ E

Possible words: “FORGE” (F allowed), “HORSE” (S already ruled out), “MORSE” (S ruled out), “GORGE” (G allowed, but repeats G).  
“FORGE” seems fine: F is new, G is new, R in 3, O in 2, E in 5.

- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).
- A, I, S are not in the word.

Next, I should choose a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Includes R (but not at the start).
- Avoids A, I, S.
- Uses new common letters to test.

Good candidates: ""ROUTE"", ""FORCE"", ""GROVE"", ""CREPE"", ""TROPE"", ""DROVE"".
I'll pick ""DROVE"" because it:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in position 2 (known not in 1, so 2 is possible).
- Adds new common consonants D, V, O and avoids A, I, S.

- Place O in 1, 2, or 4 and avoid 3.
- Use new common consonants / vowels (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.).

Candidate: TORCE – repeats O and E but uses T and C.  
Better: TOWER – uses T, W, keeps O at 1 and R at 3.  
But we already know O can’t be at 3, which is fine here.

- TOWER: ends with E ✓
- R is in position 3 ✓ (and 3 is allowed)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).
- A, I, S are not in the word.

Next, I should choose a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Includes R (but not at the start).
- Avoids A, I, S.
- Uses new common letters to test.

Good candidates: ""ROUTE"", ""FORCE"", ""GROVE"", ""CREPE"", ""TROPE"", ""DROVE"".
I'll pick ""DROVE"" because it:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in position 2 (known not in 1, so 2 is possible).
- Adds new common consonants D, V, O and avoids A, I, S.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: DROVE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. The word ends with E.
2. R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
   → Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.  
   (Position 5 is already taken by E, so R must be in 3 or 4.)
3. O is in the word but not in position 3.
   → Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4.  
   (Position 5 is E, so 1, 2, 4 are open.)
4. Letters we have ruled out so far: A, D, I, S, V.

Next guess should:
- Place E in position 5.
- Place R in position 3 or 4 (let’s try 3 first).
- Place O in 1, 2, or 4 and avoid 3.
- Use new common consonants / vowels (e.g., T, N, L, C, M, etc.).

Candidate: TORCE – repeats O and E but uses T and C.  
Better: TOWER – uses T, W, keeps O at 1 and R at 3.  
But we already know O can’t be at 3, which is fine here.  
Let’s try TOWER.

Check constraints:
- TOWER: ends with E ✓
- R is in position 3 ✓ (and 3 is allowed)
- O is in position 1 ✓ (position 1 is allowed)
- Letters not yet tested: T, W
- Avoids A, D, I, S, V ✓

So TOWER looks good.

Guess 3: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) W(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what all the feedback now tells us.

1. E must be in position 5 and nowhere else (certainty from all three guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   ⇒ R must be in position 3 or 4.
3. O is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from guesses 2 and 3).
   ⇒ O must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters we have ruled out so far:
   A, D, I, S, V, T, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E,
- contains both R and O,
- has R in position 3 or 4,
- has O in position 2 or 4,
- and uses only the still-legal letters.

Possible valid patterns:

Case 1: R in 3, O in 2
   _ O R _ E

Case 2: R in 4, O in 2
   _ O _ R E

Case 3: R in 3, O in 4
   _ _ R O E  (but then O is in 4; we have no info against that)

Let’s test the most constrained pattern first (Case 1):
_ O R _ E

Possible words: “FORGE” (F allowed), “HORSE” (S already ruled out), “MORSE” (S ruled out), “GORGE” (G allowed, but repeats G).  
“FORGE” seems fine: F is new, G is new, R in 3, O in 2, E in 5.  
All letters are still allowed; letters ruled out (A,D,I,S,V,T,W) are not used.

So the next guess is FORGE.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s pull together everything the four guesses have taught us.

Known facts:
1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from R(-) in guesses 1, 2, 3).
   → R must be in position 3 or 4.
3. O is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from O(-) in guesses 2, 3, 4).
   → O must be in position 2 or 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, D, I, S, V, T, W, F, G.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both R and O, with:
- R in 3 or 4
- O in 2 or 4
- and using only allowed consonants: B, C, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

Examine the two feasible patterns:

Pattern 1: R in 3, O in 2
   _ O R _ E

Candidates:
- BORNE → letters B, N allowed
- CORNE → C allowed
- HORSE → S ruled out
- MORNE → M, N allowed
- LORNE → L allowed
- PORKE → K allowed (but ‘PORKE’ isn’t a valid English word)
- BORNE is good.

Pattern 2: R in 4, O in 2
   _ O _ R E

Candidates:
- COBRE → not valid
- COMER → M allowed
- CONER → N allowed
- LOVER → V ruled out
- BONER → N allowed
- But none look as common as BORNE.

Pattern 3: R in 4, O in 4 impossible (both can’t be in 4).

Pattern 4: R in 3, O in 4
   _ _ R O E

Candidates:
- BROKE → B, K allowed
- CRORE → valid word
- PROBE → P, B allowed
- BROKE seems the most common.

Between BORNE and BROKE:
- BORNE fits _ O R _ E (O in 2, R in 3)
- BROKE fits _ R O _ E (O in 4, R in 3) – but O must be in 2 or 4, so valid.

Let’s choose BORNE first since it’s a clean fit to _ O R _ E and all letters are still allowed.

- R is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions: 1 (from guess 1), 2 (from guess 2), 3 (from guess 3), 4 (from guess 4), 5 (from guess 5). Wait, that's not possible - if R is not in 1,2,3,4,5 then it can't be in the word at all. But we know from guess 1 that R is in the word. Let me re-examine:

Looking carefully at guess 5: BORNE feedback is B(-) O(-) R(-) N(x) E(✓)
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 3
- So far we have:
  - R not in 1 (from guess 1)
  - R not in 2 (from guess 2)
  - R not in 3 (from guess 5)
  - R not in 5 (from guess 3)
  - Therefore R must be in position 4

For O:
- Not in 1 (from guess 3), not in 3 (from guess 4), not in 4 (from guess 2)
- O must be in position 2

So we have:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E
- Pattern: _ O _ R E
