For the first guess, I want to choose a word that gives me good information about common letters. A good starting word should include frequently occurring letters in English. Some common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that combines several of these high-frequency letters. Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"" are good options. Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters in English words. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently occurring letters in English. Some common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that combines several of these high-frequency letters. Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""STARE"" are good options.

- A: - (in the word but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word at all)
- S: - (in the word but not in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word at all)

So the word contains A and S, but they are not in positions 2 and 4 respectively. Also, the letters R, I, and E are excluded entirely.

Next I need a word that:
1. Has A and S
2. Doesn’t place A in position 2
3. Doesn’t place S in position 4
4. Doesn’t contain R, I, or E

I’ll look for a word that uses other common letters. Since we know S is in the word, it could be S_ _ _ _ or _ _ _ S _ or similar. A is also in the word, but not in position 2. Let’s try a word like “STAND” but check:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 4)
- A is in position 2 (disallowed by feedback)

So STAND is invalid. Instead, let me try “SNACK”:
- S: position 1 (allowed)
- N: new letter, common
- A: position 3 (allowed, since position 2 was ruled out)
- C: new letter, common
- K: new letter

This seems good: it includes the known letters A and S, avoids the ruled-out positions, and doesn’t use any excluded letters (R, I, E).

- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, N, C, K
- Still possible letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y

The word is of the form:  
S _ A _ _

I need a valid 5-letter word with S as the first letter, A as the third, and using only the still-allowed letters.  
Let me think of common words fitting S _ A _ _:
- SLASH – uses S, L, A, S, H. All letters are allowed, and S is already confirmed in position 1.
- SWARM – uses W (allowed), A (position 3), but M is allowed.

- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 4)
- A is in position 2 (disallowed by feedback)

So STAND is invalid. Instead, let me try “SNACK”:
- S: position 1 (allowed)
- N: new letter, common
- A: position 3 (allowed, since position 2 was ruled out)
- C: new letter, common
- K: new letter

This seems good: it includes the known letters A and S, avoids the ruled-out positions, and doesn’t use any excluded letters (R, I, E).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SNACK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SNACK:
- S(✓) – S is in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is in position 3.
- N(x), C(x), K(x) – none of these letters appear anywhere in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), A (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, N, C, K
- Still possible letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y

The word is of the form:  
S _ A _ _

I need a valid 5-letter word with S as the first letter, A as the third, and using only the still-allowed letters.  
Let me think of common words fitting S _ A _ _:
- SLASH – uses S, L, A, S, H. All letters are allowed, and S is already confirmed in position 1.
- SWARM – uses W (allowed), A (position 3), but M is allowed.
- STAMP – uses T (allowed), A (position 3), M (allowed), P (allowed).

I’ll go with SLASH first, since L and H are common and haven’t been ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SNACK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: SLASH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 3 (SLASH) we now know:

Letters so far:
- S ✓ in position 1 (confirmed)
- A ✓ in position 3 (confirmed)
- L is in the word but not in position 2
- Second S is not in position 4 (already knew that S is in the word but only once, since position 1 is already taken by S)
- H is not in the word at all

Summary:
- Word structure: S _ A _ _
- Letters definitely in: S (pos 1), A (pos 3), L (somewhere, but not pos 2)
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, N, C, K, H
- Positions for L: only possible positions are 4 or 5 (since 2 is wrong)

So possible patterns:
- S _ A L _
- S _ A _ L

Let's list 5-letter words fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (B, D, F, G, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y):

Possible candidates:
- SMALL – but M is allowed, A is already placed, L could be position 5. This fits S _ A _ L.
- SPALL – P is allowed, L in position 5.
- SWAL_ – W is allowed, but need a valid letter for position 5: SWAL_ needs a letter not ruled out: SWALD? not a word. SWALM? not a word. SWALP? not a word. So SWAL_ seems invalid.
- STALL – T is allowed, L is allowed in position 5. This fits S _ A _ L.

Between SMALL and STALL, both are valid. SMALL uses M (allowed), STALL uses T (allowed). Both are equally valid guesses. I'll go with SMALL first.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SNACK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x)
Guess 3: SLASH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
Guess 4: SMALL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓) L(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback on SMALL:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
- L(✓) – L is correct in position 4.
- L(✓) – second L is correct in position 5.

So the word structure is:
S _ A L L

The only missing letter is the second character (position 2). We have ruled out: R, I, E, N, C, K, H, M.

Still allowed letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S _ A L L. Let's list possible letters for the blank:

- B → SBALL (not a word)
- D → SDALL (not a word)
- F → SFALL (not a word)
- G → SGALL (not a word)
- O → SO ALL (not a word, but ""SMALL"" already ruled out M; ""SCALL"" uses C which is ruled out)
- P → SPALL (this is a real word meaning to chip or flake)
- T → STALL (real word, but let's check if T is ruled out: no, T is still allowed)
- W → SWALL (not a word)
- Y → SYALL (not a word)

Between SPALL and STALL:
- SPALL: P is allowed, not yet used.
- STALL: T is allowed, not yet used.

Both fit perfectly. Since SPALL hasn't been tried yet, I'll go with it.
