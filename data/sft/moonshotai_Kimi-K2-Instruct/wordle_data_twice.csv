For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and can help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:

- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - C is in the word but **not** in position 1.
   - E is in position 5 and is correct.
   - R, A, N are not in the word.

2. TOILE → T(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)
   - T is correct in position 1.
   - I is correct in position 3.
   - E is still correct in position 5.
   - O and L are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: T _ I _ E
- Letters used (and therefore excluded): R, A, N, O, L
- C must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (2 or 4).

Now we need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T
- Has C and I in the correct positions relative to what we know
- Ends with E
- Uses none of: R, A, N, O, L

Looking at the pattern T _ I _ E, the remaining letters we can use (common consonants/vowels not yet ruled out): C, D, G, H, K, M, P, S, U, Y.

We still need to place C somewhere. The only positions left for C are 2 or 4.

- If C is in position 2: T C I _ E
- If C is in position 4: T _ I C E

Let’s explore both:
- T C I _ E: Needs a valid word with pattern TCI_E. “TCI_E” doesn’t form a recognizable word.
- T _ I C E: Needs a valid word with pattern T_ICE. “TWICE” fits perfectly. Also, W hasn’t been tested yet.

“TWICE” uses:
- T (position 1) ✓
- W (new letter)
- I (position 3) ✓
- C (position 4) ✓ (this would confirm C is in position 4, satisfying the C(-) from first round)
- E (position 5) ✓

No excluded letters (R, A, N, O, L) are used, and all constraints are satisfied.
