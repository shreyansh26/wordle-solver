For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to test as many frequent letters as possible without repeating letters in the word. 

Some good starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""ARISE"" (A, R, I, S, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains the very common letters A, R, S, and E, as well as the moderately common letter I. This gives a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

All five letters in ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out the most common vowels (A, E, I) and two very common consonants (R, S).  
Our next guess should therefore:

1. Avoid A, R, I, S, E completely.  
2. Introduce new common vowels (only O and U remain from the standard set) and new common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information gain.

A balanced word that meets these constraints is “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T are still possible.  
- It uses both remaining high-frequency vowels O and U.  
- It tests the common consonants C, L, T.

That seems like the most informative next move.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, E, C, L, U, T  
- Letter that IS in the word: O, and it is in the 4th position.

We have to find a 5-letter word whose 4th letter is O and which contains none of the eliminated letters.  
Good remaining letters to test include common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, Y, F, H, K and the vowel Y (since only O is confirmed).  
Because position 4 is locked with O, we need to choose candidates like _ _ _ O _.  

A strong next guess should introduce as many new letters as possible.  
Looking at frequencies: N, D, G, B, M are all still possible.  
Let’s pick a word that tests several of these while keeping O in the 4th spot.  
“NYMPH” fits: N, Y, M, P, H are all still allowed, and the fourth letter is O (but wait—NYMPH has O in the 4th spot only if we rearrange; actually NYMPH is N Y M P H—no O).  
Oops, that’s invalid. Let’s correct: we need a real 5-letter word with O in the 4th position and none of the banned letters.  

Good candidates:  
- BONGO (but G and N are fine, yet it has O twice—no, that’s okay) – but B, O, N, G are still possible.  
- MOPED (but E and D are fine) – but E is already banned.  
- DOWDY – W is still possible, but D is allowed.  

Let’s pick a word with fresh, high-frequency letters: B, N, G, D, Y, etc.  
“BONGY” is a valid word (slang for “bong-like”), but may be obscure.  
“MONDO” uses M, O, N, D – but has O twice and is a bit niche.  
“FONDU” uses F, O, N, D, U – but U is banned.  

The cleanest, common word with O in position 4 and no banned letters is “NYMPH” – but again, no O.  
Recheck: we need O as the 4th letter.  
After scanning, “DONUT” has O in 2nd spot—wrong.  
“BLOWN” – W, L (but L is banned).  
“GONAD” – A, D (A banned).  
“FORGO” – F, R (R banned).  

A real 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot and only allowed letters:  
“MOMMY” – M, Y allowed, but O appears twice and is in 4th spot—valid.  
But MOMMY is okay; however, it repeats M and Y might be low yield.  

Better: “FUNKY” – but no O in 4th.  
Actually, let’s settle on “BONGO”:
- Letters: B, O, N, G, O  
- O is in 4th spot ✓  
- None of A,R,I,S,E,C,L,U,T appear.

(essentially the alphabet has been pruned to: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y plus O and maybe others)

Position knowledge  
- 4th letter IS O and is in the correct spot (✓).  
- 2nd letter is also O, but the second O only got “-”, i.e., it exists somewhere else in the word but NOT in the 2nd slot.

Therefore the secret word has two O’s:
- one fixed at position 4  
- one somewhere else (1st, 3rd, or 5th) but NOT 2nd.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that
1. has O in the 4th position,
2. has exactly one more O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5),
3. uses none of the eliminated letters listed above.

Candidate letters still allowed: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y (plus the extra O).

Quick scan for real words that satisfy these criteria:

- MOODY  → M, O, O, D, Y – O at 2 & 4, but 2 is banned by feedback.  
- DODO   → too short.  
- HOODOO → 6 letters.  
- POOHY  → no, 2nd O again.

- MOMPO  → not a word.  
- WOWOW  → not a word.

- DODO   → 4 letters.  
- VODO   → 4 letters.  
- HOOKY  → H, O, O, K, Y – again 2nd O disallowed.  
- MOPPY  → only one O.  
- DOOMY  → two O’s, but 2nd O is banned.  
- DOOFY  → again 2nd O.  
- …

The only common word that has the 4th O and a second O in an allowed position is “MOMMY” (M, O, M, M, Y) – but it has only one O.  
Wait, we need two O’s. Next candidate with the second O in the 3rd slot: “DOOMY” – but again 2nd O.  

Realising a pattern: virtually all English 5-letter words with two O’s put one of them in position 2, which is forbidden here. The only remaining possibility is that the second O is in the 5th position, like “_ _ _ O O”.

Look for words of pattern ? ? ? O O that avoid all eliminated letters:

- DODOO  – not a word.  
- MOMOO  – not a word.  
- POOHY  – not ending OO.  
- MOJO?  – no.  
- VODOO  – variant spelling of “voodoo” (usually 6 letters).

- POGOO  – not a word.  
- KOOKY  – K, O, O, K, Y – ends OO. 4th letter is O, last is O, and the middle O is in 3rd (allowed).  Valid English word.

So “KOOKY” satisfies:
- 4th letter is O (✓)  
- another O is in 3rd position (allowed)

Therefore “KOOKY” is the best next informative guess.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to test as many frequent letters as possible without repeating letters in the word. 

Some good starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""ARISE"" (A, R, I, S, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains the very common letters A, R, S, and E, as well as the moderately common letter I. This gives a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out the most common vowels (A, E, I) and two very common consonants (R, S).  
Our next guess should therefore:

1. Avoid A, R, I, S, E completely.  
2. Introduce new common vowels (only O and U remain from the standard set) and new common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information gain.

A balanced word that meets these constraints is “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T are still possible.  
- It uses both remaining high-frequency vowels O and U.  
- It tests the common consonants C, L, T.

That seems like the most informative next move.

Good remaining letters to test include common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, Y, F, H, K and the vowel Y (since only O is confirmed).  
Because position 4 is locked with O, we need to choose candidates like _ _ _ O _.  

A strong next guess should introduce as many new letters as possible.  
Looking at frequencies: N, D, G, B, M are all still possible.  
Let’s pick a word that tests several of these while keeping O in the 4th spot.

Let’s pick a word with fresh, high-frequency letters: B, N, G, D, Y, etc.  
“BONGY” is a valid word (slang for “bong-like”), but may be obscure.  
“MONDO” uses M, O, N, D – but has O twice and is a bit niche.  
“FONDU” uses F, O, N, D, U – but U is banned.  

The cleanest, common word with O in position 4 and no banned letters is “NYMPH” – but again, no O.  
Recheck: we need O as the 4th letter.  
After scanning, “DONUT” has O in 2nd spot—wrong.  
“BLOWN” – W, L (but L is banned).  
“GONAD” – A, D (A banned).  
“FORGO” – F, R (R banned).  

A real 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot and only allowed letters:  
“MOMMY” – M, Y allowed, but O appears twice and is in 4th spot—valid.  
But MOMMY is okay; however, it repeats M and Y might be low yield.  

Better: “FUNKY” – but no O in 4th.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to test as many frequent letters as possible without repeating letters in the word. 

Some good starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""ARISE"" (A, R, I, S, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains the very common letters A, R, S, and E, as well as the moderately common letter I. This gives a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in ARISE (A, R, I, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately rules out the most common vowels (A, E, I) and two very common consonants (R, S).  
Our next guess should therefore:

1. Avoid A, R, I, S, E completely.  
2. Introduce new common vowels (only O and U remain from the standard set) and new common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information gain.

A balanced word that meets these constraints is “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T are still possible.  
- It uses both remaining high-frequency vowels O and U.  
- It tests the common consonants C, L, T.

That seems like the most informative next move.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, E, C, L, U, T  
- Letter that IS in the word: O, and it is in the 4th position.

We have to find a 5-letter word whose 4th letter is O and which contains none of the eliminated letters.  
Good remaining letters to test include common consonants like N, D, G, B, M, Y, F, H, K and the vowel Y (since only O is confirmed).  
Because position 4 is locked with O, we need to choose candidates like _ _ _ O _.  

A strong next guess should introduce as many new letters as possible.  
Looking at frequencies: N, D, G, B, M are all still possible.  
Let’s pick a word that tests several of these while keeping O in the 4th spot.  
“NYMPH” fits: N, Y, M, P, H are all still allowed, and the fourth letter is O (but wait—NYMPH has O in the 4th spot only if we rearrange; actually NYMPH is N Y M P H—no O).  
Oops, that’s invalid. Let’s correct: we need a real 5-letter word with O in the 4th position and none of the banned letters.  

Good candidates:  
- BONGO (but G and N are fine, yet it has O twice—no, that’s okay) – but B, O, N, G are still possible.  
- MOPED (but E and D are fine) – but E is already banned.  
- DOWDY – W is still possible, but D is allowed.  

Let’s pick a word with fresh, high-frequency letters: B, N, G, D, Y, etc.  
“BONGY” is a valid word (slang for “bong-like”), but may be obscure.  
“MONDO” uses M, O, N, D – but has O twice and is a bit niche.  
“FONDU” uses F, O, N, D, U – but U is banned.  

The cleanest, common word with O in position 4 and no banned letters is “NYMPH” – but again, no O.  
Recheck: we need O as the 4th letter.  
After scanning, “DONUT” has O in 2nd spot—wrong.  
“BLOWN” – W, L (but L is banned).  
“GONAD” – A, D (A banned).  
“FORGO” – F, R (R banned).  

A real 5-letter word with O in the 4th spot and only allowed letters:  
“MOMMY” – M, Y allowed, but O appears twice and is in 4th spot—valid.  
But MOMMY is okay; however, it repeats M and Y might be low yield.  

Better: “FUNKY” – but no O in 4th.  
Actually, let’s settle on “BONGO”:
- Letters: B, O, N, G, O  
- O is in 4th spot ✓  
- None of A,R,I,S,E,C,L,U,T appear.  
- Introduces B, N, G.

That seems optimal.

Letters eliminated so far: A, R, I, S, E, C, L, U, T, B, N, G  
(essentially the alphabet has been pruned to: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y plus O and maybe others)

Position knowledge  
- 4th letter IS O and is in the correct spot (✓).  
- 2nd letter is also O, but the second O only got “-”, i.e., it exists somewhere else in the word but NOT in the 2nd slot.

Therefore the secret word has two O’s:
- one fixed at position 4  
- one somewhere else (1st, 3rd, or 5th) but NOT 2nd.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that
1. has O in the 4th position,
2. has exactly one more O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5),
3. uses none of the eliminated letters listed above.

Candidate letters still allowed: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y (plus the extra O).

Quick scan for real words that satisfy these criteria:

- MOODY  → M, O, O, D, Y – O at 2 & 4, but 2 is banned by feedback.  
- DODO   → too short.  
- HOODOO → 6 letters.  
- POOHY  → no, 2nd O again.  
- KHOJO  → obsolete.  
- MOMPO  → not a word.  
- WOWOW  → not a word.  
- POOKY  → 2nd O again.  
- DODO   → 4 letters.  
- VODO   → 4 letters.  
- HOOKY  → H, O, O, K, Y – again 2nd O disallowed.  
- MOPPY  → only one O.  
- DOOMY  → two O’s, but 2nd O is banned.  
- DOOFY  → again 2nd O.  
- …

The only common word that has the 4th O and a second O in an allowed position is “MOMMY” (M, O, M, M, Y) – but it has only one O.  
Wait, we need two O’s. Next candidate with the second O in the 3rd slot: “DOOMY” – but again 2nd O.  

Realising a pattern: virtually all English 5-letter words with two O’s put one of them in position 2, which is forbidden here. The only remaining possibility is that the second O is in the 5th position, like “_ _ _ O O”.

Look for words of pattern ? ? ? O O that avoid all eliminated letters:

- DODOO  – not a word.  
- MOMOO  – not a word.  
- POOHY  – not ending OO.  
- MOJO?  – no.  
- VODOO  – variant spelling of “voodoo” (usually 6 letters).  
- HOBOO  – not a word.  
- POGOO  – not a word.  
- KOOKY  – K, O, O, K, Y – ends OO. 4th letter is O, last is O, and the middle O is in 3rd (allowed).  Valid English word.

So “KOOKY” satisfies:
- 4th letter is O (✓)  
- another O is in 3rd position (allowed)  
- letters used: K, O, Y – none of them appear in the banned set.  

Therefore “KOOKY” is the best next informative guess.

4. We need a 5-letter English word that fits the pattern ? O O ? Y using only the legal letters.

Scanning the allowed consonants for position 1 and 4:

   – 1st letter choices: F, H, J, P, V, W  
   – 4th letter choices: F, H, J, P, V, W (must be different from 1st if the word has no repeats)

Quick check of real words:

   FOOD?  – no, 4 letters.  
   HOOFY? – not a word.  
   POOFY  – P O O F Y → valid English word.  Uses P (legal), F (legal), O, O, Y.  
   WHOOP? – ends P, but pattern is W H O O P (5th letter would be P, not Y).  
   JOOBY? – not a word.  
   VOOVY? – not a word.

Only real candidate: POOFY (P O O F Y).

It satisfies:
- 2nd, 3rd, 5th letters already match the ✓ feedback.  
- P and F are both legal (never appeared before).  
- No banned letters are used.  

Therefore, POOFY must be the correct word; making it the final guess.
