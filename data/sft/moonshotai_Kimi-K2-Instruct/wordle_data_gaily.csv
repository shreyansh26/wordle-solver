For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as an optimal first guess because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us maximum information about letter placement and presence. Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid starting point.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (shows “-”)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (shows “x”)

That tells me:
- The secret word contains the letter A somewhere, but NOT in the first position.
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

So I need a 5-letter word:
- That includes the letter A.
- That does NOT include R, O, S, E.
- That has A in some position other than the first.

Good consonants left are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.  
Good vowels to try next (since we only know about A) are I and U.

A candidate word that satisfies these constraints: “TULIP”.
- Contains A? No. So discard.

Another candidate: “TAINT”.
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed).
- Contains T, A, I, N: none of R, O, S, E.
- So it satisfies every rule.

I’ll go with TAINT.

From the three rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, N, D, V  
Letters IN the word and their known positions:
- A is in position 2 (locked)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (feedback from DAVID shows “-” for I)

So the pattern is:
_ A _ _ _   (A fixed in 2)
I must appear in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Available letters (excluding the banned ones):
Vowels: A (already placed), I (must be used), U  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- I in one of positions 1, 3, or 5
- No R, O, S, E, T, N, D, V

Possible candidates:
- HABIT → H A B I T → T is banned → reject
- MAGIC → M A G I C → C allowed → positions: A in 2, I in 4 → but I cannot be in 4
- CABIN → C A B I N → N is banned → reject
- BAILS → S is banned → reject
- LAICH → L A I C H → positions: A in 2, I in 3 (allowed), no banned letters → valid
- GAILY → G A I L Y → positions: A in 2, I in 3 (allowed), no banned letters → valid

Between LAICH and GAILY, GAILY is a more common word.

So let’s try GAILY.
