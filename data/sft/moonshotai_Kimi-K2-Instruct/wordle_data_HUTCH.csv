For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters (vowels and common consonants) and no repeated letters. Some popular first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives me a good chance to identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From both guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)

- U is not in position 3.

Possible positions for T: 2, 3, 5.  
Possible positions for U: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but must avoid position 3).

- Places U in one of its allowed positions (1, 2, 4, 5) without colliding with T.  
- Uses other common unused letters (good choices among remaining common letters: C, D, G, H, I, M, O, P, Y).

A promising pattern could be _ T _ _ _ or _ _ T _ _ or _ _ _ _ T, while also including U somewhere. One such word that fits these constraints and uses other common letters is ""OUTDO"".  
- O and D have not been tested.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, R, N, K, O, D  
Letters we are certain ARE in the word: T, U  

Positions we have learned:
- T is not in positions 1, 3, or 4.  That leaves positions 2 or 5.
- U is not in positions 2 or 3.  That leaves positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining available letters (common ones in priority): I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, V, W, Z.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains T and U.
2. Places T in position 2 or 5.
3. Places U in position 1, 4, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining letters (no S, L, A, E, R, N, K, O, D).

A good candidate is ""ITCHY"" but it doesn’t contain U.  Another candidate: ""CUPID"" but it contains D which is out.  ""INPUT"" is invalid because N is out.  ""BUILT"" is invalid because L and I are out.  ""THUMP"" is invalid because H, M, P are okay but it contains P and M but no U.  

Let’s try ""UPTIC"":
- Contains U and T.
- U is in position 1 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 but position 3 for T was already ruled out in guess 3 (OUTDO had T in position 3 and it was marked ✓).  Wait, no: in guess 3, T was in position 3 and it was ✓, which means position 3 is CORRECT, so T must be in position 3.  This is a key insight.

Re-examining:
Guess 3: OUTDO → O(x) U(✓) T(✓) D(x) O(x)  
This shows T is in position 3 (✓), so T is definitely in position 3.  
And U is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2 (since U was in position 2 in OUTDO and was marked ✓, meaning position 2 for U is CORRECT).

Wait, no: the feedback symbols are:
- ✓ means the letter is in the word AND in the correct position.
- - means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x means the letter is not in the word.

In guess 3: OUTDO → O(x) U(✓) T(✓) D(x) O(x)  
This means:
- U is in the word and is in position 2 (✓).  
- T is in the word and is in position 3 (✓).  

So now we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are locked: position 2 is U, position 3 is T.
- Letters not allowed: S, L, A, E, R, N, K, O, D.

So the word looks like: _ U T _ _

Available letters for positions 1, 4, 5: C, G, H, I, M, P, Y, B, F, V, W, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form _ U T _ _ using only these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BUTCH (but B and C, H are okay, but ""BUTCH"" is valid) – let’s check: B is allowed, U is position 2, T is position 3, C and H are allowed.
- GUTSY (G, U, T, S, Y – S is out) – invalid.
- HUTCH – H, U, T, C, H – valid and uses H and C.
- MUTCH – M, U, T, C, H – valid.
- YUTCH – Y, U, T, C, H – valid.

""HUTCH"" looks like the best common word among these.
