For the first guess in Wordle, we want to maximize the information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. A classic starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
This provides a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain L or T.

Good next step: pick a word that reuses the known letters (S, A, E) while adding new high-value consonants.  
A solid choice is ""CHASE"":
- C and H are new consonants.
- S is tried in position 2 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 1).
- A is tried in position 3 (but we know it’s not in position 3 from the feedback, so this is a deliberate test to confirm it’s elsewhere).
- E is locked at position 5.

However, since A can’t be in position 3, let’s instead shift A to position 2 and try ""ASIDE"":
- A in position 2 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 3).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- D is a new consonant.
- E is locked at position 5.

This tests new letters and repositions S and A appropriately.

1. E is fixed at position 5 (✓ each time).

4. P, H, L, T, I, D are all ruled out.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, we want to maximize the information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. A classic starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Common vowels: A, E
This provides a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain L or T.

Good next step: pick a word that reuses the known letters (S, A, E) while adding new high-value consonants.  
A solid choice is ""CHASE"":
- C and H are new consonants.
- S is tried in position 2 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 1).
- A is tried in position 3 (but we know it’s not in position 3 from the feedback, so this is a deliberate test to confirm it’s elsewhere).
- E is locked at position 5.

However, since A can’t be in position 3, let’s instead shift A to position 2 and try ""ASIDE"":
- A in position 2 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 3).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since we only know it’s not in position 1).
- I is a new vowel.
- D is a new consonant.
- E is locked at position 5.

This tests new letters and repositions S and A appropriately.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ASIDE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)  
   - E is fixed at position 5.  
   - S is present but not in positions 1 or 2 (since it was position-1 in SLATE and position-2 in ASIDE).  
   - A is present but not in positions 2 or 3 (it was position-3 in SLATE and position-1 in ASIDE).  
   - T and I are ruled out entirely.  
   - L and D are also ruled out.

Known facts:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains S and A.
- S must be in positions 3 or 4.
- A must be in positions 4 or 5, but E is already at 5 ⇒ A must be in position 4.
- Therefore positions: _ _ _ A E
- S must then be in position 3: _ _ S A E
- The remaining two letters (positions 1 and 2) must be consonants not yet ruled out (no L, T, D, I, etc.). Good candidates: B, C, F, G, H, M, N, P, R, W, etc.

We want a consonant pair that forms a common English word ending in “SAE”.  
The two most common 5-letter words fitting this pattern are CRASE and PHASE, but CRASE uses R and C which are both still allowed. However, CRASE is less common.  
PHASE uses P and H; PHASE is very common and only introduces P and H, neither of which has been ruled out.

So, PHASE satisfies all constraints:
- P and H are new letters.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (required).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know with certainty.

1. E is fixed in position 5.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ E

2. A is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback in guesses 2, 3, 4).  
   The only remaining position is position 5, but position 5 is already E.  
   ⇒ A cannot appear at all.  
   Therefore, the earlier symbol “A(-)” must have meant the letter A appears in the word but in a **different position**; but every position has now been tried and ruled out for A.  
   This is a contradiction unless the feedback symbols were interpreted incorrectly.

Re-reading the original feedback rules:
- “-” means the letter is in the word but in the **wrong position**.
- “x” means the letter is **not** in the word.

So let’s re-tabulate the positions for A:

- Guess 1 (SLATE): position 3 → A(-) → A exists but **not** at 3.  
- Guess 2 (ASIDE): position 1 → A(✓) → A **is** at position 1.  
- Guess 3 (PHASE): position 3 → A(-) → A exists but **not** at 3.  
- Guess 4 (FACES): position 2 → A(-) → A exists but **not** at 2.

From Guess 2 we got A(✓) meaning A **is** in position 1.  
Therefore the first letter is A.  
Positions: A _ _ _ E

Now re-examine S.

- Guess 1: S(-) → S is in the word but not at position 1.  
- Guess 2: S(-) → S is in the word but not at position 2.  
- Guess 3: S(✓) → S is at position 4.  
- Guess 4: S(-) → S is in the word but not at position 5 (already known).  

So S is fixed at position 4: A _ _ S E

Letters ruled out so far:
L, T, I, D, P, H, C, F.

We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining alphabet:  
B, G, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Common English 5-letter words that fit A _ _ S E:
- A B S E N  (but that’s 6 letters)  
- A B U S E  (U not yet tried, B allowed)  
- A M U S E  (M, U allowed)  
- A R O S E  (O not yet tried, R allowed)  
- A N Y S E  (rare)  
- A G E S S  (invalid)

Among these, the most common and valid 5-letter option is **ABUSE**.

Let’s check its letters:  
A (allowed at 1), B (new), U (new), S (fixed at 4), E (fixed at 5).  
None of the letters have been ruled out.

Therefore, the optimal next guess is ABUSE.

None of the letters have been ruled out.

Therefore, the optimal next guess is ABUSE.",Guess 5: ABUSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
