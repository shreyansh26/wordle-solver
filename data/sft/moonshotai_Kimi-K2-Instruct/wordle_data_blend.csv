Since this is my first guess with no prior information, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Good options might be:
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with STARE because it includes S, T, A, R, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters, including multiple vowels.

From the feedback:
- S, T, A, R are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the word contains an E somewhere other than the last letter, and none of S, T, A, R appear anywhere.

We need a five-letter word that uses none of S,T,A,R and has E elsewhere than the 5th slot. Common consonants still available (and frequent) include N, L, C, M, D, P, B, H, G.

A good next guess should introduce several new consonants plus place the E in a fresh position. The word “BLEND” uses B, L, N, D (all new) and places E in the 2nd spot. Another candidate could be “PLUMB” (P, L, U, M, B), but it lacks the known letter E. “PLUMB” gives fewer new consonants, whereas “BLEND” tests four new consonants and the known E.

Let’s choose BLEND.
