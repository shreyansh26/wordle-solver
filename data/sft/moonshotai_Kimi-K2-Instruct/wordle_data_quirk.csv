For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels are in the word and give us some information about common consonants.

So far we have:

- Letters completely ruled out: A, O, S, E, B, N  
- Letters confirmed in the word (but not yet fixed in position): U, R, I  
  – U is in the correct position (position 2).  
  – R is somewhere in the word but NOT positions 2 or 3.  
  – I is somewhere in the word but NOT position 4.

So the word must look like: _ U _ _ _  
and must contain R and I somewhere among positions 3,4,5, with R definitely not in position 3.

We also know it cannot contain A, O, S, E, B, N.

Let’s list possible 3-letter suffixes after “U” that use R and I plus one more allowed letter (C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible placements:
- R in position 4 or 5
- I in position 3 or 5  
- One more unused consonant.

Quick scan:
- CURIO – invalid (O eliminated)  
- HURRY – N ruled out but Y allowed, yet R twice and Y not yet tested.  
- PURIM – M is allowed, but we already tried BURIN and N is out; PURIM ends in M, but M is allowed.  
- MURID – D allowed, I in correct spot (position 4).  
- DURRA – A eliminated.  
- LURID – D allowed, I in position 4, R in 3. But R cannot be in position 3.  
- QUIRK – Q and K allowed, R in 4, I in 3. R can be in 4, I in 3 allowed.  

“QUIRK” seems to satisfy every rule:
- Letters: Q, U, I, R, K  
  – U is in position 2 (✓).  
  – R is in position 4 (not 2 or 3).  
  – I is in position 3 (not 4, so okay).  
  – No A, O, S, E, B, N.  
  – All letters allowed and it’s a valid English word.

<guess>QUIRK</guess>",QUIRK,"So far we have:

- Letters completely ruled out: A, O, S, E, B, N  
- Letters confirmed in the word (but not yet fixed in position): U, R, I  
  – U is in the correct position (position 2).  
  – R is somewhere in the word but NOT positions 2 or 3.  
  – I is somewhere in the word but NOT position 4.

So the word must look like: _ U _ _ _  
and must contain R and I somewhere among positions 3,4,5, with R definitely not in position 3.

We also know it cannot contain A, O, S, E, B, N.

Let’s list possible 3-letter suffixes after “U” that use R and I plus one more allowed letter (C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible placements:
- R in position 4 or 5
- I in position 3 or 5  
- One more unused consonant.

Quick scan:
- CURIO – invalid (O eliminated)  
- HURRY – N ruled out but Y allowed, yet R twice and Y not yet tested.  
- PURIM – M is allowed, but we already tried BURIN and N is out; PURIM ends in M, but M is allowed.  
- MURID – D allowed, I in correct spot (position 4).  
- DURRA – A eliminated.  
- LURID – D allowed, I in position 4, R in 3. But R cannot be in position 3.  
- QUIRK – Q and K allowed, R in 4, I in 3. R can be in 4, I in 3 allowed.  

“QUIRK” seems to satisfy every rule:
- Letters: Q, U, I, R, K  
  – U is in position 2 (✓).  
  – R is in position 4 (not 2 or 3).  
  – I is in position 3 (not 4, so okay).  
  – No A, O, S, E, B, N.  
  – All letters allowed and it’s a valid English word.",Guess 3: QUIRK -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) I(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
