Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The goal is to eliminate many possible letters early on.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of these top letters. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" with C, R, A, N, E.

""CRANE"" seems particularly good because:
- C is common and often appears at the start
- R is very frequent
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter overall

This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

2. The word contains **A** and **L**, but neither is in the positions we have tried so far:
   - A has been tried in positions 3 (CRANE) and 3 (PLATE), both times marked wrong position, so A cannot be in position 3.
   - L has been tried in position 2 (PLATE), marked wrong position, so L is not in position 2.
3. The word must NOT contain C, R, N, P, T.

- _ A L _ E  (e.g., VALVE, but V is allowed) → VALVE has V, A, L, V, E – no forbidden letters.
- _ _ A L E  (e.g., SCALE, but S, C, A, L, E – C is forbidden)
- L A _ _ E  (e.g., L A _ _ E → LANCE has N, forbidden; LAKES has K, S – let’s see)
- L _ _ A E  (e.g., LEMMA has M, but also M, M – not ideal)

- E in position 5

- Y in position 4 (new letter)

Another candidate: **VALVE** – but V is allowed, and A is in position 2 (allowed). However, it has double V, which might not be ideal for testing new letters.

**ALLEY** is better because it tests the new letter Y and places A and L in positions we haven’t tried yet.

From ALLEY we now have:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of these top letters. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" with C, R, A, N, E.

""CRANE"" seems particularly good because:
- C is common and often appears at the start
- R is very frequent
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter overall

This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

From the latest feedback on AMBLE:
- A ✓ (locked in position 1)
- M x (not in the word)
- B x (not in the word)
- L ✓ (locked in position 4)
- E ✓ (locked in position 5)

So the word must be A _ _ L E, and the letters already ruled out are C, R, N, P, T, Y, M, B. 

We still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the remaining alphabet that have not been tried yet. The remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared (or have appeared only in ruled-out contexts) are: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Since we have only two slots to fill (positions 2 and 3) and we want to test new letters, we should pick a combination that hasn’t been tried and uses common letters. 

Looking at possible combinations:
- A D U L E (ADULE – not a valid word)

- A ✓ (locked in position 1)

So the word must be A _ _ L E, and the letters already ruled out are C, R, N, P, T, Y, M, B. 

We still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the remaining alphabet that have not been tried yet. The remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared (or have appeared only in ruled-out contexts) are: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,aisle,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. The goal is to eliminate many possible letters early on.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of these top letters. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" with C, R, A, N, E.

""CRANE"" seems particularly good because:
- C is common and often appears at the start
- R is very frequent
- A is the most common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter overall

This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in the first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → fifth position
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A must appear somewhere in positions 1-4

We now know:
- Word ends with E
- Must contain A (but not in position 3)
- Must not contain C, R, N

Looking for 5-letter words ending in E that contain the letter A somewhere in positions 1-4, and avoid C, R, N.

Good candidates:
- SLADE – uses S, L, A, D, E (no C, R, N; A in position 3 is valid since original A was in position 3 and marked wrong, so A could be in 3 again)
- PLATE – P, L, A, T, E (no C, R, N)
- STAGE – S, T, A, G, E (no C, R, N)

""PLATE"" seems strongest because:
- Uses P, L, A, T – all new letters to test
- A is in position 3 again (acceptable since feedback only said ""wrong position"", not forbidden)
- E confirmed in position 5
- Tests P, L, T which are common letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
1. The word ends with **E** (fixed).
2. The word contains **A** and **L**, but neither is in the positions we have tried so far:
   - A has been tried in positions 3 (CRANE) and 3 (PLATE), both times marked wrong position, so A cannot be in position 3.
   - L has been tried in position 2 (PLATE), marked wrong position, so L is not in position 2.
3. The word must NOT contain C, R, N, P, T.

So far, the revealed pattern is: _ _ _ _ E  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4, and L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains both A and L (in allowed positions)
- Excludes C, R, N, P, T

Possible structures:
- A _ L _ E  (e.g., ALLEY, ALIKE) → ALLEY has double L, which is fine, but let’s check letters: A, L, E, Y – all allowed.
- _ A L _ E  (e.g., VALVE, but V is allowed) → VALVE has V, A, L, V, E – no forbidden letters.
- _ _ A L E  (e.g., SCALE, but S, C, A, L, E – C is forbidden)
- L A _ _ E  (e.g., L A _ _ E → LANCE has N, forbidden; LAKES has K, S – let’s see)
- L _ _ A E  (e.g., LEMMA has M, but also M, M – not ideal)

Looking at the safest candidate: **ALLEY**
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (allowed, since L was only excluded from position 2 in PLATE)
- L in position 3 (fine)
- E in position 5
- Y in position 4 (new letter)

Another candidate: **VALVE** – but V is allowed, and A is in position 2 (allowed). However, it has double V, which might not be ideal for testing new letters.

**ALLEY** is better because it tests the new letter Y and places A and L in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: ALLEY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) L(-) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From ALLEY we now have:
A(✓) in position 1 – this is now locked in place.
L appears twice, both times marked (-) – so L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (and clearly not in 1 or 5 because A and E are already fixed there).
E(✓) in position 5 – already known and confirmed.
Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So the fixed pattern is:
A _ _ _ E
with L required somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no C, R, N, P, T, Y.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z plus the confirmed A, L, E.

Possible structures:
1. A L _ _ E – but L in position 2 would contradict the (-) it received there in ALLEY.
2. A _ L _ E – L in position 3 would contradict the (-) it received in position 3 of ALLEY.
3. A _ _ L E – L in position 4 has not been tried yet and is not contradicted.

So L must be in position 4, giving the template:
A _ _ L E

We need a 5-letter word matching A _ _ L E using only the allowed letters.

Candidates:
- AMBLE – M and B are allowed, fits A M B L E
- ANGLE – N is now forbidden (from CRANE)
- APPLE – P is forbidden
- AXILE – X and I are allowed, fits A X I L E
- AGILE – G and I are allowed, fits A G I L E
- AMOLE – M and O are allowed, but O was never tested; fits A M O L E

Among these, AMBLE tests new letters M and B, while AXILE tests X and I. AMBLE uses more common letters, so it's a safer informative choice.

Therefore: AMBLE
