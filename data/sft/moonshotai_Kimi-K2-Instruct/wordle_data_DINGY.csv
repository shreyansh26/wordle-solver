3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters that might appear in the secret word. After this first guess, I'll be able to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong starting choice that many players use.

The feedback for AROSE was all “x”, which means none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word.  
Therefore, my next guess should avoid every one of those five letters entirely.  
To still cover common letters efficiently, I can pick a word that uses other high-frequency consonants and remaining vowels.  
U and I are the vowels still allowed, and consonants like T, N, L, C, D, G, M, P, B, H, K, etc., are all fair game.  
A balanced word that uses several of those remaining common letters is “UNITY”.  It contains:
- U and I (two of the remaining common vowels)
- N, T, Y (fairly common consonants)
No letters from the previous guess appear, so the feedback should give fresh information.

(Other candidate first-follow-up words with no A,R,O,S,E include “UNTIL”, “BUILD”, “CHIMP”, etc., but “UNITY” is clean and simple.)
