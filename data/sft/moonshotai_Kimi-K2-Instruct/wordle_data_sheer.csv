For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about the letters in the secret word. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained
3. Include both vowels and consonants to test different letter types

Some classic good starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, ADIEU, STARE, ROAST. Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives coverage of different letter positions and types.

From the two rounds:

Round 1 (CRANE)
C x, R -, A x, N x, E –

Round 2 (STORE)
S ✓, T x, O x, R –, E –  
1. S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
2. T and O are not in the word at all
3. R is still “in the word but wrong spot” → R must be in positions 3 or 4 (it can’t be 1,2,5 because S is 1, we know 2 and 5 are wrong from CRANE, and 2 is also wrong from STORE)
4. E is still “in the word but wrong spot” → E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are already ruled out)

So far the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _
with letters still to place: R (only positions 3 or 4), E (positions 2,3,4), plus any new letters.

We need three more distinct letters from the remaining unused set. Common ones still available include D, I, L, P, U, etc. To maximize info, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps S fixed in position 1,
- tries R in position 3,
- tries E in position 2,
- and adds two new letters (L and I) in positions 4 and 5.

A valid word is SPIRE: S ✓, P new, I new, R in position 4 (still allowed), E in position 5 (but we know E cannot be in 5 from CRANE). So SPIRE is invalid for E.

Known facts after three guesses:

1. Position 1: S is fixed (✓).
2. Letters definitely in the word: R, E.
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, O, U, M.
4. Restricted positions:
   – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and SERUM feedback).
   – R cannot be in positions 2, 3 or 5 (from CRANE, STORE, SERUM feedback).
   – R is therefore allowed only in position 4.
   – E is therefore allowed only in positions 3 or 4.
   – But position 4 can’t hold both R and E, so exactly one of them must go there.

Deduce placement:

- R must be in position 4 (only remaining spot allowed).
- E must be in position 3 (only remaining spot allowed).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ E R _

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sheer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained
3. Include both vowels and consonants to test different letter types

Some classic good starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, ADIEU, STARE, ROAST. Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives coverage of different letter positions and types.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So far we know:
1. The word contains R and E.
2. R is not in position 2.
3. E is not in position 5.
4. Letters C, A, N are absent.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should:
- Include R and E in new positions (not 2 for R, not 5 for E)
- Use new common letters to test more possibilities
- Avoid C, A, N
- Avoid repeating any other letters

Good candidate letters to test: T, S, L, I, O, D, M, P, H, K, etc.

I'll try ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters
- R in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 2 (new position)

This tests 5 new letters (since R and E are already known to be present) and places them in informative positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds:

Round 1 (CRANE)
C x, R -, A x, N x, E –  
→ Letters known: R and E must appear (somewhere other than positions 2 and 5 respectively), C, A, N are ruled out.

Round 2 (STORE)
S ✓, T x, O x, R –, E –  
1. S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
2. T and O are not in the word at all
3. R is still “in the word but wrong spot” → R must be in positions 3 or 4 (it can’t be 1,2,5 because S is 1, we know 2 and 5 are wrong from CRANE, and 2 is also wrong from STORE)
4. E is still “in the word but wrong spot” → E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are already ruled out)

So far the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _
with letters still to place: R (only positions 3 or 4), E (positions 2,3,4), plus any new letters.

We need three more distinct letters from the remaining unused set. Common ones still available include D, I, L, P, U, etc. To maximize info, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps S fixed in position 1,
- tries R in position 3,
- tries E in position 2,
- and adds two new letters (L and I) in positions 4 and 5.

That gives: S E R L I  (SERLI is not a valid English word).  
A valid word is SPIRE: S ✓, P new, I new, R in position 4 (still allowed), E in position 5 (but we know E cannot be in 5 from CRANE). So SPIRE is invalid for E.

Next try: SLIDE
S ✓, L new, I new, D new, E in position 5 (forbidden).

Try: SPEIR (not common).

Better: SPIRE is invalid for E, so let’s place E in position 2 and R in position 4: S E _ R _.  
Need one more letter. SERUM? 5 letters: S E R U M.
