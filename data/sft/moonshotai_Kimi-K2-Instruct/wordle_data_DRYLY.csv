For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The classic starting word for Wordle-like games is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another good option, but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's slightly more balanced between vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct second position (✓).
- C, A, N, and E are NOT in the word at all (x).

So the secret word has the pattern _R _ _ _.  
Letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E.

Next I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates are S, T, I, L, O, U, D, etc. I’ll build a word that keeps R in position 2 and introduces new letters.

One strong choice is “TRUST”:
- T – common consonant
- R – already confirmed in position 2
- U – common vowel
- S – common consonant
- T – common consonant (repeating T is acceptable because T is popular)

This tests a new vowel (U) and two new consonants (T, S) while fitting the positional constraint.

So far we know:
1. The second letter is R (✓).
2. The letters C, A, N, E, T, U, and S are NOT in the word at all (x).

That leaves us with the pattern _R _ _ _ and a shrinking pool of usable letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining common vowels: I, O (U and A were ruled out)

I want a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Introduces several new letters not yet tried
- Uses both remaining vowels (I and/or O) to narrow them down quickly

A strong candidate is “BRISK”:
- B – new consonant
- R – already confirmed in position 2
- I – new vowel
- S – but S was already ruled out by TRUST feedback, so this is invalid.

Next idea: “FROST” – but T and S are out.  
“GROWN” – W and N are still possible, but N was already ruled out in CRANE.  
“PROUD” – U and T are out.  
“GRIND” – N is out.  
“PRISM” – S and M are still possible, but S is out.  
“DRINK” – N and K are still possible, but N is out.  
“FRISK” – S is out.  
“CRISP” – C and S are out.

Let me try using only letters not ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, Z.

The classic starting word for Wordle-like games is ""CRANE"" because it contains:\n- C (common consonant)\n- R (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- N (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another good option, but I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it\'s slightly more balanced between vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n- R is in the word and in the correct second position (✓).\n- C, A, N, and E are NOT in the word at all (x).\n\nSo the secret word has the pattern _R _ _ _.  \nLetters we know are absent: C, A, N, E.\n\nNext I want to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates are S, T, I, L, O, U, D, etc. I’ll build a word that keeps R in position 2 and introduces new letters.\n\nOne strong choice is “TRUST”:\n- T – common consonant\n- R – already confirmed in position 2\n- U – common vowel\n- S – common consonant\n- T – common consonant (repeating T is acceptable because T is popular)\n\nThis tests a new vowel (U) and two new consonants (T, S) while fitting the positional constraint.\n\n<guess>TRUST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRUST -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n1.

We now have the fixed pattern: D R _ L Y (letters 1, 2, 4, 5 are locked in).  
The only slot still unknown is position 3.  
Letters already ruled out (from earlier feedback):  
C, A, N, E, T, U, S, I.  

So the third letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been used yet.  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z.  

We need a 5-letter English word that fits the pattern D R ? L Y.  
A quick mental scan gives:  
- D R O L Y (but O is still possible, though it hasn’t been ruled out)  
- D R E L Y (E is out)  
- D R I L Y (I is out)  
- D R B L Y – not a real word  
- D R F L Y – not a word  
- D R G L Y – not a word  
- D R H L Y – not a word  
- D R K L Y – not a word  
- D R M L Y – not a word  
- D R P L Y – not a word  
- D R V L Y – not a word  
- D R W L Y – not a word  
- D R Z L Y – not a word  

Wait, “DROLL” fits the pattern D R ? L Y?  No, it’s D R O L L.  
“DRILY” was the last guess.  
“DROOL” is D R O O L – doesn’t fit.  

Hmm, the only real word that matches D R _ L Y seems to be “D R O L Y” (which is actually a rare variant spelling for “drily”), but it’s not recognized as a valid Wordle word in most lists.  

Let me double-check: the valid English word fitting D R _ L Y is “DRYLY”.  Let me verify that:
- D – ✓
- R – ✓
- Y – ✓
- L – ✓
- Y – ✓

But we need 5 distinct letters. Wait, no, “DRYLY” is D-R-Y-L-Y.  
Actually, the pattern is D R _ L Y, so the word must be D R ? L Y.  
The only common word that fits is “DRYLY” (with Y in position 3).  

But is “DRYLY” valid? Yes, it’s an adverb form of “dry” accepted in Scrabble and Wordle.  

Thus, the word must be “DRYLY”.
