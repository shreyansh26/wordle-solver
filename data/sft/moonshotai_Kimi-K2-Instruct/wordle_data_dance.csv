For a first guess in Wordle, I want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent English letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with as many of these common letters as possible. 

Classic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage across vowels and consonants. This should help quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

So far we know:

1. The letter E is in the word and in the correct final position (……E).
2. The letters A, R, I, S are NOT in the word at all (because they all got x).

That leaves us to work with the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, V, W, Y plus the known E at the end.

We want to test a new set of five common letters while keeping E fixed in the last slot. Good next choices should use letters we haven’t tested yet. Some good candidates:

- CONE – but we’ve already eliminated R and I, but not O or N.
- DOTE – but T is common and untested.
- LONE – but we haven’t tested L or N.
- BONE – B and N are untested.

Let me pick “BONE” to test new letters B, O, N.

But wait: the word must be 5 letters, and I need to keep E at the end. So a good word is:

T O N E ? – no that’s 4 letters.

Let me go with “TONEY” – but Y hasn’t been tested yet, and it’s not the most common.

Better to test a 5-letter word with as many new common letters as possible while keeping E in the last position.

Let’s try: “M O N E Y” – but Y is less common.

How about “C O M E T” – but E is fixed at the end.

Actually, since we know the word ends with E, I need a 5-letter word ending in E. The best untested common consonants are T, L, N, D, O, C, B, etc.

Let me pick “O L D E N” – but O, L, D, N are untested and common, and E is at the end. But “OLDEN” is a valid word.

But actually “OLDEN” ends with N, not E. Oops.

Let me think of a 5-letter word ending in E that uses new untested consonants. Some options:

- CLONE – but L, O, N, C are untested.
- BLEND – but ends with D.
- BLOKE – but K is rare.
- TONED – ends with D.

I think “CLONE” is a good choice:

C – new
L – new
O – new
N – new

Actually, since we know the word ends with E, I need a 5-letter word ending in E. The best untested common consonants are T, L, N, D, O, C, B, etc.

Let me pick “O L D E N” – but O, L, D, N are untested and common, and E is at the end. But “OLDEN” is a valid word.

But actually “OLDEN” ends with N, not E. Oops.

Let me think of a 5-letter word ending in E that uses new untested consonants. Some options:

- CLONE – but L, O, N, C are untested.
- BLEND – but ends with D.
- BLOKE – but K is rare.
- TONED – ends with D.

I think “CLONE” is a good choice:

C – new
L – new
O – new
N – new
E – known to be correct at the end.

So let’s go with CLONE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: clone -> FEEDBACK: C(-) L(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

1. The word is _ _ _ _ E (E is locked in the 5th position).
2. Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, I, S, L, O.
3. Letters now also ruled out in positions 1-4: C and N are in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4, respectively.

Remaining common letters we haven't tested yet in positions 1-4: B, D, F, G, H, M, T, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-allowed C and N but not in their previous wrong spots.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses only these remaining letters, and avoids the forbidden positions for C and N.

Good candidate letters: B, D, T, U, Y, M, G, H.

A strong choice is ""BUDGE"":
- B, U, D, G are all untested and common.
- E is confirmed at the end.
- All letters are allowed and none are forbidden in their positions.

Let's confirm:
- Valid 5-letter word: BUDGE.
- Ends in E.
- Uses only permitted letters (no A, R, I, S, L, O).
- Does not place C or N in positions 1 or 4 (neither letter appears).

This seems optimal.

The most frequent English letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with as many of these common letters as possible. 

Classic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage across vowels and consonants. This should help quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

That leaves us to work with the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, V, W, Y plus the known E at the end.

We want to test a new set of five common letters while keeping E fixed in the last slot. Good next choices should use letters we haven’t tested yet. Some good candidates:

- CONE – but we’ve already eliminated R and I, but not O or N.

- BONE – B and N are untested.

Let me pick “BONE” to test new letters B, O, N.

But wait: the word must be 5 letters, and I need to keep E at the end. So a good word is:

T O N E ? – no that’s 4 letters.

Let me go with “TONEY” – but Y hasn’t been tested yet, and it’s not the most common.

Better to test a 5-letter word with as many new common letters as possible while keeping E in the last position.

The only letters we have not tested yet in any position are:
C, D, N (already known to be somewhere inside)
plus the still-untested common letters F, K, P, V, W.

We still need two more distinct letters for positions 1–4.  
To maximize information, let’s test a word that uses two of the remaining untested letters while placing C, D, or N in positions still allowed.

A good candidate set:
- F, K, V, W plus C or N or D.

A valid 5-letter word ending in E that fits these constraints is ""FENCE"":
- F and E are both untested positions
- N is in the word (not yet placed), and position 2 is still allowed for N
- C is in the word, and position 3 is still allowed for C
- E is fixed at the end

C, D, N (already known to be somewhere inside)

We still need two more distinct letters for positions 1–4.  
To maximize information, let’s test a word that uses two of the remaining untested letters while placing C, D, or N in positions still allowed.

A good candidate set:
- F, K, V, W plus C or N or D.

A valid 5-letter word ending in E that fits these constraints is ""FENCE"":
- F and E are both untested positions
- N is in the word (not yet placed), and position 2 is still allowed for N
- C is in the word, and position 3 is still allowed for C
- E is fixed at the end
- All letters are distinct and comply with the current constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, I want a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent English letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word with as many of these common letters as possible. 

Classic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage across vowels and consonants. This should help quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>arise</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

1. The letter E is in the word and in the correct final position (……E).
2. The letters A, R, I, S are NOT in the word at all (because they all got x).

That leaves us to work with the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, V, W, Y plus the known E at the end.

We want to test a new set of five common letters while keeping E fixed in the last slot. Good next choices should use letters we haven’t tested yet. Some good candidates:

- CONE – but we’ve already eliminated R and I, but not O or N.
- DOTE – but T is common and untested.
- LONE – but we haven’t tested L or N.
- BONE – B and N are untested.

Let me pick “BONE” to test new letters B, O, N.

But wait: the word must be 5 letters, and I need to keep E at the end. So a good word is:

T O N E ? – no that’s 4 letters.

Let me go with “TONEY” – but Y hasn’t been tested yet, and it’s not the most common.

Better to test a 5-letter word with as many new common letters as possible while keeping E in the last position.

Let’s try: “M O N E Y” – but Y is less common.

How about “C O M E T” – but E is fixed at the end.

Actually, since we know the word ends with E, I need a 5-letter word ending in E. The best untested common consonants are T, L, N, D, O, C, B, etc.

Let me pick “O L D E N” – but O, L, D, N are untested and common, and E is at the end. But “OLDEN” is a valid word.

But actually “OLDEN” ends with N, not E. Oops.

Let me think of a 5-letter word ending in E that uses new untested consonants. Some options:

- CLONE – but L, O, N, C are untested.
- BLEND – but ends with D.
- BLOKE – but K is rare.
- TONED – ends with D.

I think “CLONE” is a good choice:

C – new
L – new
O – new
N – new
E – known to be correct at the end.

So let’s go with CLONE.

Guess 2: clone -> FEEDBACK: C(-) L(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

1. The word is _ _ _ _ E (E is locked in the 5th position).
2. Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, I, S, L, O.
3. Letters now also ruled out in positions 1-4: C and N are in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4, respectively.

Remaining common letters we haven't tested yet in positions 1-4: B, D, F, G, H, M, T, U, V, W, Y, plus the already-allowed C and N but not in their previous wrong spots.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses only these remaining letters, and avoids the forbidden positions for C and N.

Good candidate letters: B, D, T, U, Y, M, G, H.

A strong choice is ""BUDGE"":
- B, U, D, G are all untested and common.
- E is confirmed at the end.
- All letters are allowed and none are forbidden in their positions.

Let's confirm:
- Valid 5-letter word: BUDGE.
- Ends in E.
- Uses only permitted letters (no A, R, I, S, L, O).
- Does not place C or N in positions 1 or 4 (neither letter appears).

This seems optimal.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds we now know:

- Word ends in E: _ _ _ _ E
- Letters permanently ruled out: A, R, I, S, L, O, B, U, G
- Position-specific information:
  – C is in the word but not in position 1
  – N is in the word but not in position 4
  – D is in the word but not in position 3

Remaining common letters that can still appear in positions 1-4: C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses only this remaining set, with no duplicates.  
A good choice is “THYME”:
- T, H, Y, M all untested and allowed
- E locked at the end
- All letters distinct and no forbidden letters used
- The word itself is valid

Alternative candidates like “WHINE” or “CHIME” use C or N in positions not yet ruled out, but THYME tests four new letters at once, giving maximal information.

3. Letters confirmed in the word:

   - C (now fixed in position 4) – _ _ N C E
4. D is in the word, but we earlier saw it’s not in position 3 (which is already occupied by N), so D must be in position 1 or 2.
5. Remaining untested letters that can still appear: D, K, P, V, W, plus the already-known C and N which are now placed.

So the pattern is: [D or ?] [D or ?] N C E
The only still-available common consonant that fits slot 1 or 2 is D.

Therefore the word must be:
D _ N C E or _ D N C E

The only valid 5-letter word fitting both is DUNCE, but U is already ruled out (feedback from budge).  
Next choice: D in position 1 and nothing else left except the already-placed N and C.  
That leaves only D in position 1 and a blank in position 2.

But we have no more untested consonants left that fit, because all other letters were ruled out.

Wait – let’s list every still-possible letter for each slot:

Slot 1: any remaining letter (D, K, P, V, W)  
Slot 2: same set, but distinct from slot 1  
Slot 3: N (fixed)  
Slot 4: C (fixed)  
Slot 5: E (fixed)

We need a dictionary word fitting _ _ N C E.

Still-valid common 5-letter words ending in NCE:
- DUNCE – U ruled out
- PENCE – P, E, N, C, E: E repeats in position 2, which is allowed (we only know E is fixed in position 5)
- WINCE – W, I, N, C, E – I is ruled out
- VINCE – V, I, N, C, E – I is ruled out

Therefore the only remaining plausible word is PENCE.
