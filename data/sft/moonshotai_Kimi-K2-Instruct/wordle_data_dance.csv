- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in English 5-letter words. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possible letters.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""RAISE"" contains three of the top five most common letters (R, A, E, S) plus I. This gives good coverage of common letters in various positions.

Other good options would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""STARE"", but ""RAISE"" seems particularly effective because:
1. It uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters
2. It has both A and E, the two most common vowels
3. It positions S and E at the end, which is a common pattern in English words
4. It avoids less common consonants like Q, X, Z which are unlikely to appear

Therefore, ""RAISE"" is an optimal first guess to maximize information about the secret word.

Known fixed positions:  
_ A _ _ E   (A is 2nd letter, E is 5th letter)

Known letters **not** in the word (x):  
R, I, S, T, B, L

So the pattern is still _ A _ _ E  
Valid letters left to use: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z – but we want only common English letters.

We need three more letters from the remaining common set (C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P) to fill slots 1, 3, 4.

Likely candidates that fit the pattern and avoid all excluded letters:

- C A M E L – contains L (already eliminated)  
- D A N C E – C appears twice and N is new  
- F A C E D – C appears  
- G A M E D – G uncommon  
- H A N D E – H, N, D all new  
- M A N G E – G uncommon  
- P A N I C – I excluded  
- N A M E S – S excluded  
- C A N O E – O not yet tried, but we want a word with common remaining letters  
- H A N D E – good: H, N, D are all common and untested

""HANDE"" isn’t a valid English word.
