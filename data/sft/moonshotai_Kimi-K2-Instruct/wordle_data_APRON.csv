For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (but E is repeated in position 5)
- SLATE
- ROAST
- RAINS
- STARE

Looking at STARE: it uses S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters with no repeats. This seems optimal as:
1. Tests S, T, A, R, E
2. Good consonant/vowel balance
3. All letters are among top 10 most frequent
4. No duplicate letters

From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So:
1. Eliminate S, T, E completely.
2. A and R are in the word, but they are NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. We have not yet tested the common letters N, I, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Next guess choices:
- Use A and R again, but in different positions.
- Include several new common letters.
- Avoid S, T, E entirely.

Good candidates:
- ARIEL – uses A and R in new spots, plus new letters I, E, L – but E has already been ruled out.
- RAINY – uses A and R in new spots, plus I and N.
- CAROL – uses A and R in new spots, plus C, O, L.
- RADIO – uses A and R in new spots, plus D, I, O.

Letters left to test that are still possible: A, O plus any new common letters we haven’t tried yet (I, N, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.).

Since A and O are already confirmed present, we need to place:
- A somewhere NOT in position 2.
- O somewhere NOT in position 4.
- R is fixed in position 3.

A good word to test next should:
- Keep R in position 3.
- Place A in a new allowed position (1, 3, 4, or 5; but 3 is R, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Place O in a new allowed position (1, 2, 3, or 5; but 3 is R, so 1, 2, or 5).

- Keep R in position 3.
- Place A in a new allowed position (1, 3, 4, or 5; but 3 is R, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Place O in a new allowed position (1, 2, 3, or 5; but 3 is R, so 1, 2, or 5).
- Introduce several new high-frequency letters.

Candidates:
- AROMA – but M not yet tested, A in 1 and 5, O in 2 – fits rules, but repeats A (might be acceptable).
- RADIO – already tried D and I in CAROL? No, CAROL was C A R O L – D and I are fresh.
- RADIO keeps R in 3, A in 2? A can't be in 2 (from STARE feedback), so A must be elsewhere.
- RADIO: R A D I O – A in 2 is invalid. Next:
- AROMA: A R O M A – A in 1 and 5 (allowed), O in 3 is occupied by R, so no – O must be elsewhere.
- ORGAN: O R G A N – O in 1, R in 2, but R must be in 3 – no.
- MORAL: M O R A L – R is in 3 (correct), O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), M and L – L is out.  
- BORAX: B O R A X – R in 3, O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), B and X new – but X is less common.
- ROACH: R is in 3 – no, R must be in 3, but word starts R, so R in 1 – conflict.

Good one is ""MORAL"" but L is out.  
Next best seems ""HORAY"": H O R A Y – R in 3, O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), H and Y new.  
But ""HORAY"" is 5 letters? Yes.  
Another: ""FORAY"": F O R A Y – R in 3, O in 2 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), F and Y new.

""FORAY"" is a valid word.  
Let's pick FORAY.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, C, L, F, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: R (position 3), A, O  
Positions of A and O are still unknown, but we know:
- A is not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from STARE and CAROL and FORAY)
- O is not in positions 2 or 4 (from CAROL and FORAY)

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _  
With A and O somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 5 for both letters)

This means the word must be A _ R O _ or O _ R A _ or _ _ R A O or _ _ R O A, but since we have only 5 letters and R is fixed at position 3, possible patterns are:
- A _ R O _ (position 1=A, 4=O)
- O _ R A _ (position 1=O, 4=A)
- _ A R O _ (but A can't be in 2)
- _ O R A _ (but O can't be in 2)
- A _ R _ O (position 1=A, 5=O)
- O _ R _ A (position 1=O, 5=A)

So possible patterns are:
1. A _ R O _
2. O _ R A _
3. A _ R _ O
4. O _ R _ A

Now we need to fill in the blanks with letters we haven't used yet, avoiding S,T,E,C,L,F,Y.

Good consonants still possible: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's think of words that fit these patterns:
- A D R O P - but P is new
- A G R O W - but GROW is a word, AGRON? Not valid
- O B R A D - not a word
- O B R A G - not a word
- A M R O N - not a word
- O M R A N - not a word
- A B R O A - not a word
- O B R A D - not a word

Looking at pattern 1: A _ R O _
Possible: A D R O P? Not a valid word
A P R O N - A P R O N is a valid word!

Let's check if this fits:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- P is new
- R fixed in 3
- O in position 4 (allowed - wasn't forbidden here)
- N is new

This seems valid. Let's try APRON.
</think>

Based on the constraints:
- R is fixed in position 3
- A is in the word but not positions 2,3,4 → must be 1 or 5
- O is in the word but not positions 2,4 → must be 1,3,5 (3 is R) → 1 or 5
- So A and O are in positions 1 and 5 in some order
- Valid letter choices: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

The pattern must be either:
A _ R O _ or O _ R A _

Testing ""APRON"":
- A in position 1 (valid)
- P new (unused)
- R in 3 (correct)
- O in 4 (valid - wasn't tested in position 4)
- N new (unused)
