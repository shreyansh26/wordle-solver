Since this is the first guess, we have no feedback from previous guesses to go on. The goal is to pick a word that has a good chance of revealing useful information about the secret word. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize information gained)
3. Be a common 5-letter word to ensure it's valid

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters in English
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid word
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)

This gives us maximum coverage to detect which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the word definitely contains E, but E is NOT at the end.  
We must avoid A, R, O, S.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known letter E and move it to a new position (not #5).
2. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Use five distinct new letters.

Candidate common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, Y, H, G, B, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other common consonants and vowels.  
A classic high-frequency word that hasn’t used any of the eliminated letters and includes E is “UNTIE”:
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5), so that’s invalid.

Next choice: “ELITE” – contains two E’s (bad).

Another: “INLET” – uses I, N, L, E, T – all fresh letters, E in position 4.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, G, U, M
2. Letter E is in the word and is in position 2 (from feedback ""E(✓)"" in BEGUM, where E is letter 2).

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters (C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: E
- Positions 3-5: unknown, must be from remaining letters (and different from each other and from E)

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Uses only the remaining letters above
- Avoids all already-eliminated letters

Possible words:
- CEDAR – but R is eliminated
- FEVER – V allowed, F and V and R (R eliminated)
- DEBUT – U and B and T eliminated
- PECAN – A, N, C
- VEXED – X allowed, D allowed
- KEPXI – not a valid word

""HEXED"" – H, E, X, E, D – same issue
""FUMED"" – U and M eliminated
""CHEEK"" – C, H, E, E, K – E twice, K allowed but word invalid

""FEWER"" – W allowed, F, W, R (R eliminated)
""DECKS"" – S eliminated
""PECKS"" – S eliminated
""HEXES"" – S eliminated
""CHECK"" – C, H, E, C, K – uses C twice but valid word? CHECK is valid and has C twice but we don't know if C is allowed twice. However, since we haven't eliminated C, and the letters are C, H, E, C, K – E is in correct position 2. All other letters C, H, K are still possible.

But CHECK has:
- C (new letter, not eliminated)
- H (new letter, not eliminated)
- E (correct, position 2)
- C (allowed since no info on repetition)
- K (new letter, not eliminated)

No eliminated letters are used. CHECK seems valid.

Another candidate: HEFTY – but T and Y, and T eliminated
Another: PECKY – P, E, C, K, Y – all letters allowed (C, K, P, Y not eliminated), E in position 2. PECKY is a valid word (slang for ""annoyed"")

Between CHECK and PECKY, both fit the pattern, but PECKY uses more new letters (P, C, K, Y) where CHECK repeats C. Let's go with PECKY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no feedback from previous guesses to go on. The goal is to pick a word that has a good chance of revealing useful information about the secret word. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize information gained)
3. Be a common 5-letter word to ensure it's valid

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters in English
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid word
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)

This gives us maximum coverage to detect which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the word definitely contains E, but E is NOT at the end.  
We must avoid A, R, O, S.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known letter E and move it to a new position (not #5).
2. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Use five distinct new letters.

Candidate common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, Y, H, G, B, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other common consonants and vowels.  
A classic high-frequency word that hasn’t used any of the eliminated letters and includes E is “UNTIE”:
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5), so that’s invalid.

Next choice: “ELITE” – contains two E’s (bad).

Another: “INLET” – uses I, N, L, E, T – all fresh letters, E in position 4.

Let’s stick with INLET.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T  
Letter that IS in the word but not in position 5: E (and not in position 4 either, since it was marked “-” in spot 4 in INLET)

Available letters (common ones): D, U, C, Y, G, B, F, H, M, P, V, W, K, etc.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses the letter E, but not in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.
- Uses as many new common consonants as possible.

Trying to place E in position 2 or 3:  
- E _ _ _ _  
- _ E _ _ _  
- _ _ E _ _

A good candidate is “DEMOB” but “DEMOB” isn’t terribly common.  
Another: “BEGUM” — uses B, E, G, U, M.  
All letters are fresh; E is in position 2.

Let’s go with BEGUM.

(Quick check: B, E, G, U, M; none forbidden letters; E in position 2.)

Key facts extracted:
1. E is in position 2 (from Guess 3 and 4 both showing E✓ in slot 2).
2. Letters now known NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, G, U, M, P, C, K

3. Letters remaining and still allowed:

4. From Guess 4 we also learned:  
   Y is in the word, and it is in position 5 (because the last letter of PECKY got ✓).

So the current pattern is:
_ E _ _ Y

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- has E in slot 2 and Y in slot 5,
- uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, G, U, M, P, C, K),
- and has three distinct consonants for the blanks.

Candidate letters left for positions 1, 3, 4: D, F, H, V, W.

Scanning the mental dictionary, the only common word that fits is:
D E F T Y  – but DEFTY is not a valid dictionary word.
D E W Y _  – nothing good.
F E W _ Y – but needs 3rd letter.
H E W _ Y – same issue.

Actually the only real word that works is:
D E F T Y  – DEFTY is not a recognized word.

Wait – DEFTY is not valid.  
Let’s try:  
F E W D Y – not valid.  
D E W F Y – not valid.  
H E F T Y – HEFTY … but T is already eliminated (from earlier x’s).  

The only valid word left that fits _ E _ _ Y with allowed letters is:
D E W Y _  – still missing.

Hmm, the valid word that uses only D, E, F, H, V, W, Y is:
H E F T Y – invalid (T gone).  
F E W D Y – not a word.  

Wait, there is “VEWXY” – not a word.  

Realizing I must have missed a candidate.  
Let me systematically try all consonant triplets from {D, F, H, V, W}.

- D, F, H, V, W ⇒ permute three for positions 1, 3, 4.

Trying the first possibility:

1) D _ _ _ Y  
   D E D _ Y – repeated D invalid.  
   D E F _ Y → D E F T Y – T eliminated.  
   D E _ _ Y → D E F H Y – not a word.

Possible words:

H E D F Y – not a word.  
H E F D Y – not a word.  

The only valid word I can construct with remaining letters is:
H E X Y _ – no.  

Actually, the correct realization:  
The remaining letters are D, F, H, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The only valid 5-letter English word with E in position 2 and Y in position 5 is:
H E _ _ Y → “HEXED”  
HEXED: H E X E D – has two E’s, but E is already confirmed and repetition of E is allowed.  
Letters used: H, E, X, E, D – none of the eliminated letters appear.  
It’s a dictionary word.

Therefore, HEXED is a valid next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WEEDY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, we have no feedback from previous guesses to go on. The goal is to pick a word that has a good chance of revealing useful information about the secret word. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize information gained)
3. Be a common 5-letter word to ensure it's valid

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters in English
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid word
- It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)

This gives us maximum coverage to detect which letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the word definitely contains E, but E is NOT at the end.  
We must avoid A, R, O, S.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the known letter E and move it to a new position (not #5).
2. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet (T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.).
3. Use five distinct new letters.

Candidate common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, Y, H, G, B, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other common consonants and vowels.  
A classic high-frequency word that hasn’t used any of the eliminated letters and includes E is “UNTIE”:
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5), so that’s invalid.

Next choice: “ELITE” – contains two E’s (bad).

Another: “INLET” – uses I, N, L, E, T – all fresh letters, E in position 4.

Let’s stick with INLET.

<guess>inlet</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T  
Letter that IS in the word but not in position 5: E (and not in position 4 either, since it was marked “-” in spot 4 in INLET)

Available letters (common ones): D, U, C, Y, G, B, F, H, M, P, V, W, K, etc.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses the letter E, but not in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.
- Uses as many new common consonants as possible.

Trying to place E in position 2 or 3:  
- E _ _ _ _  
- _ E _ _ _  
- _ _ E _ _

A good candidate is “DEMOB” but “DEMOB” isn’t terribly common.  
Another: “BEGUM” — uses B, E, G, U, M.  
All letters are fresh; E is in position 2.

Let’s go with BEGUM.

(Quick check: B, E, G, U, M; none forbidden letters; E in position 2.)

<guess>begum</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: begum -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, G, U, M
2. Letter E is in the word and is in position 2 (from feedback ""E(✓)"" in BEGUM, where E is letter 2).

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown, must be from remaining letters (C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 2: E
- Positions 3-5: unknown, must be from remaining letters (and different from each other and from E)

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Uses only the remaining letters above
- Avoids all already-eliminated letters

Possible words:
- CEDAR – but R is eliminated
- FEVER – V allowed, F and V and R (R eliminated)
- DEBUT – U and B and T eliminated
- PECAN – A, N, C
- VEXED – X allowed, D allowed
- KEPXI – not a valid word

Looking for valid dictionary words... ""PEWED"" has P, E, W, E, D – uses E twice (invalid)
""HEXED"" – H, E, X, E, D – same issue
""FUMED"" – U and M eliminated
""CHEEK"" – C, H, E, E, K – E twice, K allowed but word invalid
""DECKY"" – not valid
""WELCH"" – L eliminated
""PEKED"" – P, E, K, E, D – E twice
""HEXER"" – R eliminated
""KEVEL"" – L eliminated
""HEVEA"" – A eliminated
""PEWEE"" – multiple E's and invalid repetition
""CELEB"" – B, L eliminated
""DEIFY"" – I, F, Y – but I is eliminated
""FEWER"" – W allowed, F, W, R (R eliminated)
""DECKS"" – S eliminated
""PECKS"" – S eliminated
""HEXES"" – S eliminated
""CHECK"" – C, H, E, C, K – uses C twice but valid word? CHECK is valid and has C twice but we don't know if C is allowed twice. However, since we haven't eliminated C, and the letters are C, H, E, C, K – E is in correct position 2. All other letters C, H, K are still possible.

But CHECK has:
- C (new letter, not eliminated)
- H (new letter, not eliminated)
- E (correct, position 2)
- C (allowed since no info on repetition)
- K (new letter, not eliminated)

No eliminated letters are used. CHECK seems valid.

Another candidate: HEFTY – but T and Y, and T eliminated
Another: PECKY – P, E, C, K, Y – all letters allowed (C, K, P, Y not eliminated), E in position 2. PECKY is a valid word (slang for ""annoyed"")

Between CHECK and PECKY, both fit the pattern, but PECKY uses more new letters (P, C, K, Y) where CHECK repeats C. Let's go with PECKY.We now know:
- The secret word has **E** in position 2.
- The letters **A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, B, G, U, M** are *not* in the word.
- Remaining available letters: **C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y** (and others not yet ruled out).

A valid 5-letter word that:
- Has **E** as the second letter,
- Uses only still-allowed letters,
- Avoids all eliminated letters,

is **PECKY**.

H E _ _ Y.

Possible words:  
H E D G Y – G gone.  
H E D F Y – not a word.  
H E F D Y – not a word.  

The only valid word I can construct with remaining letters is:
H E X Y _ – no.  

Actually, the correct realization:

The only valid 5-letter English word with E in position 2 and Y in position 5 is:
H E _ _ Y → “HEXED”  
HEXED: H E X E D – has two E’s, but E is already confirmed and repetition of E is allowed.

Known facts about the word  
- Position 2 = E (✓ in guesses 3-5)  
- Position 5 = Y (✓ in guess 4)  
- Position 1: cannot be H (x in HEXED)  
- Position 3: cannot be X (x in HEXED)  
- Position 4: cannot be D, and cannot be E (both marked – or x)

Therefore the pattern is

Allowed letters still unused  
F, V, W, Z (plus Q, J, etc. but they don’t combine into a word)

Create a 5-letter word meeting:

Valid English words fitting _ E _ _ Y:
- F E V E Y – invalid (double E and not a word)

- V E W E Y – invalid  
- F E W F Y – invalid  
- V E F F Y – invalid

There is a real word **FEWZY** (rare but valid), but it contains Z and duplicates.

Wait – the only remaining real word I can form is **FEWZY** (slang for messy hair).  
It uses F, E, W, Z, Y – none of the eliminated letters.

So the next logical guess is FEWZY.
