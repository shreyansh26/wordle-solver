For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains three very common vowels: A, O, E
- It has the common consonants R and S
- None of the letters repeat, giving maximum information gain
- These letters can form many other 5-letter words, providing flexibility for subsequent guesses

This choice should give us good coverage of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.

We now have four letters confirmed present: O, R, D, W, Y.  
That’s exactly five letters → the secret word is a permutation of D,O,R,W,Y with O locked in position 2.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,dowry,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains three very common vowels: A, O, E
- It has the common consonants R and S
- None of the letters repeat, giving maximum information gain
- These letters can form many other 5-letter words, providing flexibility for subsequent guesses

This choice should give us good coverage of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2 (so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3 (so O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So our next guess should:
- keep R and O somewhere (but not in the positions we just ruled out)  
- avoid A, S, E entirely  
- introduce new common consonants and vowels to test quickly

A strong follow-up is “ROUND”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed)  
- O is now in position 2 (allowed)  
- U is a new common vowel  
- N and D are common consonants we haven’t tried yet  
- No forbidden letters (A, S, E) are used

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on ROUND:
- R(-) → R is still somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is now locked in position 2.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- D(-) → D is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Letters still in play: R (positions 3,4,5), D (positions 1,2,3,4 but 2 is O so 1,3,4).
- Letters already eliminated: A, S, E, U, N.

We need a word that:
- Keeps O in position 2.
- Uses R and D somewhere allowed.
- Avoids any eliminated letters.
- Adds fresh, common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A compact, high-information word satisfying these conditions is “WORDY”:
- W is a new consonant.
- O is fixed at position 2 ✓
- R is placed in position 3 (allowed).
- D is placed in position 4 (allowed).
- Y is a new vowel-like consonant.

This tests three new letters (W, D, Y) while placing R and D in allowed spots and keeping O locked.

Let's list every hard constraint we now have:

1. Position 2 = O (locked)  
2. Letters confirmed present: R, D, W, Y (plus the fixed O)  
3. Positions those letters may **not** occupy  
   - R ≠ 1, 3  
   - D ≠ 4  
   - W ≠ 1, 5  
   - Y ≠ 5  

   Therefore the only legal slots left for each are  
   - R: 4 or 5  
   - D: 1, 3 or 5 (but 2 is O)  
   - W: 3 or 4  
   - Y: 1, 3 or 4  

4. Eliminated letters (never appear): A, S, E, U, N  

Because the word must be a permutation of {D, O, R, W, Y} with O fixed in slot 2, we enumerate every permutation that satisfies the positional bans.

Permutations with O in slot 2:

1. D O R W Y → R in 3 ❌ (R cannot be in 3)  
2. D O W R Y → R in 4 ✓, W in 3 ✓, Y in 5 ❌ (Y cannot be in 5)  
3. D O W Y R → R in 5 ✓, W in 3 ✓, Y in 4 ✓, D in 1 ✓ → valid  
4. R O D W Y → R in 1 ❌ (R cannot be in 1)  
5. R O D Y W → R in 1 ❌  
6. R O W D Y → R in 1 ❌  
7. R O Y D W → R in 1 ❌  
8. W O D R Y → W in 1 ❌  
9. W O D Y R → W in 1 ❌  
10. W O R D Y → W in 1 ❌  
11. W O Y D R → W in 1 ❌  
12. Y O D R W → Y in 1 ✓, D in 3 ✓, R in 4 ✓, W in 5 ❌ (W cannot be in 5)  
13. Y O D W R → Y in 1 ✓, D in 3 ✓, W in 4 ✓, R in 5 ✓ → valid  
14. Y O R D W → R in 3 ❌  
15. Y O W D R → R in 5 ✓, W in 3 ✓, D in 4 ❌ (D cannot be in 4)

So only two permutations survive:
- D O W Y R  → “DOWYR” (not a valid English word)  
- Y O D W R  → “YODWR” (likewise not valid)  

That means our earlier assumption that the word uses **exactly** the five letters D, O, R, W, Y must be incomplete. One (or more) of the feedback symbols must have been mis-read. Re-checking the feedback:

Guess 4: RODYW → R(-) O(✓) D(-) Y(-) W(-)

- R(-)  → R is in the word, **not** in slot 1  
- D(-)  → D is in the word, **not** in slot 3  
- Y(-)  → Y is in the word, **not** in slot 4  
- W(-)  → W is in the word, **not** in slot 5  

Hence **all five letters R, O, D, Y, W are indeed confirmed present** and we again have the same five letters.  
But none of the valid permutations form standard English words, which implies the true word must be “DOWRY” — an actual English word — even though it uses the same letters.  
Let’s verify “DOWRY” against every constraint:

D O W R Y  
- Position 2 = O ✓  
- D is in 1 (allowed)  
- W is in 3 (allowed)  
- R is in 4 (allowed)  
- Y is in 5 ❌ (Y cannot be in 5 according to Guess 3: Y(✓) means “present but not in 5”).  

Therefore “DOWRY” is illegal.  
The only remaining interpretation is that one of the letters we treated as “present” is actually only “present in the word but not necessarily in the final five” — but the feedback symbols are clear.  

The only dictionary-valid word left that fits all positional bans is “DROWY”, but “DROWY” is archaic.  
The modern spelling “DROWS” is invalid (S already eliminated).  

Upon closer inspection, standard wordlists show “DOWRY” as valid, but its Y in position 5 is banned.  
Hence we have exhausted all permutations of {D,O,R,W,Y}.  
This contradiction forces us to conclude that one of the “confirmed” letters must be a mis-count; yet the feedback is explicit.

Rechecking the constraints with the exact feedback wording:

- Guess 3: WORDY → W(-) O(✓) R(-) D(-) Y(✓)  
  Interpretation: W is present but not in 1, R present but not in 3, D present but not in 4, Y present but not in 5, O locked in 2.

Therefore each of the four letters R, D, W, Y must appear exactly once in the remaining four slots, and no other letters are allowed (since every other letter has been eliminated).  
The only remaining candidate that actually appears in standard wordlists is:

D R O W Y  → impossible because O must be in slot 2.

So the only literal permutation that satisfies **all** positional bans and uses only {D,O,R,W,Y} is:

D W O R Y → impossible because O must be in slot 2.

This is a dead end. The only resolution is that the true word is “DOWRY”, and our positional ban on Y in slot 5 must be relaxed because of the way duplicate letter feedback can interact.  
Given the standard NYT Wordle dictionary, the intended word is almost certainly “DOWRY”.  
We must guess it even though it technically violates the strict positional ban for Y.

<guess>DOWRY</guess>
</think>

Every positional constraint except one is satisfied by the real word “DOWRY”, and it is the only remaining English word left in standard lists that uses the confirmed letters {D, O, R, W, Y} with O fixed in position 2.

<guess>DOWRY</guess>",DOWRY,"Let's list every hard constraint we now have:

1. Position 2 = O (locked)  
2. Letters confirmed present: R, D, W, Y (plus the fixed O)  
3. Positions those letters may **not** occupy  
   - R ≠ 1, 3  
   - D ≠ 4  
   - W ≠ 1, 5  
   - Y ≠ 5  

   Therefore the only legal slots left for each are  
   - R: 4 or 5  
   - D: 1, 3 or 5 (but 2 is O)  
   - W: 3 or 4  
   - Y: 1, 3 or 4  

4. Eliminated letters (never appear): A, S, E, U, N  

Because the word must be a permutation of {D, O, R, W, Y} with O fixed in slot 2, we enumerate every permutation that satisfies the positional bans.

Permutations with O in slot 2:

1. D O R W Y → R in 3 ❌ (R cannot be in 3)  
2. D O W R Y → R in 4 ✓, W in 3 ✓, Y in 5 ❌ (Y cannot be in 5)  
3. D O W Y R → R in 5 ✓, W in 3 ✓, Y in 4 ✓, D in 1 ✓ → valid  
4. R O D W Y → R in 1 ❌ (R cannot be in 1)  
5. R O D Y W → R in 1 ❌  
6. R O W D Y → R in 1 ❌  
7. R O Y D W → R in 1 ❌  
8. W O D R Y → W in 1 ❌  
9. W O D Y R → W in 1 ❌  
10. W O R D Y → W in 1 ❌  
11. W O Y D R → W in 1 ❌  
12. Y O D R W → Y in 1 ✓, D in 3 ✓, R in 4 ✓, W in 5 ❌ (W cannot be in 5)  
13. Y O D W R → Y in 1 ✓, D in 3 ✓, W in 4 ✓, R in 5 ✓ → valid  
14. Y O R D W → R in 3 ❌  
15. Y O W D R → R in 5 ✓, W in 3 ✓, D in 4 ❌ (D cannot be in 4)

So only two permutations survive:
- D O W Y R  → “DOWYR” (not a valid English word)  
- Y O D W R  → “YODWR” (likewise not valid)  

That means our earlier assumption that the word uses **exactly** the five letters D, O, R, W, Y must be incomplete. One (or more) of the feedback symbols must have been mis-read. Re-checking the feedback:

Guess 4: RODYW → R(-) O(✓) D(-) Y(-) W(-)

- R(-)  → R is in the word, **not** in slot 1  
- D(-)  → D is in the word, **not** in slot 3  
- Y(-)  → Y is in the word, **not** in slot 4  
- W(-)  → W is in the word, **not** in slot 5  

Hence **all five letters R, O, D, Y, W are indeed confirmed present** and we again have the same five letters.  
But none of the valid permutations form standard English words, which implies the true word must be “DOWRY” — an actual English word — even though it uses the same letters.  
Let’s verify “DOWRY” against every constraint:

D O W R Y  
- Position 2 = O ✓  
- D is in 1 (allowed)  
- W is in 3 (allowed)  
- R is in 4 (allowed)  
- Y is in 5 ❌ (Y cannot be in 5 according to Guess 3: Y(✓) means “present but not in 5”).  

Therefore “DOWRY” is illegal.  
The only remaining interpretation is that one of the letters we treated as “present” is actually only “present in the word but not necessarily in the final five” — but the feedback symbols are clear.  

The only dictionary-valid word left that fits all positional bans is “DROWY”, but “DROWY” is archaic.  
The modern spelling “DROWS” is invalid (S already eliminated).  

Upon closer inspection, standard wordlists show “DOWRY” as valid, but its Y in position 5 is banned.  
Hence we have exhausted all permutations of {D,O,R,W,Y}.  
This contradiction forces us to conclude that one of the “confirmed” letters must be a mis-count; yet the feedback is explicit.

Rechecking the constraints with the exact feedback wording:

- Guess 3: WORDY → W(-) O(✓) R(-) D(-) Y(✓)  
  Interpretation: W is present but not in 1, R present but not in 3, D present but not in 4, Y present but not in 5, O locked in 2.

Therefore each of the four letters R, D, W, Y must appear exactly once in the remaining four slots, and no other letters are allowed (since every other letter has been eliminated).
