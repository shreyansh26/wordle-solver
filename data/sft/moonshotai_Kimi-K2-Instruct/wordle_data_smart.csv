For the first guess, I want to use a word that has common letters to help narrow down the possibilities quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, a strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Other good starting words could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""IRATE"", but ""AROSE"" has a good balance of vowels and consonants while covering many high-frequency letters.

The feedback from AROSE:
A(-) – letter A exists in the word but is NOT in position 1.
R(-) – letter R exists in the word but is NOT in position 2.
O(x) – letter O is NOT in the word at all.
S(-) – letter S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4.
E(x) – letter E is NOT in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the secret word: O, E  
Letters that ARE somewhere in the secret word: A, R, S  
Positions we can exclude for these letters:
A cannot be in spot 1.
R cannot be in spot 2.
S cannot be in spot 4.

So the secret word is 5 letters long, contains A, R, and S (each exactly once, since the feedback shows only one dash per letter), and does not contain O or E.

I’ll choose a new word that:
- uses A, R, S in different positions from those excluded,
- avoids O and E,
- adds fresh common letters (T, N, I, L, etc.) to gain more information.

A good candidate: “TRAIN”

- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 again (from TRAIN).  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and no new restriction from TRAIN.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, a strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Other good starting words could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""IRATE"", but ""AROSE"" has a good balance of vowels and consonants while covering many high-frequency letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
A(-) – letter A exists in the word but is NOT in position 1.
R(-) – letter R exists in the word but is NOT in position 2.
O(x) – letter O is NOT in the word at all.
S(-) – letter S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4.
E(x) – letter E is NOT in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the secret word: O, E  
Letters that ARE somewhere in the secret word: A, R, S  
Positions we can exclude for these letters:
A cannot be in spot 1.
R cannot be in spot 2.
S cannot be in spot 4.

So the secret word is 5 letters long, contains A, R, and S (each exactly once, since the feedback shows only one dash per letter), and does not contain O or E.

I’ll choose a new word that:
- uses A, R, S in different positions from those excluded,
- avoids O and E,
- adds fresh common letters (T, N, I, L, etc.) to gain more information.

A good candidate: “TRAIN”
- T (new)  
- R placed in spot 2 (different from spot 2 exclusion)  
- A placed in spot 3 (different from spot 1 exclusion)  
- I (new)  
- N (new)

This satisfies all constraints and should give us helpful new feedback.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have so far:

Guess 1: AROSE  
FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
– A, R, S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
– O, E are not in the word.  

Guess 2: TRAIN  
FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)  
– A is in the correct position (spot 3).  
– R is wrong position (spot 2).  
– T, I, N are not in the word.  

Combining information:
- The word contains A (fixed at position 3), R, and S.  
- Therefore the letters we must use are A, R, S plus two others that have not yet been ruled out.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, E, T, I, N.  

Remaining candidates for the two extra letters: from the alphabet, skipping O, E, T, I, N.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Positions for R and S:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 again (from TRAIN).  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and no new restriction from TRAIN.  

A good third guess should rearrange R and S into the remaining positions not yet excluded and introduce two new unused letters. Let’s pick C and L.

One valid arrangement:  
S _ A R _  (S in 1, A locked in 3, R in 4)  
Only need letters for 2 and 5.  
Choose C and L.

Constructing: S C A R L → does not work because L at 5 is fine, C at 2 is fine, but we need to check word validity. SCARL is not a valid English 5-letter word.

Try: C A R L S → not valid.

Try: C L A R S → valid word “CLARS” is obscure (plural of clart/clar? probably not).

Try: S C A R L → no.

Try: S P A R K – but K hasn’t been used and is available.  
Letters: S (ok), P (new), A (fixed), R (ok), K (new).  
Does it satisfy positions?
- S cannot be at 4 – ok, here S is at 1.  
- R cannot be at 2 – ok, here R is at 4.  
- A is at 3 – ok.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,smart,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to use a word that has common letters to help narrow down the possibilities quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should use several of these.

Looking at these letters, a strong starting word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Other good starting words could include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""IRATE"", but ""AROSE"" has a good balance of vowels and consonants while covering many high-frequency letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
A(-) – letter A exists in the word but is NOT in position 1.
R(-) – letter R exists in the word but is NOT in position 2.
O(x) – letter O is NOT in the word at all.
S(-) – letter S exists in the word but is NOT in position 4.
E(x) – letter E is NOT in the word at all.

Letters we know are NOT in the secret word: O, E  
Letters that ARE somewhere in the secret word: A, R, S  
Positions we can exclude for these letters:
A cannot be in spot 1.
R cannot be in spot 2.
S cannot be in spot 4.

So the secret word is 5 letters long, contains A, R, and S (each exactly once, since the feedback shows only one dash per letter), and does not contain O or E.

I’ll choose a new word that:
- uses A, R, S in different positions from those excluded,
- avoids O and E,
- adds fresh common letters (T, N, I, L, etc.) to gain more information.

A good candidate: “TRAIN”
- T (new)  
- R placed in spot 2 (different from spot 2 exclusion)  
- A placed in spot 3 (different from spot 1 exclusion)  
- I (new)  
- N (new)

This satisfies all constraints and should give us helpful new feedback.

<guess>TRAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have so far:

Guess 1: AROSE  
FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
– A, R, S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
– O, E are not in the word.  

Guess 2: TRAIN  
FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)  
– A is in the correct position (spot 3).  
– R is wrong position (spot 2).  
– T, I, N are not in the word.  

Combining information:
- The word contains A (fixed at position 3), R, and S.  
- Therefore the letters we must use are A, R, S plus two others that have not yet been ruled out.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, E, T, I, N.  

Remaining candidates for the two extra letters: from the alphabet, skipping O, E, T, I, N.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Positions for R and S:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 again (from TRAIN).  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and no new restriction from TRAIN.  

A good third guess should rearrange R and S into the remaining positions not yet excluded and introduce two new unused letters. Let’s pick C and L.

One valid arrangement:  
S _ A R _  (S in 1, A locked in 3, R in 4)  
Only need letters for 2 and 5.  
Choose C and L.

Constructing: S C A R L → does not work because L at 5 is fine, C at 2 is fine, but we need to check word validity. SCARL is not a valid English 5-letter word.

Try: C A R L S → not valid.

Try: C L A R S → valid word “CLARS” is obscure (plural of clart/clar? probably not).

Try: S C A R L → no.

Try: S P A R K – but K hasn’t been used and is available.  
Letters: S (ok), P (new), A (fixed), R (ok), K (new).  
Does it satisfy positions?
- S cannot be at 4 – ok, here S is at 1.  
- R cannot be at 2 – ok, here R is at 4.  
- A is at 3 – ok.  

SPARK is a valid English word and uses only letters we know are allowed so far.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: SPARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(✓) R(✓) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

- Position 1: S(✓) → S is correct in position 1.
- Position 2: P(x) → P is not in the word.
- Position 3: A(✓) → A is correct in position 3.
- Position 4: R(✓) → R is correct in position 4.
- Position 5: K(x) → K is not in the word.

So far we have:
S _ A R _   (positions 1, 3, 4 are locked).

Letters we know are in the word: S, A, R.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, T, I, N, P, K.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out and not already used in the word (so far S, A, R are used once each).

Available letters (excluding O, E, T, I, N, P, K and the letters already used once: S, A, R):
From the alphabet we have left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need two distinct letters from these for positions 2 and 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ A R _:
- SCARF (F is allowed)
- SCARY (Y is allowed)
- SCALP (P already ruled out)
- SCARB (not a word)
- SCART (T ruled out)
- SCARE (E ruled out)
- SCARF seems valid: S C A R F.

All letters C and F are allowed and not yet used.

So the next guess is SCARF.

O, E, T, I, N, P, K, C, F

Available letters (excluding those above and the already-used S, A, R):
