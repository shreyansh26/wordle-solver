For the first guess, the goal is typically to maximize information gain by covering common letters and positions. A good starting word should include frequently used letters in English words, especially vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: Covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: Covers C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: Covers R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: Covers A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""AROSE"" is strong because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage of high-frequency letters in English words. 

Therefore, I'll start with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- S appears somewhere in the word but not at position 4 (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 are possible—but 5 is already E, so positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 5.
2. Contains S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O).

Commonly used letters still valid: S, T, I, N, L, D, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess would incorporate several of the remaining common letters while ensuring S is in a valid spot. ""STILE"" fits:
- S in position 1 (valid since S can be in position 1, 2, or 3)
- T, I, L are common letters not yet ruled out

Available letters to try in positions 2 and 4:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern S _ I _ E, using only the allowed letters.

Scrabble-style scan of common words:
- SKIVE (K, V) – K and V still allowed.
- SMIZE (M, Z) – M and Z still allowed.
- SWIVE (W, V) – W and V still allowed, but “swive” is archaic.
- SMITE – T is already ruled out.
- SNIPE – N and P already ruled out.
- SKITE – T ruled out.

“SKIVE” seems the most viable choice with two new common letters.

What we now know for certain:
- Word must be of the form S _ I _ E
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, L, H, N, P, C, K, V
- Still-valid letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Scanning the dictionary for S _ I _ E with only those allowed letters:

1. Position 2 options: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
2. Position 4 options: any of the same set, but must create a real English word.

Look at common words first:
- SWIPE – P is ruled out.
- SWIRE – archaic, unlikely.
- SMITE – T ruled out.
- SMILE – L ruled out.
- SMIZE – Z is allowed, and “smize” (smile with the eyes) is in some modern dictionaries.
- SWINE – N ruled out.
- SKIVE – K and V already ruled out in the last guess.
- SWIVE – archaic.
- SMIZE – already considered.

The only remaining plausible common word is SMIZE (S M I Z E).  
M and Z have not been tried in positions 2 and 4, respectively, and “smize” is a recognized modern term.

Next best alternative would be an uncommon word like SWIRE, but that’s less likely to be the intended answer.

Therefore, the logical next guess is SMIZE.
