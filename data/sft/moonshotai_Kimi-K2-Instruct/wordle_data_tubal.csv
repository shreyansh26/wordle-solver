For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This gives us the best chance of identifying which letters are in the secret word and which are not.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (another strong choice with common letters)
- AROSE (good vowel coverage)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's highly effective at testing common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) in one guess.

1. Word must contain A, but A cannot be in the second position.
2. Word cannot contain C, R, N, E.

- Place the known A in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Include several new, high-frequency consonants to maximize discovery.

Let’s digest the new information.

Previous constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, O.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (now confirmed in the 4th position).
- Letters that are in the word but not in the guessed positions: B, L, T.

So far we know the secret word looks like: _ _ _ A _
and it must contain B, L, and T exactly once each (because they each appeared once in BLOAT and were marked “-”, meaning they exist but were in the wrong spots).

That’s four distinct letters already identified: A (position 4), plus B, L, T somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We have one unknown slot left. The simplest plan is to test frequent unused consonants or vowels in that slot while permuting B, L, T into the available positions.

Candidate letters still untested and common: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good test word would:
1. Keep A in position 4.
2. Permute B, L, T among the remaining four slots.
3. Add one fresh high-frequency letter.

One such word is “TABLE” – but E is already ruled out.
Next possibility: “BLAST” – contains A in the right place and uses B, L, T but needs to check for the E (forbidden). Let’s see:

BLAST:
- B: slot 1 (was in slot 1 before, so “-” means it can’t be slot 1 again) – conflict, discard.

“TAB” + another pair: “TAB” plus two new letters. How about “TABID”? But 5 letters only. Permute into “ABILT” – not valid.

A quick valid permutation: “BALTI” – invalid (not a recognized word).

“BLOAT” already used. A working permutation is “BLATT” – invalid (double T not helpful).

Better: “TAB” + “F” + “L” -> “FABLE” – but E is out.

“TAB” + “I” + “L” -> “TIBAL” – not a common word.

Try “S” instead: “STABL” – not valid.

Try “G” instead: “GABLT” – invalid.

How about moving to another high-frequency consonant – “M”:
Permute: M, B, T, L around A in slot 4.

One valid permutation: “BLT” + “M” + “A” -> “BLTAM” – invalid.

Another permutation: “TABLM” – invalid.

Need a valid English 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 4.
- Contains B, L, T exactly once each (not yet placed).
- Uses one fresh letter not yet ruled out.

A valid candidate: “BELTA” – but E is out.

Next: “PLATB” – invalid.

Let’s list possible slots: positions 1,2,3,5 for B, L, T plus one new letter.

Try “STAB” + “L” -> “STABL” – invalid.

Try “PLAT” + “B” -> “PLATB” – invalid.

Look for actual words:
- “TAB” + “L” + “S” -> “BLAST” – but S is new, and positions: A is 4th, so:
  B L A S T – positions: 1,2,4,5 – but A is only in position 4, so T would be 5th, L 2nd, B 1st, S 3rd.

Check if BLAST fits constraints:
- B in 1st (was in 1st in BLOAT, feedback said “-” so B can’t be 1st) – conflict.

Another word: “BALMS” – but A is 2nd here, must be 4th.

“FLABS” – invalid.

“AMBLS” – invalid.

“LAMBS” – A is 2nd, must be 4th.

“TABID” – invalid.

“TABUN” – N is out.

“TABBY” – B twice, invalid.

“TABER” – E, R out.

“TABES” – E, S untested, but E out.

“A” is 4th, so:

“TAB” + “K” + “L” -> “TALKB” – invalid.

“TAB” + “I” + “L” -> “TIBAL” – invalid.

“TAB” + “U” + “L” -> “TUBAL” – valid word! Let’s check:

TUBAL:
- T (1) – not yet placed, possible.
- U (2) – new letter, fine.
- B (3) – new position.
- A (4) – correct.
- L (5) – new position.

No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, O), keeps A in 4th, and uses B, L, T in new positions.

Checks:
- B was in position 1 in BLOAT (marked “-”), so 3 is fine.
- L was in position 2 in BLOAT (marked “-”), so 5 is fine.
- T was in position 5 in BLOAT (marked “-”), so 1 is fine.
