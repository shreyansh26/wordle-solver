For the first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word that includes frequently appearing letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. The word should also not repeat letters to cover more possibilities. ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent starting word because it contains the five most common letters in English: A, R, O, S, E. However, since I need to make a single first guess, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it checks these boxes.

We know:
- E is in the word and is in the exact last position (position 5).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, and none of the letters A, R, O, S may appear.

To maximize information on the second guess, I should choose a word that:
1. Ends in E (to lock the known letter).
2. Uses other highly common letters that have not yet been tested (like T, N, L, I, C, D, M, etc.).
3. Does NOT use A, R, O, S.

A good candidate is “INLET”:
- Ends with E.
- Uses I, N, L, T, all common and untested so far.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.

Another solid choice is “UNTIE,” but since E must be in position 5, “UNTIE” would be rejected (it ends in E but does not have E as the last letter). “INLET” satisfies the positional constraint.

We now have two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: INLET → I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(x)  
- Because the second E received (-), it means the letter E is in the word but is NOT in position 2.  
  (We already knew from Guess 1 that E is in position 5, so this is consistent.)  
- I, N, L, T are not in the word at all.

So the constraints are:
- Word ends with E.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T.
- We have three unfilled positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to pick a 5-letter word ending in E that uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Common remaining consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out include: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s build a candidate:
- Position 5: E (fixed).
- Need three new letters for positions 1-3.

A frequent consonant combination would be “C, H, U” giving “CHU_E”.

Let's summarize what we know after the three guesses.

1. Positional info
   - 5th letter is E (from Guess 1 and confirmed by Guess 3).

2. Letters ruled out
   A, R, O, S, I, N, L, T, C, U.

3. Letters we have not yet ruled out and their tentative positions
   Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, G, M, P, W, Y plus the vowels E (already used at end) and possibly others.

4. Hints from Guess 3
   - The letter H appears in CHUTE and received (-) – it is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   Therefore H must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

5. Pattern so far
   _ _ _ _ E

We now need a 5-letter English word that:
   - Ends in E.
   - Contains H somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 4.
   - Uses only letters from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, H, M, P, W, Y} plus E at the end.

Trying the H in position 3:
   _ _ H _ E   →  A common word is “G H O S T” – but O and S are ruled out.
   Next try “F _ H _ E”  →  “F U H _ E”  – U is ruled out.

Trying H in position 1:
   H _ _ _ E   →  “H O M E” – but O is ruled out.
   “H E D G E” – E already used in position 5; HEDGE has two E’s, which is acceptable because the feedback never said “only one E”.  However, letters D and G have not been eliminated.

Trying H in position 4:
   _ _ _ H E   →  “B U S H E” – U and S ruled out.
   “M O S H E” – O and S ruled out.
   “G R A P H E” – too long.

Another check: “HEDGE”
   - Ends in E ✓
   - Letters: H, E, D, G, E – only H, D, G have not been ruled out.
   - It is a valid English word.

Therefore HEDGE satisfies all constraints and uses new letters.
