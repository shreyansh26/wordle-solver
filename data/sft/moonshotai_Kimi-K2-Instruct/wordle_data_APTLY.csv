For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has commonly used letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most frequent. A good starting word should include a mix of these letters without repeating any. One classic choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will help me quickly identify or eliminate several key letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1, so the word starts with A.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Since A is locked in the first spot, I now know the pattern is A _ _ _ _.  
I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Does not contain R, O, S, E
3. Uses new letters that haven't been tried yet.

Common remaining high-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, etc.  
Vowels left to try: I, U (since A is used, and O, E are ruled out).

Good candidate: “AINTY” – but Y may be less common.  
Better: “ADMIT” – uses D, M, I, T (all new) and starts with A.

Let’s go with ADMIT.

Summary of what we know:

1. Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, I
3. Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Letters still available (high-frequency ones in bold): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T cannot be in position 5, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- A T _ _ _
- A _ T _ _
- A _ _ T _

Let’s pick a word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains T in positions 2 or 3
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Uses common letters

Good candidate: “ATMAN” – but N hasn’t been tested yet, and M is already ruled out.  
Next: “AUGHT” – but U and G are fine, H too, but T is in position 5 (invalid).  
Better: “ALTAR” – but R is ruled out.  
Next candidate: “ANTSY” – S is ruled out.  
Another: “ANKLE” – E is ruled out.  
Another: “ACTOR” – O, R ruled out.  
Another: “AWFUL” – F and U are okay, L is okay, but W hasn’t been tested yet.  
Another: “ACUTE” – E ruled out.  
Another: “ANGLE” – E ruled out.  
Another: “APHID” – D ruled out.  
Another: “AFTON” – O ruled out.  
Another: “APTLY” – P, T, L, Y are all okay.
