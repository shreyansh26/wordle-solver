For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters and ideally include some vowels. 

Some popular starting words are ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

We just learned:

- R – exists in the word but is NOT in position 1  
- A – is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
- I, S, E – are NOT in the word at all  

So the pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

We still need to test other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (O, U) while never re-using I, S, or E.  
To cover new ground quickly, let’s pick a word whose letters we haven’t tried and that keeps A in the second slot. “TALON” gives us T, L, O, N and already satisfies _ A _ _ _.

TALON:
- T – new letter  
- A – already confirmed ✓ in position 2  
- L – new letter  
- O – new vowel  
- N – new letter  

No repeats of I, S, E, R (until we place R in a new position), so it’s a good next probe.

Remaining possible consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters and ideally include some vowels. \n\nSome popular starting words are ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:\n- R (very common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- I (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We just learned:\n\n- R – exists in the word but is NOT in position 1  \n- A – is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  \n- I, S, E – are NOT in the word at all  \n\nSo the pattern so far: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe still need to test other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (O, U) while never re-using I, S, or E.  \nTo cover new ground quickly, let’s pick a word whose letters we haven’t tried and that keeps A in the second slot. “TALON” gives us T, L, O, N and already satisfies _ A _ _ _.\n\nTALON:\n- T – new letter  \n- A – already confirmed ✓ in position 2  \n- L – new letter  \n- O – new vowel  \n- N – new letter  \n\nNo repeats of I, S, E, R (until we place R in a new position), so it’s a good next probe.\n\n<guess>TALON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: TALON -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n- T is correct in position 1: T A _ _ _\n- A is correct in position 2: T A _ _ _\n- O is correct in position 4: T A _ O _\n- Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): I, S, E, L, N\n- R is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 5.\n\nRemaining possible consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  \nRemaining possible vowels: U (A and O are already placed; I and E are ruled out)\n\nWe need to place R somewhere.

The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant.  The most common consonants left are C, D, G, B, M, etc.  “TACOR” is not a word.  “TABOR” is a valid English word (a small drum).\n\nBetween TAROK and TABOR, TABOR is more common.

Let’s recap what we now know for certain:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: T  
   - Position 2: A  
   - Position 4: O  

   So the word shape is: T A _ O _

2. Eliminated letters (not in the word at all):
   - I, S, E, L, N, B  
   - (R is in the word but cannot be in position 5, therefore must be in position 3)

3. Remaining valid pool:
   - Position 3: only R is possible (since R must be somewhere and positions 1,2,4,5 are already fixed or eliminated for it)
   - Position 5: any consonant that hasn’t been ruled out and makes a real word.

   The only consonants not yet eliminated from any position: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Real 5-letter English words that fit T A R O _ :
   - TAROK (already tried, valid word but not the answer)
   - TAROC (not a common English word)
   - TAROT (very common English word)

Since TAROK was rejected (feedback shows R not in position 5, and we already know R must be in position 3), the clear candidate left is TAROT.

Therefore, the logical next guess is TAROT.
