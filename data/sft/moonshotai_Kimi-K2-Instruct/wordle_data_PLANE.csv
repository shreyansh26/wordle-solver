For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet with our first guess.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters.

We now know:
- Pattern: P L A _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: A (in correct place), R, O, S, T, C
- Remaining letters that can fit position 4: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Among these, common English letters are D, G, H, K, M, N.

Potential candidates:
- PLADE – possible, but ""PLADE"" is not a common word.
- PLAGE – valid, but G is not strongly indicated.
- PLAKE – valid, but K is less likely.
- PLANE – valid and common.
- PLUME – uses U, but U is less likely in this pattern.
- PLIME – I is possible, but ""PLIME"" is uncommon.

The most likely and common word fitting the pattern is PLANE.

Let's check:
- P, L, A, E are correct positions.
- N has not been tested yet and is a common letter.

Thus, the next logical guess is PLANE.
