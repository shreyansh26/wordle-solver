For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A popular strategy is to use a word that includes several vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback on several common letters.

All five letters in SLATE — S, L, A, T, E — were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we should avoid those letters entirely in the next guess and try a new set of common consonants/vowels.

Good remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced word with different vowels/consonants is ideal.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all unused so far and fairly common.

Remaining common vowels: I, Y (Y can act as vowel)

We still have no positional information, so the safest next step is to pick a word containing a fresh set of high-frequency remaining letters.  
A good choice is “CHIMP”:  
- C, H, I, M, P — none of these have been tested yet, and together they cover four consonants and one vowel.

- Letters M and P are NOT in the word.

Letters already ruled out:

Remaining common letters (not yet used):
B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels we haven’t ruled out (only Y is still available since A, E, O, U are out, and I is already used).

Examples: CHICK, CHILD, CHILI, CHILL, CHIME (but M is out), CHINA, CHINO, CHINS, CHIRP (P is out), CHIVE, CHIVY.

- CHILD uses C, H, I, L, D → L and D already ruled out.
- CHILI uses C, H, I, L, I → L is out.

- CHIVE uses C, H, I, V, E → E is out.
- CHIVY uses C, H, I, V, Y → all letters are allowed (V and Y are still in play).

C, H, I are correct and in position.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,chick,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A popular strategy is to use a word that includes several vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback on several common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE — S, L, A, T, E — were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we should avoid those letters entirely in the next guess and try a new set of common consonants/vowels.

Good remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced word with different vowels/consonants is ideal.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all unused so far and fairly common.  
Another option could be “CHIRP” or “MOUND”, but “ROUND” strikes a nice balance.  
Let’s go with ROUND.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Two guesses have eliminated ten distinct letters:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D.  
That’s roughly 40 % of the alphabet gone.  

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining common vowels: I, Y (Y can act as vowel)

We still have no positional information, so the safest next step is to pick a word containing a fresh set of high-frequency remaining letters.  
A good choice is “CHIMP”:  
- C, H, I, M, P — none of these have been tested yet, and together they cover four consonants and one vowel.  

This should give us maximal new information on five untouched letters.

Guess 3: CHIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback, we know:
- The word starts with C, H, I in that exact order: C ✓ H ✓ I ✓ _ _
- Letters M and P are NOT in the word.

Letters already ruled out:
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D, M, P

Remaining common letters (not yet used):
B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels we haven’t ruled out (only Y is still available since A, E, O, U are out, and I is already used).

So we have:
C H I _ _
with the two blanks drawn from the set {B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with CHI.  
Examples: CHICK, CHILD, CHILI, CHILL, CHIME (but M is out), CHINA, CHINO, CHINS, CHIRP (P is out), CHIVE, CHIVY.

- CHICK uses C, H, I, C, K → C already used in first position; second C would duplicate, but we haven’t ruled out double letters.
- CHILD uses C, H, I, L, D → L and D already ruled out.
- CHILI uses C, H, I, L, I → L is out.
- CHILL uses C, H, I, L, L → L is out.
- CHINA uses C, H, I, N, A → N and A are out.
- CHINO uses C, H, I, N, O → N and O are out.
- CHINS uses C, H, I, N, S → N and S are out.
- CHIVE uses C, H, I, V, E → E is out.
- CHIVY uses C, H, I, V, Y → all letters are allowed (V and Y are still in play).

So CHIVY seems the only common word left that fits the constraints.

Let me verify:  
C, H, I are correct and in position.  
V and Y have not been ruled out.  
No disallowed letters (M, P, S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D) appear.

Thus, CHIVY is a valid guess.

We now know four facts:

1. The first three letters are fixed: C ✓ H ✓ I ✓ _ _
2. Letters already eliminated across all guesses:
   S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D, M, P, V, Y  
   (14 letters gone)
3. Remaining alphabet letters that have NOT yet been ruled out:
   B, F, G, J, K, Q, W, X, Z
4. The two unused positions (4th and 5th) must be filled from that remaining set.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words that start with “CHI” and use only the still-allowed letters:

- CHIBB – uncommon, double B not ruled out but obscure
- CHICK – K is allowed, but the second C would repeat; allowed but less likely
- CHICO – O is out
- CHIDE – D is out
- CHIEF – F is still allowed
- CHILL – L is out
- CHINK – K is allowed
- CHINO – O and N are out
- CHIRP – P is out
- CHIVY – already guessed (Y is out)

The only reasonably common word left from the allowed letters is “CHIEF” (C H I E F), but E is already ruled out.  
Thus the only other simple candidate using still-allowed letters is “CHICK” (C H I C K).  
Although the second C repeats, nothing in the rules forbids repeated letters, and all letters C, H, I, C, K have not been marked “x”.

Therefore the best next guess is CHICK.
