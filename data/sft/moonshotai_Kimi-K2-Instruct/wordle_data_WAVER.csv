As this is the first guess, I have no feedback from previous attempts. My goal is to pick a word that contains common letters in English, which will help maximize the information gained from the first guess. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced word like ""AROSE"" covers many of these letters (A, R, O, S, E), making it a strong starting guess to narrow down possibilities for subsequent tries.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters that must be in the word (but in wrong positions so far):
- A, R, E

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, S, T, D

Remaining positions to fill are the five slots, but we know:
- 1st position: cannot be A (rose feedback), T (tread feedback).
- 2nd position: cannot be R (rose feedback), R (tread feedback), E (tread feedback).
- 3rd position: cannot be O, S, D; E is allowed here (since E was only forbidden in 5th in arose).
- 4th position: cannot be A (tread feedback).
- 5th position: cannot be E (rose feedback), D (tread feedback).

We need a word that uses the letters A, R, E exactly once each (unless letters repeat, but we have no evidence of that) and three other letters from the remaining pool (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try a word that places these letters in as-yet-unused positions:
- A not in 1st or 4th
- R not in 2nd
- E not in 2nd or 5th

Possible placements:
- 1st: R, E (E is allowed in 1st: not ruled out yet)
- 2nd: A, E (but E is allowed here)
- 3rd: A, R, E
- 4th: R, E (A is disallowed here)
- 5th: A, R (E is disallowed here)

One good combination is to place R in 1st, E in 3rd, and A in 2nd:
R _ E _ _

Filling the remaining two slots with common unused consonants: let’s try C and L for 4th and 5th:
R A E C L → ""RAECL"" is not valid.
Let’s swap: R E A C L → ""REACL"" also invalid.

Trying another pattern: A in 3rd, E in 1st, R in 4th:
E _ A R _

Now fill the 2nd and 5th positions. Good consonants left: N, L, M, etc.
E N A R L → ""ENARL"" invalid.
E N A R M → ""ENARM"" invalid.
E N A R Y → ""ENARY"" invalid.

Next pattern: A in 2nd, E in 4th, R in 5th:
_ A _ E R

Now the 1st and 3rd positions. Good consonants: C, L, N, M, etc.
C A N E R → ""CANER"" is a valid word (a type of worker who makes cane products).

Let’s verify:
- C, N are new letters.
- A is 2nd (allowed).
- N is 3rd (new).
- E is 4th (not 5th, allowed).
- R is 5th (allowed).
This seems valid.

From the latest feedback:

Letters confirmed as present and in their correct spots:
- A is in the correct spot (position 2)
- E is in the correct spot (position 4)
- R is in the correct spot (position 5)

So the target word has the form: _ A _ E R

We also know from previous feedback:
- Must contain A, R, E (already confirmed and positioned)
- Must NOT contain: O, S, T, D, C, N (all received 'x' in previous guesses)

Remaining letters to check (consonants and vowels not excluded):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R with letters from the allowed set.

Let's think of possible combinations:
- B A B E R (baber - not a word)
- G A M E R (""gamer"") - valid word
- F A V E R (""faver"" - not valid)

- L A M E R (""lamer"" - valid but slang)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
a(-) – the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
r(-) – the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
o(x) – the letter O is NOT in the word at all
s(x) – the letter S is NOT in the word at all
e(-) – the letter E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th)

So we must include A, R, E somewhere other than their original spots and must avoid O and S.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, U (and of course A, E must be used).

Trying to place A, R, E in new positions while avoiding O and S.  
Let’s try “TREAD”:
- T, D are fresh letters.
- E is 2nd (not 5th).
- A is 3rd (not 1st).
- R is 4th (not 2nd).

Guess 2: tread -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters that must be in the word (but in wrong positions so far):
- A, R, E

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, S, T, D

Remaining positions to fill are the five slots, but we know:
- 1st position: cannot be A (rose feedback), T (tread feedback).
- 2nd position: cannot be R (rose feedback), R (tread feedback), E (tread feedback).
- 3rd position: cannot be O, S, D; E is allowed here (since E was only forbidden in 5th in arose).
- 4th position: cannot be A (tread feedback).
- 5th position: cannot be E (rose feedback), D (tread feedback).

We need a word that uses the letters A, R, E exactly once each (unless letters repeat, but we have no evidence of that) and three other letters from the remaining pool (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try a word that places these letters in as-yet-unused positions:
- A not in 1st or 4th
- R not in 2nd
- E not in 2nd or 5th

Possible placements:
- 1st: R, E (E is allowed in 1st: not ruled out yet)
- 2nd: A, E (but E is allowed here)
- 3rd: A, R, E
- 4th: R, E (A is disallowed here)
- 5th: A, R (E is disallowed here)

One good combination is to place R in 1st, E in 3rd, and A in 2nd:
R _ E _ _

Filling the remaining two slots with common unused consonants: let’s try C and L for 4th and 5th:
R A E C L → ""RAECL"" is not valid.
Let’s swap: R E A C L → ""REACL"" also invalid.

Trying another pattern: A in 3rd, E in 1st, R in 4th:
E _ A R _

Now fill the 2nd and 5th positions. Good consonants left: N, L, M, etc.
E N A R L → ""ENARL"" invalid.
E N A R M → ""ENARM"" invalid.
E N A R Y → ""ENARY"" invalid.

Next pattern: A in 2nd, E in 4th, R in 5th:
_ A _ E R

Now the 1st and 3rd positions. Good consonants: C, L, N, M, etc.
C A N E R → ""CANER"" is a valid word (a type of worker who makes cane products).

Let’s verify:
- C, N are new letters.
- A is 2nd (allowed).
- N is 3rd (new).
- E is 4th (not 5th, allowed).
- R is 5th (allowed).
This seems valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WAVER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>As this is the first guess, I have no feedback from previous attempts. My goal is to pick a word that contains common letters in English, which will help maximize the information gained from the first guess. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced word like ""AROSE"" covers many of these letters (A, R, O, S, E), making it a strong starting guess to narrow down possibilities for subsequent tries.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
a(-) – the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
r(-) – the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
o(x) – the letter O is NOT in the word at all
s(x) – the letter S is NOT in the word at all
e(-) – the letter E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th)

So we must include A, R, E somewhere other than their original spots and must avoid O and S.

Good consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, U (and of course A, E must be used).

Trying to place A, R, E in new positions while avoiding O and S.  
Let’s try “TREAD”:
- T, D are fresh letters.
- E is 2nd (not 5th).
- A is 3rd (not 1st).
- R is 4th (not 2nd).

<guess>tread</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tread -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters that must be in the word (but in wrong positions so far):
- A, R, E

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- O, S, T, D

Remaining positions to fill are the five slots, but we know:
- 1st position: cannot be A (rose feedback), T (tread feedback).
- 2nd position: cannot be R (rose feedback), R (tread feedback), E (tread feedback).
- 3rd position: cannot be O, S, D; E is allowed here (since E was only forbidden in 5th in arose).
- 4th position: cannot be A (tread feedback).
- 5th position: cannot be E (rose feedback), D (tread feedback).

We need a word that uses the letters A, R, E exactly once each (unless letters repeat, but we have no evidence of that) and three other letters from the remaining pool (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try a word that places these letters in as-yet-unused positions:
- A not in 1st or 4th
- R not in 2nd
- E not in 2nd or 5th

Possible placements:
- 1st: R, E (E is allowed in 1st: not ruled out yet)
- 2nd: A, E (but E is allowed here)
- 3rd: A, R, E
- 4th: R, E (A is disallowed here)
- 5th: A, R (E is disallowed here)

One good combination is to place R in 1st, E in 3rd, and A in 2nd:
R _ E _ _

Filling the remaining two slots with common unused consonants: let’s try C and L for 4th and 5th:
R A E C L → ""RAECL"" is not valid.
Let’s swap: R E A C L → ""REACL"" also invalid.

Trying another pattern: A in 3rd, E in 1st, R in 4th:
E _ A R _

Now fill the 2nd and 5th positions. Good consonants left: N, L, M, etc.
E N A R L → ""ENARL"" invalid.
E N A R M → ""ENARM"" invalid.
E N A R Y → ""ENARY"" invalid.

Next pattern: A in 2nd, E in 4th, R in 5th:
_ A _ E R

Now the 1st and 3rd positions. Good consonants: C, L, N, M, etc.
C A N E R → ""CANER"" is a valid word (a type of worker who makes cane products).

Let’s verify:
- C, N are new letters.
- A is 2nd (allowed).
- N is 3rd (new).
- E is 4th (not 5th, allowed).
- R is 5th (allowed).
This seems valid.

Guess 3: caner -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

Letters confirmed as present and in their correct spots:
- A is in the correct spot (position 2)
- E is in the correct spot (position 4)
- R is in the correct spot (position 5)

So the target word has the form: _ A _ E R

We also know from previous feedback:
- Must contain A, R, E (already confirmed and positioned)
- Must NOT contain: O, S, T, D, C, N (all received 'x' in previous guesses)

Remaining letters to check (consonants and vowels not excluded):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R with letters from the allowed set.

Let's think of possible combinations:
- B A B E R (baber - not a word)
- G A M E R (""gamer"") - valid word
- F A V E R (""faver"" - not valid)
- H A V E R (""haver"" - valid but less common)
- L A M E R (""lamer"" - valid but slang)
- M A K E R (""maker"" - valid and common)
- P A P E R (""paper"" - valid and perfect fit)

""MAKER"" and ""PAPER"" are both valid, common words. Between them, ""MAKER"" uses 'M' and 'K' which haven't been tested yet, while ""PAPER"" uses 'P' twice but 'P' hasn't been tested either. Both are good, but let's go with ""MAKER"" as it uses two new letters.

Check positions:
- M (position 1) - new
- A (position 2) - correct
- K (position 3) - new
- E (position 4) - correct
- R (position 5) - correct
