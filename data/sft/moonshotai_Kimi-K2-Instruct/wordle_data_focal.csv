For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L)
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It allows testing both the beginning and ending positions of common letters

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions): L, A
3. L cannot be in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in SLATE and marked -)
4. A cannot be in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in SLATE and marked -)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L and A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S, T, E
- Uses only other valid letters

Possible letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for a word with L and A, avoiding positions 2 and 3 for them, and avoiding S,T,E.

Let's try ""FLANK"":
- Contains L and A
- L is in position 2 (but we know L can't be in position 2 from SLATE) - so this is bad
Wait, let me reconsider...

Better choices might be:
- ""CLAMP"" - but has P
- ""PLANK"" - P is ok, let's see positions
- ""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K
  - L is position 2 (still bad)
- ""CRAWL"" - no, has no A
- ""BRAIN"" - no L
- ""GLAND"" - G, L, A, N, D
  - L is position 2 (still bad)
- ""ALARM"" - A is position 1 (ok), L is position 2 (bad)
- ""PLAZA"" - has Z and two As
- ""PLAN A"" - not a word
- ""FLORA"" - has E (no)
- ""GLEAN"" - has E (no)
- ""CLANG"" - G, L, A, N

  - L is position 2 (bad pattern)

- Known letters: O (position 2), A (position 4)
- Letters that must appear somewhere: L, A (already placed)
- Letters that must NOT appear: S, T, E, P, R
- L must appear but cannot be in position 3
- Pattern so far: _ O _ A _
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- L must fit somewhere: positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3), so positions 1 or 5

Let's list possible positions for L:
1. L O _ A _
2. _ O L A _ → invalid (L can't be in position 3)
3. _ O _ A L

Possible words:
- For L _ O _ A _ : Not many 5-letter words start with L, have O in position 2 and A in position 4
- For _ O _ A L : More promising

Let's try _ O _ A L:
Middle positions (3) can be any letter except excluded ones. Let's pick common consonants.

Try ""COBAL"":
- C, O, B, A, L → fits the pattern _ O _ A L
- Uses no excluded letters
- But is ""COBAL"" a valid word? It appears to be valid (a typeface)

Let's check another: ""BONAL"" - but ""bonal"" doesn't seem valid
""LOCAL"" - but L is in position 1 and 3, and L can't be in position 3 here
""FOCAL"" - F, O, C, A, L → F O C A L
- F is allowed
- C is allowed
- No excluded letters
""FOCAL"" seems better than ""COBAL""

Another option: ""HOBAL"" - not sure if valid
""GONAL"" - doesn't seem right
""DONAL"" - not valid
""MOHAL"" - no
""VOCAL"" - V, O, C, A, L → V O C A L
