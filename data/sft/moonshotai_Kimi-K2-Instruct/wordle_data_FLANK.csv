For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategically best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
1. It contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of consonants and vowels (2 vowels: A, E)
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain
5. It follows common letter patterns in English

After the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → _ L A _ _ (letters out: S T E)
2. BLACK → _ L A _ K (letters out: B C)
3. PLANK → _ L A N K (letters out: P)

So the pattern is now:
_ L A N K

Letters still unknown: only the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out: S T E B C P.

Any remaining candidate must be a 5-letter word of the form ? L A N K where the first letter is **not** S, T, E, B, C, or P.

Possible English words that fit:
- FLANK  (F is still allowed)
- GLAND  (doesn’t end with K)
- ULNAR  (doesn’t fit pattern)
- ALANK  (not a word)
- CLANK  (C is already ruled out)
- SLANK  (S is ruled out)
- BLANK  (B is ruled out)
- PLANK  (already guessed)

The only remaining valid word is **FLANK**.

Let’s confirm:
- F not previously ruled out ✓
- L A N K positions fixed ✓
- 5-letter word ✓

Therefore, FLANK is the logical next guess.
