For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify key vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains multiple vowels and frequently used consonants to maximize information gain. One such word is ""AROSE"" which includes:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – the letter E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but in different positions (A not 1st, E not 5th).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Therefore we need a word that:
1. Has A somewhere except first position.

- E at 2 ✓
- L is in word (from leapt feedback) but PECAN lacks L → reject.

We need a word with E at 2, A not at 1 or 3 (so 4 or 5), and containing L somewhere (since L is in the word but not at 1 or 5).  
Possible positions for L: 3 or 4.

Try “DELAY”:
- D E L A Y
- E at 2 ✓
- A at 4 ✓
- L at 3 ✓ (allowed)
Letters used: D, E, L, A, Y – all are still possible (none ruled out).  
This satisfies every constraint so far.

Check against exclusions:
- No R, O, S, T → OK.
- No letters in ruled-out positions → OK.

Therefore “DELAY” is a valid next guess.

Current facts we can extract from all feedback:

Letters known to be in the secret word  
- E is in position 2 (from the ✓ in leapt and delay)  
- A is in the word and is in position 4 (from the ✓ in delay)

Letters known NOT to be in the secret word  
R, O, S, T, D, Y

Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from L(-) in leapt and delay)  
  – The only remaining possible position for L is 2, but position 2 is already taken by E.  
  – Therefore L cannot actually be in the word at all. The earlier feedback must have been mis-read.

Wait, let’s re-examine carefully:

- leapt → L(-) : L is in the word but not in position 1.  
- delay → L(-) : L is in the word but not in position 3.  
So L is definitely somewhere, but not 1 and not 3. Possible positions for L: 2, 4, 5.  
But position 2 is E (fixed), and position 4 is A (fixed).  
Therefore L must be in position 5.

So we now know:

Exact pattern so far:  
_ E _ A L

We still need the first and third letters.  
Allowed letters: any letter not yet ruled out (so not R, O, S, T, D, Y).

Frequent consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

We need two new distinct consonants (or consonant and vowel) for positions 1 and 3.

A good next word that fits this pattern and tests two new letters quickly is:

B E G A L → “begal” – but “begal” is not a valid English word.

C E N A L → “cenal” – invalid.

P E N A L → “penal” – valid English word.

Check constraints:
- p (1) – not yet ruled out  
- e (2) – must be E ✓  
- n (3) – not yet ruled out  
- a (4) – must be A ✓  
- l (5) – must be L ✓  

No forbidden letters used.  
“penal” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Thus we will guess “penal”.
