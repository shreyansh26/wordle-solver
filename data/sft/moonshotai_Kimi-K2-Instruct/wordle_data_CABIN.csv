For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can help identify vowels and consonants early on. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This gives a good mix of letters that should provide substantial information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct second position (✓)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. It contains the letter I (but not in the 3rd position)
3. It contains none of R, S, or E

To maximize information from the next guess, I should pick a word that:
- Keeps A in the second position
- Places I in a new position (1st, 4th, or 5th)
- Introduces new common letters we haven't tested yet

Good candidates would be:
- DAILY (but Y isn't ideal as it's less common)
- FAIRY (Y again)
- HABIT (but T and H haven't been tested)
- CABIN (N and C are good letters to test)

I'll go with CABIN as it:
- Keeps A in position 2
- Moves I to position 4
- Introduces C, B, and N which are all common and untested
