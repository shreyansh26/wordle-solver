This is the first guess, so there's no prior information to work from. My goal is to pick a word that will provide the most useful feedback possible. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid rare letters (Q, X, Z)
3. Ideally contain common consonants and vowels

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)

I'll go with SLATE because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) plus two very common consonants (S, T, L) and covers a good range of possible letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends in E and does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

1. Ends with E.
2. Has none of S, L, A, T.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, B, G, M, P, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out, and E is already used).

Since we have no positional info for the first 4 letters, I want a word that tests common consonants and the remaining vowels. Possible choices:
- RINNE (but N is repeated, not ideal)
- CRONE (but O is common here)
- PRIME (tests P, R, I, M)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

My goal is to pick a word that will provide the most useful feedback possible. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters in the English language (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S)
2. Avoid rare letters (Q, X, Z)
3. Ideally contain common consonants and vowels

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)

I'll go with SLATE because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) plus two very common consonants (S, T, L) and covers a good range of possible letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends in E and does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has none of S, L, A, T.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, B, G, M, P, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out, and E is already used).

Since we have no positional info for the first 4 letters, I want a word that tests common consonants and the remaining vowels. Possible choices:
- RINNE (but N is repeated, not ideal)
- CRONE (but O is common here)
- PRIME (tests P, R, I, M)
- BRINE (B, R, I, N)

I'll go with BRINE because it tests B, R, I, N - all common letters not yet ruled out, and ends with the confirmed E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:
1. Word ends in E (from Guess 1).
2. Word contains R in the third position (✓ at position 3).
3. Word does NOT contain S, L, A, T, B, I, N.

So the pattern so far: _ _ R _ E  
Allowed letters left include: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P  
Vowels left: O, U (A and I are out, E is already placed)

We need to test positions 1, 2, and 4. A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Has R in position 3 (✓)
- Has E in position 5 (✓)
- Uses new common letters in positions 1, 2, 4

Possible candidates:
- CORER (but C is common, O is good)
- FORGE (tests F, O, G)
- HORDE (tests H, O, D)
- PORCH (but would need to end in E)

Since we know position 4 must be a consonant (because the word ends in E and R is at 3), let's pick a word that tests common consonants in positions 1, 2, 4.

Good choice: FORCE - tests F, O, R, C, E. But R must be at position 3, so F O R C E fits the pattern _ _ R _ E. However, C is at position 4 which is allowed.

But wait, FORCE doesn't fit the pattern _ _ R _ E because R is at position 3 in the word, but in FORCE, R is at position 3, E at 5 - so that's fine.

But does FORCE contain any disallowed letters? No S, L, A, T, B, I, N - looks good.

Alternatively, CHORE - but H is less common than F.

I'll go with FORCE as it tests F, O, C which are all common and unused.

From Guess 4 (GROVE) we learned:
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- V is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (already known)
- G is not in the word (x)

So the actual pattern is now completely determined:
R _ _ _ E
with positions 2, 3, 4 already filled perfectly:
R O V E

Therefore the secret word must be:
R O V E ?  (but we already have E at position 5)

So the word is exactly: ROV E + E → ROVE? Wait, that's only 4 letters.

Let me re-read the feedback carefully:
GROVE → positions:
1 G(x)
2 R(✓)
3 O(✓)
4 V(✓)
5 E(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: NOT G (but we know it must start with R from position 2 being R in ROVE)
Wait no - the R was in position 2 in GROVE, so in the correct word R is in position 2.

So the correct positions are:
1: ?
2: R
3: O
4: V
5: E

So the word pattern is: _ R O V E

Now we just need to find the first letter. Available letters (not forbidden):
Forbidden letters so far: S,L,A,T,B,I,N,F,C,G
Remaining common consonants: D, H, K, M, P, W, Y
Vowels: Only O is used in position 3, U is available but position 1 could be consonant.

Possible starting letters: D, H, K, M, P, W, Y

Common words that fit _ R O V E:
- DROVE
- PROVE

Between these, PROVE is more common. Let's check letters:
P - not forbidden
R - confirmed
O - confirmed
V - confirmed
E - confirmed

No forbidden letters used.
