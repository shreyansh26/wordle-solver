For the first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters and gives good coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, and L are good to include, along with common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A word like ""STARE"" includes S, T, A, R, E - which covers 3 common vowels and 2 common consonants. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""STARE"" seems slightly better because S and T are very common starting letters for 5-letter words, and the placement might give more information. However, ""AROSE"" also has good letter coverage. Another strong first guess is ""CRANE"" which covers C, R, A, N, E.

After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that will help identify which vowels and consonants are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE, we know:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word ends in E.

So far we have:
- Last letter: E
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain A or S

To find new letters while respecting the constraints, a good next guess would be one that:
1. Ends with E (known ✓)
2. Includes R and O in different positions
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels

Possible candidates: ""ROUTE"" (but O is in position 2 which we know is wrong - O was in position 3 in AROSE), ""FORCE"" (but O is in position 2), ""WORLD"" (but ends in D), ""WORSE"" (ends in E, has R and O in different positions), ""GROVE"" (O in position 3 was wrong, but maybe acceptable), ""BROKE"" (similar issue with O).

""WORSE"" looks good because:
- Ends with E (matches ✓)
- Has R in position 2 (original R was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Let me reconsider. The R was in position 2 in AROSE and feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2. The O was in position 3 and feedback was ""-"", so O is not in position 3.

""CRONE"" would be invalid because O would be in position 3.

""ORDER"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid), and O is in position 1 (new position).

""GROPE"" - O in position 2, R in position 3 (both new positions from original)
- Original positions: O was 3 (now 2), R was 2 (now 3) - this seems acceptable

""PROBE"" - similar, O in 2, R in 3

From the combined feedback:

- Word ends with E (✓ in both guesses).
- R is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- O is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, P.
- Allowed consonants/vowels we’ve seen: G, R, O, E (plus earlier A, S).

So we have:
E _ _ _ E

Possible slots for R and O are 1 and 4.

The pattern looks like:
[x] [ ] [ ] [x] E
with R and O occupying positions 1 and 4 in some order.

That gives two candidates:
- O _ _ R E
- R _ _ O E

We still need to introduce fresh common letters to fill positions 2 and 3. Good choices: N, T, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- OUTRE (but U not yet seen)
- OLIVE (I not seen, L not seen)
- ORDER (but R would repeat in position 4)
- FROND (but ends in D)
- FRONT (ends in T)
- PRONE (P is forbidden)
- CRONE (O in position 3 is forbidden)

Try “ROUTE” – O in position 3 is forbidden, so no.

Try “BORNE” – O in position 2 is forbidden.

Try “FRONT” – ends in T, not E.

“OLIVE” satisfies:

But V is uncommon. Maybe “OLDER” – but R would be in 4, which is allowed, D is new.

O 1, L 2, D 3, R 4, E 5
- R not in 2 or 3 (ok)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE, we know:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word ends in E.

So far we have:
- Last letter: E
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain A or S

To find new letters while respecting the constraints, a good next guess would be one that:
1. Ends with E (known ✓)
2. Includes R and O in different positions
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels

Possible candidates: ""ROUTE"" (but O is in position 2 which we know is wrong - O was in position 3 in AROSE), ""FORCE"" (but O is in position 2), ""WORLD"" (but ends in D), ""WORSE"" (ends in E, has R and O in different positions), ""GROVE"" (O in position 3 was wrong, but maybe acceptable), ""BROKE"" (similar issue with O).

""WORSE"" looks good because:
- Ends with E (matches ✓)
- Has R in position 2 (original R was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Let me reconsider. The R was in position 2 in AROSE and feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2. The O was in position 3 and feedback was ""-"", so O is not in position 3.

""CRONE"" would be invalid because O would be in position 3.

""ORDER"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid), and O is in position 1 (new position).

""GROPE"" - O in position 2, R in position 3 (both new positions from original)
- Original positions: O was 3 (now 2), R was 2 (now 3) - this seems acceptable

""PROBE"" - similar, O in 2, R in 3

I'll go with ""GROPE"" as it introduces new letters G and P while placing O and R in new positions and keeping the known E at the end.

<guess>GROPE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: GROPE -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

- Word ends with E (✓ in both guesses).
- R is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- O is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, P.
- Allowed consonants/vowels we’ve seen: G, R, O, E (plus earlier A, S).

So we have:
E _ _ _ E  
must contain R and O, each somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

Possible slots for R and O are 1 and 4.

The pattern looks like:
[x] [ ] [ ] [x] E
with R and O occupying positions 1 and 4 in some order.

That gives two candidates:
- O _ _ R E
- R _ _ O E

We still need to introduce fresh common letters to fill positions 2 and 3. Good choices: N, T, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- OUTRE (but U not yet seen)
- OLIVE (I not seen, L not seen)
- ORDER (but R would repeat in position 4)
- FROND (but ends in D)
- FRONT (ends in T)
- PRONE (P is forbidden)
- CRONE (O in position 3 is forbidden)

Try “ROUTE” – O in position 3 is forbidden, so no.

Try “BORNE” – O in position 2 is forbidden.

Try “FRONT” – ends in T, not E.

Try “OLIVE” – ends in E, O in position 1, L and I new letters.

“OLIVE” satisfies:
O in 1 (new), L and I in 2-3 (new), V in 4 (new), E in 5 (known ✓).

But V is uncommon. Maybe “OLDER” – but R would be in 4, which is allowed, D is new.

“OLDER”:
O 1, L 2, D 3, R 4, E 5
- R not in 2 or 3 (ok)
- O not in 2 or 3 (ok)
- Letters already: A, S, P, G excluded
- Introduces D and L

That looks solid.

From all feedback so far:

- E is in the word and ends the word (✓ in position 5 every time).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from AROSE, GROPE, OLDER) → R must be in position 1 or 4.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 → O must be in position 4.
- L and D are NOT in the word (x from OLDER).
- Forbidden letters: A, S, P, G, L, D.

Since O must be in position 4, and E is fixed in position 5:
Word shape: _ _ _ O E

Also R must appear once more; the only remaining slot for R is position 1 (because 4 is taken by O).

So word starts with R, ends with OE:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

""WORSE"" looks good because:

Let me extract the certain facts we now have.

- Word ends in E (✓ position 5 in every guess).
- R is in position 1 (✓ in Guess 4 RINOE).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from earlier feedback).  
  – From AROSE: O was in 3 ⇒ not 3  
  – From GROPE: O was in 3 ⇒ not 3 (re-confirmed)  
  – From OLDER: O was in 1 ⇒ not 1  
  – From RINOE: O was in 4 ⇒ not 4  
  – E is 5 ⇒ not 5  
  Therefore O must be in position 2.

So the pattern is fixed:

R O _ _ E

Only one blank position (the third letter) remains, and that letter must be a consonant that has never been ruled out.

Forbidden letters so far:  
A, S, P, G, L, D, I, N (and of course R, O, E are already placed)

Possible remaining common consonants:  
T, C, M, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Because the unknown letter is the third one and must form a valid 5-letter word with R O _ _ E, let me test a few:

- ROTCE – not a word  
- ROMAE – not a word  
- ROBLE – L is already ruled out  
- ROFLE – F and L, L ruled out  
- ROWNE – W and N, N ruled out  
- ROTWE – not a word  
- ROCKE – C and K both still allowed  
- ROCKE is a valid variant spelling of “rock” (verb), though “ROCK” is 4 letters; actually “ROCKY” is 5 letters ending Y.  
Wait – let me list real 5-letter words R O _ _ E:

ROATE, ROBLE, ROCHE, RODGE, ROGUE, ROMNE, RONDE, ROQUE, ROSIE, ROTHE, ROUTE, ROVIE, ROWME, ROYNE, etc.

Cross-checking against forbidden letters:

- ROCHE – C and H still allowed  
- ROGUE – G is already out  
- ROUTE – T and U: U has not been tested, and T is allowed  
- ROCKE – K and E allowed, but not sure if valid, “ROCKY” ends Y

Between ROCHE and ROUTE, “ROCHE” uses C and H which we haven’t tested yet. That’s useful to learn about two fresh letters at once.

I’ll go with ROCHE.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,rouge,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters and gives good coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, and L are good to include, along with common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A word like ""STARE"" includes S, T, A, R, E - which covers 3 common vowels and 2 common consonants. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E. 

Between these, ""STARE"" seems slightly better because S and T are very common starting letters for 5-letter words, and the placement might give more information. However, ""AROSE"" also has good letter coverage. Another strong first guess is ""CRANE"" which covers C, R, A, N, E.

After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that will help identify which vowels and consonants are present or absent in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE, we know:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓), so the word ends in E.

So far we have:
- Last letter: E
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does not contain A or S

To find new letters while respecting the constraints, a good next guess would be one that:
1. Ends with E (known ✓)
2. Includes R and O in different positions
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels

Possible candidates: ""ROUTE"" (but O is in position 2 which we know is wrong - O was in position 3 in AROSE), ""FORCE"" (but O is in position 2), ""WORLD"" (but ends in D), ""WORSE"" (ends in E, has R and O in different positions), ""GROVE"" (O in position 3 was wrong, but maybe acceptable), ""BROKE"" (similar issue with O).

""WORSE"" looks good because:
- Ends with E (matches ✓)
- Has R in position 2 (original R was position 2 in AROSE, but feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Let me reconsider. The R was in position 2 in AROSE and feedback was ""-"", so R is not in position 2. The O was in position 3 and feedback was ""-"", so O is not in position 3.

""CRONE"" would be invalid because O would be in position 3.

""ORDER"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid), and O is in position 1 (new position).

""GROPE"" - O in position 2, R in position 3 (both new positions from original)
- Original positions: O was 3 (now 2), R was 2 (now 3) - this seems acceptable

""PROBE"" - similar, O in 2, R in 3

I'll go with ""GROPE"" as it introduces new letters G and P while placing O and R in new positions and keeping the known E at the end.

<guess>GROPE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: GROPE -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

- Word ends with E (✓ in both guesses).
- R is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- O is in the word but never in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, P.
- Allowed consonants/vowels we’ve seen: G, R, O, E (plus earlier A, S).

So we have:
E _ _ _ E  
must contain R and O, each somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.

Possible slots for R and O are 1 and 4.

The pattern looks like:
[x] [ ] [ ] [x] E
with R and O occupying positions 1 and 4 in some order.

That gives two candidates:
- O _ _ R E
- R _ _ O E

We still need to introduce fresh common letters to fill positions 2 and 3. Good choices: N, T, L, D, C, etc.

Candidate words:
- OUTRE (but U not yet seen)
- OLIVE (I not seen, L not seen)
- ORDER (but R would repeat in position 4)
- FROND (but ends in D)
- FRONT (ends in T)
- PRONE (P is forbidden)
- CRONE (O in position 3 is forbidden)

Try “ROUTE” – O in position 3 is forbidden, so no.

Try “BORNE” – O in position 2 is forbidden.

Try “FRONT” – ends in T, not E.

Try “OLIVE” – ends in E, O in position 1, L and I new letters.

“OLIVE” satisfies:
O in 1 (new), L and I in 2-3 (new), V in 4 (new), E in 5 (known ✓).

But V is uncommon. Maybe “OLDER” – but R would be in 4, which is allowed, D is new.

“OLDER”:
O 1, L 2, D 3, R 4, E 5
- R not in 2 or 3 (ok)
- O not in 2 or 3 (ok)
- Letters already: A, S, P, G excluded
- Introduces D and L

That looks solid.

Guess 2: GROPE -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(-) O(-) P(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: OLDER -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(x) D(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

- E is in the word and ends the word (✓ in position 5 every time).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from AROSE, GROPE, OLDER) → R must be in position 1 or 4.
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 → O must be in position 4.
- L and D are NOT in the word (x from OLDER).
- Forbidden letters: A, S, P, G, L, D.

Since O must be in position 4, and E is fixed in position 5:
Word shape: _ _ _ O E

Also R must appear once more; the only remaining slot for R is position 1 (because 4 is taken by O).

So word starts with R, ends with OE:
R _ _ O E

Letters left to fill positions 2 and 3: cannot be A, S, P, G, L, D, and must be common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out. Remaining common letters: N, T, C, M, B, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R I V O E (invalid, V uncommon, I not yet tested)
- R I N O E (I and N both new, common)
- R U N O E (U uncommon)
- R I C O E (C new)
- R I N O E seems best – uses common letters I and N, nothing forbidden.

Check: R(1) I(2) N(3) O(4) E(5)
- R not in 2,3,5 (ok)
- O not in 1,2,3 (ok)
- ends E (ok)

We now know the exact pattern:

R O _ _ E  
with positions 1, 2, and 5 fixed as R, O, E respectively (✓ each time).

We also know:

- C and H are NOT in the word (x from ROCHE).  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, P, G, L, D, I, N, C, H.  

So the two unknown letters (positions 3 and 4) must be chosen from the remaining consonants and vowels:  
B, F, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels not yet ruled out.

Real 5-letter English words of the form R O _ _ E:

ROATE (A ruled out)  
ROBES (S ruled out)  
ROBLE (L out)  
ROBME (not a word)  
ROFLE (not a word)  
ROGUE (G out)  
ROJEE (J possible, but uncommon)  
ROKER (K and R, but R already placed)  
ROMNE (M and N, N out)  
ROQUE (Q and U, but Q needs U)  
ROUTE (T and U, both still allowed)  
ROWME (M and W, both allowed)  
ROYNE (Y and N, N out)

“ROUTE” uses T and U – both letters we haven’t tried.  
“ROWNE” uses W and N – N is out.  
“ROMPE” uses M and P – P is out.  

So “ROUTE” is the only common, valid word left that fits the constraints.

Positions check:
- R 1 ✓  
- O 2 ✓  
- U 3 (new)  
- T 4 (new)  
- E 5 ✓  

All constraints satisfied.
