For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help identify which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

The feedback tells us:
- A: present but not in the 1st position
- R: not in the word at all
- O: not in the word at all
- S: not in the word at all
- E: present but not in the 5th position

So the secret word must contain both A and E, but R, O, S are ruled out.  
We already know A and E are in the word, so we need to choose a new set of consonants to test. Common remaining consonants include T, N, L, C, D, etc. A good second-guess word might be “TABLE” because:
1. It keeps the A and E we know are present.
2. It introduces T, B, L, none of which have been tested yet.
3. It places A in position 2 and E in position 5 (both safe, since we were only told those positions were wrong in the previous guess).

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, S are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (TABLE) we learned:
- T is not in the word.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- B is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Exact placement: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: A, B, E, L
- Letters definitely not in the word: R, O, S, T

We have 4 letters confirmed (A, B, E, L) and need one more letter. The missing letter must be from the remaining unused consonants (common ones still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.).

We can try a word that uses A in position 2 and places B, E, L in new positions. A good candidate is ""CABLE"" because:
- C is untested.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- B moves to position 3 (was not allowed in position 3, but here it's in position 3 again - let me reconsider).

Actually, we know B is not in position 3 (from TABLE feedback: B(-)), so CABLE would have B in position 3 again - that's invalid.

Let me think of a word that keeps A in position 2 and places B, E, L in allowed positions. Possible structure: _ A _ _ _ with B, E, L in positions 1,3,4,5 (but E cannot be in position 5).

Good candidates:
- ""BALED"" - uses B, A, L, E, D. Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). This fits:
  - A is in 2 (✓)
  - B moves from 3 to 1 (allowed)
  - L moves from 4 to 3 (allowed)
  - E moves from 5 to 4 (allowed)
  - D is new and untested

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 5 respectively.  
   – R, O, S are excluded.

2. TABLE → T(x) A(✓) B(-) L(-) E(-)
   – A is locked in position 2.  
   – B, E, L are in the word but B is not in 3, L is not in 4, E is not in 5.  
   – T is excluded.

3. BALED → B(✓) A(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)
   – Confirms B in 1, A in 2, E in 4.  
   – L is not in 3.  
   – D is excluded.

So we have:
- Pattern: B A _ E _
- Letters in the word: B, A, E, L
- L must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 3 or 4 and 2 is A).
- Position 3 is still unknown; it must be a letter we haven’t used yet and not among R, O, S, T, D.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with B A _ E L. The only common English word that fits is BAGEL.

Let’s verify:
- B(1) ✓, A(2) ✓, E(4) ✓, L(5) ✓  
- G(3) is new and allowed.

Thus, the next guess is BAGEL.
