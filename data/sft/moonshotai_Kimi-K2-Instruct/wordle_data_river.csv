For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Popular starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)

These words contain frequently used letters in English and help identify vowels early. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has good consonant coverage and the common vowels A and E.

Current known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, D
2. Letters definitely in the word: I (position 3), E (position 4), R (somewhere)
3. R cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback R(-) in position 3)
4. R has also been ruled out of position 2 (from Guess 1 feedback R(-) in position 2)

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
But position 4 is already taken by E, so R must be in position 1 or 5.

Current pattern: _ _ I E _  or  _ _ I E R

We need two more letters (positions 1,2,5 or 1,2,5) from unused common letters: S, L, B, H, M, F, G, K, O, U, Y, etc.

Common words fitting:
- SPIER (but P and S not tested yet)
- FIERY (Y not tested)
- BRIER (but R already in word)
- WRIER (but W not tested)
- PRIER (but P not tested)
- LIERS (common word, uses L and S which are untested)

Going with LIERS: places R at position 5, uses L and S as new letters, and keeps I and E in their correct positions.

Pattern: L I E R S - but this would put E in position 3 which conflicts with I(✓) in position 3. Wait, let me re-examine.

Actually, the pattern should be: [1][2]I[4]E or [1][2]I[4]E[5]R

Let me try ""LIERS"" carefully:
L I E R S → positions: 1-L, 2-I, 3-E, 4-R, 5-S
But I must be in position 3 (from feedback I(✓)), E must be in position 4 (from feedback E(✓)).

So the word structure is: [1][2]I E [5] with R needing to be in position 1 or 5.

Possible structures:
- R _ I E _ 
- _ _ I E R

Testing ""R"" in position 1: R _ I E _

Possible word: R I V E L - but V and L not tested yet
Or: R I S E N - but N is already ruled out
Or: R I V E T - but T is ruled out
Or: R I P E S - P and S not tested

""RIPES"" looks good - uses P and S as new letters, R in position 1, fits pattern R I P E S.

But wait - in ""RIPES"":
- I is in position 2, but feedback said I(✓) which means correct position, and in TIRED I was in position 2 and got ✓, so I must be in position 2? No - in TIRED, I was in position 2 and got ✓, so I must be in position 2.

Therefore the word structure is: [1] [2]I [3]E [4] [5] - but this contradicts the earlier feedback.

Let me carefully reconstruct positions:

From TIRED feedback (positions):
T(1) I(2) R(3) E(4) D(5)
Feedback: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)

This means:
- I is in position 2 and correct
- E is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 3
- Cannot be positions 1,5 since T and D are ruled out there

So R must be in position 1 or 5, but positions 1 and 5 letters are unknown (T and D were just test letters).

Therefore the word structure is:
[1] I [3] E [5] with R being in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- R I _ E _
- _ I _ E R

Looking at common words:
- R I V E R - but R would be in position 1 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat)
- R I D G E - but D is ruled out
- R I P E R - possible
- R I F E R - F not tested
- R I P E R seems best - uses P as new letter, R in position 1 and 5

Therefore the word structure is: [1] [2]I [3]E [4] [5] - but this contradicts the earlier feedback.

Let me carefully reconstruct positions:

T(1) I(2) R(3) E(4) D(5)
Feedback: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)

This means:
- I is in position 2 and correct

- R is in word but not position 3
- Cannot be positions 1,5 since T and D are ruled out there

So R must be in position 1 or 5, but positions 1 and 5 letters are unknown (T and D were just test letters).

Actually, the pattern should be: [1][2]I[4]E or [1][2]I[4]E[5]R

Let me try ""LIERS"" carefully:
L I E R S → positions: 1-L, 2-I, 3-E, 4-R, 5-S
But I must be in position 3 (from feedback I(✓)), E must be in position 4 (from feedback E(✓)).

So the word structure is: [1][2]I E [5] with R needing to be in position 1 or 5.

Possible structures:
- R _ I E _ 
- _ _ I E R

Testing ""R"" in position 1: R _ I E _

Possible word: R I V E L - but V and L not tested yet
Or: R I S E N - but N is already ruled out
Or: R I V E T - but T is ruled out
Or: R I P E S - P and S not tested

""RIPES"" looks good - uses P and S as new letters, R in position 1, fits pattern R I P E S.

But wait - in ""RIPES"":
- I is in position 2, but feedback said I(✓) which means correct position, and in TIRED I was in position 2 and got ✓, so I must be in position 2? No - in TIRED, I was in position 2 and got ✓, so I must be in position 2.

Therefore the word structure is: [1] [2]I [3]E [4] [5] - but this contradicts the earlier feedback.

Let me carefully reconstruct positions:

From TIRED feedback (positions):
T(1) I(2) R(3) E(4) D(5)
Feedback: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)

This means:
- I is in position 2 and correct
- E is in position 4 and correct
- R is in word but not position 3
- Cannot be positions 1,5 since T and D are ruled out there

So R must be in position 1 or 5, but positions 1 and 5 letters are unknown (T and D were just test letters).

Therefore the word structure is:
[1] I [3] E [5] with R being in 1 or 5.

Possible words:
- R I _ E _
- _ I _ E R

Looking at common words:
- R I V E R - but R would be in position 1 and 5, which is possible (letters can repeat)
- R I D G E - but D is ruled out
- R I P E R - possible
- R I F E R - F not tested
- R I P E R seems best - uses P as new letter, R in position 1 and 5

From the latest feedback (RIPER → R✓ I✓ P× E✓ R✓) we immediately see that positions 1, 2, 4 and 5 are locked in:
- Position 1: R  
- Position 2: I  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: R  

So the word must be of the form `R I _ E R`.

Only the third letter is unknown, and we already know that P is not there (feedback P×).  
Letters already ruled out across all guesses: C, A, N, T, D, P.

Common consonants still available: S, L, B, H, M, F, G, K, etc.

Scanning valid 5-letter English words fitting `R I _ E R`:
- R I V E R – but V has not been tested yet.
- R I S E R – S has not been tested.
- R I F E R – F has not been tested.
- R I B E R – B has not been tested.

Among these, “RIVER” is the most common word and uses a new consonant (V) that hasn’t been eliminated.  
Since no feedback rules out V, this is a safe next guess.
