For the first guess, we want a word that can give us maximum information about the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically contain common consonants and vowels to quickly rule in or rule out many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". These all contain a good mix of common letters. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This seems like a solid first choice to maximize information.

However, another strong contender is ""RAISE"" - it has R, A, I, S, E. This covers all five major vowels (A, E, I) plus R and S which are very common consonants. Between these, ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes 'I' which isn't in ""AROSE"".

After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems like the optimal first guess due to its excellent letter coverage.

- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

We need to move A, S, E to different positions. One common approach is to rearrange these letters and add new consonants to test. Good consonants to test next might be T, N, L, C, etc.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 2, 3)
- S (not in position 3, 4)
- E (not in position 2, 5)

Known letters that ARE NOT in the word:
- R, I, L

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each (because duplicates would have shown as repeated feedback letters) and must also contain two more distinct consonants, none of which are R, I, L.

Positions that seem most constrained so far:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

We have five positions and three known letters: A, S, E. We need to place them along with two new consonants that have not been used yet (e.g., N, T, C, D, H, etc.).

Let’s try to place the known letters in the remaining valid positions and pick two new consonants. One systematic way is to list possible placements:

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are out)
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since 2 and 3 are out)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are out)

These positions must be unique for each letter.

Let’s try S in 1, A in 4, E in 3: S _ E A _

We need two consonants (not R, I, L) for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s pick N and T: S N E A T → “SNEAT” – not a valid English word.

Try S in 2, A in 4, E in 3: _ S E A _ → need consonants for 1 and 5.

Pick N and T: N S E A T → “NSEAT” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ S → pick N and T: A N E T S → “ANETS” – not a word.

Try S in 1, A in 5, E in 3: S _ E _ A → pick N and T: S N E T A → “SNETA” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A S → pick N and T: E N T A S → “ENTAS” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E S → pick N and T: A N T E S → “ANTES” – this is a valid word (“antes” – the plural of ante, as in poker).

Let’s verify positions:
- S is now in 5 (allowed)
- A is now in 1 (allowed)
- E is now in 4 (allowed)
- Letters used: A, N, T, E, S – none are forbidden.

Thus “ANTES” is a valid next guess.

We need two consonants (not R, I, L) for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s pick N and T: S N E A T → “SNEAT” – not a valid English word.

Try S in 2, A in 4, E in 3: _ S E A _ → need consonants for 1 and 5.

Pick N and T: N S E A T → “NSEAT” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ S → pick N and T: A N E T S → “ANETS” – not a word.

Try S in 1, A in 5, E in 3: S _ E _ A → pick N and T: S N E T A → “SNETA” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A S → pick N and T: E N T A S → “ENTAS” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E S → pick N and T: A N T E S → “ANTES” – this is a valid word (“antes” – the plural of ante, as in poker).

Let’s verify positions:
- S is now in 5 (allowed)
- A is now in 1 (allowed)
- E is now in 4 (allowed)
- Letters used: A, N, T, E, S – none are forbidden.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can give us maximum information about the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically contain common consonants and vowels to quickly rule in or rule out many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". These all contain a good mix of common letters. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This seems like a solid first choice to maximize information.

However, another strong contender is ""RAISE"" - it has R, A, I, S, E. This covers all five major vowels (A, E, I) plus R and S which are very common consonants. Between these, ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes 'I' which isn't in ""AROSE"".

After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems like the optimal first guess due to its excellent letter coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: A, S, E (but their positions are wrong)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (positions still unknown)
2. Does NOT contain R or I
3. Does not place A in position 2, S in position 4, or E in position 5

We need to move A, S, E to different positions. One common approach is to rearrange these letters and add new consonants to test. Good consonants to test next might be T, N, L, C, etc.

A possible word that uses A, S, E without the forbidden letters: ""STEAL"" - but this uses R which is forbidden. Let's think of others.

How about ""SHEET""? - but this repeats E and doesn't use A. Not ideal.

Let's try ""CHASE"" - uses C, H, and moves S to position 1, A to position 3, E to position 5 (but E was in position 5 in RAISE, so this would be wrong).

""TEASE"" - uses T, and moves E to position 2, A to position 3, S to position 4 (but S was in position 4 originally, so this is wrong).

""LEASE"" - uses L, and moves A to 1, E to 2, S to 3 - this seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:
- R and I are not in ""LEASE"" ✔
- Contains A, S, E ✔
- A is in position 1 (was in 2) ✔
- S is in position 3 (was in 4) ✔
- E is in position 2 (was in 5) ✔

This looks good.Based on the feedback:
- R and I are not in the word
- A, S, and E are all in the word but in wrong positions in RAISE
- I need to place A, S, E in new positions while avoiding R and I

The word ""LEASE"" uses:
- L (new consonant)
- E (new position 2)
- A (new position 1)
- S (new position 3)
- E (appears again, but this is acceptable as we know E is present)

Guess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know.

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 2, 3)
- S (not in position 3, 4)
- E (not in position 2, 5)

Known letters that ARE NOT in the word:
- R, I, L

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each (because duplicates would have shown as repeated feedback letters) and must also contain two more distinct consonants, none of which are R, I, L.

Positions that seem most constrained so far:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

We have five positions and three known letters: A, S, E. We need to place them along with two new consonants that have not been used yet (e.g., N, T, C, D, H, etc.).

Let’s try to place the known letters in the remaining valid positions and pick two new consonants. One systematic way is to list possible placements:

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are out)
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since 2 and 3 are out)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are out)

These positions must be unique for each letter.

Let’s try S in 1, A in 4, E in 3: S _ E A _

We need two consonants (not R, I, L) for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s pick N and T: S N E A T → “SNEAT” – not a valid English word.

Try S in 2, A in 4, E in 3: _ S E A _ → need consonants for 1 and 5.

Pick N and T: N S E A T → “NSEAT” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ S → pick N and T: A N E T S → “ANETS” – not a word.

Try S in 1, A in 5, E in 3: S _ E _ A → pick N and T: S N E T A → “SNETA” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A S → pick N and T: E N T A S → “ENTAS” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E S → pick N and T: A N T E S → “ANTES” – this is a valid word (“antes” – the plural of ante, as in poker).

Let’s verify positions:
- S is now in 5 (allowed)
- A is now in 1 (allowed)
- E is now in 4 (allowed)
- Letters used: A, N, T, E, S – none are forbidden.

Thus “ANTES” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate the feedback so far.

1. Letters we know are in the word (but in wrong positions):
   A, S, E, T (all four have appeared with “-” at least once)

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word:
   R, I, L, N

3. Additional placement constraints gathered from the three guesses
   (positions are 1-5):

   A: not in 2, 3, 1 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 4 or 5 left.
   S: not in 3, 4, 5 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 2 left.
   E: not in 2, 5, 4 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 3 left.
   T: not in 3 (from ANTES) ⇒ still free in 1,2,4,5.

We must place A, S, E, T exactly once each, plus one new consonant (cannot be R, I, L, N).
Available consonants we haven’t tested yet include C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Quick check for conflicts:
- S can be 1 or 2.
- A can be 4 or 5.
- E can be 1 or 3.

Case 1: S in 1
   Then E must be 3 (cannot also be 1), so:
   S _ E _ _
   A must be 4 or 5, T must go in the remaining slot plus the new consonant.

   Sub-case 1a: A in 4
       S _ E A _  → need T and a new consonant in 2 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (already E) and 3 is taken anyway.

       Pick H for 2 → S H E A T → SHEAT (valid: past tense of “sheet” or “sheat” dialectal).
       That’s a possible guess: SHEAT.

   Sub-case 1b: A in 5
       S _ E _ A  → need T and a new consonant for 2 and 4.
       T in 2 and new consonant in 4 → S T E _ A → STE_A → STEGA (not a word).
       T in 4 and new consonant in 2 → S _ E T A → S C E T A → SCETA (invalid).

Case 2: S in 2
   Then E must be 1 or 3.

   Sub-case 2a: E in 1
       E S _ _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in remaining two.
       A in 4 → E S _ A _ → need T and new consonant for 3 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (was marked - in ANTES, so 3 is allowed now? Wait, ANTES had T in 3 and feedback was “-”, meaning T is in the word but not in 3. So 3 is free except T cannot be there. Therefore T must go to 2 or 4 or 5. 2 is S, 4 is A, so T must go to 5.
       Then new consonant must go to 3 → E S D A T → ESDAT (invalid).
       E S H A T → ESHAT (invalid).

   Sub-case 2b: E in 3
       _ S E _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in 1 and remaining.
       A in 4 → _ S E A _ → 1 and 5 for T and new consonant.
       Put T in 1 and new consonant in 5 → T S E A _ → TSEAX (invalid).
       Put new consonant in 1 and T in 5 → C S E A T → CSEAT (invalid).
       A in 5 → _ S E _ A → 1 and 4 for T and new consonant.
       T in 1, new consonant in 4 → T S E C A → TSECA (invalid).
       New consonant in 1, T in 4 → D S E T A → DSETA (invalid).

The only valid word that emerges cleanly is “SHEAT” in Case 1a.

Let’s double-check:
Letters: S, H, E, A, T
- None of R, I, L, N appear ✓
- A is in 4 (allowed) ✓

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can give us maximum information about the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically contain common consonants and vowels to quickly rule in or rule out many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". These all contain a good mix of common letters. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This seems like a solid first choice to maximize information.

However, another strong contender is ""RAISE"" - it has R, A, I, S, E. This covers all five major vowels (A, E, I) plus R and S which are very common consonants. Between these, ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes 'I' which isn't in ""AROSE"".

After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems like the optimal first guess due to its excellent letter coverage.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: A, S, E (but their positions are wrong)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (positions still unknown)
2. Does NOT contain R or I
3. Does not place A in position 2, S in position 4, or E in position 5

We need to move A, S, E to different positions. One common approach is to rearrange these letters and add new consonants to test. Good consonants to test next might be T, N, L, C, etc.

A possible word that uses A, S, E without the forbidden letters: ""STEAL"" - but this uses R which is forbidden. Let's think of others.

How about ""SHEET""? - but this repeats E and doesn't use A. Not ideal.

Let's try ""CHASE"" - uses C, H, and moves S to position 1, A to position 3, E to position 5 (but E was in position 5 in RAISE, so this would be wrong).

""TEASE"" - uses T, and moves E to position 2, A to position 3, S to position 4 (but S was in position 4 originally, so this is wrong).

""LEASE"" - uses L, and moves A to 1, E to 2, S to 3 - this seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:
- R and I are not in ""LEASE"" ✔
- Contains A, S, E ✔
- A is in position 1 (was in 2) ✔
- S is in position 3 (was in 4) ✔
- E is in position 2 (was in 5) ✔

This looks good.Based on the feedback:
- R and I are not in the word
- A, S, and E are all in the word but in wrong positions in RAISE
- I need to place A, S, E in new positions while avoiding R and I

The word ""LEASE"" uses:
- L (new consonant)
- E (new position 2)
- A (new position 1)
- S (new position 3)
- E (appears again, but this is acceptable as we know E is present)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know.

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 2, 3)
- S (not in position 3, 4)
- E (not in position 2, 5)

Known letters that ARE NOT in the word:
- R, I, L

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each (because duplicates would have shown as repeated feedback letters) and must also contain two more distinct consonants, none of which are R, I, L.

Positions that seem most constrained so far:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

We have five positions and three known letters: A, S, E. We need to place them along with two new consonants that have not been used yet (e.g., N, T, C, D, H, etc.).

Let’s try to place the known letters in the remaining valid positions and pick two new consonants. One systematic way is to list possible placements:

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are out)
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since 2 and 3 are out)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are out)

These positions must be unique for each letter.

Let’s try S in 1, A in 4, E in 3: S _ E A _

We need two consonants (not R, I, L) for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s pick N and T: S N E A T → “SNEAT” – not a valid English word.

Try S in 2, A in 4, E in 3: _ S E A _ → need consonants for 1 and 5.

Pick N and T: N S E A T → “NSEAT” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ S → pick N and T: A N E T S → “ANETS” – not a word.

Try S in 1, A in 5, E in 3: S _ E _ A → pick N and T: S N E T A → “SNETA” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A S → pick N and T: E N T A S → “ENTAS” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E S → pick N and T: A N T E S → “ANTES” – this is a valid word (“antes” – the plural of ante, as in poker).

Let’s verify positions:
- S is now in 5 (allowed)
- A is now in 1 (allowed)
- E is now in 4 (allowed)
- Letters used: A, N, T, E, S – none are forbidden.

Thus “ANTES” is a valid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the feedback so far.

1. Letters we know are in the word (but in wrong positions):
   A, S, E, T (all four have appeared with “-” at least once)

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word:
   R, I, L, N

3. Additional placement constraints gathered from the three guesses
   (positions are 1-5):

   A: not in 2, 3, 1 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 4 or 5 left.
   S: not in 3, 4, 5 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 2 left.
   E: not in 2, 5, 4 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 3 left.
   T: not in 3 (from ANTES) ⇒ still free in 1,2,4,5.

We must place A, S, E, T exactly once each, plus one new consonant (cannot be R, I, L, N).
Available consonants we haven’t tested yet include C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Quick check for conflicts:
- S can be 1 or 2.
- A can be 4 or 5.
- E can be 1 or 3.

Case 1: S in 1
   Then E must be 3 (cannot also be 1), so:
   S _ E _ _
   A must be 4 or 5, T must go in the remaining slot plus the new consonant.

   Sub-case 1a: A in 4
       S _ E A _  → need T and a new consonant in 2 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (already E) and 3 is taken anyway.
       Let’s pick C for 2 and T for 5 → S C E A T → SCETA (not a word).
       Pick H for 2 → S H E A T → SHEAT (valid: past tense of “sheet” or “sheat” dialectal).
       That’s a possible guess: SHEAT.

   Sub-case 1b: A in 5
       S _ E _ A  → need T and a new consonant for 2 and 4.
       T in 2 and new consonant in 4 → S T E _ A → STE_A → STEGA (not a word).
       T in 4 and new consonant in 2 → S _ E T A → S C E T A → SCETA (invalid).

Case 2: S in 2
   Then E must be 1 or 3.

   Sub-case 2a: E in 1
       E S _ _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in remaining two.
       A in 4 → E S _ A _ → need T and new consonant for 3 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (was marked - in ANTES, so 3 is allowed now? Wait, ANTES had T in 3 and feedback was “-”, meaning T is in the word but not in 3. So 3 is free except T cannot be there. Therefore T must go to 2 or 4 or 5. 2 is S, 4 is A, so T must go to 5.
       Then new consonant must go to 3 → E S D A T → ESDAT (invalid).
       E S H A T → ESHAT (invalid).

   Sub-case 2b: E in 3
       _ S E _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in 1 and remaining.
       A in 4 → _ S E A _ → 1 and 5 for T and new consonant.
       Put T in 1 and new consonant in 5 → T S E A _ → TSEAX (invalid).
       Put new consonant in 1 and T in 5 → C S E A T → CSEAT (invalid).
       A in 5 → _ S E _ A → 1 and 4 for T and new consonant.
       T in 1, new consonant in 4 → T S E C A → TSECA (invalid).
       New consonant in 1, T in 4 → D S E T A → DSETA (invalid).

The only valid word that emerges cleanly is “SHEAT” in Case 1a.

Let’s double-check:
Letters: S, H, E, A, T
- None of R, I, L, N appear ✓
- A is in 4 (allowed) ✓
- S is in 1 (allowed) ✓
- E is in 3 (allowed) ✓
- T is in 5 (no restriction) ✓
- H is a new untested consonant ✓
- “SHEAT” is listed in some dictionaries as valid (past tense of sheet, dialectal) and acceptable in Wordle wordlists.

So we’ll go with SHEAT.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that can give us maximum information about the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically contain common consonants and vowels to quickly rule in or rule out many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular strong first guesses include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". These all contain a good mix of common letters. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This seems like a solid first choice to maximize information.

However, another strong contender is ""RAISE"" - it has R, A, I, S, E. This covers all five major vowels (A, E, I) plus R and S which are very common consonants. Between these, ""RAISE"" might be slightly better as it includes 'I' which isn't in ""AROSE"".

After consideration, ""RAISE"" seems like the optimal first guess due to its excellent letter coverage.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: A, S, E (but their positions are wrong)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, E (positions still unknown)
2. Does NOT contain R or I
3. Does not place A in position 2, S in position 4, or E in position 5

We need to move A, S, E to different positions. One common approach is to rearrange these letters and add new consonants to test. Good consonants to test next might be T, N, L, C, etc.

A possible word that uses A, S, E without the forbidden letters: ""STEAL"" - but this uses R which is forbidden. Let's think of others.

How about ""SHEET""? - but this repeats E and doesn't use A. Not ideal.

Let's try ""CHASE"" - uses C, H, and moves S to position 1, A to position 3, E to position 5 (but E was in position 5 in RAISE, so this would be wrong).

""TEASE"" - uses T, and moves E to position 2, A to position 3, S to position 4 (but S was in position 4 originally, so this is wrong).

""LEASE"" - uses L, and moves A to 1, E to 2, S to 3 - this seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:
- R and I are not in ""LEASE"" ✔
- Contains A, S, E ✔
- A is in position 1 (was in 2) ✔
- S is in position 3 (was in 4) ✔
- E is in position 2 (was in 5) ✔

This looks good.Based on the feedback:
- R and I are not in the word
- A, S, and E are all in the word but in wrong positions in RAISE
- I need to place A, S, E in new positions while avoiding R and I

The word ""LEASE"" uses:
- L (new consonant)
- E (new position 2)
- A (new position 1)
- S (new position 3)
- E (appears again, but this is acceptable as we know E is present)

Guess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know.

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- A (not in position 2, 3)
- S (not in position 3, 4)
- E (not in position 2, 5)

Known letters that ARE NOT in the word:
- R, I, L

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each (because duplicates would have shown as repeated feedback letters) and must also contain two more distinct consonants, none of which are R, I, L.

Positions that seem most constrained so far:
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

We have five positions and three known letters: A, S, E. We need to place them along with two new consonants that have not been used yet (e.g., N, T, C, D, H, etc.).

Let’s try to place the known letters in the remaining valid positions and pick two new consonants. One systematic way is to list possible placements:

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are out)
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5 (since 2 and 3 are out)
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are out)

These positions must be unique for each letter.

Let’s try S in 1, A in 4, E in 3: S _ E A _

We need two consonants (not R, I, L) for positions 2 and 5.

Let’s pick N and T: S N E A T → “SNEAT” – not a valid English word.

Try S in 2, A in 4, E in 3: _ S E A _ → need consonants for 1 and 5.

Pick N and T: N S E A T → “NSEAT” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ S → pick N and T: A N E T S → “ANETS” – not a word.

Try S in 1, A in 5, E in 3: S _ E _ A → pick N and T: S N E T A → “SNETA” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 4, E in 1: E _ _ A S → pick N and T: E N T A S → “ENTAS” – not a word.

Try S in 5, A in 1, E in 4: A _ _ E S → pick N and T: A N T E S → “ANTES” – this is a valid word (“antes” – the plural of ante, as in poker).

Let’s verify positions:
- S is now in 5 (allowed)
- A is now in 1 (allowed)
- E is now in 4 (allowed)
- Letters used: A, N, T, E, S – none are forbidden.

Thus “ANTES” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: ANTES -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the feedback so far.

1. Letters we know are in the word (but in wrong positions):
   A, S, E, T (all four have appeared with “-” at least once)

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word:
   R, I, L, N

3. Additional placement constraints gathered from the three guesses
   (positions are 1-5):

   A: not in 2, 3, 1 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 4 or 5 left.
   S: not in 3, 4, 5 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 2 left.
   E: not in 2, 5, 4 (from RAISE, LEASE, ANTES) ⇒ only 1 or 3 left.
   T: not in 3 (from ANTES) ⇒ still free in 1,2,4,5.

We must place A, S, E, T exactly once each, plus one new consonant (cannot be R, I, L, N).
Available consonants we haven’t tested yet include C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Quick check for conflicts:
- S can be 1 or 2.
- A can be 4 or 5.
- E can be 1 or 3.

Case 1: S in 1
   Then E must be 3 (cannot also be 1), so:
   S _ E _ _
   A must be 4 or 5, T must go in the remaining slot plus the new consonant.

   Sub-case 1a: A in 4
       S _ E A _  → need T and a new consonant in 2 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (already E) and 3 is taken anyway.
       Let’s pick C for 2 and T for 5 → S C E A T → SCETA (not a word).
       Pick H for 2 → S H E A T → SHEAT (valid: past tense of “sheet” or “sheat” dialectal).
       That’s a possible guess: SHEAT.

   Sub-case 1b: A in 5
       S _ E _ A  → need T and a new consonant for 2 and 4.
       T in 2 and new consonant in 4 → S T E _ A → STE_A → STEGA (not a word).
       T in 4 and new consonant in 2 → S _ E T A → S C E T A → SCETA (invalid).

Case 2: S in 2
   Then E must be 1 or 3.

   Sub-case 2a: E in 1
       E S _ _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in remaining two.
       A in 4 → E S _ A _ → need T and new consonant for 3 and 5.
       T cannot be 3 (was marked - in ANTES, so 3 is allowed now? Wait, ANTES had T in 3 and feedback was “-”, meaning T is in the word but not in 3. So 3 is free except T cannot be there. Therefore T must go to 2 or 4 or 5. 2 is S, 4 is A, so T must go to 5.
       Then new consonant must go to 3 → E S D A T → ESDAT (invalid).
       E S H A T → ESHAT (invalid).

   Sub-case 2b: E in 3
       _ S E _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in 1 and remaining.
       A in 4 → _ S E A _ → 1 and 5 for T and new consonant.
       Put T in 1 and new consonant in 5 → T S E A _ → TSEAX (invalid).
       Put new consonant in 1 and T in 5 → C S E A T → CSEAT (invalid).
       A in 5 → _ S E _ A → 1 and 4 for T and new consonant.
       T in 1, new consonant in 4 → T S E C A → TSECA (invalid).
       New consonant in 1, T in 4 → D S E T A → DSETA (invalid).

The only valid word that emerges cleanly is “SHEAT” in Case 1a.

Let’s double-check:
Letters: S, H, E, A, T
- None of R, I, L, N appear ✓
- A is in 4 (allowed) ✓
- S is in 1 (allowed) ✓
- E is in 3 (allowed) ✓
- T is in 5 (no restriction) ✓
- H is a new untested consonant ✓
- “SHEAT” is listed in some dictionaries as valid (past tense of sheet, dialectal) and acceptable in Wordle wordlists.

So we’ll go with SHEAT.

So the secret word looks like:
S _ E A _

and the missing letter must be T (because we know T is in the word and cannot be in position 5).

The only place left for T is position 2:
S T E A _ — but that would put T in position 2, which is allowed.

We need a real 5-letter word that matches “S T E A _”.

Possible completions:
- STEAK  (5th letter K)
- STEAL  (but L is already ruled out)
- STEAM  (M not yet ruled out)
- STEAN  (N already ruled out)
- STEAP  (not a word)
- STEAR  (R already ruled out)
- STEAT  (not a word)

The only valid word is STEAK.

Let’s check constraints:
- Contains S, E, A, T exactly once ✔
- S in position 1 ✔ (matches ✓)
- E in position 3 ✔ (matches ✓)
- A in position 4 ✔ (matches ✓)
- T in position 2 (allowed; previous feedback said T is in the word but not in position 5)

Therefore T must go to 2 or 4 or 5. 2 is S, 4 is A, so T must go to 5.\n       Then new consonant must go to 3 → E S D A T → ESDAT (invalid).\n       E S H A T → ESHAT (invalid).\n\n   Sub-case 2b: E in 3\n       _ S E _ _ → A must be 4 or 5, T and new consonant in 1 and remaining.\n       A in 4 → _ S E A _ → 1 and 5 for T and new consonant.\n       Put T in 1 and new consonant in 5 → T S E A _ → TSEAX (invalid).\n       Put new consonant in 1 and T in 5 → C S E A T → CSEAT (invalid).\n       A in 5 → _ S E _ A → 1 and 4 for T and new consonant.\n       T in 1, new consonant in 4 → T S E C A → TSECA (invalid).\n       New consonant in 1, T in 4 → D S E T A → DSETA (invalid).\n\nThe only valid word that emerges cleanly is “SHEAT” in Case 1a.\n\nLet’s double-check:\nLetters: S, H, E, A, T\n- None of R, I, L, N appear ✓\n- A is in 4 (allowed) ✓\n- S is in 1 (allowed) ✓\n- E is in 3 (allowed) ✓\n- T is in 5 (no restriction) ✓\n- H is a new untested consonant ✓\n- “SHEAT” is listed in some dictionaries as valid (past tense of sheet, dialectal) and acceptable in Wordle wordlists.\n\nSo we’ll go with SHEAT.\n\n<guess>SHEAT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 3: ANTES -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 4: SHEAT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have the strongest information yet:\n\nPositions:\n1  S(✓)\n2  H(x) → H is not in the word\n3  E(✓)\n4  A(✓)\n5  T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo the secret word looks like:\nS _ E A _\n\nand the missing letter must be T (because we know T is in the word and cannot be in position 5).\n\nThe only place left for T is position 2:\nS T E A _ — but that would put T in position 2, which is allowed.\n\nWe need a real 5-letter word that matches “S T E A _”.\n\nPossible completions:\n- STEAK  (5th letter K)\n- STEAL  (but L is already ruled out)\n- STEAM  (M not yet ruled out)\n- STEAN  (N already ruled out)\n- STEAP  (not a word)\n- STEAR  (R already ruled out)\n- STEAT  (not a word)\n\nThe only valid word is STEAK.\n\nLet’s check constraints:\n- Contains S, E, A, T exactly once ✔\n- S in position 1 ✔ (matches ✓)\n- E in position 3 ✔ (matches ✓)\n- A in position 4 ✔ (matches ✓)\n- T in position 2 (allowed; previous feedback said T is in the word but not in position 5)\n- K is a new consonant, not yet ruled out ✔\n\n<guess>STEAK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 3: ANTES -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 4: SHEAT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(-)\nGuess 5: STEAK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the feedback on STEAK:

Positions:
1  S(✓) – correct
2  T(✓) – correct
3  E(✓) – correct
4  A(✓) – correct
5  K(x) – K is NOT in the word

Therefore the secret word must be  
S T E A _  
with position 5 still unknown but excluding K.

Looking back, we already know:
- letters in word: S, T, E, A
- letters NOT in word: R, I, L, N, H, K

We have never tried the remaining common consonants (C, D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.) in position 5.

The only obvious valid 5-letter word that fits S T E A _ is:

STEAD – which uses D for the last letter (D has never been ruled out).
