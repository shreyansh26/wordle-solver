For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has several common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- No repeated letters
- Good positional coverage

Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, SAINT, CRISP, RAISE, etc. Looking at these, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong choice because it contains:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: The most common vowel

This combination should give us good information about which of these letters are in the target word and their positions.

From the first guess (CRANE) we know:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word and is at the rightmost position (position 5).

So the unknown word ends in E and contains none of C, R, A, N.

We still have most of the alphabet available. Next we want to probe more common vowels and consonants to find the remaining four letters. Good remaining letters are: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

A strong second guess should:
- Keep E fixed at the end.
- Introduce new common letters, especially vowels like I and O.
- Avoid any letters already eliminated (C, R, A, N).

Looking at that, ""STOIE"" would test S, T, O, I with E known. But ""STOIE"" isn’t a valid English word.  
Valid options that fit: ""SLIDE"", ""SPITE"", ""SHITE"", ""SMILE"", ""STONE"", ""STOLE"", etc.

Among these, ""STONE"" is a very common word and tests S, T, O, N. But N is already eliminated.  
Another: ""SLIDE"" tests S, L, I, D with E fixed. Looks good.

From the three guesses we now have the following constraints:

Known positions:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 5: E

Letters known NOT in the word:
C, R, A, N, S, I, D, G, V

Remaining unused common letters include:
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with these letters while keeping the known fixed letters in place.

Possible patterns:
- _ L O _ E

Common English 5-letter words fitting _ L O _ E:
- BLOKE
- FLOTE (not a word)
- PLOTE (not a word)
- BLOWE (not a word)
- PLOVE (not a word)
- BLORE (not a word)

Looking at valid words:
- BLOKE (slang for guy)
- BLOPE (not valid)
- PLOPE (not valid)

BLOKE seems to be the most common valid word left to test.
