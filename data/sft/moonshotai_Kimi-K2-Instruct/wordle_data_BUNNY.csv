For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and common positions. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:

- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently
- No repeating letters, maximizing letter coverage

This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters in English while maintaining a valid 5-letter word. After this guess, the feedback will help us eliminate many possibilities and narrow down the correct word.

Feedback recap:
- AROSE – every letter (A, R, O, S, E) is NOT in the word at all (all marked “x”).

That means we can eliminate any 5-letter word containing A, R, O, S, or E.
To maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses none of those five letters.
2. Contains letters that are still common in English but weren’t in the first guess (e.g., I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, Y, etc.).
3. Has no duplicate letters so we test five new letters.

A strong candidate is “UNITY”:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y
- None of A, R, O, S, E appear.
- Covers high-frequency consonants N and T, plus two vowels U and I.

From the feedback so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, I, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but not yet in the correct position: U, N  
Letters that ARE in the word and ARE in the correct position: Y (in position 5)

So the pattern we seek looks like: _ _ _ _ Y  
and must include both U and N somewhere in the first four positions (but not in the positions we tried before).

To gather more information, we need a word that:
- ends with Y
- uses both U and N
- does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, I, T
- avoids repeating letters we already know are absent.

A clean candidate is “FUNNY” – but it contains N twice (and one N is already ruled out for position 2), so that’s inefficient.  
Another candidate is “UNFED” – but it contains E and D, and E is banned.  

Looking for remaining high-frequency consonants and vowels that are still allowed:  
Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus U, N, Y.

A solid choice is “LUNGY”:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains both required letters U and N.
- Uses L and G, which are still untested.
- Doesn’t use any banned letters.

With this guess we will learn the positions of U and N and confirm / eliminate L and G.

From the feedback so far:

Fixed: The word ends in Y (position 5).

Letters known to be in the word:
- U – confirmed in position 2 (from LUNGY feedback: U✓ in slot 2)
- N – confirmed in position 3 (from LUNGY feedback: N✓ in slot 3)
- Y – confirmed in position 5

Letters known NOT to appear anywhere: A, R, O, S, E, I, T, L, G

So the pattern is: _ U N _ Y

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen only from the remaining unused alphabet that do not include any of the banned letters.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4 (and not yet used): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common consonants among these: C, D, F, H, K, M, P, B

Goal of next guess: pick a word matching _ U N _ Y while testing two new letters that are still allowed, to narrow down the missing pair.

Candidate words that fit _ U N _ Y:
- BUNNY – repeats N (invalid, N already placed)
- DUNKY – contains D and K, but K might be in position 4

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and common positions. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:

- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently
- No repeating letters, maximizing letter coverage

This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters in English while maintaining a valid 5-letter word. After this guess, the feedback will help us eliminate many possibilities and narrow down the correct word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
- AROSE – every letter (A, R, O, S, E) is NOT in the word at all (all marked “x”).

That means we can eliminate any 5-letter word containing A, R, O, S, or E.
To maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses none of those five letters.
2. Contains letters that are still common in English but weren’t in the first guess (e.g., I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, Y, etc.).
3. Has no duplicate letters so we test five new letters.

A strong candidate is “UNITY”:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y
- None of A, R, O, S, E appear.
- Covers high-frequency consonants N and T, plus two vowels U and I.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, I, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but not yet in the correct position: U, N  
Letters that ARE in the word and ARE in the correct position: Y (in position 5)

So the pattern we seek looks like: _ _ _ _ Y  
and must include both U and N somewhere in the first four positions (but not in the positions we tried before).

To gather more information, we need a word that:
- ends with Y
- uses both U and N
- does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, I, T
- avoids repeating letters we already know are absent.

A clean candidate is “FUNNY” – but it contains N twice (and one N is already ruled out for position 2), so that’s inefficient.  
Another candidate is “UNFED” – but it contains E and D, and E is banned.  

Looking for remaining high-frequency consonants and vowels that are still allowed:  
Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus U, N, Y.

A solid choice is “LUNGY”:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains both required letters U and N.
- Uses L and G, which are still untested.
- Doesn’t use any banned letters.

With this guess we will learn the positions of U and N and confirm / eliminate L and G.

   B, C, F, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   (must not be any of the excluded ones)

4. We need a valid English word matching B/F/H/J/M/P/Q/V/W/X/Z + U N + B/F/H/J/M/P/Q/V/W/X/Z + Y  
   that uses two distinct letters from the allowed set.

   JUNKY – J in 1, K in 4, but K is excluded.  
   MUNKY – M in 1, K in 4, K excluded.  
   PUNKY – P in 1, K in 4, K excluded.  
   V? – no common word “VUNXY” etc.  
   W? – “WUNXY” not a word.  
   X? – “XUNNY” not a word.  
   Z? – “ZUNNY” not a word.  

   The only remaining high-frequency letter pair that forms a real word is B and B again, but “BUNBY” is not a recognized English word.

   However, “BUNNY” is listed in standard dictionaries, but it repeats N.  
   Rechecking: the word must be _ U N _ Y with distinct letters in 1 and 4.

Looking more carefully, the only valid English word that exactly fits _ U N _ Y and uses two new, non-excluded letters is:

   B U N N Y – but position 4 would be N, which is already in position 3 and thus must be unique?  
   Actually the game rules allow letters to repeat, but feedback would have marked a second N in LUNGY or DUNKY if it were needed.  
   But in LUNGY we only had one N and it was marked ✓ in slot 3, so a second N in slot 4 would have been indicated somehow.  
   Since that hasn’t happened, we can assume no repetition.

Next option: F U N N Y – same issue.

C U N N Y – not a valid word.

H U N N Y – not valid.

P U N N Y – likewise.

There is actually only one other common word left: “BUNNY”, but it has a double N. Re-reading the feedback rules: the game does not prevent double letters; it just shows “-” if the extra letter exists but is in the wrong place. Since we only have one N confirmed in position 3, a second N in position 4 is still allowed.

“BUNNY” is therefore a legal test. It will tell us whether position 4 is N (making the word B U N N Y) or whether we need another letter.  
But B U N N Y is a valid 5-letter word, and B has not been tried yet.

So the safest single-guess move is BUNNY.

If that fails, we’ll know we need a different letter for slot 4 (e.g., B U N C Y – but C is still allowed).  
However, we have only two guesses left and we want to maximize information.
