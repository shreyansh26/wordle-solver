1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels as possible to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 different vowels and common consonants.

Looking at options like:
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

""ARISE"" seems particularly good because it uses 5 distinct letters including 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to detect which letters are in the target word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 different vowels and common consonants.

Looking at options like:
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

""ARISE"" seems particularly good because it uses 5 distinct letters including 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to detect which letters are in the target word.

- None of A, R, I, E occur in the secret word.
- S appears somewhere in the word, but not in the 4th position.

Since we have eliminated four vowels (A, I, E and the R is also out), the remaining common vowels are O and U.  
We still want to use S, and we should sprinkle in other very common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet, such as T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Deductions:
1. Letters **A, R, I, E, O, N, D** are all absent.
2. The word **must contain** both **S** and **U**, but:
   - S is **not** in position 1 (from SOUND) and **not** in position 4 (from ARISE).
   - U is **not** in position 3 (from SOUND).

So:
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- U must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We still need to explore the remaining common consonants: **T, L, C, M, P, H, B, F, G, K, Y** etc.  
A good next guess should:
- Include both S and U in the allowed positions.
- Introduce three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate word:  
**STUCK**
- S in position 1: ruled out (from SOUND).  
**PLUSH**
- U in position 3: ruled out (from SOUND).  
**LUSTY**
- S in position 3: allowed.
- U in position 2: allowed.
- L, T, Y are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good next guess should:
- Include both S and U in the allowed positions.
- Introduce three new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate word:  
**STUCK**
- S in position 1: ruled out (from SOUND).  
**PLUSH**
- U in position 3: ruled out (from SOUND).  
**LUSTY**
- S in position 3: allowed.
- U in position 2: allowed.
- L, T, Y are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

So “LUSTY” satisfies all constraints.

<guess>LUSTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: LUSTY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(x), R(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
   ⇒ letters A, R, I, E are out; S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
   ⇒ letters O, N, D are out; U is in the word but not in position 3; S is in the word but not in position 1.

3. LUSTY → L(x), U(✓), S(✓), T(x), Y(✓)  
   ⇒ letters L, T are out;  
   ⇒ we now know the exact positions of three letters:  
      - U is in position 2  
      - S is in position 3  
      - Y is in position 5  

Current pattern: _ U S _ Y

Letters still unused that have never been marked absent:
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4.  
We should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
Choosing “C” and “H” gives the word “CHUSY”, but that isn’t a valid English word.  
“M” and “P” give “MUSPY” – also invalid.  
“F” and “H” give “FUSHY” – invalid.  
“B” and “H” give “BUSHY” – this is a valid English word.

Check positions:
- B: new letter, allowed in position 1  
- U: fixed in position 2  
- S: fixed in position 3  
- H: new letter, allowed in position 4  
- Y: fixed in position 5  

Thus the next logical guess is BUSHY.

The only unknown is the first letter:

 _ U S H Y  

Letters already ruled out include: A, R, I, E, O, N, D, L, T, B.  
Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Z.

Valid 5-letter English words that end in “USHY”:

- GUSHY  
- MUSHY  
- PUSHY  

All three are real words.  
Among them, “GUSHY” uses G, which is still untested, so let’s try it.

Pattern: G U S H Y
