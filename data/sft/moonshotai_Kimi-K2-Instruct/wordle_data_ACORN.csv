moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,ACORN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and which are not. 

Common high-frequency letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, all high-frequency letters without repetition. This gives us a strong starting point to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the first feedback:
- A is correct in the 1st position (A _ _ _ _)
- O is correct in the 3rd position (A _ O _ _)
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position
- S and E are not in the word at all

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ O _ _
- Contains R somewhere (but not 2nd)
- Does not contain S or E

Next, we need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the 3rd position
3. Contains R (but not in 2nd)
4. Uses letters not yet tried (since S/E are out)

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, C, D, P, etc. We should also include R in a new position. Possible positions for R: 2nd, 4th, or 5th (but 2nd is excluded from feedback). 

A good candidate is ""ABORT"":

- O (✓) in spot 3

- B and T are NOT in the word

Letters still unknown: 2 and 5, using only unused letters.

Letters already used / ruled out:
A, R, O (correct)
S, E, B, T (absent)

Remaining common consonants and vowels:

We need to pick two of these for spots 2 and 5 and form a valid English word.
