1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct for maximum coverage

From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:
- R is in the correct position (position 2)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position
- E is in the word but in the wrong position
- O and S are NOT in the word

So the pattern is:
- _ R _ _ _
- Must contain A somewhere (but not position 1)
- Must contain E somewhere (but not position 5)
- Cannot use O or S

Good letters to try next: consonants like T, N, L, D, G, C, M, plus remaining vowels I, U.

A logical next word would use the known letters (R in 2nd, A/E elsewhere) and test new common consonants. ""TRADE"" fits:
- R in position 2 ✓
- Tests T for position 1
- D for position 4
- A and E are moved to new positions (A to 3, E to 5 which isn't allowed since E can't be 5 - oops!)

Wait, E can't be in position 5 and A can't be in position 1. Let me rethink. ""TREAD"" would be better:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,TRADE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Checking which of these form a standard English word:
