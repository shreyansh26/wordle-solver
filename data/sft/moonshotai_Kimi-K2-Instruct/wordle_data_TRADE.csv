For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will maximize the amount of information gained. This means selecting a word that uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good strategies include:
1. Using common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Using common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. Avoiding repetition of letters to test more unique letters

A well-known optimal starting word for Wordle-type games is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
- All unique letters

However, another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which has similar properties with S, L, A, T, E.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words for information gain.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is R
- A: correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A
- N: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → 5th letter is E

So we know the pattern is: _ R A _ E

Letters not in the word: C, N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has A in position 3
3. Has E in position 5
4. Does not contain C or N

Common words fitting this pattern:
- GRATE
- CRANE (but C is excluded)
- BRACE (but C is excluded)
- GRADE
- GRAPE
- BRAVE
- DRATE (not a word)
- FRAME

From these, ""GRATE"" seems like a strong candidate as it uses G, T, and reuses A, R, E. It also has a good mix of remaining consonants and vowels to test new letters.
