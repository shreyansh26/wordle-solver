For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting strategies include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - though this has 4 vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It includes 3 very common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
3. It avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z that are unlikely to appear

This gives me good coverage to test multiple common letters and positions simultaneously.

Let’s condense everything we now know:

- Position 1: T (TRAMP)  
- Position 2: R (CRANE)  
- Position 3: A (CRANE)  
- Positions 1–5: Y is confirmed in position 5 (STRAY feedback)  

So the word ends in Y.  We need to place R, A, T in the first four positions under the restrictions above.

Remaining known letters to place: R, A, T (in positions 1-4, with forbidden spots noted).

Candidate letters for the remaining slot(s): any of the frequent letters not yet eliminated: L, D, H, K, B, F, G, etc.

A good template:  
_ _ _ _ Y

We must use R, A, T plus one new letter in the first four positions, avoiding:
- T in pos 1  
- R in pos 2  
- A in pos 3  

Possible permutations:
- Pos 1: R, A  
- Pos 2: T, A (but A must avoid pos 3)  
- Pos 3: R, T  
- Pos 4: R, A, T

Let’s pick a concrete word that satisfies:
- ends in Y  
- contains R, A, T  
- avoids the banned positions  

Try: ARTSY  
- A in pos 1 (allowed)  
- R in pos 2 (forbidden!) → discard

Try: RATLY — not a valid word.  

Try: TARDY

Try: HARDY (but H not yet confirmed) — but we must use R, A, T.  

Wait: we need exactly the letters R, A, T, Y, plus one more letter that hasn’t been excluded.  
List of still-allowed letters (not yet ruled out): L, D, H, K, B, F, G, I, O, U, etc.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words ending in Y that contain R, A, T plus one other allowed letter.

After scanning, “RATLY” isn’t valid.  
“TARRY” repeats R, but might be legal.  Let’s check constraints:

“TRYMA” – invalid (M excluded).

“LARTY” – not a word.

“DRATY” – not valid.

“GRATY” – not valid.

But “DRATY” isn’t in the dictionary.  A real word: “TARDY”.

Check TARDY:

“YARTY” – ending Y is already pos 5, but Y must be pos 5; word invalid.

“TRADY” – same issue.

“HARTY” – not valid.

Wait, the only real word left is “YARTY” but it’s invalid.

Real words:
- ARTSY (invalid, S banned)

- TARDY (invalid, T pos 1)  

We missed one: “RATSY” – S banned.

“DRATY” – not a word.

“GRATY” – not a word.

Wait: “TRYMA” – invalid.

Another approach: use a word that includes R, A, T, Y plus a safe extra letter, and ends in Y.

Real word: “TARDY” is the closest, but T in pos 1 is forbidden.

Next best: “HARTY” – not valid.

“FARTY” – slang, but not recognized.

“YARTY” – invalid.

“RATLY” – invalid.

“TRAY” – only 4 letters.

Thus, the only plausible real word left is “TARDY” but T is banned in position 1.

We have to allow the extra letter to be anywhere.  Re-examine the constraints:

We need a 5-letter word:
- ends in Y  
- contains R, A, T (at least once each)  
- no banned letters (C, N, E, M, P, S)  
- avoid T in pos 1, R in pos 2, A in pos 3  

Let’s list possible valid words ending in Y with R, A, T:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting strategies include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - though this has 4 vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It includes 3 very common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
3. It avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z that are unlikely to appear

This gives me good coverage to test multiple common letters and positions simultaneously.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- A: in word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
- It DOES contain R and A, but NOT in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

My next guess should:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Drop C, N, E.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Good candidates:
- PLAID (but I is less common, D might be okay)
- DRAMA (but repeats A)
- RADIO (already ruled out D and I)
- GRAPE (P not yet tested)
- TRAMP

TRAMP looks good:
- Has R and A in new positions (R in 1st, A in 3rd)
- Introduces T, M, P which are common untested letters
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E)

Let's go with TRAMP.

<guess>TRAMP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints from both guesses:

1. From CRANE:
   - C, N, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. From TRAMP:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - M and P are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in word: C, N, E, M, P.
- Letters definitely in word: R, A, T (in unknown positions, avoiding the ruled-out spots).

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A

The word must contain R, A, T and two other letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, N, E, M, P.

Good next steps:
- Place R, A, T in new positions (avoiding the ruled-out ones).
- Introduce common remaining letters like S, L, D, H, K, B, F, G, etc.

A strong candidate is STRAY:
- S: new, common letter
- T: allowed in position 2 (not ruled out for T)
- R: allowed in position 3 (not ruled out for R)
- A: allowed in position 4 (not ruled out for A)
- Y: new letter to test

Let’s check constraints:
- T not in pos 1: OK (pos 2)
- R not in pos 2: OK (pos 3)
- A not in pos 3: OK (pos 4)
- Contains R, A, T: yes
- No forbidden letters: yes

From the latest feedback on DARTY:

- D(x) – D is **not** in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 2).
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the **wrong** position (currently position 3).
- T(✓) – T is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) – Y is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the exact pattern:

_ A _ T Y

with:
- R must appear **somewhere** in the first, third, or fifth position (but fifth is already Y), so R must be in position 1 or 3.
- All letters used so far (A, R, T, Y) are confirmed and must appear exactly once each.
- Forbidden letters so far: C, N, E, M, P, S, D.

We need to fill position 1 and 3 with valid letters (not used yet), ensuring R appears in one of them.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,ratty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting strategies include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - though this has 4 vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It includes 3 very common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
2. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
3. It avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z that are unlikely to appear

This gives me good coverage to test multiple common letters and positions simultaneously.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- A: in word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
- It DOES contain R and A, but NOT in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

My next guess should:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Drop C, N, E.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Good candidates:
- PLAID (but I is less common, D might be okay)
- DRAMA (but repeats A)
- RADIO (already ruled out D and I)
- GRAPE (P not yet tested)
- TRAMP

TRAMP looks good:
- Has R and A in new positions (R in 1st, A in 3rd)
- Introduces T, M, P which are common untested letters
- No forbidden letters (C, N, E)

Let's go with TRAMP.

<guess>TRAMP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints from both guesses:

1. From CRANE:
   - C, N, E are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. From TRAMP:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).
   - M and P are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in word: C, N, E, M, P.
- Letters definitely in word: R, A, T (in unknown positions, avoiding the ruled-out spots).

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A

The word must contain R, A, T and two other letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, N, E, M, P.

Good next steps:
- Place R, A, T in new positions (avoiding the ruled-out ones).
- Introduce common remaining letters like S, L, D, H, K, B, F, G, etc.

A strong candidate is STRAY:
- S: new, common letter
- T: allowed in position 2 (not ruled out for T)
- R: allowed in position 3 (not ruled out for R)
- A: allowed in position 4 (not ruled out for A)
- Y: new letter to test

Let’s check constraints:
- T not in pos 1: OK (pos 2)
- R not in pos 2: OK (pos 3)
- A not in pos 3: OK (pos 4)
- Contains R, A, T: yes
- No forbidden letters: yes

STRAY seems good.

Guess 3: STRAY -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) R(-) A(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s condense everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, M, P, S  
Letters definitely IN the word: R, A, T, Y  

Positions ruled out so far:
- Position 1: T (TRAMP)  
- Position 2: R (CRANE)  
- Position 3: A (CRANE)  
- Positions 1–5: Y is confirmed in position 5 (STRAY feedback)  

So the word ends in Y.  We need to place R, A, T in the first four positions under the restrictions above.

Remaining known letters to place: R, A, T (in positions 1-4, with forbidden spots noted).

Candidate letters for the remaining slot(s): any of the frequent letters not yet eliminated: L, D, H, K, B, F, G, etc.

A good template:  
_ _ _ _ Y

We must use R, A, T plus one new letter in the first four positions, avoiding:
- T in pos 1  
- R in pos 2  
- A in pos 3  

Possible permutations:
- Pos 1: R, A  
- Pos 2: T, A (but A must avoid pos 3)  
- Pos 3: R, T  
- Pos 4: R, A, T

Let’s pick a concrete word that satisfies:
- ends in Y  
- contains R, A, T  
- avoids the banned positions  

Try: ARTSY  
- A in pos 1 (allowed)  
- R in pos 2 (forbidden!) → discard  

Try: PARTY  
- P is banned → discard  

Try: TRAY?  (but we need 5 letters, and Y is already pos 5) — wait, TRAY is 4 letters.  

Try: RATLY — not a valid word.  

Try: TARDY  
- T in pos 1 (forbidden) → discard  

Try: HARDY (but H not yet confirmed) — but we must use R, A, T.  

Wait: we need exactly the letters R, A, T, Y, plus one more letter that hasn’t been excluded.  
List of still-allowed letters (not yet ruled out): L, D, H, K, B, F, G, I, O, U, etc.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words ending in Y that contain R, A, T plus one other allowed letter.

After scanning, “RATLY” isn’t valid.  
“TARRY” repeats R, but might be legal.  Let’s check constraints:  
T A R R Y  
- T in pos 1 (forbidden) → discard.

“TRYMA” – invalid (M excluded).

“LARTY” – not a word.

“DRATY” – not valid.

“GRATY” – not valid.

But “DRATY” isn’t in the dictionary.  A real word: “TARDY”.

Check TARDY:
- T in pos 1 (forbidden) → discard.

“YARTY” – ending Y is already pos 5, but Y must be pos 5; word invalid.

“TRADY” – same issue.

“HARTY” – not valid.

“RATSY” – S is banned.

We need a valid English word ending in Y with R, A, T plus one other allowed letter, avoiding the positional constraints.

Real dictionary word: “ARTSY” – but S is banned.

Another: “TARDY” – T in pos 1.

“TRADY” – same.

Wait, the only real word left is “YARTY” but it’s invalid.

Let’s rethink: we need exactly one more letter not yet used.  Valid English words ending in Y and containing R, A, T:

- TRASHY – too long, extra letters.

Actually, let’s list 5-letter words ending in Y that contain R, A, T and no banned letters.

Real words:
- ARTSY (invalid, S banned)  
- TRADY (invalid, not a word)  
- TARDY (invalid, T pos 1)  

We missed one: “RATSY” – S banned.

“DRATY” – not a word.

“GRATY” – not a word.

Wait: “TRYMA” – invalid.

Another approach: use a word that includes R, A, T, Y plus a safe extra letter, and ends in Y.

Real word: “TARDY” is the closest, but T in pos 1 is forbidden.

Next best: “HARTY” – not valid.

“FARTY” – slang, but not recognized.

“YARTY” – invalid.

“RATLY” – invalid.

“TRAY” – only 4 letters.

Thus, the only plausible real word left is “TARDY” but T is banned in position 1.

We have to allow the extra letter to be anywhere.  Re-examine the constraints:

We need a 5-letter word:
- ends in Y  
- contains R, A, T (at least once each)  
- no banned letters (C, N, E, M, P, S)  
- avoid T in pos 1, R in pos 2, A in pos 3  

Let’s list possible valid words ending in Y with R, A, T:

- DARTY – valid (D, A, R, T, Y)  
Check constraints:
D A R T Y  
- T in pos 4 (allowed)  
- R in pos 3 (allowed)  
- A in pos 2 (allowed)  
- Y in pos 5 (as required)  
All letters allowed (no banned ones).

DARTY satisfies all current constraints.

So we now know the exact pattern:

_ A _ T Y

with:
- R must appear **somewhere** in the first, third, or fifth position (but fifth is already Y), so R must be in position 1 or 3.
- All letters used so far (A, R, T, Y) are confirmed and must appear exactly once each.
- Forbidden letters so far: C, N, E, M, P, S, D.

We need to fill position 1 and 3 with valid letters (not used yet), ensuring R appears in one of them.

Letters not yet ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, etc.

Possible candidates:
1. R A _ T Y → need a letter for position 3. Valid letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W.
   - R A B T Y – ""RABTY"" – not a valid word.
   - R A F T Y – ""RAFTY"" – not valid.
   - R A G T Y – ""RAGTY"" – invalid.
   - R A H T Y – ""RAHTY"" – invalid.
   - R A K T Y – ""RAKTY"" – invalid.
   - R A L T Y – ""RALTY"" – invalid.
   - R A O T Y – ""RAOTY"" – invalid.
   - R A U T Y – ""RAUTY"" – invalid.

2. _ A R T Y → need a letter for position 1.
   - B A R T Y – ""BARTY"" – valid word.
   - F A R T Y – ""FARTY"" – informal, but recognized.
   - G A R T Y – ""GARTY"" – invalid.
   - H A R T Y – ""HARTY"" – invalid.
   - K A R T Y – ""KARTY"" – invalid.
   - L A R T Y – ""LARTY"" – invalid.
   - O A R T Y – ""OARTY"" – invalid.
   - W A R T Y – ""WARTY"" – valid.

Between ""BARTY"" and ""WARTY"", ""WARTY"" is the more common word.

Let's choose ""WARTY"".

From all feedback we now know the exact pattern:

_ A _ T Y

with:
- A in position 2 ✓
- T in position 4 ✓
- Y in position 5 ✓
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (- in DARTY and WARTY), so R must be in position 1.
- Letters ruled out so far: C, N, E, M, P, S, D, W
- We need one more letter for position 3, and it must be from the remaining unused alphabet (letters not yet tested and not ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, etc.

Therefore the word must be:
R A _ T Y

with any valid letter in position 3.

Let's look at valid English words:
- R A B T Y → ""RABTY"" – invalid
- R A F T Y → ""RAFTY"" – invalid
- R A G T Y → ""RAGTY"" – invalid
- R A H T Y → ""RAHTY"" – invalid
- R A I T Y → ""RAITY"" – invalid

- R A L T Y → ""RALTY"" – invalid
- R A B T Y – invalid
- R A N T Y – N is ruled out
- R A C T Y – C is ruled out
- R A V T Y – V hasn't been tested yet
- R A L T Y – invalid
- R A F T Y – invalid
- R A I T Y – invalid

Wait, the only remaining valid English word seems to be RATTY, but T is already in position 4 and words don't usually repeat letters in Wordle. But RATTY has two T's which is allowed.

But in RATTY:
- A is position 2 ✓
- T is position 4 ✓
- Y is position 5 ✓
- R is position 1 ✓
- Second T is position 3 – but we know T is already in position 4, and repeating T is allowed.

Is RATTY a valid English word? Yes, it is.

Let's check constraints:
- R in position 1 – allowed (we know R must be somewhere, and position 3 is ruled out)
- A in position 2 ✓
- T in position 3 – allowed (we only know T is in position 4, no restriction on T appearing elsewhere)
- T in position 4 ✓
- Y in position 5 ✓

This satisfies all constraints.
