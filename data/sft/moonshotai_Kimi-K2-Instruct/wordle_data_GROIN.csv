For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes several common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gain. A good strategy is to use a word that contains frequently occurring letters in English.

A common first guess is ""AROSE"" because it has:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, E (common consonants and vowel)
- Uses 5 unique letters to cover more ground

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-known starting word that can give good information about vowels and some consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in position 2
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- A, S, E are not in the word at all

So far we know:
1. _ R _ _ _
2. Contains O, but O is NOT in the 3rd position
3. Does not contain A, S, E

I need a word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has O somewhere other than position 3
- Does not contain A, S, E

Let me think of words that fit:
- CROWN: R in position 2, O in position 3 (but O can't be in position 3)
- GROIN: R in position 2, O in position 1 (valid)
- DROOP: R in position 2, O in positions 1 and 4 (valid)
- TROOP: R in position 2, O in positions 3 and 4 (but O can't be in position 3)

Between valid options like GROIN, DROOP, etc., I'll choose GROIN as it uses different letters and positions O in the first spot.
