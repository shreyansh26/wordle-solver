1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad initial test of letters that are likely to appear in the target word.

So far we know:
- R is in the secret word and is in the correct position (second letter).
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore the word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

We should pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd spot.
2. Avoids A, O, S, E entirely.
3. Introduces new common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.) and the only remaining common vowel, I or U.

A good candidate is “TRICK”:
- T, I, C, K are all fresh letters that haven’t been tested.
- R is already known in the second spot.

Let’s guess TRICK.

We now have the partial word: _ R I _ K

- K is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ R I _ K

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is R, third letter is I, fifth letter is K, and which avoids A, O, S, E, T, C.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- GRINK (but GRINK isn’t a valid English word)
- DRINK (D, N are allowed)
