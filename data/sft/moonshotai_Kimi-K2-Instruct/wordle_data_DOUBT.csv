For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Popular starting words often include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. One such word is ""SLATE"" - it covers:
- S (common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel/letter)
This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the combined feedback so far:

1. Letters we know are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, E, R, I, C.
2. Letters that are in the word but currently in the wrong positions:
   - T (wrong in position 1 and wrong in position 4)
   - O (wrong in position 4)

That leaves us with the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding the six above), and we must place T and O somewhere other than their previous spots.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T and O.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, R, I, C.
- Does NOT put T in position 1 or 4.
- Does NOT put O in position 4.

Looking at the remaining common consonants: N, D, M, B, G, H, K, F, P, V, etc., and the remaining vowels: U is the only one left (since A, E, I, O are either excluded or already used).

But we already have O, so we only need consonants.

Let me think of words that satisfy all constraints.

Possible structure:
- Positions 1-5.
- T cannot be 1 or 4, O cannot be 4.
- We have T and O, need 3 more letters from the remaining pool.

Let's try positions:
Option 1: T in position 3.
Option 2: T in position 5.
Option 3: T in position 2.

Let's try position 2 for T and position 3 for O: _ T O _ _

But then position 4 is empty; we need two more consonants.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to list remaining letters and construct.

Remaining letters (excluding S, L, A, E, R, I, C):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From these, we have T and O already confirmed. So the word must contain T and O, plus 3 letters from the remaining set.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words with T and O, avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible words:
- NOUTH? Not valid.
- MOUNT? Has U, N, M, O, T. Let’s check:
  - M: allowed (not in excluded list)
  - O: must be present
  - U: allowed
  - N: allowed
  - T: must be present
  Positions: M O U N T. Check constraints:
  - T is in position 5 (new, not 1 or 4) ✔
  - O is in position 2 (new, not 4) ✔
  - No excluded letters ✔

From the new feedback on MOUNT:

- O is in the correct position 2.
- U is in the correct position 3.
- T is in the correct position 5.
- M and N are not in the word.

So we already have:

Position 1: ?
Position 2: O (✓)
Position 3: U (✓)
Position 4: ?
Position 5: T (✓)

Letters still excluded: S, L, A, E, R, I, C, M, N.

Remaining pool for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4, forming a valid 5-letter word with the pattern _ O U _ T.

Common words that fit:
- BOUT? Not 5 letters.
- GOUT? Not 5 letters.
- JOUST? 5 letters but has S (excluded).
- HOUT? Not valid.
- POUT? No, need 5 letters.
- DOUBT? 5 letters, but has B and D.

Let's check DOUBT:
D O U B T
- D: allowed, not in excluded list
- O: correct position 2
- U: correct position 3
- B: allowed
- T: correct position 5
- No excluded letters
- Valid word

This seems to fit perfectly.

Alternative: WOULD doesn't fit (has L and D, but L is excluded).

So DOUBT appears to be the best next guess.
