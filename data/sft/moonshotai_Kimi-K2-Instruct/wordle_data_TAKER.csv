Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give us good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular opening choice as it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words.

However, since we don't have any feedback yet, the key is to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is another excellent choice as it contains all five most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in English. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us coverage of many high-frequency letters in both consonants and vowels.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all  
O, S, L, Y, C  

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown  
A, R, E, T  

Known position  
A is **not** in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (based on the last guess “REACT” where A in position 3 received “-” instead of “✓”).  
But that contradicts Guess 2 “EARLY” where A in position 3 was marked “✓”.  
Therefore the feedback “A(-)” in Guess 3 must mean that A is **not** in position 3 **in the current guess**, not that it was removed from the word.  
So A is still confirmed in position 3.

Current confirmed pattern  
_ _ A _ _

And we still need to place: R, E, T (and avoid their previous wrong spots)  
- R: cannot be positions 2,3 (from EARLY) and cannot be position 1 (from REACT)  
- E: cannot be positions 1,5 (from AROSE) and cannot be position 2 (from REACT)  
- T: cannot be position 5 (from REACT)

Possible placements for R, E, T in the three remaining slots:

Positions left: 1, 2, 4, 5  
- 1: must be R, E, T, but R is excluded (used position 1 and got “-”), so 1 must be E or T.  
- 2: must be E or T (R excluded here)  
- 4: open to R, E, T  
- 5: T excluded here

Try to put T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5 → word would be E T A E R, but that repeats E.  
Instead put E in position 4, R in position 5, T in position 1 → T E A R ? but only 5 letters needed.

Wait: positions are 1 2 3 4 5  
We have fixed: 3 = A  
We must fit R, E, T into 1,2,4,5 respecting exclusions.

Valid single assignment without repeats:  
position 1 = T (allowed)  
position 2 = R (R cannot be 1,2,3 → only 4,5 allowed, wait that’s wrong)  
R cannot be 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5  
E cannot be 1,2,5 → must be 3 or 4 (but 3 is A) → must be 4  
T cannot be 5 → must be 1 or 2  

The unique valid placement is  
1: T  
2: (must be unused letter, but we still need to place E and R)  
Wait, let’s list the remaining letters: A is fixed at 3.  
We still have to fill positions 1,2,4,5 with two of R,E,T plus two new consonants.  
But we already have to use R, E, T somewhere.

Actually we have to use R, E, T plus one more letter.  
Let’s test RATE_ pattern, but the last letter must be new and common.  
We know T must be 1 or 2, E must be 4, R must be 4 or 5.

Only valid configuration:  
1: T  
2: new letter (since E must be 4)  
3: A  
4: E  
5: R  

That gives T _ A E R  
Fill blank with a new common consonant not yet excluded: N, D, P, M, etc.  
Try “TANER” – but TANER isn’t common.  
Try “TABER” – not a standard word.  
Standard word fitting T _ A E R: “TAPER”.

Check exclusions for “TAPER”  
Letters: T,A,P,E,R  
- P is new – fine  
Positions:  
1 T (allowed)  
2 A (A is fixed to 3, so A in 2 would get “-” – acceptable, we just want to see if it’s present)  
3 A (✓)  
4 E (allowed)  
5 R (allowed, never tried here)

This will test whether P is in the word and whether R belongs at position 5.

So the next guess is “TAPER”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular opening choice as it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words.

However, since we don't have any feedback yet, the key is to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is another excellent choice as it contains all five most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in English. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us coverage of many high-frequency letters in both consonants and vowels.

- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

We know:

- Letters present (but misplaced): A, R, E

Next guess should:
1. Include A, R, E in different positions.
2. Avoid positions 1, 2, 5 for A, R, E respectively.
3. Introduce new common letters (like T, L, N, C, etc.) to gather more info.

A good choice: ""EARLY""
- E is in position 1 (previously in position 5).
- A is in position 2 (previously in position 1).
- R is in position 3 (previously in position 2).
- Introduces L and Y as new letters.

- E is in the word but not positions 1 or 5.
- R is in the word but not positions 2 or 3.

So far the word looks like:   _ _ A _ _

We still need to test positions 1, 2, 4, 5. The letters we know we must include are A (already placed at position 3), E, and R.

- E in position 4: _ _ A E _
- R in position 1, 4, or 5 (since we know it’s not 2 or 3).

From Guess 4 (TAPER):
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- P is not in the word (x)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 5 (✓)

So the exact word is now revealed: T A _ E R.

The missing letter (position 3) must be a common consonant not yet used or excluded. From previous feedback, we have not tested:
- B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, Z.

Looking at common 5-letter words with the pattern TA_ER, the most common is ""TAKER"".

Check if any letters in ""TAKER"" conflict:
- T, A, E, R are already confirmed.
- K hasn't been tested yet and isn't excluded.

Therefore, ""TAKER"" is a valid guess.
