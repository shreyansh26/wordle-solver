For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. I'll use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. A good starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help identify multiple letters in their correct or incorrect positions. This will give us good information about what letters are in the secret word and where they might be located.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.
- Must use only the remaining consonants and the letter A.

Letters we can use: A, plus the remaining consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

From the latest feedback:

CANTY → C(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

This tells us the exact pattern of the secret word:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: NOT N (x), but we already know from earlier feedback that A must appear somewhere and we've now placed A at position 2, so position 3 is still open. However, from earlier feedback, A is not at position 3 (since A was ""-"" in AROSE and ADMIT, meaning it's present but not in those positions).
Wait, let's re-examine:

From AROSE: A(-) - A is present but not at position 1
From ADMIT: A(-) - A is present but not at position 2
From CANTY: A(✓) at position 2 - this contradicts the ADMIT feedback where A was not in position 2.

Ah! I made an error in interpretation. The feedback shows:
- For CANTY: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: C is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: N is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: T is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

So the word is: C A _ T Y

Now we need to find the 3rd letter. From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, I, N
- Letters already placed: C, A, T, Y
- The remaining letters can be any other consonant not yet used.

Looking at remaining consonants (excluding R, O, S, E, D, M, I, N): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Common consonants that fit here would be L or B or K. The most common would be L.

Thus the word is likely ""CALTY"" but ""CALTY"" is not a valid English word. Next common letter would be B - ""CABTY"" (invalid), or K - ""CAKTY"" (invalid).

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit C A _ T Y pattern:
- CACTY - invalid
- CALTY - invalid
- CANTY - already tried, N is incorrect
- CATTY - but T is already at position 4
- CARTY - but R is already excluded
- CAFTY - invalid
- CAWTY - invalid
- CAJTY - invalid
- CAKTY - invalid

Actually, the valid word that fits is ""CATTY"" but position 4 is already T, so position 3 would be T - but we can't have T twice unless word has double T.

But ""CATTY"" is a valid word meaning spiteful. Since T is confirmed at position 4, having another T at position 3 would be acceptable.

But let's check: the word would be C A T T Y. This would match all feedback:
- C(✓) A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)

But position 4 was T(✓) from CANTY, so position 3 could also be T.

Thus the word must be CATTY.
</think>

Based on the feedback pattern C(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(✓) Y(✓), the only valid 5-letter word that fits is:

<guess>CATTY</guess>",CATTY,"From the latest feedback:

CANTY → C(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

This tells us the exact pattern of the secret word:
- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: NOT N (x), but we already know from earlier feedback that A must appear somewhere and we've now placed A at position 2, so position 3 is still open. However, from earlier feedback, A is not at position 3 (since A was ""-"" in AROSE and ADMIT, meaning it's present but not in those positions).
Wait, let's re-examine:

From AROSE: A(-) - A is present but not at position 1
From ADMIT: A(-) - A is present but not at position 2
From CANTY: A(✓) at position 2 - this contradicts the ADMIT feedback where A was not in position 2.

Ah! I made an error in interpretation. The feedback shows:
- For CANTY: C(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: C is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: N is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: T is correct (✓)
- Position 5: Y is correct (✓)

So the word is: C A _ T Y

Now we need to find the 3rd letter. From previous feedback:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, I, N
- Letters already placed: C, A, T, Y
- The remaining letters can be any other consonant not yet used.

Looking at remaining consonants (excluding R, O, S, E, D, M, I, N): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Common consonants that fit here would be L or B or K. The most common would be L.

Thus the word is likely ""CALTY"" but ""CALTY"" is not a valid English word. Next common letter would be B - ""CABTY"" (invalid), or K - ""CAKTY"" (invalid).

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit C A _ T Y pattern:
- CACTY - invalid
- CALTY - invalid
- CANTY - already tried, N is incorrect
- CATTY - but T is already at position 4
- CARTY - but R is already excluded
- CAFTY - invalid
- CAWTY - invalid
- CAJTY - invalid
- CAKTY - invalid
