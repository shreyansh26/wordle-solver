For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE - contains S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE - contains C, R, A, N, E
- AUDIO - many vowels but fewer consonants
- ADIEU - similar to above, but limited consonant coverage

Looking at letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover several of these.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (common consonant, especially at word endings)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives good coverage of common letters without repeating any, maximizing the chance of getting hits or confirming letter positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is correct and in the right position (5th letter).

So we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Contains R somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Must not contain I or S.

Good second-guess strategy:
- Keep A and E locked in their correct spots.
- Try R in positions 2-5 (but position 2 is taken by A, so positions 3,4,5).
- Avoid I and S entirely.
- Use other common consonants and vowels (T, N, O, L, C, etc.)

Candidate constructions:
- TA_R_ E, but TAR isn't ideal
- R must be in 3rd or 4th position since 5th is E
- Possible: T A R _ E or T A _ R E
- Or C A R _ E, M A R _ E, G A R _ E, etc.

Looking at common patterns, ""C"" and ""T"" are good consonants to test. Let's try ""TARGE"" - but that's not a 5-letter word. ""CARTE"" exists but isn't common. 

A better approach might be ""CATER"" - but E is already in position 5, so ""C A T _ E"" would be ""C A T R E"" - but ""C A T R E"" isn't a valid word.

Wait, let's think differently - we need a word with:
- A in position 2
- E in position 5
- R somewhere in positions 3 or 4
- No I or S

Possible words:
- CARVE - C A R V E
- MARGE - M A R G E
- PARGE - P A R G E (not common)
- BARRE - B A R R E (double R)
- FARCE - F A R C E

""FARCE"" seems like a strong choice - includes F, C which are good to test, maintains A and E positions, and places R in the 3rd position.

But let's check: does this make sense with R being wrong in position 1? Yes, because we're moving R to position 3.

""FARCE"" would be: F A R C E
