For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This helps maximize the information gained about which letters are present.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering both common vowels and consonants. 

I think ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage, so I'll go with that as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (-).

So the mystery word contains S and E, but not at the 4th and 5th spots. The remaining letters must be drawn from the rest of the alphabet.

Strategy for the second guess:
1. Keep S and E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tested yet: T, L, N, I, C, D, etc.
3. Place S and E in positions 1 and 2 (since they cannot be at 4 and 5).
4. Fill the other three spots with fresh common letters.

A good candidate is “STEIN”: it reuses S and E in new positions and introduces T, I, N.

Feedback recap:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ S and E are somewhere in the word, but not at positions 4 and 5.

2. STEIN → S(✓) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(✓)  
   ⇒ S is in position 1 (✓), N is somewhere in the word but not at position 5 (-), T and I are not in the word (x).  
   ⇒ E is in the word but not at position 3 (-).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern S _ _ _ _
- It must also contain N and E.
- E cannot be at positions 3, 4, or 5 ⇒ E must be at position 2.
- The last three letters are still unknown and must be chosen from unused common letters.

Positions so far: S E _ _ _

Good remaining consonants: L, D, C, G, M, P, etc.  
We still need two more letters and we want common ones. Let’s try L and D for now.

A straightforward candidate: “SELD_” – but we need a valid word. The closest common word that fits is “SELDM” (not valid) or “SELDOM” (too long). Instead, let’s use “SLEEP” (invalid because P repeats E and E is already used). A better choice is “SLEPT” which uses S, E, L, P, T – but T was already ruled out. Another option is “SENDY” – not a word. Let’s consider “SENGE” – not valid. The simplest valid word that fits S E _ _ and uses N is “SENSE” but it repeats S and E. “SEDGE” uses S, E, D, G. This is valid.

Let me pick “SEDGE” as it places S in 1st, E in 2nd, and D and G in unknown positions with N.

Wait – we know N must be in the word, but N is not in SEDGE. Let me try again.

We need S E _ _ _ and N somewhere. The only valid word I can think of is “SENGE” – but it’s not valid. Actually, there’s “SENGE” (not valid). The valid word is “SEINE” (a type of net), but it repeats E at 5th position and E can’t be at 5th. So let’s go with “SENGE” – but invalid. Let me think differently.

We have S at 1, E at 2, and N must be somewhere in 3-5. Let’s try “SENOR” – but R was ruled out. How about “SENEX” – invalid. “SENGA” – invalid. “SENGE” – invalid.

Actually, let me try “SENGE” is invalid. Let’s think of valid words: “SENGE” is not in Scrabble. The valid word with S, E, N in positions 1, 2, and somewhere else: “SENGE” is not valid. A valid word is “SEVEN” – but V and N are new. Let’s try “SEVEN”.

But feedback shows N is in the word but not at 5th. So N must be at 3 or 4. So “SEVEN” puts N at 4 – this is allowed. Let’s go with “SEVEN”.
