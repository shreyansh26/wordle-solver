Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters in English. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these common letters, ideally avoiding repeats to cover more ground. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent starting word because it contains:
- 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All are among the 10 most common letters in English
- It gives maximum coverage to identify which common letters are present

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong place (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are all not in the word at all.

So the mystery word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

That leaves consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc. and the vowels I, U, Y.  
Because we already know A is present, we might want to keep A in positions 2–5 and surround it with other common letters we haven’t tested yet.

A balanced second guess should:
1. Keep A, but move it to a new position (2–5).
2. Introduce new common consonants that weren’t tried yet (T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Try one new vowel (I or U).

“TAINT” covers:
- T (common consonant, new)
- A (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- N (common consonant, new)
- T (re-used T to probe two consonants quickly)

But that repeats T and might be less informative.

A better choice: “TACIT” – but that repeats T twice in close positions.

Next best: “CANTU” – but U is somewhat less common than I.

I’ll go with “TAINT” because even with a repeated T, it tests A in a new spot and introduces T, I, N quickly.

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, E, T, N, C, M

Letters we know ARE in the word (and their positions):
- A is in position 3
- I is in position 4

So the current partial pattern is: _ _ A I _

Letters still possible (excluding the banned ones and the ones already placed):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Among these, we need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, plus a letter for position 5.

We also have:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from CLAIM feedback: L(-)). So L must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 3
2. Has I in position 4
3. Contains L in either position 1 or 5
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters
5. Is a valid English word

Let's try placing L in position 1:
L _ A I _

We need a valid letter for position 2 and 5 from the remaining pool. Common combinations:
- Position 2: B, D, G, K, P, etc.
- Position 5: B, D, G, K, P, etc.

Possible word: L B A I D (but ""LBAID"" isn't a valid word)
Another try: L G A I D (not a word)
Next: L P A I R (but R is banned)

Instead, let's try L in position 5:
_ _ A I L

Now we need two letters for positions 1 and 2. Possible combinations:
- Position 1 and 2: B, D, G, K, P, etc.

Looking for valid English words with this pattern:
- B D A I L → ""BDAIL"" isn't valid
- G R A I L → ""GRAIL"" but R is banned
- F R A I L → ""FRAIL"" but R is banned
- F L A I L → ""FLAIL"" (valid word, and L would be in position 2, which is allowed since we only know L is not in position 2 - wait no: from CLAIM feedback, L is not in position 2, so FLAIL would have L in position 2 which contradicts. So FLAIL is invalid.)

Another approach: L in position 1, and look for valid words:
- L B A I D → invalid
- L G A I D → invalid
- L P A I D → ""LPAID"" invalid

Wait, let's think differently: from CLAIM feedback, L is in the word but not in position 2. So L could be in 1,3,4,5. But 3 is A, 4 is I, so L must be in 1 or 5.

Looking for valid English words with:
- Pos 3: A
- Pos 4: I
- L in pos 1 or 5
- No banned letters

Valid word: ""VIALS"" - but S is banned.
""DIVAL"" - not a word.
""BIALY"" - valid word (a type of bread), but Y is allowed.

But ""BIALY"" would place L in position 5, which is allowed:
B I A L Y → but this contradicts our positions (A must be 3, I must be 4)

Wait, let's correct:
We need _ _ A I L or L _ A I _

Looking at L _ A I _ options:
- L B A I D → invalid
- L G A I D → invalid
- L P A I D → invalid
- L B A I T → T is banned
- L B A I N → N is banned

Looking at _ _ A I L options:
- B D A I L → invalid
- G L A I L → ""GLAIL"" invalid
- P L A I L → ""PLAIL"" invalid
- B L A I L → ""BLAIL"" invalid
- H A A I L → invalid (and A repeated)

Alternative: maybe the word is ""VIRAL"" - but R is banned.
""SIGMA"" - but A is not in position 3 there.

Wait, let's systematically list possible words matching _ _ A I L with allowed letters:
Letters allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Positions: 1 and 2 must be from these, position 5 is L.

Possible:
- B D A I L → ""BDAIL"" invalid
- B G A I L → ""BGAIL"" invalid
- D R A I L → R banned
- F R A I L → R banned
- H A A I L → A repeated
- P L A I L → L in 2 is banned
- V L A I L → L in 2 banned
- G L A I L → L in 2 banned
- F L A I L → L in 2 banned
- B L A I L → L in 2 banned

This seems problematic. Maybe L is in position 1.

L _ A I _

Need letters for positions 2 and 5 from allowed set:
Possible:
- L B A I D → ""LBAID"" invalid
- L D A I B → ""LDAIB"" invalid
- L P A I D → ""LPAID"" invalid
- L U A I D → ""LUAID"" invalid
- L G A I D → ""LGAID"" invalid

Realizing that most combinations don't form valid words. Maybe the word is ""QUAIL"":
Q U A I L
- Q and U are allowed
- A is 3, I is 4, L is 5
- All letters are from allowed set

""QUAIL"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- Q and U are untested and allowed
- A in position 3 ✓
- I in position 4 ✓
- L in position 5 (this satisfies L being in word and not in position 2)

Let's verify no banned letters:
Q, U, A, I, L – none are banned.

This seems to be the best candidate.
