For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

Some popular strong first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N). This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

So the pattern so far is  C L I _ _  and we already know the disallowed letters:  
R, A, N, E, O, U, D, P, S.

Remaining usable letters for positions 4 and 5 (in alphabetical order):  
B, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with CLI.  
Scanning through common combinations:

- CLIMB – uses B and M (both allowed)
- CLIFT – uses F and T (allowed)
- CLINK – uses N (already ruled out)
- CLIFF – uses F twice (possible)
- CLYFT – not a valid word
- CLICH – not valid
- CLIMB seems to be the most common valid word left.

So the next logical guess is CLIMB.
