For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and good vowel coverage to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and some common consonants.

Looking at the best starting words that have been statistically analyzed, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""IRATE"", ""STARE"", ""AROSE"" are considered optimal. ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and 3 vowels. This should give us good information about what letters might be in the word.

We got: RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)

So we now know:
- S is in position 4.
- E is in position 5.
- R, A, I are **not** in the word at all.

That leaves the first and second positions to be filled by letters other than R, A, I.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, F, H, K, W, Y, V, etc.  
Good vowels to test: O, U (since E is already fixed at the end).

We have the pattern: _ _ S E  
We also know S and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.

A strong second guess would test new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A good candidate: “HOUSE” or “DOUSE” or “NOSEY”.  

But “NOSEY” has 6 letters so invalid.  
“HOUSE” uses H, O, U, S, E — but S and E are already known positions, and we want to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

We could try “TONES” — T, O, N, E, S — but E and S are already fixed at positions 5 and 4.  

Better to pick a word that keeps S and E in positions 4 and 5, and tests new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

So possible pattern: _ _ _ S E

A strong candidate: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.

Let’s try “NOSEY” — invalid (6 letters).

We now know:
- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: S and E respectively.

- So positions 1, 2, and 3 must be chosen from the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in “S E” and uses only the allowed letters in the first three slots.  
Among the common letters left after eliminating R, A, I, T, O, U, the best consonants to try next are usually: C, D, L, N, M, P, H, G, B, F, K.

Let’s look for three-letter combinations that form a word with “…SE”.  
Some common patterns:
- N _ _ SE, D _ _ SE, L _ _ SE, P _ _ SE, M _ _ SE, C _ _ SE, G _ _ SE.

Checking real 5-letter words ending in “SE” and avoiding the banned letters:
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → N is allowed, D is allowed, E is allowed, but E is only allowed in position 5, so this is fine.
- “false” – F, A, L, S, E → A is banned (from guess 1 feedback). So invalid.
- “lapse” – L, A, P, S, E → A is banned. Invalid.
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “mense” – M, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “lense” – L, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “purse” – P, U, R, S, E – U and R are banned. Invalid.
- “horse” – H, O, R, S, E – O and R banned. Invalid.
- “burse” – B, U, R, S, E – U and R banned. Invalid.
- “gneiss” – 6 letters. Invalid.
- “dense”, “lense”, “mense” are all valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,SENSE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and good vowel coverage to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and some common consonants.

Looking at the best starting words that have been statistically analyzed, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""IRATE"", ""STARE"", ""AROSE"" are considered optimal. ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and 3 vowels. This should give us good information about what letters might be in the word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We got: RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)

So we now know:
- S is in position 4.
- E is in position 5.
- R, A, I are **not** in the word at all.

That leaves the first and second positions to be filled by letters other than R, A, I.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, F, H, K, W, Y, V, etc.  
Good vowels to test: O, U (since E is already fixed at the end).

We have the pattern: _ _ S E  
We also know S and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.

A strong second guess would test new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A good candidate: “HOUSE” or “DOUSE” or “NOSEY”.  

But “NOSEY” has 6 letters so invalid.  
“HOUSE” uses H, O, U, S, E — but S and E are already known positions, and we want to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

We could try “TONES” — T, O, N, E, S — but E and S are already fixed at positions 5 and 4.  

Better to pick a word that keeps S and E in positions 4 and 5, and tests new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

So possible pattern: _ _ _ S E

A strong candidate: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  
But we want to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

Another candidate: “MUSED” — but D is position 5 and we know E is position 5.  

Best is to pick a word that fits _ _ _ S E and uses new common letters.  

Let’s try “TONES” — but O is position 3, N position 2, T position 1.  

Actually, we know positions 4 and 5 are S and E. So we need _ _ _ S E.  

A good word: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

But we want to maximize new letters.  

Let’s try “TOUSE” — T, O, U, S, E.  

But we want to test consonants and vowels.  

Actually, the strongest play is to test new consonants and vowels while keeping S in 4 and E in 5.  

A good choice: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

But let’s pick a word that tests more new letters.  

Let’s try “NOSEY” — invalid (6 letters).  

Let’s try “DOSES” — but tests S again.  

Let’s try “HOUSE” — H, O, U, S, E.  

But we want to test new consonants.  

Let’s try “BLOKE” — but we need S in position 4.  

We need to keep positions 4 and 5 as S and E.  

So pattern: _ _ _ S E  

A strong candidate: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

Another: “TOUSE” — T, O, U, S, E.  

Let’s go with “TOUSE” — tests T, O, U in new positions.

<guess>TOUSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: TOUSE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(x) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: S and E respectively.
- Letters R, A, I, T, O, U are NOT in the word.
- So positions 1, 2, and 3 must be chosen from the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in “S E” and uses only the allowed letters in the first three slots.  
Among the common letters left after eliminating R, A, I, T, O, U, the best consonants to try next are usually: C, D, L, N, M, P, H, G, B, F, K.

Let’s look for three-letter combinations that form a word with “…SE”.  
Some common patterns:
- N _ _ SE, D _ _ SE, L _ _ SE, P _ _ SE, M _ _ SE, C _ _ SE, G _ _ SE.

Checking real 5-letter words ending in “SE” and avoiding the banned letters:
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → N is allowed, D is allowed, E is allowed, but E is only allowed in position 5, so this is fine.
- “false” – F, A, L, S, E → A is banned (from guess 1 feedback). So invalid.
- “lapse” – L, A, P, S, E → A is banned. Invalid.
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “mense” – M, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “lense” – L, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “purse” – P, U, R, S, E – U and R are banned. Invalid.
- “horse” – H, O, R, S, E – O and R banned. Invalid.
- “burse” – B, U, R, S, E – U and R banned. Invalid.
- “gneiss” – 6 letters. Invalid.
- “dense”, “lense”, “mense” are all valid.

Among these, “dense” seems like the most common word. Let’s choose “dense”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and some common consonants.

Looking at the best starting words that have been statistically analyzed, words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""IRATE"", ""STARE"", ""AROSE"" are considered optimal. ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters and 3 vowels. This should give us good information about what letters might be in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We got: RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)

So we now know:
- S is in position 4.
- E is in position 5.
- R, A, I are **not** in the word at all.

That leaves the first and second positions to be filled by letters other than R, A, I.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, F, H, K, W, Y, V, etc.  
Good vowels to test: O, U (since E is already fixed at the end).

We have the pattern: _ _ S E  
We also know S and E are correct in positions 4 and 5.

A strong second guess would test new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A good candidate: “HOUSE” or “DOUSE” or “NOSEY”.  

But “NOSEY” has 6 letters so invalid.  
“HOUSE” uses H, O, U, S, E — but S and E are already known positions, and we want to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

We could try “TONES” — T, O, N, E, S — but E and S are already fixed at positions 5 and 4.  

Better to pick a word that keeps S and E in positions 4 and 5, and tests new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

So possible pattern: _ _ _ S E

A strong candidate: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  
But we want to test new letters in positions 1, 2, and 3.  

Another candidate: “MUSED” — but D is position 5 and we know E is position 5.  

Best is to pick a word that fits _ _ _ S E and uses new common letters.  

Let’s try “TONES” — but O is position 3, N position 2, T position 1.  

Actually, we know positions 4 and 5 are S and E. So we need _ _ _ S E.  

A good word: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

But we want to maximize new letters.  

Let’s try “TOUSE” — T, O, U, S, E.  

But we want to test consonants and vowels.  

Actually, the strongest play is to test new consonants and vowels while keeping S in 4 and E in 5.  

A good choice: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

But let’s pick a word that tests more new letters.  

Let’s try “NOSEY” — invalid (6 letters).  

Let’s try “DOSES” — but tests S again.  

Let’s try “HOUSE” — H, O, U, S, E.  

But we want to test new consonants.  

Let’s try “BLOKE” — but we need S in position 4.  

We need to keep positions 4 and 5 as S and E.  

So pattern: _ _ _ S E  

A strong candidate: “CLOSE” — C, L, O, S, E.  

Another: “TOUSE” — T, O, U, S, E.  

Let’s go with “TOUSE” — tests T, O, U in new positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: S and E respectively.
- Letters R, A, I, T, O, U are NOT in the word.
- So positions 1, 2, and 3 must be chosen from the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in “S E” and uses only the allowed letters in the first three slots.  
Among the common letters left after eliminating R, A, I, T, O, U, the best consonants to try next are usually: C, D, L, N, M, P, H, G, B, F, K.

Let’s look for three-letter combinations that form a word with “…SE”.  
Some common patterns:
- N _ _ SE, D _ _ SE, L _ _ SE, P _ _ SE, M _ _ SE, C _ _ SE, G _ _ SE.

Checking real 5-letter words ending in “SE” and avoiding the banned letters:
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → N is allowed, D is allowed, E is allowed, but E is only allowed in position 5, so this is fine.
- “false” – F, A, L, S, E → A is banned (from guess 1 feedback). So invalid.
- “lapse” – L, A, P, S, E → A is banned. Invalid.
- “dense” – D, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “mense” – M, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “lense” – L, E, N, S, E → valid.
- “purse” – P, U, R, S, E – U and R are banned. Invalid.
- “horse” – H, O, R, S, E – O and R banned. Invalid.
- “burse” – B, U, R, S, E – U and R banned. Invalid.
- “gneiss” – 6 letters. Invalid.
- “dense”, “lense”, “mense” are all valid.

Among these, “dense” seems like the most common word. Let’s choose “dense”.
