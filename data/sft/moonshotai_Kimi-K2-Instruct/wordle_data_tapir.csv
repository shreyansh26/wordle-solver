- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that can help maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters in 5-letter words are: A, E, S, T, R, O, N, I, L, D. A good first guess would include a mix of these common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels as well as consonants. This should give good feedback on multiple fronts.

From the two results:

1. The word definitely contains: A, R, T and I (because each of them was marked “-” at least once, meaning they appear somewhere, and T was even marked ✓ in position 1).
2. The word definitely does NOT contain: O, S, E, L.
3. Current positional constraints:
   - T is NOT in position 1 (✓ in position 1 in TRIAL, but that was for TRIAL; we just know T exists somewhere).
   - R is NOT in position 2.
   - I is NOT in position 3.
   - A is NOT in position 4.
   - L was never in the word anyway.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T, R, A, I.
- Possibly one more letter (since we’ve only confirmed four so far).
- Avoids O, S, E, L.

A good candidate is “TRIAC”:
- T, R, I, A are all present.
- C is a common consonant not yet tried.
- Positions: T(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) C(5)
   - Position constraints:
     - R cannot be in position 2, so TRIAC is invalid (R is in position 2).

Next candidate: “RATIO” – but O is banned.

Next: “ATRIA” – repeats A too many times and is plural; probably not the word.

Next: “TRAIN” – fits:
- Contains T, R, A, I, plus N.
- No banned letters (O, S, E, L).
- Positions:
  - T(1) – allowed (no constraint on T’s position).
  - R(2) – violates R not in position 2. So TRAIN is invalid.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that ARE in the word (marked with - somewhere): A, R, T, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, L, N  

We still need one more letter that hasn’t been tried.  The remaining common letters that have never appeared in any guess are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We know:
- Position 1: T is not here (because in TRIAL, T was ✓ in position 1, meaning that specific placement was correct; therefore T is certainly in position 1 of the secret word).  
- Position 2: R cannot be here (AROSE and RIANT both showed R “-” when it was in position 2).  
- Position 3: I cannot be here (TRIAL showed I “-” when in position 3).  
- Position 4: A cannot be here (TRIAL and RIANT showed A “-” when in position 4).  
- Position 5: T cannot be here (RIANT showed T “-” when in position 5).

So positions look like:

1: T  
2: not R  
3: not I  
4: not A  
5: not T  

We have to place A, R, I plus one new letter (from the remaining set) into the remaining four slots, while respecting the positional bans.

- T is locked in position 1.  
- We need to fit A, R, I into positions 2,3,4,5, plus one new letter somewhere.

Possible arrangements, avoiding the banned positions:

- Position 2: could be A, I, or the new letter.  
- Position 3: could be A, R, or the new letter (not I).  
- Position 4: could be R, I, or the new letter (not A).  
- Position 5: could be A, R, or I (not T).

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words that start with T, contain A R I, and one new consonant not yet used, and obey the positional bans:

Candidate: TARDI – not a word.  
Candidate: TRAID – not a word.  
Candidate: TRIAD – contains N, which is banned.  
Candidate: TIBAR – not a word.  
Candidate: TAPIR – meets all constraints: T in 1, A in 2 (allowed), P new, I in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed).  No banned letters.  Positions: 2≠R, 3≠I, 4≠A, 5≠T, all satisfied.

Therefore TAPIR is a valid next guess.
