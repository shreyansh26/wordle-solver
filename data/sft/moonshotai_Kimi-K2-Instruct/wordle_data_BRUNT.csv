For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters to maximize information gain. Some common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) which are often found in 5-letter words.
