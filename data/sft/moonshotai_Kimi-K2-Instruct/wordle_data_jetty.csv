For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common 5-letter letters to maximize information gain. The best first guesses typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at common word patterns, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word.

So far we know:

- E appears somewhere, but not positions 4 or 5.
- Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E.

Remaining vowels (that have not been ruled out): E (must appear) and Y.

A good strategy is to test a few more high-frequency consonants while placing E in a yet-untested position (1, 2, or 3—but 3 is already T). A word that fits is “DEPTH”:  
- T is already locked in position 3, so the word _ _ T _ _.  
- E is placed in position 2 this time (never tested there).  
- We introduce D, P, H (high-frequency consonants not yet tried).  
- All letters are fresh except T and E.

   – D, P, H are eliminated.

So the current pattern is:  
_ E T _ _

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, D, P, H.

Valid remaining letters (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, F, G, **K**, L, M, **V**, **W**, **Y**, plus any other unused.

We still need consonants for slots 1 and 4/5. Likely candidates that yield common words:
- F, L, M, V, W, Y.

Possible patterns:
F E T _ _  
_ E T _ _  
etc.

Common English words fitting _ E T _ _:
– F E T U S  
– V E T C H (but C and H are eliminated)  
– M E T A L (but A and L not ruled out)  
– W E T L Y (but L, Y still possible)  
– L E T U S (but U, S eliminated)  
– F E T I D (I eliminated)  
– M E T E D (but D eliminated)  
– K E T C H (C eliminated)  
– V E T O S (O, S eliminated)  
– W E T L Y (L, Y still possible)  
– F E T A L (A eliminated)  

Looking again, the remaining letters that can form a valid 5-letter word are limited. The most promising common word that fits _ E T _ _ with remaining letters is ""FETAL"" but A is eliminated. ""FETUS"" has U eliminated. ""FETID"" has I eliminated. ""METAL"" has A, L not eliminated yet but M, E, T are fine. However, A is already eliminated. So no vowel left except Y for slot 4 or 5.

Re-evaluate: We have E in 2, T in 3. Slots 1, 4, 5 can only use remaining letters: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Most common word structure with Y at the end: _ E T _ Y  
Possible: K E T T Y – but T is already used in slot 3 and cannot repeat (no indication yet of duplicates).  
B E T T Y – same issue with double T.  
W E T L Y – W, E, T, L, Y all allowed.  
M E T A L – A eliminated.  
F E T C H – C, H eliminated.  

""WETLY"" is a valid English word and uses only letters not eliminated.

So the best next guess is ""WETLY"" to test W, L, Y in the remaining slots while keeping E and T fixed.

The best first guesses typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at common word patterns, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on arose:
- A, R, O, and S are not in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (marked -).

Since A, R, O, and S are eliminated, and E must appear elsewhere, I want a new set of high-frequency consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). Letters still worth trying include T, N, L, I, U, D, C, etc.

A good next guess is “UNTIE”:
- Contains the confirmed letter E (and places it in a new spot).
- Introduces three new common consonants N, T and a new vowel U, I.
- All letters are fresh except E, maximizing information gain.

<guess>untie</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: A, R, O, S  
   – E is present but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: U, N, I  
   – T is in the correct position (position 3).  
   – E is still present but not in position 5 (and now we also know it’s not in position 4, because in untie it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So far we know:
- T is fixed in position 3.
- E appears somewhere, but not positions 4 or 5.
- Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E.

Remaining vowels (that have not been ruled out): E (must appear) and Y.

A good strategy is to test a few more high-frequency consonants while placing E in a yet-untested position (1, 2, or 3—but 3 is already T). A word that fits is “DEPTH”:  
- T is already locked in position 3, so the word _ _ T _ _.  
- E is placed in position 2 this time (never tested there).  
- We introduce D, P, H (high-frequency consonants not yet tried).  
- All letters are fresh except T and E.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, D, P, H.

Valid remaining letters (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, F, G, **K**, L, M, **V**, **W**, **Y**, plus any other unused.

We still need consonants for slots 1 and 4/5. Likely candidates that yield common words:
- F, L, M, V, W, Y.

Possible patterns:
F E T _ _

Common English words fitting _ E T _ _:

– F E T A L (A eliminated)  

Looking again, the remaining letters that can form a valid 5-letter word are limited. The most promising common word that fits _ E T _ _ with remaining letters is ""FETAL"" but A is eliminated. ""FETUS"" has U eliminated. ""FETID"" has I eliminated. ""METAL"" has A, L not eliminated yet but M, E, T are fine. However, A is already eliminated. So no vowel left except Y for slot 4 or 5.

Re-evaluate: We have E in 2, T in 3. Slots 1, 4, 5 can only use remaining letters: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Most common word structure with Y at the end: _ E T _ Y  
Possible: K E T T Y – but T is already used in slot 3 and cannot repeat (no indication yet of duplicates).  
B E T T Y – same issue with double T.  
W E T L Y – W, E, T, L, Y all allowed.  
M E T A L – A eliminated.  
F E T C H – C, H eliminated.  

""WETLY"" is a valid English word and uses only letters not eliminated.

So the best next guess is ""WETLY"" to test W, L, Y in the remaining slots while keeping E and T fixed.

3. Remaining letters that can still appear in positions 1 and 4

4. Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit the exact pattern _ E T _ Y and use only the remaining letters.

   - B E T T Y → T is already used once and we have no evidence that T repeats; also “BETTY” uses T twice.
   - C E T T Y → same issue with double T.
   - F E T C H → wrong length/pattern.
   - K E T C H → C, H eliminated.
   - J E T T Y → double T again, plus J is allowed but word is rare.
   - V E T C H → C, H eliminated.
   - Z E T T Y → double T and uncommon.

   The only common word that fits _ E T _ Y without using any eliminated letters and without repeating T is **""F E T C H""**, but H is eliminated.

   Re-checking the remaining consonants: none form a common word in the pattern _ E T _ Y except those that repeat T or use eliminated letters.

   But wait: the pattern _ _ T _ Y with E in slot 2 is strict.

   The word **""B E T T Y""** is valid despite the repeated T; the feedback so far never ruled out duplicate letters.

   But to avoid guessing a word with double T without evidence, let’s look for another option.

   The only common word left that fits _ E T _ Y is **""C E T T Y""** (but again double T).

   Actually, double letters are allowed unless ruled out. Given the very small pool of remaining letters, the most plausible choice is **B E T T Y**.

   However, we should also check if a letter has been ruled out in a position. All we know is that B has not been eliminated.

   Thus, best choice is to try **B E T T Y**.

   But let’s double-check the remaining letters again: positions 1 and 4 can use any of B, C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.

   The only common word fitting _ E T _ Y is **""F E T C H""** (invalid, H gone). Actually, the correct word is **""F E T C H""** but H is gone.

   Actually, the word **""B E T T Y""** is the only common word left fitting the pattern, even with a duplicate T.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common 5-letter letters to maximize information gain. The best first guesses typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at common word patterns, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on arose:
- A, R, O, and S are not in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (marked -).

Since A, R, O, and S are eliminated, and E must appear elsewhere, I want a new set of high-frequency consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). Letters still worth trying include T, N, L, I, U, D, C, etc.

A good next guess is “UNTIE”:
- Contains the confirmed letter E (and places it in a new spot).
- Introduces three new common consonants N, T and a new vowel U, I.
- All letters are fresh except E, maximizing information gain.

<guess>untie</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: A, R, O, S  
   – E is present but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminated: U, N, I  
   – T is in the correct position (position 3).  
   – E is still present but not in position 5 (and now we also know it’s not in position 4, because in untie it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So far we know:
- T is fixed in position 3.
- E appears somewhere, but not positions 4 or 5.
- Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E.

Remaining vowels (that have not been ruled out): E (must appear) and Y.

A good strategy is to test a few more high-frequency consonants while placing E in a yet-untested position (1, 2, or 3—but 3 is already T). A word that fits is “DEPTH”:  
- T is already locked in position 3, so the word _ _ T _ _.  
- E is placed in position 2 this time (never tested there).  
- We introduce D, P, H (high-frequency consonants not yet tried).  
- All letters are fresh except T and E.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: depth -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) P(x) T(✓) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we know so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in slot 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)  
   – T is in slot 3.  
   – E is in the word but not in slots 4 or 5.

3. depth → D(x) E(✓) P(x) T(✓) H(x)  
   – E is confirmed in slot 2.  
   – T is still in slot 3.  
   – D, P, H are eliminated.

So the current pattern is:  
_ E T _ _

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, D, P, H.

Valid remaining letters (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, F, G, **K**, L, M, **V**, **W**, **Y**, plus any other unused.

We still need consonants for slots 1 and 4/5. Likely candidates that yield common words:
- F, L, M, V, W, Y.

Possible patterns:
F E T _ _  
_ E T _ _  
etc.

Common English words fitting _ E T _ _:
– F E T U S  
– V E T C H (but C and H are eliminated)  
– M E T A L (but A and L not ruled out)  
– W E T L Y (but L, Y still possible)  
– L E T U S (but U, S eliminated)  
– F E T I D (I eliminated)  
– M E T E D (but D eliminated)  
– K E T C H (C eliminated)  
– V E T O S (O, S eliminated)  
– W E T L Y (L, Y still possible)  
– F E T A L (A eliminated)  

Looking again, the remaining letters that can form a valid 5-letter word are limited. The most promising common word that fits _ E T _ _ with remaining letters is ""FETAL"" but A is eliminated. ""FETUS"" has U eliminated. ""FETID"" has I eliminated. ""METAL"" has A, L not eliminated yet but M, E, T are fine. However, A is already eliminated. So no vowel left except Y for slot 4 or 5.

Re-evaluate: We have E in 2, T in 3. Slots 1, 4, 5 can only use remaining letters: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Most common word structure with Y at the end: _ E T _ Y  
Possible: K E T T Y – but T is already used in slot 3 and cannot repeat (no indication yet of duplicates).  
B E T T Y – same issue with double T.  
W E T L Y – W, E, T, L, Y all allowed.  
M E T A L – A eliminated.  
F E T C H – C, H eliminated.  

""WETLY"" is a valid English word and uses only letters not eliminated.

So the best next guess is ""WETLY"" to test W, L, Y in the remaining slots while keeping E and T fixed.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list what we now know:

1. Fixed letters  
   – Position 2: E (✓)  
   – Position 3: T (✓)  
   – Position 5: Y (✓)

   So the pattern is: _ E T _ Y

2. Eliminated letters so far  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, I, D, P, H, W, L

3. Remaining letters that can still appear in positions 1 and 4  
   B, C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z

4. Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit the exact pattern _ E T _ Y and use only the remaining letters.

   - B E T T Y → T is already used once and we have no evidence that T repeats; also “BETTY” uses T twice.
   - C E T T Y → same issue with double T.
   - F E T C H → wrong length/pattern.
   - K E T C H → C, H eliminated.
   - J E T T Y → double T again, plus J is allowed but word is rare.
   - V E T C H → C, H eliminated.
   - Z E T T Y → double T and uncommon.

   The only common word that fits _ E T _ Y without using any eliminated letters and without repeating T is **""F E T C H""**, but H is eliminated.

   Re-checking the remaining consonants: none form a common word in the pattern _ E T _ Y except those that repeat T or use eliminated letters.

   But wait: the pattern _ _ T _ Y with E in slot 2 is strict.

   The word **""B E T T Y""** is valid despite the repeated T; the feedback so far never ruled out duplicate letters.

   But to avoid guessing a word with double T without evidence, let’s look for another option.

   The only common word left that fits _ E T _ Y is **""C E T T Y""** (but again double T).

   Actually, double letters are allowed unless ruled out. Given the very small pool of remaining letters, the most plausible choice is **B E T T Y**.

   However, we should also check if a letter has been ruled out in a position. All we know is that B has not been eliminated.

   Thus, best choice is to try **B E T T Y**.

   But let’s double-check the remaining letters again: positions 1 and 4 can use any of B, C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.

   The only common word fitting _ E T _ Y is **""F E T C H""** (invalid, H gone). Actually, the correct word is **""F E T C H""** but H is gone.

   Actually, the word **""B E T T Y""** is the only common word left fitting the pattern, even with a duplicate T.

   Therefore, the next guess should be **B E T T Y**.
