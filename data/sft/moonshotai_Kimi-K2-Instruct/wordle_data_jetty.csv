For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. According to letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to include several of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"", I'll select ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination should provide good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I
2. Letters that ARE in the word: E (not in position 5) and T (in position 3).

So the word looks like: _ _ T _ _, and must contain the letter E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3 (but position 3 is already T), or 4.

Letters we have NOT tested yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common consonants are B, C, D, L, M, P, and common vowels are only E (already known) and possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ T _ _, containing E in position 1, 2, or 4, and using only untested letters.

A good candidate is ""METED"" – but E appears twice which may be less informative.  
Another good choice is ""ELATE"" – but A is already known to be absent.  
""LATED"" – but A is absent.  
""FETED"" – but D and F are untested, E in correct spot.  
""DETER"" – T is already in position 3, but this puts E potentially in correct spots.  
""PETED"" – uses P, E, T, E, D; but double E may not help.  
""WETEN"" – N is already excluded.  

The word must fit _ _ T _ _, have E in 1, 2, or 4, and avoid all excluded letters.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known:
- NOT in word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, W, L  
- ARE in word (positions unknown except as below):
  – T is in position 3 (✓ from UNTIE & WETLY)  
  – E is in position 2 (✓ from WETLY)  
  – Y is in the word somewhere (but not in position 5, because WETLY shows Y in 5 is x)  

So the pattern is: _ E T _ _   (positions 2 and 3 already fixed)  
And the word must include the letter Y somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Letters still allowed (not ruled out) among common ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z plus Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:

and one of the three blanks must be Y; the other two must be from the allowed set and distinct from each other and from Y.

Possible immediate choices:
- Y E T _ _  → “YET” already uses three letters, but we need two more.  Yet…?  
  – Y E T C H → “YETCH” – valid word.  
  – Y E T C H uses Y, E, T, C, H.  All letters are still allowed and none are eliminated.  
  – It puts Y in position 1 (allowed).

Another:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

According to letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to include several of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"", I'll select ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination should provide good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E but NOT in position 5.
- The letters A, R, O, S are all absent.

Next I need a word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

High-frequency letters not yet tested include T, I, N, L, C, U, M, D, P, H, G, B.  
A strong candidate would be ""UNTIE"" – it has E in position 4, and uses U, N, T, I which are all common and untested. This should reveal more about remaining letters.

I’ll go with ""UNTIE"".

So the word looks like: _ _ T _ _, and must contain the letter E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3 (but position 3 is already T), or 4.

Letters we have NOT tested yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common consonants are B, C, D, L, M, P, and common vowels are only E (already known) and possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ T _ _, containing E in position 1, 2, or 4, and using only untested letters.

A good candidate is ""METED"" – but E appears twice which may be less informative.  
Another good choice is ""ELATE"" – but A is already known to be absent.  
""LATED"" – but A is absent.  
""FETED"" – but D and F are untested, E in correct spot.  
""DETER"" – T is already in position 3, but this puts E potentially in correct spots.  
""PETED"" – uses P, E, T, E, D; but double E may not help.  
""WETEN"" – N is already excluded.  

The word must fit _ _ T _ _, have E in 1, 2, or 4, and avoid all excluded letters.

Step 1 – Consolidate everything we know
- Positions already fixed:
  – position 2: E (✓)
  – position 3: T (✓)
  Word form: _ E T _ _

- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – E is already placed in position 2.
  – Y is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (from YETCH feedback Y(-)).

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
  A, R, O, S, U, N, I, W, L, C, H

- Remaining unused common letters (roughly descending frequency):
  B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z

Step 2 – Determine where Y can go
Y must occupy one of positions 4 or 5 (because positions 1 and 2 are excluded and position 3 is T).  So the two live patterns are:
  1. _ E T Y _
  2. _ E T _ Y

Step 3 – Find real words that fit
Pattern 1 (_ E T Y _): the only common 5-letter word ending with Y after “ETY” is “BETTY”.  But we already know T is only in position 3, so a second T would be invalid.  No other common word fits.

Pattern 2 (_ E T _ Y): we need two consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z}.  Possible combinations:
  - B E T G Y  → “BETGY” – not a word
  - D E T B Y  → “DETBY” – not a word
  - F E T C H  – C and H already excluded
  - G E T B Y  – “GETBY” – not a word
  - M E T G Y  – “METGY” – not a word
  - P E T B Y  – “PETBY” – not a word
  - B E T P Y  – “BETPY” – not a word
  - V E T B Y  – “VETBY” – not a word
  - B E T D Y  – “BETDY” – not a word
  - V E T K Y  – “VETKY” – not a word
  - P E T K Y  – “PETKY” – not a word
  - F E T I D  – I already excluded
  - D E T K Y  – “DETKY” – not a word
  - G E T Z Y  – “GETZY” – not a word
  - B E T K Y  – “BETKY” – not a word

Hmm – none of these are valid English words.  Let’s double-check real 5-letter words that match “_ E T _ Y”:

  - “BETTY” – double T disallowed (T already fixed in 3rd spot)
  - “PELTY” – P, E, L, T, Y  → L is excluded (from WETLY feedback)
  - “MELTY” – M, E, L, T, Y  → L excluded
  - “HETTY” – H excluded
  - “KETYL” – L excluded
  - “JETTY” – J is allowed but Y is already okay
  - “ZETTY” – Z is allowed

The only real word that satisfies all constraints is “JETTY” or “ZETTY”.  “JETTY” is far more common.

Step 4 – Final check
Word: J E T T Y
- J – allowed (never tested)
- E – must be in position 2 (✓ already)
- T – must be in position 3 (✓ already)
- T – second T would conflict with the single-T rule (T only allowed once, already in position 3)  
Thus “JETTY” is invalid because it uses a second T.

Next real possibility: “ZETTY”
- Z, E, T, T, Y – again a second T → invalid.

Conclusion:  The only remaining 5-letter English word that fits all constraints is “BETTY”, but it carries a second T.  Realizing the dictionary must be respected, and “BETTY” is the only common word left, we proceed with it, understanding the second T will be marked (x).

But wait – the feedback so far only guarantees T in position 3; nothing prevents a second T elsewhere.  In Wordle rules duplicate letters can occur.  Hence “BETTY” is actually legal, and we should test it.

So let’s guess “BETTY”.
</think>

<guess>BETTY</guess>",BETTY,"Step 1 – Consolidate everything we know
- Positions already fixed:
  – position 2: E (✓)
  – position 3: T (✓)
  Word form: _ E T _ _

- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – E is already placed in position 2.
  – Y is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (from YETCH feedback Y(-)).

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
  A, R, O, S, U, N, I, W, L, C, H

- Remaining unused common letters (roughly descending frequency):
  B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z

Step 2 – Determine where Y can go
Y must occupy one of positions 4 or 5 (because positions 1 and 2 are excluded and position 3 is T).  So the two live patterns are:
  1. _ E T Y _
  2. _ E T _ Y

Step 3 – Find real words that fit
Pattern 1 (_ E T Y _): the only common 5-letter word ending with Y after “ETY” is “BETTY”.  But we already know T is only in position 3, so a second T would be invalid.  No other common word fits.

Pattern 2 (_ E T _ Y): we need two consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z}.  Possible combinations:
  - B E T G Y  → “BETGY” – not a word
  - D E T B Y  → “DETBY” – not a word
  - F E T C H  – C and H already excluded
  - G E T B Y  – “GETBY” – not a word
  - M E T G Y  – “METGY” – not a word
  - P E T B Y  – “PETBY” – not a word
  - B E T P Y  – “BETPY” – not a word
  - V E T B Y  – “VETBY” – not a word
  - B E T D Y  – “BETDY” – not a word
  - V E T K Y  – “VETKY” – not a word
  - P E T K Y  – “PETKY” – not a word
  - F E T I D  – I already excluded
  - D E T K Y  – “DETKY” – not a word
  - G E T Z Y  – “GETZY” – not a word
  - B E T K Y  – “BETKY” – not a word

Hmm – none of these are valid English words.  Let’s double-check real 5-letter words that match “_ E T _ Y”:

  - “BETTY” – double T disallowed (T already fixed in 3rd spot)
  - “PELTY” – P, E, L, T, Y  → L is excluded (from WETLY feedback)
  - “MELTY” – M, E, L, T, Y  → L excluded
  - “HETTY” – H excluded
  - “KETYL” – L excluded
  - “JETTY” – J is allowed but Y is already okay
  - “ZETTY” – Z is allowed

The only real word that satisfies all constraints is “JETTY” or “ZETTY”.  “JETTY” is far more common.

Step 4 – Final check
Word: J E T T Y
- J – allowed (never tested)
- E – must be in position 2 (✓ already)
- T – must be in position 3 (✓ already)
- T – second T would conflict with the single-T rule (T only allowed once, already in position 3)  
Thus “JETTY” is invalid because it uses a second T.

Next real possibility: “ZETTY”
- Z, E, T, T, Y – again a second T → invalid.

Conclusion:  The only remaining 5-letter English word that fits all constraints is “BETTY”, but it carries a second T.  Realizing the dictionary must be respected, and “BETTY” is the only common word left, we proceed with it, understanding the second T will be marked (x).

But wait – the feedback so far only guarantees T in position 3; nothing prevents a second T elsewhere.  In Wordle rules duplicate letters can occur.  Hence “BETTY” is actually legal, and we should test it.

So let’s guess “BETTY”.",Guess 5: BETTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,jetty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. According to letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to include several of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"", I'll select ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination should provide good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter E but NOT in position 5.
- The letters A, R, O, S are all absent.

Next I need a word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

High-frequency letters not yet tested include T, I, N, L, C, U, M, D, P, H, G, B.  
A strong candidate would be ""UNTIE"" – it has E in position 4, and uses U, N, T, I which are all common and untested. This should reveal more about remaining letters.

I’ll go with ""UNTIE"".

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I
2. Letters that ARE in the word: E (not in position 5) and T (in position 3).

So the word looks like: _ _ T _ _, and must contain the letter E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3 (but position 3 is already T), or 4.

Letters we have NOT tested yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Among these, common consonants are B, C, D, L, M, P, and common vowels are only E (already known) and possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ T _ _, containing E in position 1, 2, or 4, and using only untested letters.

A good candidate is ""METED"" – but E appears twice which may be less informative.  
Another good choice is ""ELATE"" – but A is already known to be absent.  
""LATED"" – but A is absent.  
""FETED"" – but D and F are untested, E in correct spot.  
""DETER"" – T is already in position 3, but this puts E potentially in correct spots.  
""PETED"" – uses P, E, T, E, D; but double E may not help.  
""WETEN"" – N is already excluded.  

The word must fit _ _ T _ _, have E in 1, 2, or 4, and avoid all excluded letters.  
Let's go with ""ELATE"" – but A is excluded.  
Wait, A is x, so avoid A.  
Next: ""BETEL"" – E in 1 and 4, T in 3, B and L untested.  
""FETED"" – E in 2 and 4, T in 3, F and D untested.  
""LEPER"" – but R is excluded.  
""WETLY"" – uses W, E, T, L, Y; E in 2, L and Y untested.

I’ll choose ""WETLY"" as it tests new letters W, L, Y while complying with known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: WETLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(✓) T(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters known:
- NOT in word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, W, L  
- ARE in word (positions unknown except as below):
  – T is in position 3 (✓ from UNTIE & WETLY)  
  – E is in position 2 (✓ from WETLY)  
  – Y is in the word somewhere (but not in position 5, because WETLY shows Y in 5 is x)  

So the pattern is: _ E T _ _   (positions 2 and 3 already fixed)  
And the word must include the letter Y somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Letters still allowed (not ruled out) among common ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z plus Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[ ] E T [ ] [ ]  
and one of the three blanks must be Y; the other two must be from the allowed set and distinct from each other and from Y.

Possible immediate choices:
- Y E T _ _  → “YET” already uses three letters, but we need two more.  Yet…?  
  – Y E T C H → “YETCH” – valid word.  
  – Y E T C H uses Y, E, T, C, H.  All letters are still allowed and none are eliminated.  
  – It puts Y in position 1 (allowed).  
  – C and H are fresh test letters.

Another:  
- _ E T Y _  → positions 4 is Y.  Try “M E T Y L” – but L is excluded.  
  – “F E T Y D” – valid but D and F are un-tested.  
  – Either is acceptable, but “YETCH” feels more likely.

Let’s go with YETCH.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Consolidate everything we know

  – E is already placed in position 2.
  – Y is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (from YETCH feedback Y(-)).

- Remaining unused common letters (roughly descending frequency):
  B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z

Step 2 – Determine where Y can go
Y must occupy one of positions 4 or 5 (because positions 1 and 2 are excluded and position 3 is T).  So the two live patterns are:
  1. _ E T Y _
  2. _ E T _ Y

Step 3 – Find real words that fit
Pattern 1 (_ E T Y _): the only common 5-letter word ending with Y after “ETY” is “BETTY”.  But we already know T is only in position 3, so a second T would be invalid.  No other common word fits.

Pattern 2 (_ E T _ Y): we need two consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z}.  Possible combinations:
  - B E T G Y  → “BETGY” – not a word
  - D E T B Y  → “DETBY” – not a word
  - F E T C H  – C and H already excluded
  - G E T B Y  – “GETBY” – not a word
  - M E T G Y  – “METGY” – not a word
  - P E T B Y  – “PETBY” – not a word
  - B E T P Y  – “BETPY” – not a word
  - V E T B Y  – “VETBY” – not a word
  - B E T D Y  – “BETDY” – not a word
  - V E T K Y  – “VETKY” – not a word
  - P E T K Y  – “PETKY” – not a word
  - F E T I D  – I already excluded
  - D E T K Y  – “DETKY” – not a word
  - G E T Z Y  – “GETZY” – not a word
  - B E T K Y  – “BETKY” – not a word

Hmm – none of these are valid English words.  Let’s double-check real 5-letter words that match “_ E T _ Y”:

  - “BETTY” – double T disallowed (T already fixed in 3rd spot)
  - “PELTY” – P, E, L, T, Y  → L is excluded (from WETLY feedback)
  - “MELTY” – M, E, L, T, Y  → L excluded
  - “HETTY” – H excluded
  - “KETYL” – L excluded
  - “JETTY” – J is allowed but Y is already okay
  - “ZETTY” – Z is allowed

The only real word that satisfies all constraints is “JETTY” or “ZETTY”.  “JETTY” is far more common.

Step 4 – Final check
Word: J E T T Y
- J – allowed (never tested)
- E – must be in position 2 (✓ already)
- T – must be in position 3 (✓ already)
- T – second T would conflict with the single-T rule (T only allowed once, already in position 3)  
Thus “JETTY” is invalid because it uses a second T.

Possible combinations:\n  - B E T G Y  → “BETGY” – not a word\n  - D E T B Y  → “DETBY” – not a word\n  - F E T C H  – C and H already excluded\n  - G E T B Y  – “GETBY” – not a word\n  - M E T G Y  – “METGY” – not a word\n  - P E T B Y  – “PETBY” – not a word\n  - B E T P Y  – “BETPY” – not a word\n  - V E T B Y  – “VETBY” – not a word\n  - B E T D Y  – “BETDY” – not a word\n  - V E T K Y  – “VETKY” – not a word\n  - P E T K Y  – “PETKY” – not a word\n  - F E T I D  – I already excluded\n  - D E T K Y  – “DETKY” – not a word\n  - G E T Z Y  – “GETZY” – not a word\n  - B E T K Y  – “BETKY” – not a word\n\nHmm – none of these are valid English words.  Let’s double-check real 5-letter words that match “_ E T _ Y”:\n\n  - “BETTY” – double T disallowed (T already fixed in 3rd spot)\n  - “PELTY” – P, E, L, T, Y  → L is excluded (from WETLY feedback)\n  - “MELTY” – M, E, L, T, Y  → L excluded\n  - “HETTY” – H excluded\n  - “KETYL” – L excluded\n  - “JETTY” – J is allowed but Y is already okay\n  - “ZETTY” – Z is allowed\n\nThe only real word that satisfies all constraints is “JETTY” or “ZETTY”.  “JETTY” is far more common.\n\nStep 4 – Final check\nWord: J E T T Y\n- J – allowed (never tested)\n- E – must be in position 2 (✓ already)\n- T – must be in position 3 (✓ already)\n- T – second T would conflict with the single-T rule (T only allowed once, already in position 3)  \nThus “JETTY” is invalid because it uses a second T.\n\nNext real possibility: “ZETTY”\n- Z, E, T, T, Y – again a second T → invalid.\n\nConclusion:  The only remaining 5-letter English word that fits all constraints is “BETTY”, but it carries a second T.  Realizing the dictionary must be respected, and “BETTY” is the only common word left, we proceed with it, understanding the second T will be marked (x).\n\nBut wait – the feedback so far only guarantees T in position 3; nothing prevents a second T elsewhere.  In Wordle rules duplicate letters can occur.  Hence “BETTY” is actually legal, and we should test it.\n\nSo let’s guess “BETTY”.\n\n<guess>BETTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) E(-)\nGuess 3: WETLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) E(✓) T(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: YETCH -> FEEDBACK: Y(-) E(✓) T(✓) C(x) H(x)\nGuess 5: BETTY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s condense the latest feedback.

Pattern now known:
- Position 2: E (✓)
- Position 3: T (✓)
- Position 4: T (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
So the secret word looks like: _ E T T Y

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, W, L, C, H, B

Letters still unused among common consonants (and not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, K, M, P, V, X, Z

We only need a single consonant for the first position.  
Which of the remaining consonants can precede ETTY and make a real English word?
- DETTY – not a word
- FETTY – not a word
- GETTY – YES!  “Getty” (as in Gettysburg) is a dictionary-valid 5-letter word.

All letters used are still allowed and satisfy every constraint.
