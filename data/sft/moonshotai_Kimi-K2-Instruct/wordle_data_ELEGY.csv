I'm starting fresh with no information about the secret word. To maximize my chances of getting useful information, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers different positions. 

Good starting words often contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters for maximum coverage

A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it:
1. Contains S (very common starting letter)
2. Contains L, T (common consonants)
3. Contains A, E (most common vowels)
4. Has no repeated letters
5. Has good letter positioning potential (S and T often at ends, E at end)

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ L E _ _
- Forbidden letters: S, A, T, B, N, D, F, C, K
- Allowed remaining letters: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels I, O, U

Need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 from the allowed letters. We have:
- Position 1: any of G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
- Position 4: same pool
- Position 5: same pool, but note E is already at position 3 so remaining vowels I, O, U could fit

Looking for common 5-letter words with this pattern, focusing on high-frequency consonants and vowels for remaining positions. 

Key observations:
1. Position 1: Could start with G, H, J, M, P, R, V, W, Y
2. Position 5: Often ends with vowels (I, O, U) or consonants like R, Y
3. Position 4: Could be any remaining letter

Let's try ""GLYPH"":
- G: new consonant
- L: fixed
- E: fixed
- Y: new letter (vowel-like)
- H: new consonant

But Y is sometimes considered vowel-like, and H is allowed. However, ""GLYPH"" might be less common.

Better choice: ""GLYPH"" uses G, L, E, Y, H - all allowed. But let's think more common.

Next try: ""PLEUR"":
- P: allowed
- L: fixed
- E: fixed
- U: allowed vowel
- R: allowed consonant

But ""PLEUR"" isn't a common word.

More common word: ""PLEAS"" - but S is forbidden.

Next: ""GLOVE"" - but O is allowed, V allowed, E already used at 3. Wait, pattern is _ L E _ _, so ""GLOVE"" doesn't fit.

Realizing we need _ L E _ _, let's try ""CLIPE"" - but C is forbidden.

Better: ""G L E E _"" - but E is already at 3, can't repeat.

Actually, letters can repeat unless feedback indicates otherwise (no indication here). But we should avoid repeating unless useful.

Looking for common _ L E _ _ words:
- ""GLUED"" - D is forbidden
- ""PLIER"" - P, L, E, I, R - all allowed! And ""PLIER"" is a common word.

Check:
- P: allowed
- L: fixed at 2
- E: fixed at 3
- I: allowed vowel
- R: allowed consonant

This seems optimal as it tests P, I, R in the remaining positions.

But wait, ""PLIER"" has 5 letters: P(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5). But our pattern is _ L E _ _ (positions 2,3 are L,E). So ""PLIER"" would be P, L, I, E, R - but our E is at position 3, not 4. This would not fit _ L E _ _.

I made an error in interpreting the pattern. The pattern is:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
Thus, word is [1] L E [4] [5]

So ""GLYPH"" is G(1) L(2) Y(3) P(4) H(5) - but E must be at 3, so this is invalid.

Correct structure: _ L E _ _

Thus, the third letter must be E, and the 4th and 5th are open.

So possible words: _ L E _ _

Allowed letters for positions 1,4,5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Common words with this pattern:
- ""GLUED"" - D forbidden
- ""GLOVE"" - pattern is G L O V E, but we need _ L E _ _
- ""CLERK"" - C forbidden
- ""FLIER"" - F forbidden
- ""PLIER"" - as above, pattern mismatch
- ""OLIVE"" - but must be _ L E _ _

Wait, the only words fitting _ L E _ _ with allowed letters are rarer. Let's think systematically:

Position 1: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
Position 4: same
Position 5: same

Possible combinations:
G L E A _ - A forbidden
H L E _ _
J L E _ _
M L E _ _
P L E _ _
R L E _ _
V L E _ _
W L E _ _
Y L E _ _
Z L E _ _
I L E _ _
O L E _ _
U L E _ _

""GLEN"" is 4 letters.

""GLUED"" - D forbidden
""GLUER"" - R allowed, but is ""GLUER"" a word?

""GLUER"" is actually a valid word meaning one who glues.

Check letters:
G - allowed
L - fixed
U - allowed
E - fixed
R - allowed

This fits _ L E _ _ pattern: G L U E R - but wait, this would be G(1) L(2) U(3) E(4) R(5), but our E must be at 3, not 4. This shows my misunderstanding.

The pattern is positions:
1: ?
2: L
3: E
4: ?
5: ?

Thus, word is [1] L E [4] [5]

So ""GLUER"" is invalid because E is at 4, not 3.

Now correct: must be [1] L E [4] [5]

Allowed letters for 1,4,5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Possible words:
- ""G L E A N"" - A, N forbidden
- ""G L E A M"" - A forbidden
- ""H L E P S"" - S forbidden
- ""P L E A S"" - A, S forbidden
- ""R L E N D"" - N, D forbidden
- ""V L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""W L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""P L E U R"" - not common
- ""M L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""Y L E R T"" - T forbidden

Looking for valid English words:
""GLYPH"" - doesn't fit _ L E _ _

Actually, common words with _ L E _ _ are rare given constraints. Let's try:

""ULERY"" - not a word

""ULER"" - too short

""GLYER"" - not a word

""GLY"" - too short

Realizing this is tricky, let's try:

""CLERK"" - C forbidden

""FLIER"" - F forbidden

""PLIER"" - pattern mismatch

""OLIVE"" - pattern mismatch

""ELITE"" - E at 3 is correct, but word is E L I T E - pattern is _ L E _ _, so this would be E(1) L(2) I(3) T(4) E(5), but E must be at 3, not 4 or 5.

This shows _ L E _ _ is very restrictive. Let's think of common words:

- ""ALERT"" - A, T forbidden
- ""ELDER"" - D forbidden
- ""OLDER"" - D forbidden
- ""ULCER"" - C forbidden

Given the constraints, one possible valid word is ""GLUME"" - but this is not very common.

Another: ""PLUME"" - P allowed, L fixed, U allowed, M allowed, E must be at 3, but ""PLUME"" is P L U M E - E at 5, not 3.

Realizing I need to list allowed letters for each position:

Positions:
1: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
2: L (fixed)
3: E (fixed)
4: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Common _ L E _ _ words with allowed letters:
- ""GLUED"" - D forbidden
- ""GLUER"" - D forbidden
- ""GLYPH"" - pattern mismatch
- ""PLUME"" - pattern mismatch
- ""CLERK"" - C forbidden

""ULCER"" - C forbidden

""ELVER"" - E at 1, not allowed for position 1 (E is allowed at 1, but word must be _ L E _ _, so E L E V R - but is this valid?

""ELVER"" is a valid word (young eel), and fits:
E(1) L(2) E(3) V(4) R(5)

Check exclusions:
E - not forbidden
L - fixed
E - not forbidden
V - not forbidden
R - not forbidden

This seems valid.

Alternative: ""OLIVE"" - but pattern mismatch.

Thus, ""ELVER"" appears to fit all constraints.

But let's double-check:
- Pattern: _ L E _ _ → positions 2 and 3 must be L and E respectively. ""ELVER"" is E(1) L(2) E(3) V(4) R(5). This matches.

So ""ELVER"" is my next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

To maximize my chances of getting useful information, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers different positions. 

Good starting words often contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters for maximum coverage

A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it:
1. Contains S (very common starting letter)
2. Contains L, T (common consonants)
3. Contains A, E (most common vowels)
4. Has no repeated letters
5. Has good letter positioning potential (S and T often at ends, E at end)

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word AND already in the correct position (✓ on the second letter), so the word is _ L _ _ _
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in a wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Starts with any letter except S, A, T  
- Has L as its second letter
- Contains E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- Does NOT contain S, A, T

I want a guess that:
1. Keeps L in position 2.
2. Places E in a different position (1, 3, or 4).
3. Introduces new common letters (N, R, D, C, etc.) to test.

A good candidate is “BLEND”:
- B: new consonant to test
- L: stays fixed
- E: moved to position 3
- N, D: common consonants we haven’t tried

- Has pattern _ L E _ _
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, B, N, D
- Already fixed letters: L at 2, E at 3

Remaining unused common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y plus vowels I, O, U.

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining pool, avoiding all excluded letters.

- C: new consonant

Let's try ""GLYPH"":
- G: new consonant
- L: fixed
- E: fixed
- Y: new letter (vowel-like)
- H: new consonant

But Y is sometimes considered vowel-like, and H is allowed. However, ""GLYPH"" might be less common.

Better choice: ""GLYPH"" uses G, L, E, Y, H - all allowed. But let's think more common.

Next try: ""PLEUR"":
- P: allowed
- L: fixed
- E: fixed
- U: allowed vowel
- R: allowed consonant

But ""PLEUR"" isn't a common word.

More common word: ""PLEAS"" - but S is forbidden.

Next: ""GLOVE"" - but O is allowed, V allowed, E already used at 3. Wait, pattern is _ L E _ _, so ""GLOVE"" doesn't fit.

Realizing we need _ L E _ _, let's try ""CLIPE"" - but C is forbidden.

Better: ""G L E E _"" - but E is already at 3, can't repeat.

Actually, letters can repeat unless feedback indicates otherwise (no indication here). But we should avoid repeating unless useful.

Looking for common _ L E _ _ words:
- ""GLUED"" - D is forbidden
- ""PLIER"" - P, L, E, I, R - all allowed! And ""PLIER"" is a common word.

Check:
- P: allowed
- L: fixed at 2
- E: fixed at 3
- I: allowed vowel
- R: allowed consonant

This seems optimal as it tests P, I, R in the remaining positions.

But wait, ""PLIER"" has 5 letters: P(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5). But our pattern is _ L E _ _ (positions 2,3 are L,E). So ""PLIER"" would be P, L, I, E, R - but our E is at position 3, not 4. This would not fit _ L E _ _.

I made an error in interpreting the pattern. The pattern is:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
Thus, word is [1] L E [4] [5]

So ""GLYPH"" is G(1) L(2) Y(3) P(4) H(5) - but E must be at 3, so this is invalid.

Correct structure: _ L E _ _

Thus, the third letter must be E, and the 4th and 5th are open.

So possible words: _ L E _ _

Allowed letters for positions 1,4,5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Common words with this pattern:
- ""GLUED"" - D forbidden
- ""GLOVE"" - pattern is G L O V E, but we need _ L E _ _
- ""CLERK"" - C forbidden
- ""FLIER"" - F forbidden
- ""PLIER"" - as above, pattern mismatch
- ""OLIVE"" - but must be _ L E _ _

Wait, the only words fitting _ L E _ _ with allowed letters are rarer. Let's think systematically:

Position 1: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
Position 4: same
Position 5: same

Possible combinations:
G L E A _ - A forbidden
H L E _ _
J L E _ _
M L E _ _
P L E _ _
R L E _ _
V L E _ _
W L E _ _
Y L E _ _
Z L E _ _
I L E _ _
O L E _ _
U L E _ _

""GLEN"" is 4 letters.

""GLUED"" - D forbidden
""GLUER"" - R allowed, but is ""GLUER"" a word?

""GLUER"" is actually a valid word meaning one who glues.

Check letters:
G - allowed
L - fixed
U - allowed
E - fixed
R - allowed

This fits _ L E _ _ pattern: G L U E R - but wait, this would be G(1) L(2) U(3) E(4) R(5), but our E must be at 3, not 4. This shows my misunderstanding.

The pattern is positions:
1: ?
2: L
3: E
4: ?
5: ?

Thus, word is [1] L E [4] [5]

So ""GLUER"" is invalid because E is at 4, not 3.

Now correct: must be [1] L E [4] [5]

Allowed letters for 1,4,5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Possible words:
- ""G L E A N"" - A, N forbidden
- ""G L E A M"" - A forbidden
- ""H L E P S"" - S forbidden
- ""P L E A S"" - A, S forbidden
- ""R L E N D"" - N, D forbidden
- ""V L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""W L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""P L E U R"" - not common
- ""M L E R T"" - T forbidden
- ""Y L E R T"" - T forbidden

Looking for valid English words:
""GLYPH"" - doesn't fit _ L E _ _

Actually, common words with _ L E _ _ are rare given constraints. Let's try:

""ULERY"" - not a word

""ULER"" - too short

""GLYER"" - not a word

""GLY"" - too short

Realizing this is tricky, let's try:

""CLERK"" - C forbidden

""FLIER"" - F forbidden

""PLIER"" - pattern mismatch

""OLIVE"" - pattern mismatch

""ELITE"" - E at 3 is correct, but word is E L I T E - pattern is _ L E _ _, so this would be E(1) L(2) I(3) T(4) E(5), but E must be at 3, not 4 or 5.

This shows _ L E _ _ is very restrictive. Let's think of common words:

- ""ALERT"" - A, T forbidden
- ""ELDER"" - D forbidden
- ""OLDER"" - D forbidden
- ""ULCER"" - C forbidden

Given the constraints, one possible valid word is ""GLUME"" - but this is not very common.

Another: ""PLUME"" - P allowed, L fixed, U allowed, M allowed, E must be at 3, but ""PLUME"" is P L U M E - E at 5, not 3.

Realizing I need to list allowed letters for each position:

Positions:
1: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
2: L (fixed)
3: E (fixed)
4: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U
5: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U

Common _ L E _ _ words with allowed letters:
- ""GLUED"" - D forbidden
- ""GLUER"" - D forbidden
- ""GLYPH"" - pattern mismatch
- ""PLUME"" - pattern mismatch
- ""CLERK"" - C forbidden

""ULCER"" - C forbidden

""ELVER"" - E at 1, not allowed for position 1 (E is allowed at 1, but word must be _ L E _ _, so E L E V R - but is this valid?

""ELVER"" is a valid word (young eel), and fits:
E(1) L(2) E(3) V(4) R(5)

Check exclusions:
E - not forbidden
L - fixed
E - not forbidden
V - not forbidden
R - not forbidden

This seems valid.

Alternative: ""OLIVE"" - but pattern mismatch.

Thus, ""ELVER"" appears to fit all constraints.

But let's double-check:
- Pattern: _ L E _ _ → positions 2 and 3 must be L and E respectively. ""ELVER"" is E(1) L(2) E(3) V(4) R(5). This matches.

So ""ELVER"" is my next guess.Analyzing the feedback:
1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   implied: _ L _ _ _ , word contains E somewhere, and cannot contain S, A, T  
2. BLEND → B(x) L(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)  
   implied: _ L E _ _ , and cannot contain B, N, D  

3. FLECK → F(x) L(✓) E(✓) C(x) K(x)  
   adds: cannot contain F, C, K  

So far the word must be of the form **X L E Y Z** where  
- X, Y, Z are chosen from the still-allowed letters: G, H, J, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, O, U  
- The resulting sequence must be a valid English word

A common 5-letter word that fits is **ELVER** (a young eel), which is E L E V R.  
Its letters are all currently allowed, and it matches the required pattern.
