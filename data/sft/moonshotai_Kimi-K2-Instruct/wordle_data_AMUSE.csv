- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc., and ideally have no repeating letters.

Common effective starting words include ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of both vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback early on.

2. S is in the word and now located in position 4 (✓).  
3. A must appear somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.  
4. Letters known to be absent: L, T, R, I.

So far the pattern is: _ _ _ S E, and we still need to place A plus two new consonants.

The remaining consonants must be chosen from the unused common letters (N, D, C, H, M, etc.).  
A good plan is to put A in position 2 or 3 (avoiding its previous spots) and pick two fresh consonants for the other slots.

We now have three turns of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
2. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
3. CHASE → C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) E(✓)

Known facts:
- Word ends in ‑SE (positions 4 and 5).
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT positions 2 or 3 (from RAISE and CHASE both showing A(-)).
- S must be in position 4 (always ✓ there).
- Forbidden letters so far: L, T, R, I, C, H.

Therefore:
- Position 1 and 2 must be filled by two new consonants (from the remaining common set: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.).
- A must be in position 1 or 3 (since it’s banned from 2 and 3 in the earlier feedback, but now we know position 3 was only banned in prior guesses; actually the “A(-)” means it’s in the word but not in that exact spot, so let’s re-check: in SLATE A was position 3, got (-); in RAISE A was position 2, got (-); in CHASE A was position 3 again, got (-). So A is NOT in 2 or 3 ⇒ A must be in position 1.

Thus word pattern: A _ _ S E, with two fresh consonants in positions 2 and 3.

Candidate consonants left: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick common ones: N and D.

This yields A N D S E → “ANDSE” is not a valid word.  
Next, D and M → “ADMSE” no.  
B and N → “ABNSE” no.  
M and A: but A already fixed.  
Let’s use real words: “ABASE” – but S already at 4, duplicate not needed.  
“AMUSE” – U not yet tested, E already fine.  
“ABASE” repeats S.  
“ANISE” – I is banned.  
“ABASE” again fails on duplicate S.

Better: “ABASE” is invalid (S twice).  
Try “AMUSE”: A M U S E – U is new, M new, fits pattern A _ _ S E.

Check letters: A(allowed in 1), M(new), U(new), S(fixed), E(fixed); no banned letters.

Let’s lock it.
