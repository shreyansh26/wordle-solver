For the first guess, we want to pick a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word typically includes vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- These are all very common letters in English
- The combination covers different positions which helps narrow down possibilities quickly

What we now know:

1. Position 2 is definitely R (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2 (obviously), 3, or 5.  
   The only slot left for A is position 4.
3. E is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2 (obviously), 3, or 5.  
   The only slot left for E is position 3.
4. Letters already ruled out: C, N, G, P, B, V.

So the pattern must be:
_ R E A _

Still-allowed consonants for positions 1 and 5: D, F, H, K, L, M, S, T, W, Y, etc.

Among common 5-letter words fitting _ R E A _, a good test is “DREAD”.

- D and D are allowed.  
- Fits R, E, A in the required spots.  
- Provides fresh information about slot 5.
