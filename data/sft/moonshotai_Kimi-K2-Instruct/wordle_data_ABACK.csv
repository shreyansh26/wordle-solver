For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""CRATE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", and ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- I: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

So, the secret word:
- Definitely does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Contains A, but not in position 2.

Next steps:
1. We need to place the A somewhere other than position 2.
2. We should use new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet (letters like T, N, L, O, U, C, M, etc.).
3. A good second-guess template is to shift A to a new spot and fill the rest with fresh, high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:  
- MALTY (A in position 2 → discard, violates feedback)  
- MANTA (two A’s; but we only know one A exists)  
- ABOUT (A in position 1, new letters B, O, U, T)  
- COAST (S already excluded)  

""ABOUT"" fits: A is in position 1 (was position 2 before) and introduces B, O, U, T — all untested.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R, I, S, E are all absent.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.

From Guess 2 (ABOUT):
- A is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- B is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- O, U, T are all absent.

Current known structure:
1: A
2: B
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

Letters still allowed (excluding R, I, S, E, O, U, T):
Consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: only A is confirmed; other vowels could appear if not yet ruled out, but E, O, U are ruled out. So remaining vowels: only Y (sometimes vowel).

So possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 1 and B in position 2. Let’s brainstorm words starting with AB... and see which fit the remaining constraints.

Possible words:
- ABACK (but C and K are allowed, but we have no info on them yet)
- ABAFT (F and T are allowed, but T is ruled out)
- ABBED (unlikely word)
- ABBEY (Y allowed, but double B isn’t ruled out)
- ABHOR (H and R; R is ruled out)
- ABLER (R ruled out)
- ABLED (D allowed)
- ABMHO (O ruled out)
- ABODE (O and E ruled out)
- ABOIL (O and I ruled out)
- ABOMA (O ruled out)
- ABOON (O ruled out)
- ABORT (O and T ruled out)
- ABOUT (already guessed)
- ABOVE (O and E ruled out)
- ABRAM (R ruled out)
- ABRAM (R ruled out)
- ABUSE (U and E ruled out)
- ABUZZ (U and Z allowed, but U ruled out)
- ABYES (E and S ruled out)
- ABYSS (S ruled out)

Looking at the list, ""ABACK"" seems valid: A, B in correct spots; C and K are untested; second A is in position 4, which is allowed since we only know one A exists but it could appear again (though unlikely). However ""ABACK"" is a valid word and uses new letters.

Another candidate is ""ABYSS"" but S is ruled out. ""ABBEY"" is possible with double B and Y, but double B seems less likely given no info.

""ABACK"" is the most straightforward next guess to test C and K in positions 3 and 5.

But let me check: is there a better word? Another option is ""ABMHO"" but O is ruled out.

""ABLED"" uses D and L which are new letters and seems more likely than ""ABACK"". Let me verify:

ABLED:
- A in 1: ✓
- B in 2: ✓
- L in 3: new
- E in 4: ruled out (E is absent)
So E is in position 4 but E is absent → conflict. So ""ABLED"" is invalid.

""ABACK"":
- A in 1: ✓
- B in 2: ✓
- A in 3: possible (we only know A exists, could be multiple)
- C in 4: new
- K in 5: new
This seems valid.

""ABASH"":
- S is ruled out → invalid.

""ABACA"":
- C and A are allowed, but double A might be less likely.

""ABACK"" is the best option I see here.
