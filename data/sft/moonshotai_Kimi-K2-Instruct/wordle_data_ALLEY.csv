For the first guess, I don't have any previous feedback to work with, so I need to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, and avoiding rare letters like Q, Z, or X.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices among Wordle players include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Current constraints after two guesses:

1. First letter is A (locked ✓).
2. Letters ruled out: R, O, S, G, N, T.
3. Letter E is in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it was in position 4 in AGENT and got “-”, so it must be in 2 or 3).
4. No other letters are confirmed yet.

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _
with E in position 2 or 3, and the remaining two slots filled only by letters NOT in {R, O, S, G, N, T}.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y …
Vowels we can still use: I, U (A and E already present).

Possible fits:
- If E is in position 2: A E _ _ _
  Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y …
  Examples: AMBLE, APPLE, ACHED, AFIRE, AWARE (but W is okay), etc.

- If E is in position 3: A _ E _ _
  Examples: ABLED, AFTER, ACHED, ALERT, AMBER, AVERT, etc.

Let’s pick a word that keeps the spread of remaining letters high and uses frequent consonants.  
“ABLED” uses B, L, D, which are still allowed, and puts E in position 3.  
Another safe choice is “APPLE”, but double P may waste a letter.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I don't have any previous feedback to work with, so I need to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, and avoiding rare letters like Q, Z, or X.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices among Wordle players include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

- A is correct in the first position (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. Letters R, O, S are definitely out.
3. E is somewhere in positions 2-5 (since it's not in position 5 where it was guessed).

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing E (but not in position 5), and avoiding R, O, S.

Possible next guesses that fit these constraints: AGREE (but E is last, which is invalid), ABELE, ACHED, AGENT, AGILE, AIDER, ALIKE, ALIVE, ANGER, ANGLE, ALONE (but O is invalid), etc.

Looking through common words, ""AGENT"" seems good:
- Starts with A
- Contains E (in position 4)
- Uses new letters G, N, T to test
- Avoids R, O, S

3. Letter E is in the word, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (it was in position 4 in AGENT and got “-”, so it must be in 2 or 3).
4. No other letters are confirmed yet.

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _
with E in position 2 or 3, and the remaining two slots filled only by letters NOT in {R, O, S, G, N, T}.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y …
Vowels we can still use: I, U (A and E already present).

Possible fits:
- If E is in position 2: A E _ _ _
  Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y …
  Examples: AMBLE, APPLE, ACHED, AFIRE, AWARE (but W is okay), etc.

- If E is in position 3: A _ E _ _
  Examples: ABLED, AFTER, ACHED, ALERT, AMBER, AVERT, etc.

Let’s pick a word that keeps the spread of remaining letters high and uses frequent consonants.  
“ABLED” uses B, L, D, which are still allowed, and puts E in position 3.  
Another safe choice is “APPLE”, but double P may waste a letter.  
I’ll choose “ABLED” to test new consonants B, L, D.

Pattern check: A B L E D  
- Starts with A ✓  
- E in position 3 (allowed)
