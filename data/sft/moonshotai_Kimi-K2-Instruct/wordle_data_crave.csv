For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, H, D, C, U, M, F, P, G, W, Y, B, V, K, X, J, Q, Z. A good starting word should have multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with CRANE as it has three very common vowels (though A and E are the only vowels here), and two very common consonants (R, N) plus the somewhat common C. This should give good initial information about several key letters.

From the feedback:
- C(✓) → first letter is C
- R(✓) → second letter is R
- A(✓) → third letter is A
- N(x) → fourth letter is NOT N
- E(✓) → fifth letter is E

So the pattern is: C R A _ E  
We need a 5-letter word matching this pattern, with the fourth letter being any letter except N.

Possible letters for the 4th position (cannot be N): common consonants like M, S, T, D, L, etc.

Immediate candidate words:
- CRAME (valid word, meaning cream or cream-colored)
- CRATE (valid word, wooden frame)
- CRAVE (valid word, to desire strongly)
- CRAPE (valid word, crepe/crepe paper)

I'll go with CRAVE as it's a common word and ""V"" is a fairly common consonant.
