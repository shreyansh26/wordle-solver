For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters. Some popular starting words are:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E - 5 most common)
- STARE
- SLATE

I'll go with STARE as it uses S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters, and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should give us good information about letter positions and presence/absence.

From the feedback on STARE:

- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and is the third letter.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is the fourth letter.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A R _
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E
- Letters in the word: A, R (already positioned)

To maximize information, I should choose a word that:
1. Matches _ _ A R _
2. Uses new common letters not yet tested (like O, I, N, L, C, etc.)
3. Avoids S, T, E

Possible candidates:
- CHARD (C, H, A, R, D)
- FLARE (but E is excluded)
- CHARM (C, H, A, R, M)
- BOARD (B, O, A, R, D)
- GUARD (G, U, A, R, D)

I'll choose BOARD because it tests B, O, D (all new letters) and fits the pattern _ _ A R _
