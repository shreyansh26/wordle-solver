For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common, frequently used letters in different positions. Some excellent starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"".

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E

These all contain very common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, E - which are all among the most common letters in English 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- Uses common letters T, O, U

Another option is ""CLOUD"" but that has no S. ""SOUND"" is possible but has U in position 4 where we might want to test S elsewhere. ""STONY"" is good too.

Looking at these options:

A good strategy is to use a word with common, frequently used letters in different positions. Some excellent starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"".\n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E\n- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E\n- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E\n\nThese all contain very common letters. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, E - which are all among the most common letters in English 5-letter words.

Current confirmed structure: _ U S _ Y

Positions:
1 – unknown
2 – U (✓)
3 – S (✓)
4 – unknown
5 – Y (✓)

Letters ruled out so far:
Positions 1 and 4 cannot be any of R, A, I, E, T, O, D, K, N, L, F.

Still-allowed consonants for positions 1 or 4: B, C, G, H, M, P, V, W, Z.

But the feedback from “FUSSY” tells us:
- First letter F is NOT in the word (x)
- Fourth letter S is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (because the feedback for the second S in FUSSY was “-”)

So position 4 cannot be S (we already knew that) and we’ve now also ruled out F.

Looking at the remaining consonants, the most common ones that fit common English words with the pattern _ U S _ Y:

- B → B U S _ Y → “BUSBY” (but BUSBY is a proper noun/less common)
- G → “GUSHY”
- H → “HUSHY” (not a standard word)
- M → “MUSKY” (but K is out)
- P → “PUSHY”
- V → “VUGSY” (not a word)
- W → “WUSHY” (not a word)
- Z → “ZUSPY” (not a word)

So the only valid and common word left is “PUSHY”.

Let’s test it.
