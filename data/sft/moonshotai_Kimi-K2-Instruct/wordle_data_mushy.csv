- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common consonants and two vowels
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage and two vowels
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - three vowels and two common consonants

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it tests three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S) in positions that might reveal useful information about the secret word's structure.

Known letters:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 or 4.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, P.

Still unknown letters (among the most common): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

From Guess 2 we also learned:
- U is in the word, but not in position 3.
- M is in the word, but not in position 4.

So far, the word contains S, U, M in some order, but not in these positions:
- S ≠ 1,4
- U ≠ 3
- M ≠ 4

We have two slots still completely unknown (positions 2 and 5).

A good next move is to place S into a new position (2 or 3 or 5) and try fresh common consonants and the two remaining vowels (I is still untested). The word “FUSIM” comes to mind:

Positions:

Let’s summarize what we know after three guesses.

Letters in the word and their positions:
- U is now fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is now fixed in position 3 (✓).

Letters not in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, L, P, F, I.

Known positions (so far):
1: ?
2: U (fixed)
3: S (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

Letters still possible (i.e., not ruled out):
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 2 we learned M is in the word but not in position 4 (it appeared in Guess 2 in position 4 with feedback (-)).  
From Guess 3 we learned M is now in position 5 with feedback (-), so M is not in position 5 either.  
Therefore M must appear somewhere else: the only open positions are 1 and 4.  
Since position 5 is ruled out, M must be in 1 or 4.

We have two positions still unknown: 1 and 4.

A good next guess should:
- keep U in position 2 and S in position 3,
- place M in one of the still-possible positions (1 or 4),
- test new common consonants in the remaining slot.

Let’s try MUSKY:
- Position 1: M (tests M in position 1)
- Position 2: U (known correct)
- Position 3: S (known correct)
- Position 4: K (new letter)
- Position 5: Y (new letter)

This tests M in position 1 and brings in two fresh consonants (K, Y) in the remaining unknown slots.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with letters that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common consonants and two vowels
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - good consonant coverage and two vowels
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E - three vowels and two common consonants

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it tests three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S) in positions that might reveal useful information about the secret word's structure.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

This eliminates A, R, O, E and tells us S exists somewhere else than position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain A, R, O, E
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Uses letters we haven't tested yet

Letters we haven’t eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S)

A good next guess should test several new common consonants and vowels while including S in a different position. Let’s try “SLUMP” – it has:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- L, U, M, P (all new letters not yet tested)

From Guess 2 we also learned:
- U is in the word, but not in position 3.
- M is in the word, but not in position 4.

So far, the word contains S, U, M in some order, but not in these positions:
- S ≠ 1,4
- U ≠ 3
- M ≠ 4

We have two slots still completely unknown (positions 2 and 5).

A good next move is to place S into a new position (2 or 3 or 5) and try fresh common consonants and the two remaining vowels (I is still untested). The word “FUSIM” comes to mind:

Positions:
1: F (new)
2: U (moves from 3 to 2)
3: S (moves from 1 to 3)
4: I (new vowel)
5: M (moves from 4 to 5)

This tests F, I and repositions U, S, M to positions we haven’t eliminated.

2: U (fixed)
3: S (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

Letters still possible (i.e., not ruled out):
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 2 we learned M is in the word but not in position 4 (it appeared in Guess 2 in position 4 with feedback (-)).  
From Guess 3 we learned M is now in position 5 with feedback (-), so M is not in position 5 either.  
Therefore M must appear somewhere else: the only open positions are 1 and 4.  
Since position 5 is ruled out, M must be in 1 or 4.

We have two positions still unknown: 1 and 4.

A good next guess should:
- keep U in position 2 and S in position 3,
- place M in one of the still-possible positions (1 or 4),
- test new common consonants in the remaining slot.

Let’s try MUSKY:
- Position 1: M (tests M in position 1)
- Position 2: U (known correct)
- Position 3: S (known correct)
- Position 4: K (new letter)
- Position 5: Y (new letter)

This tests M in position 1 and brings in two fresh consonants (K, Y) in the remaining unknown slots.

Letters in correct positions:

- Position 5: Y

Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, P, F, I, K

Only unknown position is position 4 (the middle letter).

We need a 5-letter word that is M U S _ Y, where the blank must be a letter not yet ruled out.

From previous guesses, the only remaining common letters are: B, C, D, G, H, J, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at common English words, ""MUSKY"" was one possibility but K was ruled out. The most common remaining letters in this slot would be B, C, D, G, H, N, T.

Possible candidates:
- MUSBY
- MUSCY
- MUSDY
- MUSGY
- MUSHY
- MUSNY
- MUSTY

Among these, MUSTY is a real word and uses the common letter T.

Let's verify:
- M U S T Y
- All letters are allowed based on feedback
- No conflicts with existing rules
