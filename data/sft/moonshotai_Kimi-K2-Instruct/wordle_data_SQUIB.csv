This is my first guess, so I have no prior information. A good strategy is to start with a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

So far, the only letter confirmed to be somewhere in the word is S, and it is NOT in the 4th position (since it was marked “-”).  
We have already eliminated A, R, O, and E completely.

Since I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I want to pick a word that uses a mix of other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, sometimes Y) to gather more information.  
A good candidate is “UNITY”:
- It has S (actually it doesn’t—my mistake; let me rethink).

Let me choose instead “SLING”:
- It has S in the first position (new location).
- Uses I and N, which are common and haven’t appeared yet.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

Current constraints:

1. First letter: S (✓)
2. The letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since last two attempts placed I in 3rd position and got “-”)
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, N, G, P, C, Y
4. We still have 4 unknown positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and we know I must appear exactly once somewhere in those four slots, but not in position 3.

Remaining common English letters that have NOT been ruled out:
- Vowels: U (I is already required), sometimes Y is ruled out
- Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Z (but we want common/legal 5-letter words)

Let’s list possible positions for the required I:
- Position 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test new consonants that are common and haven’t been tried yet.

Possible patterns:
S _ I _ _   (I in position 2)
S _ _ I _   (I in position 4)
S _ _ _ I   (I in position 5)

Let’s try I in position 2: S I _ _ _

We need 3 more letters from remaining unused and common letters.  Good consonants left: D, T, H, M, K, B, F, etc.

Common 5-letter word starting with SI and avoiding banned letters: “SIDHU” (not common), “SITED” (uses E which is banned), “SITUP” (P is banned), “SILKY” (L and Y banned), “SICKO” (C and O banned), “SIMPS” (P banned), “SIXTH” (X possible, but we need to avoid H if we can).

Let’s try a common word: S I D _ _ but need two more letters.

Consider “SIXTH”:
- S I X T H
- Contains X and H, both not yet ruled out.

We need 3 more letters from remaining unused and common letters.  Good consonants left: D, T, H, M, K, B, F, etc.

Common 5-letter word starting with SI and avoiding banned letters: “SIDHU” (not common), “SITED” (uses E which is banned), “SITUP” (P is banned), “SILKY” (L and Y banned), “SICKO” (C and O banned), “SIMPS” (P banned), “SIXTH” (X possible, but we need to avoid H if we can).

Let’s try a common word: S I D _ _ but need two more letters.

Consider “SIXTH”:
- S I X T H
- Contains X and H, both not yet ruled out.
- Doesn’t contain any banned letters (A, R, O, E, L, N, G, P, C, Y).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

Let’s check:
- S (✓) – matches known.
- I (-) – we know I is in word, this placement hasn’t been tested in this position yet.
- X, T, H – all new letters.

This seems like a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. The word starts with S. (position 1 locked)
2. The letter I is in the word, but every position we have tried for I (3rd, 2nd) has given “-”.  
   → I must be in position 4 or 5.
3. All letters we have tested so far and which were marked “x” are permanently excluded:  
   A, R, O, E, L, N, G, P, C, Y, X, T, H.

That leaves the still-allowed consonants and vowels:  
B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, Z, plus the vowel U.

Pattern so far:  
S _ _ I _  or S _ _ _ I

Because position 2 and 3 are still fully unknown, let’s pick the most common remaining letters for those two spots, and decide on the final I placement.

Candidate consonants: D, K, M, B, F  
Candidate vowel: U (only remaining common vowel)

We need a real 5-letter word that starts with S, avoids all banned letters, and ends with either I or has I in 4th position.

Possible word: S U _ _ I  or S _ U I _  or S _ _ U I, etc.

Let’s try S K I M _ – but that would require I in 3rd (ruled out).

Try S U _ _ I pattern:  
“SUSHI” – contains H (banned).  
“SULKI” – contains L (banned).  
“SUKIY” – contains Y (banned).  

Try S _ _ _ I:  
“SUDSI” – not a common word.  
“SKIDI” – contains D twice (legal but uncommon).  
“SAMPI” – P is banned.  
“SWAMI” – contains A (banned).  
“SKIMI” – I in 3rd (banned).  

Try S _ _ I _ pattern:  
“SKIMP” – P banned.  
“SKIVE” – E banned.  
“SKIFF” – F allowed, word exists.  
“SKIFF” – letters: S, K, I, F, F.  
- Starts with S ✓  
- I is in 4th position (never tried before).  
- Uses new allowed letters K, F.  
- No banned letters appear.

Looks good.

What we now know for sure:

- The letter I must appear exactly once, somewhere in positions 2–5, and has so far been placed in positions 2, 3, 4 (and got “-” for each).  
  Therefore, the only remaining spot for I is position 5.

Banned letters (have appeared with “x”):

Still-allowed letters (consonants): B, D, J, M, Q, V, W, Z

We need three more letters for positions 2, 3, 4 that:
- are not on the banned list
- together with S and I form a valid English word.

Possible letters left: B, D, J, M, Q, V, W, Z, U.
