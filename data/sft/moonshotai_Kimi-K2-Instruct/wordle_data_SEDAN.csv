For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A word that covers several of these common letters would be ideal. After considering options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in the secret word, providing maximum information potential with this first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain R or O.
- It DOES contain A, S, and E, but none of them are in their guessed positions (positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).

Given that, for the second guess I want to:
1. Place the known letters (A, S, E) in new positions.
2. Introduce new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid R and O.

A good next word would reposition A, S, and E while inserting common untested letters like T, N, or I. ""STEAK"" fits this:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- T is new (common).
- E moves to position 3 (was position 5).
- A moves to position 4 (was position 1).
- K is new (moderately common).

This tests new letters and repositions the known ones.

Feedback summary so far
- Letters we know are in the word (but not yet in the right positions):  
  A  (from AROSE, position 1)  
  E  (from AROSE, position 5 and from STEAK, position 3)  
  S  (from AROSE, position 4)  

- Letters that are definitely out: R, O, T, K.

From the STEAK feedback:
- S is in the word and already in the right position (1st letter) → word starts with S.
- A is in the word and already in the right position (4th letter) → word has the pattern S _ _ A _.
- E is in the word but wrong position so far (it was tried in positions 3 and 5). That leaves 2nd or 4th slot, but 4th is already A, so E must be in position 2.

Current pattern: S E _ A _

Remaining unused common letters: C, I, N, L, D, B, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

We only need one more consonant for the 3rd slot. Common choices would be C, N, L, D, H, M.

Choosing N gives a common word: S E N A _  
The only common 5-letter word fitting S E N A _ is “SENAC” (but that’s not a standard English word) or “SENAT” (non-English, likely invalid).  
Better: S E N A L (but “SENAL” is not valid).  
S E N A R → “SENAR” invalid.  
S E N A P → “SENAP” invalid.  
S E N A M → “SENAM” invalid.  
S E N A G → “SENAG” invalid.  
S E N A D → “SENAD” invalid.  

Let’s try a different consonant: S E C A _  
Only one common word: S E C A N (invalid).  
S E C A L (invalid).  
S E C A M (invalid).  
S E C A P (invalid).  

Next try: S E L A _  
“SELAK” invalid.  
“SELAM” invalid.  
“SELAR” invalid.  
“SELAB” invalid.  

Try: S E D A _  
“SEDAN” — that’s a perfectly valid English word.

Pattern check:
S (✓) E (must be in position 2) D (new) A (✓) N (new).

This satisfies every known constraint.
