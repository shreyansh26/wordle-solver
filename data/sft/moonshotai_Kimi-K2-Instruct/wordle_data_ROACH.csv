Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me good coverage of common English letters to maximize the information gained. 

A good first guess strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"". 

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

My goal is to choose a word that will give me good coverage of common English letters to maximize the information gained. 

A good first guess strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"". 

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct (fourth) position (✓)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has an A in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- It does NOT contain S, L, T, E

I want a new guess that keeps A in position 4 and introduces other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good letters to try next include R, N, I, C, O, U, G, H, M, D, etc.

A strong candidate is “CRAIN” but that contains T which is ruled out. Another good pattern is _ _ _ A _ with common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U).

“CHAIR” would place A in position 3, which is wrong.

“PLANK” – but L and T are ruled out, and P isn’t as common.

“GRAIN” – A is in the right spot, and G, R, I, N are new, all high-frequency letters.

Yes, GRAIN keeps A in the correct place and introduces G, R, I, N—none of which were in the first guess and none of which are S, L, T, E.

We still need:
1. A consonant in position 2 (R is in the word but cannot be in slot 2).
2. Two more consonants/vowels for slots 1, 3, and 5.

A good candidate is “BOARD”:
- B, O, R, D are all new letters not yet used.
- R is present and in slot 3, satisfying “R exists but not in slot 2”.
- Keeps A in slot 4.
- Uses common letters B, O, D.

Another candidate is “CHARM” but M hasn’t been ruled out yet and might be useful later.

Choosing “BOARD” gives us coverage of B, O, R, D, and still keeps A fixed.
