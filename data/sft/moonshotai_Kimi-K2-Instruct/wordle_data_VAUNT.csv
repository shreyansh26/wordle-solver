The first guess is always the hardest since we have no information to go on. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to test their presence/absence
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Good letter distribution across positions

Some popular strong starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" - covers all 5 vowels plus S (common)
- ""RAISE"" - very common letters
- ""SLATE"" - common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests all vowels plus S, which are extremely common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Remaining useful common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K
Remaining useful vowels: I, U, Y (since A is already known to be present and E, O are absent)

Good next step is to test new common letters while placing A in a different spot. A good candidate would include letters like T, N, L, I, U to gather more information.

Since A is in the word but not first, let's try placing it second. A word like ""TAINT"" would be ideal but contains T twice (and we don't know about T yet). Instead, let's try ""UNTAI"" - but that's not a valid word.

Better to pick a valid word with letters we haven't tested yet. Let's try ""INPUT"" - but it has P and T (P is less common). 

Another option is ""LAUGH"" - but has G and H which are less common.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIL"" - contains U, N, T, I, L - all relatively common letters, places A isn't in first spot, and tests new vowels/consonants.

But we know A must be present, so let's ensure A is included. Let's try ""PLANT"" - but we don't know about P, L, N, T.

Actually, let's use ""PAINT"" - contains P, A, I, N, T - all new letters except A (which we know is present), and places A in second position (since it can't be first).

But we should probably test more vowels first. Let's try ""ADIEU"" - but E and U are in it, E is confirmed absent.

Better to test more consonants. Let's try ""PLANK"" - no, K is less common.

Let's go with ""PAINT"" - it includes A (known to be present), and tests P, I, N, T which are new and common.

From the new feedback on PAINT:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (2nd spot).
- I(x), N(✓), T(✓) → I is not in the word, N and T are in their correct positions.

So we now know the word has the pattern:
_ A N T _

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: T

Letters confirmed absent from entire word: R, O, S, E, P, I

Remaining common letters to test for the first and fifth positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters, has A-N-T in positions 2-4, and ends with one of these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BANTU (but U is uncommon in this position)
- CANTO (but O is absent)
- DANTE (but E is absent)
- HANTS (but S is absent)
- MANTA (but A is repeated and already in position 2)
- VANTA (not a valid word)
- WANT (only 4 letters)
- CANTY (but Y is less common)

Looking at valid words:
- CANTY is valid but Y is less common
- BANTU is valid but U is less common
- MANTA is valid but repeats A
- DANTE is invalid (E is absent)
- HANTS is invalid (S is absent)

Let's try CANTY as it's the most valid option among those, testing C and Y.

But actually, let's think of other valid words with A-N-T in 2-4 positions:
- BANTU
- CANTO (invalid, has O)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- MANTA (invalid, repeats A)
- VANTA (invalid)
- WANTS (invalid, has S and E)

Another approach: look for words ending in ANT plus one letter, but that's not our pattern.

Wait, let's list possible valid words with pattern _ A N T _:
- BANTU
- CANTY
- DANTE (invalid)
- HANTS (invalid)
- MANTA (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid, has P,O)
- RANT (invalid, has R)
- SANTA (invalid, has S)
- TANTO (invalid, has T,O)
- WANT (invalid)

The most valid option is CANTY, testing C and Y.

But since Y is less common and we have few guesses left, let's instead try BANTU to test B and U.

Actually, let's think differently - what valid English words fit _ A N T _ ?

Looking up valid words:
- BANTU (proper noun, may not count)
- CANTY (valid but uncommon)
- MANTA (valid, but repeats A)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- DANTE (invalid, has E)
- RANT (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid)

This suggests our pattern might be too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PAINT:
- A(✓) means A is in position 2 - correct.
- N(✓) means N is in position 3 - correct.
- T(✓) means T is in position 4 - correct.

So the word must be _ A N T _

Looking through valid 5-letter words matching _ A N T _:
- CANTY
- BANTU (questionable)
- MANTA (but MANTA has A in position 5, which would be allowed since A is only confirmed in position 2)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)

The clearest valid word is CANTY, testing C and Y.

However, CANTY is quite obscure. Let's see if there's a better word.

Actually, the most common word fitting _ A N T _ is probably ""HANT"" but that's 4 letters.

Wait, let's think of ""CHANT"" - but that would require:
- C, H, A, N, T
- But from PAINT, position 1 isn't confirmed yet, N is in position 3, T in 4.

But CHANT would be:
C _ _ _ _
_ H _ _ _
_ _ A _ _
_ _ _ N _
_ _ _ _ T

But our pattern is _ A N T _ from PAINT feedback (A in 2, N in 3, T in 4).

So CHANT would fit _ A N T _ ? No, CHANT has:
1: C
2: H
3: A
4: N
5: T

This contradicts our feedback from PAINT which says:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)

Therefore, the word must be _ A N T _

Only valid common word seems to be CANTY.

But let's test CANTY to confirm the pattern:
C A N T Y
- Position 1: C (new test)
- Position 5: Y (new test)

This seems our best option given the constraints.
</think>

From the clues we have the fixed pattern _ A N T _ (A in position 2, N in 3, T in 4), and we know the letters not to use include R, O, S, E, P, I.

A valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is ""CANTY"". Let's test this to confirm positions 1 and 5.

<guess>CANTY</guess>",CANTY,"From the new feedback on PAINT:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (2nd spot).
- I(x), N(✓), T(✓) → I is not in the word, N and T are in their correct positions.

So we now know the word has the pattern:
_ A N T _

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: T

Letters confirmed absent from entire word: R, O, S, E, P, I

Remaining common letters to test for the first and fifth positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters, has A-N-T in positions 2-4, and ends with one of these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BANTU (but U is uncommon in this position)
- CANTO (but O is absent)
- DANTE (but E is absent)
- HANTS (but S is absent)
- MANTA (but A is repeated and already in position 2)
- VANTA (not a valid word)
- WANT (only 4 letters)
- CANTY (but Y is less common)

Looking at valid words:
- CANTY is valid but Y is less common
- BANTU is valid but U is less common
- MANTA is valid but repeats A
- DANTE is invalid (E is absent)
- HANTS is invalid (S is absent)

Let's try CANTY as it's the most valid option among those, testing C and Y.

But actually, let's think of other valid words with A-N-T in 2-4 positions:
- BANTU
- CANTO (invalid, has O)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- MANTA (invalid, repeats A)
- VANTA (invalid)
- WANTS (invalid, has S and E)

Another approach: look for words ending in ANT plus one letter, but that's not our pattern.

Wait, let's list possible valid words with pattern _ A N T _:
- BANTU
- CANTY
- DANTE (invalid)
- HANTS (invalid)
- MANTA (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid, has P,O)
- RANT (invalid, has R)
- SANTA (invalid, has S)
- TANTO (invalid, has T,O)
- WANT (invalid)

The most valid option is CANTY, testing C and Y.

But since Y is less common and we have few guesses left, let's instead try BANTU to test B and U.

Actually, let's think differently - what valid English words fit _ A N T _ ?

Looking up valid words:
- BANTU (proper noun, may not count)
- CANTY (valid but uncommon)
- MANTA (valid, but repeats A)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- DANTE (invalid, has E)
- RANT (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid)

This suggests our pattern might be too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PAINT:
- A(✓) means A is in position 2 - correct.
- N(✓) means N is in position 3 - correct.
- T(✓) means T is in position 4 - correct.

So the word must be _ A N T _

Looking through valid 5-letter words matching _ A N T _:
- CANTY
- BANTU (questionable)
- MANTA (but MANTA has A in position 5, which would be allowed since A is only confirmed in position 2)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)

The clearest valid word is CANTY, testing C and Y.

However, CANTY is quite obscure. Let's see if there's a better word.

Actually, the most common word fitting _ A N T _ is probably ""HANT"" but that's 4 letters.

Wait, let's think of ""CHANT"" - but that would require:
- C, H, A, N, T
- But from PAINT, position 1 isn't confirmed yet, N is in position 3, T in 4.

But CHANT would be:
C _ _ _ _
_ H _ _ _
_ _ A _ _
_ _ _ N _
_ _ _ _ T

But our pattern is _ A N T _ from PAINT feedback (A in 2, N in 3, T in 4).

So CHANT would fit _ A N T _ ? No, CHANT has:
1: C
2: H
3: A
4: N
5: T

This contradicts our feedback from PAINT which says:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)

Therefore, the word must be _ A N T _

Only valid common word seems to be CANTY.

But let's test CANTY to confirm the pattern:
C A N T Y
- Position 1: C (new test)
- Position 5: Y (new test)

This seems our best option given the constraints.From the clues we have the fixed pattern _ A N T _ (A in position 2, N in 3, T in 4), and we know the letters not to use include R, O, S, E, P, I.

A valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is ""CANTY"". Let's test this to confirm positions 1 and 5.",Guess 3: CANTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(-) T(-) Y(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,VAUNT,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to test their presence/absence
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Good letter distribution across positions

Some popular strong starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" - covers all 5 vowels plus S (common)
- ""RAISE"" - very common letters
- ""SLATE"" - common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests all vowels plus S, which are extremely common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Remaining useful common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K
Remaining useful vowels: I, U, Y (since A is already known to be present and E, O are absent)

Good next step is to test new common letters while placing A in a different spot. A good candidate would include letters like T, N, L, I, U to gather more information.

Since A is in the word but not first, let's try placing it second. A word like ""TAINT"" would be ideal but contains T twice (and we don't know about T yet). Instead, let's try ""UNTAI"" - but that's not a valid word.

Better to pick a valid word with letters we haven't tested yet. Let's try ""INPUT"" - but it has P and T (P is less common). 

Another option is ""LAUGH"" - but has G and H which are less common.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIL"" - contains U, N, T, I, L - all relatively common letters, places A isn't in first spot, and tests new vowels/consonants.

But we know A must be present, so let's ensure A is included. Let's try ""PLANT"" - but we don't know about P, L, N, T.

Actually, let's use ""PAINT"" - contains P, A, I, N, T - all new letters except A (which we know is present), and places A in second position (since it can't be first).

But we should probably test more vowels first. Let's try ""ADIEU"" - but E and U are in it, E is confirmed absent.

Better to test more consonants. Let's try ""PLANK"" - no, K is less common.

Let's go with ""PAINT"" - it includes A (known to be present), and tests P, I, N, T which are new and common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on PAINT:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (2nd spot).
- I(x), N(✓), T(✓) → I is not in the word, N and T are in their correct positions.

So we now know the word has the pattern:
_ A N T _

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: T

Letters confirmed absent from entire word: R, O, S, E, P, I

Remaining common letters to test for the first and fifth positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters, has A-N-T in positions 2-4, and ends with one of these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BANTU (but U is uncommon in this position)
- CANTO (but O is absent)
- DANTE (but E is absent)
- HANTS (but S is absent)
- MANTA (but A is repeated and already in position 2)
- VANTA (not a valid word)
- WANT (only 4 letters)
- CANTY (but Y is less common)

Looking at valid words:
- CANTY is valid but Y is less common
- BANTU is valid but U is less common
- MANTA is valid but repeats A
- DANTE is invalid (E is absent)
- HANTS is invalid (S is absent)

Let's try CANTY as it's the most valid option among those, testing C and Y.

From the latest feedback:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.

- N(-) → N is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So:
1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _
2. N must appear, but not in position 3.
3. T must appear, but not in position 4.
4. Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- They must be in different positions.

Also, the remaining candidate consonants (excluding the eliminated ones) for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W.

Let’s list the constraints:
- Position 2: A
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5
- T must be in 1, 3, or 5
- No repeated letters among N and T (since they must be in different positions)
- Use only the remaining consonants for other positions

Possible configurations:
1. If N is in 1 and T is in 3: N A T _ _
2. If N is in 1 and T is in 5: N A _ _ T
3. If N is in 4 and T is in 1: T A _ N _
4. If N is in 4 and T is in 5: _ A _ N T
5. If N is in 5 and T is in 1: T A _ _ N
6. If N is in 5 and T is in 3: _ A T _ N

Now we check which of these patterns form valid English words using the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).

- N A T _ _: NAT?? → No valid 5-letter words starting with NAT.
- N A _ _ T: NA??T → Valid words: NAIVT (not valid), NAMPT (not valid), NAPHT (not valid) – none found.
- T A _ N _: TA?N? → Valid words: TANGY (but Y eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TALON (O eliminated), TAWNY (Y eliminated) – none fit.
- _ A _ N T: ?A?NT → Valid words: BANT (4 letters), DANT (not valid), GANT (not valid), HANT (S eliminated), MANT (not valid), WANT (S eliminated) – none fit.
- T A _ _ N: TA??N → Valid words: TABUN (valid but U is allowed, B is allowed), TALON (O eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAXON (O eliminated) – TABUN is valid but obscure.
- _ A T _ N: ?AT?N → Valid words: BATON (O eliminated), CATEN (E eliminated), FATIN (I eliminated), GATEN (E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATIN (I eliminated), MATIN (I eliminated), PATIN (P eliminated) – none fit.

This leaves us with the most plausible valid word being TABUN, though it's uncommon.

However, let me re-examine possible words more carefully.

Looking at pattern _ A T _ N (T in 3, N in 5):
Valid word: GATEN (but E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATEN (E eliminated), MATEN (E eliminated) – none fit.

Looking at pattern T A _ _ N (T in 1, N in 5):
Valid word: TABUN (valid, uses B and U which are allowed).

Therefore, the best guess is TABUN.

The constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- N must appear but NOT in position 3.
- T must appear but NOT in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

A valid arrangement is T in position 1 and N in position 5, giving T A _ _ N. The remaining letters can be B and U, forming the word TABUN.

Also, the remaining candidate consonants (excluding the eliminated ones) for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W.

Let’s list the constraints:
- Position 2: A
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5
- T must be in 1, 3, or 5
- No repeated letters among N and T (since they must be in different positions)
- Use only the remaining consonants for other positions

Possible configurations:
1. If N is in 1 and T is in 3: N A T _ _
2. If N is in 1 and T is in 5: N A _ _ T
3. If N is in 4 and T is in 1: T A _ N _
4. If N is in 4 and T is in 5: _ A _ N T
5. If N is in 5 and T is in 1: T A _ _ N
6. If N is in 5 and T is in 3: _ A T _ N

Now we check which of these patterns form valid English words using the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).

- N A T _ _: NAT?? → No valid 5-letter words starting with NAT.
- N A _ _ T: NA??T → Valid words: NAIVT (not valid), NAMPT (not valid), NAPHT (not valid) – none found.
- T A _ N _: TA?N? → Valid words: TANGY (but Y eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TALON (O eliminated), TAWNY (Y eliminated) – none fit.
- _ A _ N T: ?A?NT → Valid words: BANT (4 letters), DANT (not valid), GANT (not valid), HANT (S eliminated), MANT (not valid), WANT (S eliminated) – none fit.
- T A _ _ N: TA??N → Valid words: TABUN (valid but U is allowed, B is allowed), TALON (O eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAXON (O eliminated) – TABUN is valid but obscure.
- _ A T _ N: ?AT?N → Valid words: BATON (O eliminated), CATEN (E eliminated), FATIN (I eliminated), GATEN (E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATIN (I eliminated), MATIN (I eliminated), PATIN (P eliminated) – none fit.

This leaves us with the most plausible valid word being TABUN, though it's uncommon.

However, let me re-examine possible words more carefully.

Looking at pattern _ A T _ N (T in 3, N in 5):
Valid word: GATEN (but E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATEN (E eliminated), MATEN (E eliminated) – none fit.

Looking at pattern T A _ _ N (T in 1, N in 5):
Valid word: TABUN (valid, uses B and U which are allowed).

Therefore, the best guess is TABUN.The constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- N must appear but NOT in position 3.
- T must appear but NOT in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

A valid arrangement is T in position 1 and N in position 5, giving T A _ _ N. The remaining letters can be B and U, forming the word TABUN.",Guess 4: TABUN -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) B(x) U(-) N(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to test their presence/absence
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Good letter distribution across positions

Some popular strong starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" - covers all 5 vowels plus S (common)
- ""RAISE"" - very common letters
- ""SLATE"" - common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests all vowels plus S, which are extremely common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Remaining useful common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K
Remaining useful vowels: I, U, Y (since A is already known to be present and E, O are absent)

Good next step is to test new common letters while placing A in a different spot. A good candidate would include letters like T, N, L, I, U to gather more information.

Since A is in the word but not first, let's try placing it second. A word like ""TAINT"" would be ideal but contains T twice (and we don't know about T yet). Instead, let's try ""UNTAI"" - but that's not a valid word.

Better to pick a valid word with letters we haven't tested yet. Let's try ""INPUT"" - but it has P and T (P is less common). 

Another option is ""LAUGH"" - but has G and H which are less common.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIL"" - contains U, N, T, I, L - all relatively common letters, places A isn't in first spot, and tests new vowels/consonants.

But we know A must be present, so let's ensure A is included. Let's try ""PLANT"" - but we don't know about P, L, N, T.

Actually, let's use ""PAINT"" - contains P, A, I, N, T - all new letters except A (which we know is present), and places A in second position (since it can't be first).

But we should probably test more vowels first. Let's try ""ADIEU"" - but E and U are in it, E is confirmed absent.

Better to test more consonants. Let's try ""PLANK"" - no, K is less common.

Let's go with ""PAINT"" - it includes A (known to be present), and tests P, I, N, T which are new and common.

<guess>PAINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on PAINT:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (2nd spot).
- I(x), N(✓), T(✓) → I is not in the word, N and T are in their correct positions.

So we now know the word has the pattern:
_ A N T _

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: T

Letters confirmed absent from entire word: R, O, S, E, P, I

Remaining common letters to test for the first and fifth positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters, has A-N-T in positions 2-4, and ends with one of these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BANTU (but U is uncommon in this position)
- CANTO (but O is absent)
- DANTE (but E is absent)
- HANTS (but S is absent)
- MANTA (but A is repeated and already in position 2)
- VANTA (not a valid word)
- WANT (only 4 letters)
- CANTY (but Y is less common)

Looking at valid words:
- CANTY is valid but Y is less common
- BANTU is valid but U is less common
- MANTA is valid but repeats A
- DANTE is invalid (E is absent)
- HANTS is invalid (S is absent)

Let's try CANTY as it's the most valid option among those, testing C and Y.

But actually, let's think of other valid words with A-N-T in 2-4 positions:
- BANTU
- CANTO (invalid, has O)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- MANTA (invalid, repeats A)
- VANTA (invalid)
- WANTS (invalid, has S and E)

Another approach: look for words ending in ANT plus one letter, but that's not our pattern.

Wait, let's list possible valid words with pattern _ A N T _:
- BANTU
- CANTY
- DANTE (invalid)
- HANTS (invalid)
- MANTA (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid, has P,O)
- RANT (invalid, has R)
- SANTA (invalid, has S)
- TANTO (invalid, has T,O)
- WANT (invalid)

The most valid option is CANTY, testing C and Y.

But since Y is less common and we have few guesses left, let's instead try BANTU to test B and U.

Actually, let's think differently - what valid English words fit _ A N T _ ?

Looking up valid words:
- BANTU (proper noun, may not count)
- CANTY (valid but uncommon)
- MANTA (valid, but repeats A)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- DANTE (invalid, has E)
- RANT (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid)

This suggests our pattern might be too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PAINT:
- A(✓) means A is in position 2 - correct.
- N(✓) means N is in position 3 - correct.
- T(✓) means T is in position 4 - correct.

So the word must be _ A N T _

Looking through valid 5-letter words matching _ A N T _:
- CANTY
- BANTU (questionable)
- MANTA (but MANTA has A in position 5, which would be allowed since A is only confirmed in position 2)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)

The clearest valid word is CANTY, testing C and Y.

However, CANTY is quite obscure. Let's see if there's a better word.

Actually, the most common word fitting _ A N T _ is probably ""HANT"" but that's 4 letters.

Wait, let's think of ""CHANT"" - but that would require:
- C, H, A, N, T
- But from PAINT, position 1 isn't confirmed yet, N is in position 3, T in 4.

But CHANT would be:
C _ _ _ _
_ H _ _ _
_ _ A _ _
_ _ _ N _
_ _ _ _ T

But our pattern is _ A N T _ from PAINT feedback (A in 2, N in 3, T in 4).

So CHANT would fit _ A N T _ ? No, CHANT has:
1: C
2: H
3: A
4: N
5: T

This contradicts our feedback from PAINT which says:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)

Therefore, the word must be _ A N T _

Only valid common word seems to be CANTY.

But let's test CANTY to confirm the pattern:
C A N T Y
- Position 1: C (new test)
- Position 5: Y (new test)

This seems our best option given the constraints.From the clues we have the fixed pattern _ A N T _ (A in position 2, N in 3, T in 4), and we know the letters not to use include R, O, S, E, P, I.

A valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is ""CANTY"". Let's test this to confirm positions 1 and 5.

<guess>CANTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
Guess 3: CANTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is still fixed in position 2.
- N(-) → N is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but **not** in position 4.
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

So:
1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _
2. N must appear, but not in position 3.
3. T must appear, but not in position 4.
4. Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- They must be in different positions.

Also, the remaining candidate consonants (excluding the eliminated ones) for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W.

Let’s list the constraints:
- Position 2: A
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5
- T must be in 1, 3, or 5
- No repeated letters among N and T (since they must be in different positions)
- Use only the remaining consonants for other positions

Possible configurations:
1. If N is in 1 and T is in 3: N A T _ _
2. If N is in 1 and T is in 5: N A _ _ T
3. If N is in 4 and T is in 1: T A _ N _
4. If N is in 4 and T is in 5: _ A _ N T
5. If N is in 5 and T is in 1: T A _ _ N
6. If N is in 5 and T is in 3: _ A T _ N

Now we check which of these patterns form valid English words using the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).

- N A T _ _: NAT?? → No valid 5-letter words starting with NAT.
- N A _ _ T: NA??T → Valid words: NAIVT (not valid), NAMPT (not valid), NAPHT (not valid) – none found.
- T A _ N _: TA?N? → Valid words: TANGY (but Y eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TALON (O eliminated), TAWNY (Y eliminated) – none fit.
- _ A _ N T: ?A?NT → Valid words: BANT (4 letters), DANT (not valid), GANT (not valid), HANT (S eliminated), MANT (not valid), WANT (S eliminated) – none fit.
- T A _ _ N: TA??N → Valid words: TABUN (valid but U is allowed, B is allowed), TALON (O eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAXON (O eliminated) – TABUN is valid but obscure.
- _ A T _ N: ?AT?N → Valid words: BATON (O eliminated), CATEN (E eliminated), FATIN (I eliminated), GATEN (E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATIN (I eliminated), MATIN (I eliminated), PATIN (P eliminated) – none fit.

This leaves us with the most plausible valid word being TABUN, though it's uncommon.

However, let me re-examine possible words more carefully.

Looking at pattern _ A T _ N (T in 3, N in 5):
Valid word: GATEN (but E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATEN (E eliminated), MATEN (E eliminated) – none fit.

Looking at pattern T A _ _ N (T in 1, N in 5):
Valid word: TABUN (valid, uses B and U which are allowed).

Therefore, the best guess is TABUN.The constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- N must appear but NOT in position 3.
- T must appear but NOT in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

A valid arrangement is T in position 1 and N in position 5, giving T A _ _ N. The remaining letters can be B and U, forming the word TABUN.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess is always the hardest since we have no information to go on. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters to test their presence/absence
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Good letter distribution across positions

Some popular strong starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" - covers all 5 vowels plus S (common)
- ""RAISE"" - very common letters
- ""SLATE"" - common consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests all vowels plus S, which are extremely common letters in English words. This should give us good information about which vowels are present and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Remaining useful common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K
Remaining useful vowels: I, U, Y (since A is already known to be present and E, O are absent)

Good next step is to test new common letters while placing A in a different spot. A good candidate would include letters like T, N, L, I, U to gather more information.

Since A is in the word but not first, let's try placing it second. A word like ""TAINT"" would be ideal but contains T twice (and we don't know about T yet). Instead, let's try ""UNTAI"" - but that's not a valid word.

Better to pick a valid word with letters we haven't tested yet. Let's try ""INPUT"" - but it has P and T (P is less common). 

Another option is ""LAUGH"" - but has G and H which are less common.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIL"" - contains U, N, T, I, L - all relatively common letters, places A isn't in first spot, and tests new vowels/consonants.

But we know A must be present, so let's ensure A is included. Let's try ""PLANT"" - but we don't know about P, L, N, T.

Actually, let's use ""PAINT"" - contains P, A, I, N, T - all new letters except A (which we know is present), and places A in second position (since it can't be first).

But we should probably test more vowels first. Let's try ""ADIEU"" - but E and U are in it, E is confirmed absent.

Better to test more consonants. Let's try ""PLANK"" - no, K is less common.

Let's go with ""PAINT"" - it includes A (known to be present), and tests P, I, N, T which are new and common.

<guess>PAINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on PAINT:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (2nd spot).
- I(x), N(✓), T(✓) → I is not in the word, N and T are in their correct positions.

So we now know the word has the pattern:
_ A N T _

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: T

Letters confirmed absent from entire word: R, O, S, E, P, I

Remaining common letters to test for the first and fifth positions: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters, has A-N-T in positions 2-4, and ends with one of these letters.

Possible candidates:
- BANTU (but U is uncommon in this position)
- CANTO (but O is absent)
- DANTE (but E is absent)
- HANTS (but S is absent)
- MANTA (but A is repeated and already in position 2)
- VANTA (not a valid word)
- WANT (only 4 letters)
- CANTY (but Y is less common)

Looking at valid words:
- CANTY is valid but Y is less common
- BANTU is valid but U is less common
- MANTA is valid but repeats A
- DANTE is invalid (E is absent)
- HANTS is invalid (S is absent)

Let's try CANTY as it's the most valid option among those, testing C and Y.

But actually, let's think of other valid words with A-N-T in 2-4 positions:
- BANTU
- CANTO (invalid, has O)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- MANTA (invalid, repeats A)
- VANTA (invalid)
- WANTS (invalid, has S and E)

Another approach: look for words ending in ANT plus one letter, but that's not our pattern.

Wait, let's list possible valid words with pattern _ A N T _:
- BANTU
- CANTY
- DANTE (invalid)
- HANTS (invalid)
- MANTA (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid, has P,O)
- RANT (invalid, has R)
- SANTA (invalid, has S)
- TANTO (invalid, has T,O)
- WANT (invalid)

The most valid option is CANTY, testing C and Y.

But since Y is less common and we have few guesses left, let's instead try BANTU to test B and U.

Actually, let's think differently - what valid English words fit _ A N T _ ?

Looking up valid words:
- BANTU (proper noun, may not count)
- CANTY (valid but uncommon)
- MANTA (valid, but repeats A)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)
- DANTE (invalid, has E)
- RANT (invalid)
- PANTO (invalid)

This suggests our pattern might be too restrictive. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From PAINT:
- A(✓) means A is in position 2 - correct.
- N(✓) means N is in position 3 - correct.
- T(✓) means T is in position 4 - correct.

So the word must be _ A N T _

Looking through valid 5-letter words matching _ A N T _:
- CANTY
- BANTU (questionable)
- MANTA (but MANTA has A in position 5, which would be allowed since A is only confirmed in position 2)
- WANTS (invalid, has S)
- HANTS (invalid, has S)

The clearest valid word is CANTY, testing C and Y.

However, CANTY is quite obscure. Let's see if there's a better word.

Actually, the most common word fitting _ A N T _ is probably ""HANT"" but that's 4 letters.

Wait, let's think of ""CHANT"" - but that would require:
- C, H, A, N, T
- But from PAINT, position 1 isn't confirmed yet, N is in position 3, T in 4.

But CHANT would be:
C _ _ _ _
_ H _ _ _
_ _ A _ _
_ _ _ N _
_ _ _ _ T

But our pattern is _ A N T _ from PAINT feedback (A in 2, N in 3, T in 4).

So CHANT would fit _ A N T _ ? No, CHANT has:
1: C
2: H
3: A
4: N
5: T

This contradicts our feedback from PAINT which says:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)

Therefore, the word must be _ A N T _

Only valid common word seems to be CANTY.

But let's test CANTY to confirm the pattern:
C A N T Y
- Position 1: C (new test)
- Position 5: Y (new test)

This seems our best option given the constraints.From the clues we have the fixed pattern _ A N T _ (A in position 2, N in 3, T in 4), and we know the letters not to use include R, O, S, E, P, I.

A valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is ""CANTY"". Let's test this to confirm positions 1 and 5.

<guess>CANTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(✓)
Guess 3: CANTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is still fixed in position 2.
- N(-) → N is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but **not** in position 4.
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

So:
1. Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _
2. N must appear, but not in position 3.
3. T must appear, but not in position 4.
4. Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

Possible positions for N and T:
- N can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- They must be in different positions.

Also, the remaining candidate consonants (excluding the eliminated ones) for positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W.

Let’s list the constraints:
- Position 2: A
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5
- T must be in 1, 3, or 5
- No repeated letters among N and T (since they must be in different positions)
- Use only the remaining consonants for other positions

Possible configurations:
1. If N is in 1 and T is in 3: N A T _ _
2. If N is in 1 and T is in 5: N A _ _ T
3. If N is in 4 and T is in 1: T A _ N _
4. If N is in 4 and T is in 5: _ A _ N T
5. If N is in 5 and T is in 1: T A _ _ N
6. If N is in 5 and T is in 3: _ A T _ N

Now we check which of these patterns form valid English words using the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).

- N A T _ _: NAT?? → No valid 5-letter words starting with NAT.
- N A _ _ T: NA??T → Valid words: NAIVT (not valid), NAMPT (not valid), NAPHT (not valid) – none found.
- T A _ N _: TA?N? → Valid words: TANGY (but Y eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TALON (O eliminated), TAWNY (Y eliminated) – none fit.
- _ A _ N T: ?A?NT → Valid words: BANT (4 letters), DANT (not valid), GANT (not valid), HANT (S eliminated), MANT (not valid), WANT (S eliminated) – none fit.
- T A _ _ N: TA??N → Valid words: TABUN (valid but U is allowed, B is allowed), TALON (O eliminated), TAMIN (I eliminated), TAKEN (E eliminated), TAXON (O eliminated) – TABUN is valid but obscure.
- _ A T _ N: ?AT?N → Valid words: BATON (O eliminated), CATEN (E eliminated), FATIN (I eliminated), GATEN (E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATIN (I eliminated), MATIN (I eliminated), PATIN (P eliminated) – none fit.

This leaves us with the most plausible valid word being TABUN, though it's uncommon.

However, let me re-examine possible words more carefully.

Looking at pattern _ A T _ N (T in 3, N in 5):
Valid word: GATEN (but E eliminated), HATEN (E eliminated), LATEN (E eliminated), MATEN (E eliminated) – none fit.

Looking at pattern T A _ _ N (T in 1, N in 5):
Valid word: TABUN (valid, uses B and U which are allowed).

Therefore, the best guess is TABUN.The constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- N must appear but NOT in position 3.
- T must appear but NOT in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, Y.

A valid arrangement is T in position 1 and N in position 5, giving T A _ _ N. The remaining letters can be B and U, forming the word TABUN.

- N must appear once, and not in positions 3 or 5 ⇒ N must be in position 4.
- T must appear once, and not in positions 1 or 4 ⇒ T must be in position 5.
- Eliminated letters so far: B, C, E, I, O, P, R, S, Y.

The word therefore looks like: _ A _ N T  
With still-allowed consonants for positions 1 and 3 (D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W).

A valid common word fitting this pattern is **DAUNT**.

No repeating letters to test more unique letters\n3. Good letter distribution across positions\n\nSome popular strong starting words include:\n- ""AROSE"" - covers all 5 vowels plus S (common)\n- ""RAISE"" - very common letters\n- ""SLATE"" - common consonants and vowels\n- ""CRANE"" - good mix of consonants and vowels\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests all vowels plus S, which are extremely common letters in English words.

A good candidate would include letters like T, N, L, I, U to gather more information.\n\nSince A is in the word but not first, let\'s try placing it second. A word like ""TAINT"" would be ideal but contains T twice (and we don\'t know about T yet).
