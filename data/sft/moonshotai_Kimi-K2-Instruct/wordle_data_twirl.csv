1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible early on. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- A: not in the word  
- R: in the word but not in position 2  
- O: not in the word  
- S: not in the word  
- E: not in the word  

So the only confirmed letter is R, and it must appear somewhere other than the second position.  
We now know the word contains no A, O, S, E, so we should avoid those letters entirely.  
Good consonants to try next include T, L, N, C, H, M, D.  
A vowel we haven’t tested yet is I or U.  
To maximize coverage, let’s pick a word that introduces new high-frequency letters and places R in a different spot, such as third or fourth position.  
A good candidate is “TRULY”:  
- T – new letter  
- R – known letter, now in position 2 (will confirm if R works here)  
- U – new vowel  
- L – new letter  
- Y – new letter  

This gives us five fresh letters while repositioning R.

So far we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, U, Y  
2. Letters in the word but wrong position:  
   - R (it is NOT in positions 2 or 3)  
   - L (it is NOT in position 4)  
3. Letters in the word AND in the correct position:  
   - T in position 1  

Therefore the word has the pattern: T _ _ _ _,  
and it must contain R and L somewhere in positions 2-5, but not in the spots already tried.  
Possible positions for R: 4, 5  
Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 5  

To gather more information I’ll try a word that keeps T fixed, moves R to position 4, and L to position 2, and introduces two new common consonants (e.g., N and C).  
A good candidate is T L N R C → “TLNRC” is invalid (not a word), so I’ll pick an actual word that fits: “TULIP” won’t work (U already excluded), “TRAIN” won’t work (A, I not yet tested but I can do better).  

Let’s use “TULIP” → but U is out.  
Next try “TWIRL” – W and I are new, R in position 4, L in position 5. This satisfies all constraints.

Checks:
- T is already confirmed at position 1 ✓  
- W, I, R (position 4), L (position 5)  
- No forbidden letters.  

Word list confirms “TWIRL” is valid.
