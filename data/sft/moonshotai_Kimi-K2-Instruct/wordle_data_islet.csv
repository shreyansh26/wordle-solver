For my first guess, I want to use a word that has common letters to maximize information. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct letters that are among the most common in English 5-letter words. Classic starting words include ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc.

Looking at the options:
- ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also very common
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses S (very common), and has both R and S which often appear together in words. The vowels A, I, E are also very common.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word has I, S, E, but none of R or A.
- The current positions of I, S, E are all wrong.

Next steps:
1. We need a word with I, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5 respectively.
2. Avoid R and A entirely.
3. Choose new letters for the remaining spots that are common and haven’t been ruled out.

Good candidates for new letters: T, N, L, O, U, C, D, etc.

Potential words:
- STEIN: Has S, T, E, I, N – but E and I are still in positions 4 and 3 (same as in RAISE), so this violates the position feedback.
- SITES: S at 1 and 4, but S can't be at 4 (from feedback), and E would be at 3 (was at 5 before, so this is new, but we have S twice).

   – E is exactly in position 4.  
   – T is exactly in position 5.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E T  
with these constraints:
- Must contain: I, S, L (each in allowed positions).  
- Must NOT contain: R, A.  
- Known exact letters: T at 5, E at 4.

We need to place I, S, L into positions 1, 2, 3 without violating their forbidden positions:
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- S cannot be in position 3 or 4 (4 is already E).  
- L cannot be in position 1.

Possible assignments for positions 1-3 using L, I, S:

- Position 1: can be S or I (L is forbidden at 1).  
- Position 2: can be S or L (I is forbidden at 2).  
- Position 3: can be L or I (S is forbidden at 3).
