For the first guess, it's important to choose a word that contains common letters and can efficiently narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it's highly strategic - it contains the three most common vowels (A, E) and three of the most common consonants (S, T, R).

From the first-guess feedback:

STARE  
S(✓) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. R is in the word but not in position 4.
3. T, A, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore the word looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  
and somewhere we must place R (but not in slot 4).

We still need four more letters, avoiding T, A, E.  
Good consonants left to try: L, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A second guess should:
- keep the fixed S at the start,
- place R somewhere else,
- introduce new common letters to test.

One efficient word that fits these constraints is “SPURN”:  
- starts with S (confirmed).  
- places R in slot 4 (which we know is NOT the right slot, so this will give us extra information).  
- introduces P, U, N (three new letters that haven’t been tested yet).

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. R is somewhere inside but not in positions 4 or 5 (since it was “-” in both STARE and SPURN at slot 4 and 5 respectively).
3. The letters T, A, E, P, N are NOT in the word at all.
4. U is present but not in position 3 (because it was “-” in SPURN).

So far we know:
S _ _ _ _   (S fixed)
R is in one of positions 2 or 3.
U is in one of positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Common remaining valid letters still untested: I, O, L, D, G, H, C, M, K, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Put R in position 2 to test that possibility.
- Put U in a new position (2 is taken by R, 3 is forbidden, so try 4 or 5).
- Use two fresh, high-frequency letters to maximize information.

Let’s test R in position 2 and U in position 4, and add common consonants L and D:

S R U L D → “SRULD” is not a valid word.

Swap positions of U and R, or try other combinations. Remember R must be in 2 or 3.

If R is in position 2:
S R _ _ _

U cannot be in 3, so try 4 or 5.

Try:
S R I U M → “SRIUM” invalid.
S R U I M → “SRUIM” invalid.

Try valid word “SCRUB” → uses S, C, R, U, B. But S is fixed at 1, C is new, R in 3, U in 4, B new.
Check if C, B have been eliminated? No, they haven’t been used yet.

But we know R cannot be in 4 or 5, so R in 3 is possible. And U cannot be in 3, so U in 2, 4, or 5. If R is in 3, U could be in 2, 4, or 5.
