For the first guess, I want to choose a word that is a valid 5-letter English word and has a good mix of common letters. This will help me gather information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Looking at common letters in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S are all good choices. A balanced first guess might be something like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Letters definitely IN the word (but at unknown positions): S, T, E  
Current knowledge about positions:
- S is in the word and is NOT in position 4 (from AROSE) and IS in position 1 (from STEIN).  
  Therefore: S = 1st letter.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from STEIN).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5 (from AROSE and STEIN).  
  So E must be 2nd or 4th.
- The remaining two positions (3rd and 5th) must be filled with letters we have not yet ruled out: from the alphabet minus A,R,O,I,N plus the confirmed S,T,E.

Because S is locked in position 1, our word pattern is:
S _ _ _ _

Possible vowels left: E, U  
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc. (excluding ruled-out letters).

We need two more consonants and the remaining vowel or another consonant.

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let me test a word that:
- keeps S in position 1,
- places E in position 2 (since E must go 2nd or 4th),
- uses common remaining consonants for 3rd, 4th, 5th,
- avoids any already-ruled-out letters.

A good candidate: ""SLEEP""
- S is 1st (✓)
- E is 2nd (allowed)
- L, P are still allowed letters
- double E in 2 and 3 is fine for feedback purposes
- but wait: we must have T somewhere in the word (from STEIN feedback T(-)), and ""SLEEP"" does not include T – so this is invalid.

We MUST use T somewhere. Let’s try:
S T _ _ _  or  S _ T _ _  or  S _ _ T _  or  S _ _ _ T

But we know:
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN feedback).  
So possible placements: T in 3, 4, or 5.

Also E must be placed 2nd or 4th.

Let’s try a word: set E in 2nd, T in 4th:

S E _ T _

Now pick one more letter for 3rd and 5th positions using allowed letters.

Let’s choose ""SEDGY"" – but D is allowed, G, Y allowed. But does not use T. Wait.

Wait, we have to place T.

Let’s try ""SLEPT"":
- S 1st (✓)
- L allowed
- E 3rd – but feedback says E is NOT in 3rd (from STEIN feedback E(-) was in 3rd). So E cannot be 3rd.

Let’s try ""SMELT"":
- S 1st (✓)
- M allowed
- E 2nd (allowed)
- L allowed
- T 5th (allowed, and T is present; T not in 2nd is satisfied)
Letters used: S, M, E, L, T – all allowed.

Check constraints:
- S confirmed 1st (✓)
- E in 2nd allowed (E not in 3rd or 5th)
- T in 5th allowed (T not in 2nd)
- No A, R, O, I, N, etc. used.

- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5 (from AROSE and STEIN).  
  So E must be 2nd or 4th.
- The remaining two positions (3rd and 5th) must be filled with letters we have not yet ruled out: from the alphabet minus A,R,O,I,N plus the confirmed S,T,E.

Because S is locked in position 1, our word pattern is:
S _ _ _ _

Possible vowels left: E, U  
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc. (excluding ruled-out letters).

We need two more consonants and the remaining vowel or another consonant.

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let me test a word that:
- keeps S in position 1,
- places E in position 2 (since E must go 2nd or 4th),
- uses common remaining consonants for 3rd, 4th, 5th,
- avoids any already-ruled-out letters.

A good candidate: ""SLEEP""
- S is 1st (✓)
- E is 2nd (allowed)
- L, P are still allowed letters
- double E in 2 and 3 is fine for feedback purposes
- but wait: we must have T somewhere in the word (from STEIN feedback T(-)), and ""SLEEP"" does not include T – so this is invalid.

We MUST use T somewhere. Let’s try:
S T _ _ _  or  S _ T _ _  or  S _ _ T _  or  S _ _ _ T

But we know:
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN feedback).  
So possible placements: T in 3, 4, or 5.

Also E must be placed 2nd or 4th.

Let’s try a word: set E in 2nd, T in 4th:

S E _ T _

Now pick one more letter for 3rd and 5th positions using allowed letters.

Let’s choose ""SEDGY"" – but D is allowed, G, Y allowed. But does not use T. Wait.

Wait, we have to place T.

Let’s try ""SLEPT"":
- S 1st (✓)
- L allowed
- E 3rd – but feedback says E is NOT in 3rd (from STEIN feedback E(-) was in 3rd). So E cannot be 3rd.

Let’s try ""SMELT"":
- S 1st (✓)
- M allowed
- E 2nd (allowed)
- L allowed
- T 5th (allowed, and T is present; T not in 2nd is satisfied)
Letters used: S, M, E, L, T – all allowed.

Check constraints:
- S confirmed 1st (✓)
- E in 2nd allowed (E not in 3rd or 5th)
- T in 5th allowed (T not in 2nd)
- No A, R, O, I, N, etc. used.

This seems to satisfy all known constraints.

Step-by-step deduction based on all feedback so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, O, I, N, M, L

2. Letters we know ARE in the word:
   - S (fixed in position 1)
   - T (in the word, but not in positions 2 or 5)
   - E (in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5)

3. Therefore the only remaining possible positions for E and T are:
   - E can be in position 2 or 4
   - T can be in position 3 or 4

4. Looking at the pattern:
   S _ _ _ _
   - Position 1 = S (locked)
   - Position 5 must be a letter not yet ruled out.

5. Remaining legal letters (from alphabet minus the eliminated ones):
   B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need to place E and T plus two more letters.

7. Case 1: If E is in position 2
   Pattern: S E _ _ _
   Then T must be in position 3 or 4.
   Possible words:
   - S E T _ _
   - S E _ T _

8. Case 2: If E is in position 4
   Pattern: S _ _ E _
   Then T must be in position 3
   Pattern: S _ T E _
   Example: S P T E D → but ""SPTED"" is not a word.

9. Let’s pick a valid word under Case 1 with E in 2 and T in 3:
   S E T _ _
   Need two more letters from remaining legal set.
   Good candidates: “SETPU” is invalid (not a word).
   How about “SETHS”? Not a word.
   How about “SETON”? But N is eliminated.
   How about “SETBY”? Y is allowed.

10. Alternatively, Case 1 with E in 2 and T in 4:
    S E _ T _
    Example: S E C T S – invalid (S repeats)
    S E C T O – O eliminated
    S E C T U – “SECTU” not a word
    S E D T U – “SEDTU” not a word
    S E D G Y – but T is missing
    S E C T S – already considered
    S E C T A – A eliminated

11. Let’s revisit Case 2 with E in 4 and T in 3:

    S C T E D – “SCTED” not a word
    S C T E N – N eliminated
    S C T E P – “SCTEP” not a word
    S C T E R – R eliminated
    S C T E Y – “SCT EY” not a word

12. Let’s consider valid words enforcing all constraints:
    - S E T _ _
    - S E C T _ → 5 letters
    - S E C T _ but need 5 letters total.

13. Realizing the only practical valid English word fitting constraints is likely “SECTY” (not a word) or “SEDGE” (but G,D allowed, E in 4, but must have T).

14. Re-evaluate: Valid word fitting S E T _ _ : “SETHS” invalid, “SETON” invalid, “SETUP” – P U allowed, T in 3, E in 2, S in 1.
    “SETUP”:
    - S 1st ✓
    - E 2nd ✓
    - T 3rd – allowed for T (not in 2 or 5)
    - U 4th – allowed
    - P 5th – allowed
    And all letters are from remaining legal set.

So a valid next guess is “SETUP”.
