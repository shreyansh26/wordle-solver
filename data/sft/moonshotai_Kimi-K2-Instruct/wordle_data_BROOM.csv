For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The optimal starting words typically contain several vowels and common consonants.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - all vowels except D

I'll go with CRANE because it has:
1. C - very common consonant
2. R - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters across different positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. R is the 2nd letter.
2. C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to find letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Looking at remaining common letters that haven't been ruled out: T, S, L, D, O, I, U, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we need to include some. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (A, E are out).

I’ll construct a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Introduces new common letters not yet tried
- Uses some of the remaining vowels
- Avoids C, A, N, E

A good candidate is ""TRIOR"" but that's not a valid word. ""TRIO"" is 4 letters. Let me think of valid 5-letter words with R in 2nd position, avoiding banned letters.

Possible words:
- TRUCK (uses T, U, C, K - but C is out) → invalid
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) - but O is repeated
- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) - but D is repeated
- PRIOR (P, R, I, O, R) - R is repeated
- BRIAR (B, R, I, A, R) - A is out and R is repeated
- ORBIT (O, R, B, I, T) - R is in 2nd position? No, this has R in 2nd but starts with O.

Actually, ORBIT has R in 2nd position (O-R-B-I-T), uses O, B, I, T - none are banned, and only R is confirmed. This seems valid.

Another option is FROST (F, R, O, S, T) - R in 2nd, uses O, S, T.

Between these, I’ll choose FROST because it introduces more new common consonants (F, S, T) and the vowel O, while keeping R in place.

- No C, A, N, E, F, S, T
- We still need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with remaining unused letters.

Remaining common letters:
- Vowels left: I, U (A, E, O are all either confirmed or in correct position)
- Consonants left: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word with _ R O _ _ structure, using only allowed letters.

Some possible words:
- BROKE - but K and E are allowed, but E is out (it was in CRANE and marked x)
- GROIN - G, R, O, I, N - but N is out
- PROUD - P, R, O, U, D - all letters are allowed (P, R, O, U, D - none of these were marked x except R and O which are confirmed correct)
- DROOL - but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4
- GROVE - but E is out
- GROOM - M is allowed, but O would be repeated which may or may not be allowed
- PROXY - X and Y are allowed

PROUD looks good because:

Looking at remaining common letters that haven't been ruled out: T, S, L, D, O, I, U, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we need to include some. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (A, E are out).

I’ll construct a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Introduces new common letters not yet tried
- Uses some of the remaining vowels
- Avoids C, A, N, E

A good candidate is ""TRIOR"" but that's not a valid word. ""TRIO"" is 4 letters. Let me think of valid 5-letter words with R in 2nd position, avoiding banned letters.

Possible words:
- TRUCK (uses T, U, C, K - but C is out) → invalid
- TROOP (T, R, O, O, P) - but O is repeated
- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) - but D is repeated
- PRIOR (P, R, I, O, R) - R is repeated
- BRIAR (B, R, I, A, R) - A is out and R is repeated
- ORBIT (O, R, B, I, T) - R is in 2nd position? No, this has R in 2nd but starts with O.

Actually, ORBIT has R in 2nd position (O-R-B-I-T), uses O, B, I, T - none are banned, and only R is confirmed. This seems valid.

Another option is FROST (F, R, O, S, T) - R in 2nd, uses O, S, T.

Between these, I’ll choose FROST because it introduces more new common consonants (F, S, T) and the vowel O, while keeping R in place.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3

Letters that are definitely out: C, A, N, E, F, S, T

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ R O _ _
- No C, A, N, E, F, S, T
- We still need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with remaining unused letters.

Remaining common letters:
- Vowels left: I, U (A, E, O are all either confirmed or in correct position)
- Consonants left: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word with _ R O _ _ structure, using only allowed letters.

Some possible words:
- BROKE - but K and E are allowed, but E is out (it was in CRANE and marked x)
- GROIN - G, R, O, I, N - but N is out
- PROUD - P, R, O, U, D - all letters are allowed (P, R, O, U, D - none of these were marked x except R and O which are confirmed correct)
- DROOL - but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4
- GROVE - but E is out
- GROOM - M is allowed, but O would be repeated which may or may not be allowed
- PROXY - X and Y are allowed

PROUD looks good because:
- P is new and allowed
- R is correct in position 2
- O is correct in position 3
- U is new and allowed (vowel)
- D is new and allowed

Let me verify:
- P - not used before
- R - confirmed correct
- O - confirmed correct
- U - not used before
- D - not used before

This should give us maximum new information.

Current constraints from the three guesses:

1. Pattern: _ R O _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word:  
   C, A, N, E, F, S, T, P, U, D
3. Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
   B, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   plus the vowels I (all other vowels A, E, O, U are either confirmed or ruled out)

Since O is already locked in position 3 and we have no evidence of a second O, we can assume the remaining letters are all different.

We need to fill:
- Position 1  
- Position 4  
- Position 5  

with letters from the allowed set, and we still haven’t placed the vowel I anywhere, so it’s highly likely it appears once in the open slots.

Possible consonant choices for the remaining three slots: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a valid English word that fits _ R O _ _ using only those letters plus I.

Some quick candidates:
- B R O I L → B, R, O, I, L – all letters allowed  
- G R O I N → G, R, O, I, N – but N was ruled out in Guess 1  
- M R O _ _ – nothing common forms  
- V R O _ _ – nothing common forms  
- W R O _ _ – nothing common forms  

BROIL is a valid word, uses only allowed letters (B, R, O, I, L), and places the still-untried vowel I plus two new consonants (B, L).

Therefore, BROIL is the best next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The optimal starting words typically contain several vowels and common consonants.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - all vowels except D

I'll go with CRANE because it has:
1. C - very common consonant
2. R - common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters across different positions.

So we know:
1. R is the 2nd letter.
2. C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
3. We still need to find letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Looking at remaining common letters that haven't been ruled out: T, S, L, D, O, I, U, etc. Since we have no vowels confirmed yet, we need to include some. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (A, E are out).

I’ll construct a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Introduces new common letters not yet tried

This seems valid.\n\nAnother option is FROST (F, R, O, S, T) - R in 2nd, uses O, S, T.\n\nBetween these, I’ll choose FROST because it introduces more new common consonants (F, S, T) and the vowel O, while keeping R in place.\n\n<guess>FROST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FROST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we have:\n\nLetters that are definitely in the word:\n- R in position 2\n- O in position 3\n\nLetters that are definitely out: C, A, N, E, F, S, T\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with:\n- _ R O _ _\n- No C, A, N, E, F, S, T\n- We still need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with remaining unused letters.\n\nRemaining common letters:\n- Vowels left: I, U (A, E, O are all either confirmed or in correct position)\n- Consonants left: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe want a word with _ R O _ _ structure, using only allowed letters.\n\nSome possible words:\n- BROKE - but K and E are allowed, but E is out (it was in CRANE and marked x)\n- GROIN - G, R, O, I, N - but N is out\n- PROUD - P, R, O, U, D - all letters are allowed (P, R, O, U, D - none of these were marked x except R and O which are confirmed correct)\n- DROOL - but O is already in position 3, and this would have O in position 4\n- GROVE - but E is out\n- GROOM - M is allowed, but O would be repeated which may or may not be allowed\n- PROXY - X and Y are allowed\n\nPROUD looks good because:\n- P is new and allowed\n- R is correct in position 2\n- O is correct in position 3\n- U is new and allowed (vowel)\n- D is new and allowed\n\nLet me verify:\n- P - not used before\n- R - confirmed correct\n- O - confirmed correct\n- U - not used before\n- D - not used before\n\nThis should give us maximum new information.\n\n<guess>PROUD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FROST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current constraints from the three guesses:\n\n1.

From the four guesses we now have:

Pattern: B R O _ _  (first three letters locked in)
Letters confirmed OUT: C, A, N, E, F, S, T, P, U, D, I, L
Remaining letters not yet tried: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We only need to place the 4th and 5th letters using the allowed pool above.  The word must start with BRO and be a real English word.

Possible real words:
BROOK – but O would repeat (we have no evidence for a second O)
BROOM – M is still allowed
BROGH – archaic, unlikely
BROKE – K, E – but E is out
BROSY – S is out
BROXY – X and Y are allowed
BROKE – ruled out
BROME – E out
BROCK – C out
BROGS – S out
BROGH – uncommon
BROZY – Y allowed, but Z is allowed too

The only common, valid 5-letter words left are:
BROOK (uses K, repeats O)  
BROOM (uses M)  
BROXY (uses X, Y)

Given that we’ve never seen K or M tried and we have no repeats so far, the statistically safest choice is BROOM (only introduces M and ends the word).
