- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically involves using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, CRANE is a strong choice because it contains three of the five most common letters in English (E, A, R), plus two other common consonants (C, N). This should help us quickly narrow down potential letters in the secret word.
