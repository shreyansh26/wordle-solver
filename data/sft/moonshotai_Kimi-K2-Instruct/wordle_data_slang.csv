2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, since I have no information yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common consonants and vowels are good choices. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are often recommended as good starting words because they contain a mix of frequent letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word with common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and includes both vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

So far I know:
1. The word starts with SLA (S, L, A are in the correct positions).
2. Letters T and E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves positions 4 and 5 to fill, using letters other than T or E.  
The prefix SLA is fixed. I need to think of common five-letter words that begin with SLA and avoid T and E.

Some candidates:
- SLACK (but C and K are still possible)
- SLAMS (M is still possible)
- SLASH (H is still possible)
- SLANT (but N is possible, T is ruled out, so SLANT is invalid)
- SLAPS (P is still possible)
- SLAVE (E is ruled out)

Among these, SLACK and SLASH are strong contenders. Between the two, SLACK seems slightly more common.

Current known facts:
- First three letters are fixed: S L A _ _ (positions 1-3 are ✓).
- Letters already ruled out: T, E, C, K.
- We now must pick two new letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining alphabet (avoiding T, E, C, K).

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, R, S, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowels: I, O, U (A is already used).

Looking for common SLA- words that avoid the forbidden letters:
- SLAIN (uses I and N)
- SLAMS (uses M and S)
- SLANG (uses N and G)
- SLANT (T is forbidden, skip)
- SLASH (H and S)
- SLUMP (U, M, P) — but SLUMP starts with SLU, not SLA
- SLIPS (I and P)

What we know after three guesses:

- SLA _ _ positions 1-3 are fixed and correct.
- Letters ruled out completely: T, E, C, K, I.
- Position 4 (guess 3: I) = x ⇒ I is not in the word.
- Position 5 (guess 3: N) = (-) ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore:
- The word must be SL A N _  (N must occupy position 4, since it can’t be at 5).
- The final letter (position 5) must be a fresh letter not yet tried, and not among T, E, C, K, I.

Common leftover consonants that fit: M, P, R, S, W, Y, etc.
A good remaining vowel: O or U.

Scanning for SLA N _ combinations:
- SLANG – but G hasn’t been tested and G is still possible.
- SLAND – D is still possible.
- SLANT – T already ruled out.
- SLANS – S is possible.
- SLANG and SLAND are reasonable.

Among these, SLANG is a more common word (G hasn’t been ruled out) so I’ll try SLANG.
