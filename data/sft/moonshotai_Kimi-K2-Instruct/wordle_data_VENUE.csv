For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants that may be present. The word should ideally cover the most frequent letters in English to maximize information gain. A commonly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good coverage to see which of these letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the 5th position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. None of the letters A, R, O, S appear anywhere in the word.
3. We still need to find the first four letters, none of which can be A, R, O, S.

Good next letters to test are common consonants not yet ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, etc., and remaining vowels: I, U.

A balanced next guess should give us information about several of these letters. I’ll try a word that:
- Keeps E in the 5th position.
- Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids A, R, O, S.

Let’s go with “UNTIE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- Contains U, N, T, I, which are still possible.

3. Letters that are in the word but not yet correctly placed: U and N (they each appeared once, but in the wrong positions).

- Positions 1-4 cannot contain A, R, O, S, T, I.
- They must contain U and N (each at least once), plus other allowed letters.

- Uses U and N somewhere among positions 1-4.
- Uses no letters from {A, R, O, S, T, I}.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

A good candidate is “UNDUE”:
- Ends with E (matches known position 5).
- Contains U and N (matches known letters).
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, T, I) appear.
- Uses only allowed letters (U, N, D, E).

This placement immediately checks if U is in position 1 and N in position 2, giving maximum information.

   - N is somewhere in the word (but not in positions 1 or 2 from Guess 3, and not in position 2 from Guess 2). Possible positions for N: 1 or 3.
   - Position 1 cannot be U (from Guess 3 feedback) and must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Available letters to use (excluding forbidden ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N, U (but U is already placed at position 4).

The word structure is: _ _ _ U E, with N appearing exactly once in positions 1 or 3.

Possible structures:
- N _ N U E (invalid, N cannot appear twice)
- N _ _ U E (N in position 1)
- _ _ N U E (N in position 3)

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in ""NUE"" or starting with ""N"" and having ""UE"" at positions 4-5.

""N"" in position 1: N _ _ U E
""N"" in position 3: _ _ N U E

Checking common 5-letter words:
- ""N"" in position 1: Not many common options (e.g., NOMUE - but O and M are allowed, but NOMUE isn't a word)
- ""N"" in position 3: Possible words like ""FENUE"" (not valid), ""BENUE"" (not valid), but ""VENUE"" is a valid word!

""VENUE"":
- Ends with UE (positions 4-5 match: U✓ E✓)
- N is in position 3 (matches requirement)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, T, I, D)
- All letters are allowed and fit previous constraints.

This seems like the optimal next guess.

<guess>VENUE</guess>",VENUE,"From the feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is definitely E.
2. Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, I, D.
3. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): U, N.
4. We now also know:
   - U is in position 4 (✓).
   - N is somewhere in the word (but not in positions 1 or 2 from Guess 3, and not in position 2 from Guess 2). Possible positions for N: 1 or 3.
