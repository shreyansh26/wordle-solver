Since this is my first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gain
4. Is a valid 5-letter word

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, I, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include a good mix of these.

A strong starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me good coverage of common letters without repeats.

From the feedback:

- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in the second position.  
- T(x) and E(x) → T and E are not in the word at all.

From the feedback on SNARL we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: N ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: R x  → R is NOT in the word
- Position 5: L ✓

So the secret word has the form: S N A _ L

We have already ruled out:
- Letters T, E, M, R are definitely absent.

The only slot left is the 4th letter.  
We need a 5-letter English word that fits S N A ? L.

Possible single-letter insertions for the 4th spot (only letters not yet excluded):
- SNAIL   (I)
- SNAWL   (W) – “snawl” is archaic/dialect, likely invalid
- SNAFL   (F) – not a word
- SNAGL   (G) – not a word
- SNAKL   (K) – not a word
- SNAPL   (P) – not a word

Only SNAIL is both common and valid.

Therefore the word must be SNAIL.

Check: S N A I L
- 1: S ✓
- 2: N ✓
- 3: A ✓
- 4: I (new but allowed)
- 5: L ✓

All constraints satisfied.
