Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I'm using a strategy that maximizes the chance of finding letters in the word. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A good starting word contains a mix of these common letters.

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", and ""AROSE"" are popular starting choices because they cover high-frequency letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for both vowels and consonants in the first guess.

From the feedback:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the word must contain both O and E, but not in the 3rd and 5th positions respectively, and it does NOT contain A, R, or S.  

Since O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, I need to place them elsewhere. A good consonant set to pair with these vowels is T, N, L, or M. Also, since S is out, I will avoid S.  

A possible word that uses O and E in new positions and avoids A, R, S is ""TONEY"":
- T (new consonant)
- O (moves from 3rd to 2nd position)
- N (new consonant)
- E (moves from 5th to 4th position)
- Y (new letter, but not excluded)

But ""TONEY"" might not be common. Another option is ""NOBLE"":
- N (new)
- O (2nd position)
- B (new)
- L (new)
- E (4th position)

Alternatively, ""MOLEN"" is possible but less common. ""TOWER"" is invalid because R is excluded. ""VOICE"" has I (not confirmed yet).  

A safer and common word is ""TONER"", but R is excluded.  

Best common word fitting the constraints: ""NOBLE"".

Let me check:  
- N (not excluded)  
- O (allowed, not in 3rd position)  
- B (not excluded)  
- L (not excluded)  
- E (allowed, not in 5th position)  

This seems valid and common.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, N, B.  
2. Letters definitely IN the word: O (now known to be in the correct 3rd position).  
3. Letters somewhere in the word, but in wrong positions: E and L.

So the pattern is:
_ _ O _ _

with E and L present somewhere else (but E ≠ 5th, L ≠ 4th).

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We still need two more distinct letters in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, while placing E and L in fresh spots.  
Let’s try:

- Put L in position 1 (it can’t be in 4).  
- Put E in position 2 (it can’t be 5).  
- Choose two new consonants for positions 4 and 5 that haven’t been ruled out.

L E O _ _

A common word fitting this pattern is “LEMON”.

Check:
L(1) – allowed (was only excluded from 4th)  
E(2) – allowed (was excluded from 5th)  
O(3) – correct position  
M(4) – new, not yet ruled out  
N(5) – wait, N was marked x in Guess 2, so N is out.

Next candidate: “LEGO_” but G hasn’t been used.  
“LEGO_” needs a 5th letter. “LEGOS” has S, which is out.  
Try “LEGOY” – uncommon.  
“LEGO” is 4 letters.

Another candidate: “LOPED” – but P hasn’t been used.  
“LOPED”: L(1), O(3), P(4), E(5) – but E can’t be 5th.  

Better word: “CLOVE” – but C, L, V, E.  
Check positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) – E is 5th (invalid).  

Next: “VOLED” – but V, D new.  
“VOLED”: V(1), O(2) – O must be 3rd (invalid).

Better: “POLED” – P(1), O(3), L(2), E(4), D(5).

We still need two more distinct letters in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, while placing E and L in fresh spots.  
Let’s try:

- Put L in position 1 (it can’t be in 4).  
- Put E in position 2 (it can’t be 5).  
- Choose two new consonants for positions 4 and 5 that haven’t been ruled out.

A 5-letter word that fits:
L E O _ _

A common word fitting this pattern is “LEMON”.

Check:
L(1) – allowed (was only excluded from 4th)  
E(2) – allowed (was excluded from 5th)  
O(3) – correct position  
M(4) – new, not yet ruled out  
N(5) – wait, N was marked x in Guess 2, so N is out.

Next candidate: “LEGO_” but G hasn’t been used.  
“LEGO_” needs a 5th letter. “LEGOS” has S, which is out.  
Try “LEGOY” – uncommon.  
“LEGO” is 4 letters.

Another candidate: “LOPED” – but P hasn’t been used.  
“LOPED”: L(1), O(3), P(4), E(5) – but E can’t be 5th.  

Better word: “CLOVE” – but C, L, V, E.  
Check positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) – E is 5th (invalid).  

Next: “VOLED” – but V, D new.  
“VOLED”: V(1), O(2) – O must be 3rd (invalid).

Better: “POLED” – P(1), O(3), L(2), E(4), D(5).  
Check:  
P(new), O(3✓), L(2 – allowed), E(4 – allowed), D(new)  
“POLED” is a valid word.

This meets all constraints so far.

We now have three rounds of feedback.  Let’s distill what we know:

Letters NOT in the word (from all x feedback):
A, R, S, N, B, P, D.

Letters definitely in the word:
O (always in position 3)
E (present, but never yet in position 5)

Letters somewhere in the word, but in wrong positions so far:
L (never yet in position 4)

So the skeleton is:
_ _ O _ _

and the set {E, L} must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (1, 2, 4, 5) but  
- E cannot be in position 5  
- L cannot be in position 4.

That leaves possible placements of E and L as:
E in 1, 2, or 4  
L in 1, 2, or 5

We need one more distinct letter (from the unused set) to fill the remaining blank.

Unused consonants that haven’t been ruled out include: C, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
Unused vowels: I, U.

Let’s list valid patterns:

1) E L O _ _ → need one more letter for positions 4,5  
   E L O _ _ → positions 4,5 must not be filled by E or L again (we can reuse letters only if they appear multiple times in the word, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet).  
   We could try E L O C K → “ELOCK” (but that’s not a word).  
   E L O W N → not valid.

2) E _ O L _ → but L in 4 is forbidden.

3) E _ O _ L → fifth letter must be new, second letter must be new.  
   Candidate: E M O C L → “EM OCL” – invalid.  
   E M O T L – not a word.  
   E T O C L – not a word.  
   E T O N L – N is out.

4) L E O _ _ → need two new letters but we only have one blank left.  
   L E O _ _ → positions 4,5 – but word must be 5 letters.  
   We have only LE_O_ left – that’s four underscores, but we already have two letters fixed.  
   So the pattern is L E O _ _ – we need only one more letter; positions 4,5 must be filled by one of them.  
   But we have already used E and L, so positions 4 and 5 must be filled by new letters.  
   We only have one blank – we need to choose a single new letter and duplicate one of E or L – but we have no evidence of duplicates.  

5) L _ O E _ → E in 4 is allowed; L in 1 is allowed.  
   Fill position 2 with new letter.  
   Candidate: L I O E _ → but we need another letter for position 5.  
   L I O E M → “LIOEM” – invalid.  
   L I O E N – N is out.  
   L I O E T – not a word.

6) _ L O E _ → second letter L (allowed), E in 4 (allowed).  
   We need a first letter that is from the unused set.  
   Candidate letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y.  
   Let’s try common combinations:  
   – C L O E _ → “CLOVE” – but we already tried that implicitly and E was 5th (invalid).  
     Here E would be 4th, so “CLOVE” would be C,L,O,E,V – that’s valid for positions: C(1),L(2),O(3),E(4),V(5).  
     We never tried “CLOVE” in this exact position pattern.  
     Check if any letters conflict:  
       C – not yet excluded.  
       L – allowed in 2.  
       O – correct in 3.  
       E – allowed in 4.  
       V – not excluded.  
     So “CLOVE” is a valid candidate.

7) _ _ O E L → E in 4, L in 5 – both positions are allowed.  
   Then positions 1,2 must be filled with new letters.  
   Example: C H O E L → “CHOEL” – invalid.  
   M I O E L – not a word.  
   W I O E L – not a word.  

Comparing all, “CLOVE” seems like the best remaining common word that fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the word must contain both O and E, but not in the 3rd and 5th positions respectively, and it does NOT contain A, R, or S.  

Since O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, I need to place them elsewhere. A good consonant set to pair with these vowels is T, N, L, or M. Also, since S is out, I will avoid S.  

A possible word that uses O and E in new positions and avoids A, R, S is ""TONEY"":
- T (new consonant)
- O (moves from 3rd to 2nd position)
- N (new consonant)
- E (moves from 5th to 4th position)
- Y (new letter, but not excluded)

But ""TONEY"" might not be common. Another option is ""NOBLE"":
- N (new)
- O (2nd position)
- B (new)
- L (new)
- E (4th position)

Alternatively, ""MOLEN"" is possible but less common. ""TOWER"" is invalid because R is excluded. ""VOICE"" has I (not confirmed yet).  

A safer and common word is ""TONER"", but R is excluded.  

Best common word fitting the constraints: ""NOBLE"".

Let me check:  
- N (not excluded)

       C – not yet excluded.  
       L – allowed in 2.  
       O – correct in 3.  
       E – allowed in 4.  
       V – not excluded.  
     So “CLOVE” is a valid candidate.

7) _ _ O E L → E in 4, L in 5 – both positions are allowed.  
   Then positions 1,2 must be filled with new letters.  
   Example: C H O E L → “CHOEL” – invalid.  
   M I O E L – not a word.  
   W I O E L – not a word.  

Comparing all, “CLOVE” seems like the best remaining common word that fits all constraints.

Let’s update the master list of what we know.

Letters that have received an “x” are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, S, N, B, P, D, C, V

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- O (from NOBLE: position 3 is ✓, so O is locked in the 3rd spot)
- E (from POLED: position 4 is ✓, so E is locked in the 4th spot)
- L (from every round it has appeared as “-” meaning it is somewhere in the word, but never in the 3rd or 4th positions, and not yet in the 2nd or 5th)

So the pattern is now:
_ _ O E _

Letters still available (unused and never marked x):
F, G, H, I, J, K, M, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We have two blanks (positions 1 and 2) and the letter L must appear exactly once, but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (it can be 1, 2, or 5).

Case 1: L in position 1
L _ O E _

We need a second letter for position 2 that is unused.
Common consonants left: M, T, H, G, K, F
A common word: L I O E N – N is out.
L I O E T – not a word.
L I O E S – S is out.
L I O E M – “LI O E M” isn’t a word.
L G O E T – not common.
L M O E T – not a word.
L T O E K – not a word.
L T O E M – not a word.

Case 2: L in position 2
_ L O E _

Again need a first letter from unused consonants.
Try G, M, H, T, etc.
G L O E _ – needs a 5th letter.  G L O E N – N out.  G L O E T – “GLOET” – not a word.
M L O E _ – M L O E T – not a word.
H L O E _ – not a word.
T L O E _ – not a word.

Case 3: L in position 5
_ _ O E L

Now positions 1 and 2 must be filled with two new letters from the unused set (no duplicates forced so far).  A frequent consonant pair is M and I, or T and I, etc.  The 5-letter word must be real and common.  Try:

M I O E L – not a word.
T I O E L – not a word.
G I O E L – not a word.
F I O E L – not a word.
M O I E L – impossible O is fixed in 3.

Another common pattern: consonant + vowel + OEL  
But we do not have many vowels left: only I or U have not been ruled out.  I is common.

Try T I O E L – “TIOEL” – invalid.

Next, try placing I in position 2 and a consonant in position 1:
F I O E L – not a word.
H I O E L – not a word.
K I O E L – not a word.
M I O E L – not a word.
W I O E L – not a word.

That seems poor.  Let’s backtrack and try a fresh high-frequency consonant pair:

M O _  – O is in 3, so not useful.

Instead, consider M and any new consonant.

A promising word that fits the blanks is “M O U S E” – but S and U placements do not fit.

Wait, let’s list the only real words that fit the exact skeleton “_ _ O E L” using only allowed letters.  English words with pattern ? ? O E L:

- “MODEL” – but D was ruled out.
- “FOGEL” – not common.
- “HOTEL” – T in 2, L in 5 – HOTEL is a word.  Check letters:
      H (allowed), O (3 ✓), T (allowed), E (4 ✓), L (5 allowed)
   H is not yet excluded, T isn’t excluded.  HOTEL is a perfectly common word.

And it uses:
- H(1) – new, allowed
- O(3) – locked
- T(2) – new, allowed
- E(4) – locked
- L(5) – allowed placement (never tried 5th before).

No conflicts.  HOTEL should be the next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the word must contain both O and E, but not in the 3rd and 5th positions respectively, and it does NOT contain A, R, or S.  

Since O cannot be in position 3 and E cannot be in position 5, I need to place them elsewhere. A good consonant set to pair with these vowels is T, N, L, or M. Also, since S is out, I will avoid S.  

A possible word that uses O and E in new positions and avoids A, R, S is ""TONEY"":
- T (new consonant)
- O (moves from 3rd to 2nd position)
- N (new consonant)
- E (moves from 5th to 4th position)

But ""TONEY"" might not be common. Another option is ""NOBLE"":
- N (new)

- L (new)
- E (4th position)

Alternatively, ""MOLEN"" is possible but less common. ""TOWER"" is invalid because R is excluded. ""VOICE"" has I (not confirmed yet).  

A safer and common word is ""TONER"", but R is excluded.  

Best common word fitting the constraints: ""NOBLE"".

2. Letters definitely IN the word: O (now known to be in the correct 3rd position).  
3. Letters somewhere in the word, but in wrong positions: E and L.

So the pattern is:
_ _ O _ _

with E and L present somewhere else (but E ≠ 5th, L ≠ 4th).

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We still need two more distinct letters in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, while placing E and L in fresh spots.  
Let’s try:

- Put L in position 1 (it can’t be in 4).  
- Put E in position 2 (it can’t be 5).  
- Choose two new consonants for positions 4 and 5 that haven’t been ruled out.

A 5-letter word that fits:
L E O _ _

A common word fitting this pattern is “LEMON”.

Check:
L(1) – allowed (was only excluded from 4th)  
E(2) – allowed (was excluded from 5th)  
O(3) – correct position  
M(4) – new, not yet ruled out  
N(5) – wait, N was marked x in Guess 2, so N is out.

Next candidate: “LEGO_” but G hasn’t been used.  
“LEGO_” needs a 5th letter. “LEGOS” has S, which is out.  
Try “LEGOY” – uncommon.  
“LEGO” is 4 letters.

Another candidate: “LOPED” – but P hasn’t been used.  
“LOPED”: L(1), O(3), P(4), E(5) – but E can’t be 5th.  

Better word: “CLOVE” – but C, L, V, E.  
Check positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5) – E is 5th (invalid).  

Next: “VOLED” – but V, D new.  
“VOLED”: V(1), O(2) – O must be 3rd (invalid).

L in 1, 2, or 5

We need one more distinct letter (from the unused set) to fill the remaining blank.

Unused consonants that haven’t been ruled out include: C, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
Unused vowels: I, U.

Let’s list valid patterns:

1) E L O _ _ → need one more letter for positions 4,5  
   E L O _ _ → positions 4,5 must not be filled by E or L again (we can reuse letters only if they appear multiple times in the word, but we have no evidence of duplicates yet).  
   We could try E L O C K → “ELOCK” (but that’s not a word).  
   E L O W N → not valid.

2) E _ O L _ → but L in 4 is forbidden.

3) E _ O _ L → fifth letter must be new, second letter must be new.  
   Candidate: E M O C L → “EM OCL” – invalid.  
   E M O T L – not a word.  
   E T O C L – not a word.  
   E T O N L – N is out.

4) L E O _ _ → need two new letters but we only have one blank left.  
   L E O _ _ → positions 4,5 – but word must be 5 letters.  
   We have only LE_O_ left – that’s four underscores, but we already have two letters fixed.  
   So the pattern is L E O _ _ – we need only one more letter; positions 4,5 must be filled by one of them.  
   But we have already used E and L, so positions 4 and 5 must be filled by new letters.  
   We only have one blank – we need to choose a single new letter and duplicate one of E or L – but we have no evidence of duplicates.  

5) L _ O E _ → E in 4 is allowed; L in 1 is allowed.  
   Fill position 2 with new letter.  
   Candidate: L I O E _ → but we need another letter for position 5.  
   L I O E M → “LIOEM” – invalid.  
   L I O E N – N is out.  
   L I O E T – not a word.

6) _ L O E _ → second letter L (allowed), E in 4 (allowed).  
   We need a first letter that is from the unused set.  
   Candidate letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, Y.  
   Let’s try common combinations:  
   – C L O E _ → “CLOVE” – but we already tried that implicitly and E was 5th (invalid).  
     Here E would be 4th, so “CLOVE” would be C,L,O,E,V – that’s valid for positions: C(1),L(2),O(3),E(4),V(5).  
     We never tried “CLOVE” in this exact position pattern.  
     Check if any letters conflict:  
       C – not yet excluded.  
       L – allowed in 2.  
       O – correct in 3.  
       E – allowed in 4.  
       V – not excluded.  
     So “CLOVE” is a valid candidate.

7) _ _ O E L → E in 4, L in 5 – both positions are allowed.  
   Then positions 1,2 must be filled with new letters.  
   Example: C H O E L → “CHOEL” – invalid.  
   M I O E L – not a word.  
   W I O E L – not a word.  

Comparing all, “CLOVE” seems like the best remaining common word that fits all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update the master list of what we know.

Letters that have received an “x” are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, S, N, B, P, D, C, V

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- O (from NOBLE: position 3 is ✓, so O is locked in the 3rd spot)
- E (from POLED: position 4 is ✓, so E is locked in the 4th spot)
- L (from every round it has appeared as “-” meaning it is somewhere in the word, but never in the 3rd or 4th positions, and not yet in the 2nd or 5th)

So the pattern is now:
_ _ O E _

Letters still available (unused and never marked x):
F, G, H, I, J, K, M, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We have two blanks (positions 1 and 2) and the letter L must appear exactly once, but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (it can be 1, 2, or 5).

Case 1: L in position 1
L _ O E _

We need a second letter for position 2 that is unused.
Common consonants left: M, T, H, G, K, F
A common word: L I O E N – N is out.
L I O E T – not a word.
L I O E S – S is out.
L I O E M – “LI O E M” isn’t a word.
L G O E T – not common.
L M O E T – not a word.
L T O E K – not a word.
L T O E M – not a word.

Case 2: L in position 2
_ L O E _

Again need a first letter from unused consonants.
Try G, M, H, T, etc.
G L O E _ – needs a 5th letter.  G L O E N – N out.  G L O E T – “GLOET” – not a word.
M L O E _ – M L O E T – not a word.
H L O E _ – not a word.
T L O E _ – not a word.

Case 3: L in position 5
_ _ O E L

Now positions 1 and 2 must be filled with two new letters from the unused set (no duplicates forced so far).  A frequent consonant pair is M and I, or T and I, etc.  The 5-letter word must be real and common.  Try:

M I O E L – not a word.
T I O E L – not a word.
G I O E L – not a word.
F I O E L – not a word.
M O I E L – impossible O is fixed in 3.

Another common pattern: consonant + vowel + OEL  
But we do not have many vowels left: only I or U have not been ruled out.  I is common.

Try T I O E L – “TIOEL” – invalid.

Next, try placing I in position 2 and a consonant in position 1:
F I O E L – not a word.
H I O E L – not a word.
K I O E L – not a word.
M I O E L – not a word.
W I O E L – not a word.

That seems poor.  Let’s backtrack and try a fresh high-frequency consonant pair:

M O _  – O is in 3, so not useful.

Instead, consider M and any new consonant.

A promising word that fits the blanks is “M O U S E” – but S and U placements do not fit.

Wait, let’s list the only real words that fit the exact skeleton “_ _ O E L” using only allowed letters.  English words with pattern ? ? O E L:

- “MODEL” – but D was ruled out.
- “FOGEL” – not common.
- “HOTEL” – T in 2, L in 5 – HOTEL is a word.  Check letters:
      H (allowed), O (3 ✓), T (allowed), E (4 ✓), L (5 allowed)
   H is not yet excluded, T isn’t excluded.  HOTEL is a perfectly common word.

And it uses:
- H(1) – new, allowed
- O(3) – locked
- T(2) – new, allowed
- E(4) – locked
- L(5) – allowed placement (never tried 5th before).

No conflicts.  HOTEL should be the next guess.

We now have:

Letters known NOT in the word (from every x):
A, R, S, N, B, P, D, C, V, T

Only the 2nd position is unknown, and it must be a single letter that:
- has never appeared,
- is not among the excluded set above.

Available unused letters (common): F, G, I, K, M, U, W, Y

A quick scan of real 5-letter words that match H ? O E L:

- H I O E L – not a word.
- H M O E L – not a word.
- H U O E L – not a word.
- H G O E L – not a word.
- H F O E L – not a word.
- H K O E L – not a word.
- H W O E L – not a word.
- H Y O E L – not a word.

The only common English word of the form H _ O E L is “HOVEL”.

Check letters:
H ✓, O ✓, V(2) – V was eliminated (x in Guess 4).  
So HOVEL is invalid.

Next possibility: check if any other silent or less-common letter fits – but nothing looks valid.

Realize: “H I O E L” doesn’t exist; English orthography for this exact skeleton is rare.

However, the word “HOVEL” was already ruled out due to V.

Step back: is there any mis-interpretation?  No, the skeleton is fixed.

Therefore the only remaining possibility is “HOIEL” or similar, but none are words.

Recheck the skeleton against list of 5-letter words:

Standard Scrabble word list shows exactly one word: “HOVEL”.

Since V is eliminated, no other common word exists.

Realize: perhaps I overlooked a letter.  Recheck the unused letters: F, G, I, K, M, U, W, Y.

“H U O E L” – invalid.

“H M O E L” – invalid.

“H F O E L” – invalid.

“H K O E L” – invalid.

“H Y O E L” – invalid.

Thus, the only possible conclusion is that the word is HOVEL, but V was marked x.  This contradiction implies an earlier oversight.

Re-examine Guess 4 feedback: CLOVE → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(-) E(-)
That means V was marked “-” (wrong position), not “x”.  My earlier summary mis-read it.

Corrected:
Letters definitely NOT in word (x received): A, R, S, N, B, P, D, C.
Letters definitely IN word: H(1), O(3), E(4), L(5) – positions locked.
Letters in word but wrong positions:
- V – was marked “-” in Guess 4 (CLOVE), meaning V exists but not in position 4.

Therefore the only unfilled position is 2, and the missing letter is V.

The word is H V O E L – but that’s not English.

Wait – the word must be HOVEL with V in 2nd place.

Check against feedback:
HOVEL:
1 H ✓ (matches feedback)
2 V – not checked in position 2 before (only marked “-” in position 4)  
3 O ✓
4 E ✓
5 L ✓

All constraints satisfied.  HOVEL is therefore the only possibility, and it has never been tried.

Using the locked pattern H _ O E L and the fact that V was only ruled out of position 4 (not the entire word), the only remaining valid word is:

Available unused letters (common): F, G, I, K, M, U, W, Y

A quick scan of real 5-letter words that match H ? O E L:

- H I O E L – not a word.
- H M O E L – not a word.
- H U O E L – not a word.
- H G O E L – not a word.
- H F O E L – not a word.
- H K O E L – not a word.
- H W O E L – not a word.
- H Y O E L – not a word.

The only common English word of the form H _ O E L is “HOVEL”.

Check letters:
H ✓, O ✓, V(2) – V was eliminated (x in Guess 4).  
So HOVEL is invalid.

Next possibility: check if any other silent or less-common letter fits – but nothing looks valid.

Realize: “H I O E L” doesn’t exist; English orthography for this exact skeleton is rare.

However, the word “HOVEL” was already ruled out due to V.

Step back: is there any mis-interpretation?  No, the skeleton is fixed.

Therefore the only remaining possibility is “HOIEL” or similar, but none are words.

Recheck the skeleton against list of 5-letter words:

Standard Scrabble word list shows exactly one word: “HOVEL”.

Since V is eliminated, no other common word exists.

Realize: perhaps I overlooked a letter.  Recheck the unused letters: F, G, I, K, M, U, W, Y.

“H U O E L” – invalid.

“H M O E L” – invalid.

“H F O E L” – invalid.

“H K O E L” – invalid.

“H Y O E L” – invalid.

Thus, the only possible conclusion is that the word is HOVEL, but V was marked x.  This contradiction implies an earlier oversight.

Re-examine Guess 4 feedback: CLOVE → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(-) E(-)
That means V was marked “-” (wrong position), not “x”.  My earlier summary mis-read it.

Corrected:
Letters definitely NOT in word (x received): A, R, S, N, B, P, D, C.
Letters definitely IN word: H(1), O(3), E(4), L(5) – positions locked.
Letters in word but wrong positions:
- V – was marked “-” in Guess 4 (CLOVE), meaning V exists but not in position 4.

Therefore the only unfilled position is 2, and the missing letter is V.

The word is H V O E L – but that’s not English.

Wait – the word must be HOVEL with V in 2nd place.

Check against feedback:
HOVEL:
1 H ✓ (matches feedback)
2 V – not checked in position 2 before (only marked “-” in position 4)  
3 O ✓
4 E ✓
5 L ✓

All constraints satisfied.  HOVEL is therefore the only possibility, and it has never been tried.Using the locked pattern H _ O E L and the fact that V was only ruled out of position 4 (not the entire word), the only remaining valid word is:",Guess 6: HOVEL -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
