For a first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants. 

Common 5-letter starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E - very common letters)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)
- STARE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRATE (good mix of letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or finding letters that exist in the word.

Another strong contender is ""STARE"" as it covers S, T (common starting letters), A (common vowel), R (common consonant), and E (very common ending letter).

Between these, ""AROSE"" slightly edges out because the combination of A-R-O-S-E gives a good spread across the alphabet. So I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O, S, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains R but not in position 2. It does NOT contain A, O, S, or E.

Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, B, K, F, W, Y, V, X, Z.

Since R must appear, and we need 5 letters total, I should pick a word that:
1. Has R in a different position (not 2nd)
2. Avoids A, O, S, E
3. Uses other high-frequency consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.)

A good next step is to test R in other positions with other common letters. Possible candidates:
- TRUNK (T, R, U, N, K) – but T is common 1st letter, U is a new vowel
- BRISK – but S is out
- FRUIT – but E is out, I and U are new vowels
- CRIMP – but P is less common
- DRIFT – D, R, I, F, T – good spread, avoids banned letters

DRIFT looks strong: D, R, I, F, T – none of the banned letters (A, O, S, E), and R is in position 2 (but we know it must move). Wait, R is currently in position 2 in DRIFT – but feedback said R is in the word but wrong position (was position 2 in AROSE). So DRIFT has R in position 2, same as before – that's not helpful. Need to move R.

Let me rethink: need a word with R not in position 2.
- TRULY (T, R, U, L, Y) – R in position 2 again, bad
- CURVE (C, U, R, V, E) – E is banned
- BURNT (B, U, R, N, T) – R in position 3
- PRINT (P, R, I, N, T) – R in position 2 again
- URBAN (U, R, B, A, N) – A is banned
- BRAND (B, R, A, N, D) – A is banned
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T) – R in position 2
- DRUID (D, R, U, I, D) – R in position 2

Hmm, many words have R in position 2. Let me pick one where R is not in position 2:
- BURNT: R is 3rd – uses B, U, R, N, T – all acceptable
- CRUMP: C, R, U, M, P – R is 3rd, but M and P are less common

BURLY seems good – common letters, R in 3rd position, avoids banned letters.

Remaining letters to try should be common consonants and vowels not yet used: T, N, I, C, D, P, M, G, H, K, F, W, V, X, Z.  
The most frequent remaining vowel is I, and common consonants are T, N, C, D, etc.  
A good next word would keep B in position 1 and R in position 3 while testing two new common letters in positions 2 and 5.

Candidate words:
- B R I _ _ – but R is already fixed at 3, so B I R _ _ won’t work.  
- B _ R I _ – possible: B A R I N → but A is banned.  
- B _ R T _ – B A R T Y → A and Y banned.  
- B I R T H → B I R T H – fits the pattern B _ R _ _ with I and T, H.

BIRTH looks solid: B (✓ pos 1), I (new vowel), R (✓ pos 3), T (new), H (new).  
Let’s go with BIRTH.",Guess 3: BIRTH -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) R(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
