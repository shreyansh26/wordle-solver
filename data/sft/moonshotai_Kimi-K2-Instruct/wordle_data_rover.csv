For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me the maximum amount of information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

Some popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)

However, since we have no information yet, I'll go with a balanced word that has both common vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common letter
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

The feedback from SLATE was:
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (is in the word but in the wrong position)

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but it is NOT in the 5th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

I need to pick a new word that:
- Uses E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common vowels to test: I, O, U
Good remaining common consonants: N, R, C, M, P, D, G, H, B, F, K, W, Y

A strong second guess would be ""CRANE"", but that uses C, R, A, N, E. However, A is already known to be excluded, so that's invalid.

Another good choice is ""REIGN"" - but it uses G and N, which are okay, but let's see.

Instead, let's try ""REIGN"":
- R: possible
- E: must be in positions 1-4 (here it's position 2, which is allowed)
- I: possible
- G: possible
- N: possible

But ""REIGN"" has E in position 2, which is allowed since it was originally in position 5 (now ruled out).

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common.

""PRONE"" uses P, R, O, N, E - O is a good vowel to test, P and R and N are common.

I think ""PRONE"" is a good choice because:
- P: common consonant not yet tested
- R: common consonant not yet tested
- O: common vowel not yet tested (and we haven't seen O yet)
- N: common consonant not yet tested
- E: known to be in word, now placed in position 5 - but wait! Feedback said E is in wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so E cannot be in position 5 in our new guess. So ""PRONE"" is invalid because it has E in position 5.

Let me rethink. Must place E in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- ""NERDY"" - but uses D which is okay, but Y is less common.
- ""CREEP"" - but uses C, R, E, E, P - double E is allowed but less informative.
- ""FRIED"" - uses F, R, I, E, D - E is in position 4 (allowed)
- ""GRIPE"" - uses G, R, I, P, E - E is in position 5 (invalid)
- ""DINER"" - uses D, I, N, E, R - E is in position 4 (allowed)

""DINER"" seems good:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,rover,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me the maximum amount of information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

Some popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)

However, since we have no information yet, I'll go with a balanced word that has both common vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common letter
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE was:
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (is in the word but in the wrong position)

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but it is NOT in the 5th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

I need to pick a new word that:
- Uses E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common vowels to test: I, O, U
Good remaining common consonants: N, R, C, M, P, D, G, H, B, F, K, W, Y

A strong second guess would be ""CRANE"", but that uses C, R, A, N, E. However, A is already known to be excluded, so that's invalid.

Another good choice is ""REIGN"" - but it uses G and N, which are okay, but let's see.

Instead, let's try ""REIGN"":
- R: possible
- E: must be in positions 1-4 (here it's position 2, which is allowed)
- I: possible
- G: possible
- N: possible

But ""REIGN"" has E in position 2, which is allowed since it was originally in position 5 (now ruled out).

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common.

""PRONE"" uses P, R, O, N, E - O is a good vowel to test, P and R and N are common.

I think ""PRONE"" is a good choice because:
- P: common consonant not yet tested
- R: common consonant not yet tested
- O: common vowel not yet tested (and we haven't seen O yet)
- N: common consonant not yet tested
- E: known to be in word, now placed in position 5 - but wait! Feedback said E is in wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so E cannot be in position 5 in our new guess. So ""PRONE"" is invalid because it has E in position 5.

Let me rethink. Must place E in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- ""NERDY"" - but uses D which is okay, but Y is less common.
- ""CREEP"" - but uses C, R, E, E, P - double E is allowed but less informative.
- ""FRIED"" - uses F, R, I, E, D - E is in position 4 (allowed)
- ""GRIPE"" - uses G, R, I, P, E - E is in position 5 (invalid)
- ""DINER"" - uses D, I, N, E, R - E is in position 4 (allowed)

""DINER"" seems good:
- D: common consonant not yet tested
- I: common vowel not yet tested
- N: common consonant not yet tested
- E: in position 4 (was in position 5 previously, so this is allowed)
- R: common consonant not yet tested

All letters are new except E, and E is in a new position.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, D, I, N, C, M.

- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from COMER feedback).

So the current pattern is: _ O _ E R, with O already in position 2 (✓), meaning O is in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ E R.

We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the allowed letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, D, I, N, C, M.

""HOVER"" uses H, O, V, E, R:
- H: allowed
- O: already in position 2 (matches our pattern)
- V: allowed
- E: in position 4 (correct)
- R: in position 5 (correct)

This seems like a good choice.

Alternatively, ""JOKER"":
- J: allowed
- O: in position 2
- K: allowed
- E: in position 4
- R: in position 5

But ""HOVER"" seems slightly more common.

Let's go with HOVER.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can give me the maximum amount of information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

Some popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)

However, since we have no information yet, I'll go with a balanced word that has both common vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common letter
- E: most common ending letter

This should give good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE was:
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (is in the word but in the wrong position)

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but it is NOT in the 5th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.

I need to pick a new word that:
- Uses E in a different position (positions 1-4).
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common vowels to test: I, O, U
Good remaining common consonants: N, R, C, M, P, D, G, H, B, F, K, W, Y

A strong second guess would be ""CRANE"", but that uses C, R, A, N, E. However, A is already known to be excluded, so that's invalid.

Another good choice is ""REIGN"" - but it uses G and N, which are okay, but let's see.

Instead, let's try ""REIGN"":
- R: possible
- E: must be in positions 1-4 (here it's position 2, which is allowed)
- I: possible
- G: possible
- N: possible

But ""REIGN"" has E in position 2, which is allowed since it was originally in position 5 (now ruled out).

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common.

""PRONE"" uses P, R, O, N, E - O is a good vowel to test, P and R and N are common.

I think ""PRONE"" is a good choice because:
- P: common consonant not yet tested
- R: common consonant not yet tested
- O: common vowel not yet tested (and we haven't seen O yet)
- N: common consonant not yet tested
- E: known to be in word, now placed in position 5 - but wait! Feedback said E is in wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so E cannot be in position 5 in our new guess. So ""PRONE"" is invalid because it has E in position 5.

Let me rethink. Must place E in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- ""NERDY"" - but uses D which is okay, but Y is less common.
- ""CREEP"" - but uses C, R, E, E, P - double E is allowed but less informative.
- ""FRIED"" - uses F, R, I, E, D - E is in position 4 (allowed)
- ""GRIPE"" - uses G, R, I, P, E - E is in position 5 (invalid)
- ""DINER"" - uses D, I, N, E, R - E is in position 4 (allowed)

""DINER"" seems good:
- D: common consonant not yet tested
- I: common vowel not yet tested
- N: common consonant not yet tested
- E: in position 4 (was in position 5 previously, so this is allowed)
- R: common consonant not yet tested

All letters are new except E, and E is in a new position.

   - R is in position 5 (because in DINER it got ✓ for the fifth letter).

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We still need three more letters (positions 1, 2, 3). Available letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, D, I, N.

Common remaining letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
- Fits the pattern _ _ _ E R.
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Some candidate words:
- COMER: but O and M and C are allowed. Let's check:
  - C: allowed
  - O: allowed
  - M: allowed
  - E: in correct position
  - R: in correct position

- HOMER: H is allowed.
- POKER: P, O, K allowed.
- COVER: C, O, V allowed.
- GAMER: G, A, M - but A is excluded, so invalid.
- BOXER: B, O, X allowed.

""COMER"" looks good because:

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:

- Position 5: R (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong position:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from COMER feedback).

So the current pattern is: _ O _ E R, with O already in position 2 (✓), meaning O is in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ O _ E R.

We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the allowed letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, D, I, N, C, M.

Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits B _ O _ E R, F _ O _ E R, etc.

Let's list some possible words:
- BOWER
- FOYER
- GOFER
- HOVER
- JOKER
- POKER
- ROGER (but R is already in position 5, so can't be in position 1)
- VOTER (but T is excluded)
- WOKER (not a word)
- YOKER (not a word)

From the valid ones, ""FOYER"" and ""HOVER"" and ""JOKER"" stand out.

""HOVER"" uses H, O, V, E, R:
- H: allowed
- O: already in position 2 (matches our pattern)
- V: allowed
- E: in position 4 (correct)
- R: in position 5 (correct)

This seems like a good choice.

Alternatively, ""JOKER"":
- J: allowed
- O: in position 2
- K: allowed
- E: in position 4
- R: in position 5

But ""HOVER"" seems slightly more common.

However, A is already known to be excluded, so that\'s invalid.\n\nAnother good choice is ""REIGN"" - but it uses G and N, which are okay, but let\'s see.\n\nInstead, let\'s try ""REIGN"":\n- R: possible\n- E: must be in positions 1-4 (here it\'s position 2, which is allowed)\n- I: possible\n- G: possible\n- N: possible\n\nBut ""REIGN"" has E in position 2, which is allowed since it was originally in position 5 (now ruled out).\n\nAlternatively, ""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common.\n\n""PRONE"" uses P, R, O, N, E - O is a good vowel to test, P and R and N are common.\n\nI think ""PRONE"" is a good choice because:\n- P: common consonant not yet tested\n- R: common consonant not yet tested\n- O: common vowel not yet tested (and we haven\'t seen O yet)\n- N: common consonant not yet tested\n- E: known to be in word, now placed in position 5 - but wait! Feedback said E is in wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so E cannot be in position 5 in our new guess. So ""PRONE"" is invalid because it has E in position 5.\n\nLet me rethink. Must place E in positions 1-4.\n\nGood candidates:\n- ""NERDY"" - but uses D which is okay, but Y is less common.\n- ""CREEP"" - but uses C, R, E, E, P - double E is allowed but less informative.\n- ""FRIED"" - uses F, R, I, E, D - E is in position 4 (allowed)\n- ""GRIPE"" - uses G, R, I, P, E - E is in position 5 (invalid)\n- ""DINER"" - uses D, I, N, E, R - E is in position 4 (allowed)\n\n""DINER"" seems good:\n- D: common consonant not yet tested\n- I: common vowel not yet tested\n- N: common consonant not yet tested\n- E: in position 4 (was in position 5 previously, so this is allowed)\n- R: common consonant not yet tested\n\nAll letters are new except E, and E is in a new position.\n\n<guess>DINER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DINER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far we know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, D, I, N, C, M, H, B, W  

Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:  
- Position 2: O  
- Position 4: E  
- Position 5: R  

Therefore the pattern is: _ O _ E R  

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (from still unused letters):  
F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ E R with these remaining letters.

Common valid candidates:
- JOKER → J (allowed), K (allowed) – valid word
- POKER → P (allowed), K (allowed) – valid word
- GOFER → G (allowed), F (allowed) – valid word

“JOKER” and “POKER” both fit perfectly and use two new allowed letters. Between them, “JOKER” introduces J and K.

So the most informative next guess is:

J _ O K E R
