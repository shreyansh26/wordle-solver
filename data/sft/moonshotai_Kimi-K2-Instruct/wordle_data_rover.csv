For the first guess in Wordle with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). It strikes a good balance between vowel coverage and consonant variety. 

Another strong contender is ""RAISE"" which has the same letters as ""ARISE"" but might be slightly better positioned. However, ""CRANE"" seems to have a slightly better letter frequency distribution.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Current constraints:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, T, I, G, L, U, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - E must be in position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3).  
   - R must appear somewhere in the word, but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (from Guess 1 and 3). So R must be in position 1 or 2.

Thus the word looks like:  
[R or _] [R or _] _ E _

Letters still allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But we want only common letters to keep possibilities high.  

Candidate patterns:
- R _ _ E _ (R in pos 1)  
- _ R _ E _ (R in pos 2)

Common letters left to test: S, M, O, B, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ E _ with R in 1 or 2 and only using allowed letters.

Examples:
- R O S E ? – but O and S are allowed. However, we need 5-letter words.  
- R O V E R – but R cannot be in position 5.  
- R O B E S – but S is allowed, but we need to check if it fits.  
- R O P E S – R O P E S: R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4), S(5). R is allowed in 1, E in 4. Uses only allowed letters.

Another candidate: _ R _ E _  
- B R E E D – but D is excluded.  
- P R E S S – S is allowed, but P and S are allowed. But E is already in 4, and we want to test other letters.  
- F R E S H – H is allowed, but we want to test more common letters.  
- M O R E L – but L is excluded.  
- S P R E E – S is allowed, but E is already in 4, and we want to test other letters.

""ROPES"" seems like a good candidate: R in 1, O and P and S are new allowed letters. It fits all constraints.

- R somewhere in the word, and the only open spots for R now are positions 1 or 2 (since R cannot be in 3 or 5).
- No letters C, A, N, T, I, G, L, U, D.

Testing new common letters (O, P, S), a valid guess is:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,rover,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). It strikes a good balance between vowel coverage and consonant variety. 

Another strong contender is ""RAISE"" which has the same letters as ""ARISE"" but might be slightly better positioned. However, ""CRANE"" seems to have a slightly better letter frequency distribution.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- C(x) – C is NOT in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains R and E, but not C, A, or N.  
Positions to avoid: R is not in spot 2, E is not in spot 5.

A good next guess should:
- keep R and E
- avoid C, A, N
- test new common letters (S, T, L, O, I, etc.)
- place R and E in new positions

Candidate words:
- STORM – but O is new, M is new, S/T are good, but R is in spot 4 (allowed), E is missing.
- TIGER – uses T, I, G, R, and E.  
  – R is not in spot 2 ✓  
  – E is not in spot 5 ✓  
  – Adds new consonants T, I, G  
  – No forbidden letters (C, A, N)

- R is in the word but is NOT in position 5.

So the word has the form _ _ _ E _, and R appears somewhere among positions 1-3.

- LURED – L, U, D are new. LURED fits all constraints: L _ U E D (but R is in position 2, which is allowed).

From the feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- R (now confirmed in position 1)
- O (now confirmed in position 2)
- E (now confirmed in position 4)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
C, A, N, T, I, G, L, U, D, P, S

So the word looks like: R O _ E _ with the blank positions 3 and 5 needing letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Allowed letters remaining (not yet eliminated): B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with ""RO"" and has ""E"" in position 4. Common possibilities:
- ROWER (but W hasn't been tested yet)
- ROGER (but G is eliminated)
- ROVER (V is allowed)
- ROPER (P is eliminated)
- RODEO (D is eliminated)

""ROVER"" seems the most likely - it's common and uses only allowed letters (R, O, V, E, R). The second R is allowed since R is already confirmed in position 1 and there's no restriction on multiple R's.
