For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I think ""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- S and T (very common starting letters)
- A and E (the most common vowels)
- L (a common consonant)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters and can quickly reveal which of these key letters are present.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means:

- S, L, A, T, E are completely out.  
- The word can’t contain any of those letters.  

Therefore we need a word made only from the remaining 21 letters.  
Good consonants to test next: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y.

A balanced word that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “CHORD”.

- C, H, R, D are all new consonants.  
- O is a new vowel.

From the previous feedback:

- Letters ruled out completely so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, D  
  (all marked with “x”).

- Letters that are in the secret word but in wrong positions:
  H (-), O (-), R (-)

The secret word contains:
- H somewhere (not position 2)  
- O somewhere (not position 3)  
- R somewhere (not position 4)  

Remaining unused common letters include: B, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no S,L,A,T,E,C,D).  
2. Contains H, O, R exactly once each (because each received one “-”).  
3. Uses two additional fresh letters (cannot reuse H, O, R more than once).

Smart choices for the two fresh letters are high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tried, e.g. N and I.

Let’s place the letters so that:
- H is not in position 2  
- O is not in position 3  
- R is not in position 4  

One arrangement satisfying all constraints: RHINO  
- R is in position 1 (allowed)  
- H is in position 2 → but we already know H was in position 2 in CHORD and was marked “-” (wrong position), so position 2 is still invalid for H.  
Oops, that won’t work.

Try another arrangement: HORN + one more letter.  
HORN already has H,O,R,N, but we need five letters.  
Let’s try adding I in an unused spot:  
Possible word: RHINO (already saw H in spot 2 is bad).  
Try: HONOR – but this uses O twice, which is invalid (O only appears once).  
Try: HORNY – H in spot 1 (allowed), O in spot 2 (allowed – wasn’t in spot 3), R in spot 3 (allowed – wasn’t in spot 4), N and Y new.  
HORNY:  
- H 1 (ok, previous H was in spot 2)  
- O 2 (ok, previous O was in spot 3)  
- R 3 (ok, previous R was in spot 4)  
- N, Y not yet used.

Let’s digest the latest feedback:

1. Letters completely ruled-out so far  
   (all received “x” at least once):  
   S, L, A, T, E, C, D, N, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the secret word  
   (received at least one “-” or ✓):  
   - H is now confirmed to be in position 1 (✓)  
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (received “-”)  
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (received “-”)  

3. Positions we now know  
   - Position 1 = H  
   - Position 2 ≠ O  
   - Position 3 ≠ R  

4. Still-untested high-frequency letters  
   B, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, W, (plus second uses if allowed)  
   We need three more letters to fill positions 2-4-5 that  
   (a) are not on the forbidden list above,  
   (b) include exactly one O and one R somewhere among positions 2-3-4-5,  
   (c) place O ≠ position 2 and R ≠ position 3,  
   (d) use two fresh letters for the remaining slots.

Simplest strategy: lock H in position 1, then distribute O and R across remaining valid spots, filling the remaining two slots with fresh letters.

Candidate placements:

- H _ _ _ _  
  – O must go in 3, 4, or 5  
  – R must go in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)  

Good pairings:

a) H O _ R _   → need two more letters; let’s pick B & I → HOBRI (valid word? yes)  
   But R would be in position 4 which is allowed (was in 3 in HORNY, marked “-”).  
   However O would be in position 2, and we know O was in position 2 in HORNY and got “-” → position 2 is forbidden for O. So HO*** is out.

b) H _ O _ _ → O in position 3  
   Then R can go in 2, 4, or 5.  
   If R in 2 → H R O _ _ → need two fresh letters → HR O _ _ → HRON_ (N already banned).  
   If R in 4 → H _ O R _ → H _ O R _ → need letters in 2 & 5.  
   If R in 5 → H _ O _ R → H _ O _ R → need letters in 2 & 4.

Let’s pursue H _ O R _ (R in 4, O in 3, H in 1).

None of the above combinations look like real English words.  
We need to widen the pool of fresh letters to include some less common but valid choices.

Let’s try H _ _ O R (O in 4, R in 5).  
Pick G & I – H G I O R – HGIOR – no.

Pick W & U – H W U O R – HWUOR – no.

Real word check: let’s list valid English words that start with H, contain O and R exactly once each, avoid banned letters, and satisfy positional constraints.

Banned letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, D, N, Y → none of these can appear.

We need H _ _ _ _ with O and R somewhere and two other fresh letters.

Try HUMOR – contains M, U, O, R – but O is in spot 3, R in 5.  
Check:  
- H (✓) – matches position 1  
- O in spot 3 – allowed (was in spot 2 in HORNY, marked “-”)  
- R in spot 5 – allowed (was in spot 3 in HORNY, marked “-”)  
- U and M have not yet been used or ruled out.  
- No banned letters present.  

HUMOR is a real word.

Validate:  
Letters: H, U, M, O, R – none of S,L,A,T,E,C,D,N,Y appear → OK.  
Positions:  
1 = H (✓)  
2 = U (new)  
3 = O (allowed)  
4 = M (new)  
5 = R (allowed)  

Therefore HUMOR satisfies every rule.
