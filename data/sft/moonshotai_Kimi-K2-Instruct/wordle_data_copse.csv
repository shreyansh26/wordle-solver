For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in 5-letter words are often vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should balance these letters to test as many possibilities as possible. 

One classic choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This allows me to quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers high-frequency letters. 

Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests more vowels upfront, which are often the trickier letters to pinpoint in word games.

- Position 3 might be O, but we should test O in different positions.

Let's choose a word that:
- Keeps S and E fixed at positions 4 and 5.
- Places O in a new position (1 or 2).
- Uses common consonants not yet tested (like T, L, N, H, etc.).

A good candidate: ""T O N S E"" (TONSE) — but is TONSE a valid word? It appears to be a surname or acronym, not a common 5-letter word. 

Next option: ""P O S S E"" — but this repeats S which is already known and doesn't test new letters well.

Try ""D O U S E"" — valid word, tests D and U.

Another option: ""M O U S E"" — tests M and U. This is a common word.

- LOOSE - double O.
- DOSES - not matching pattern.
- WOKE - too short.

The cleanest valid word fitting _ O _ S E is probably ""DOSES"", but it places S in position 3 which conflicts with S in position 4.
Next is ""HORSE"" – but R is eliminated.
""CORSE"" – uses C, O, R, S, E; R eliminated.
""GOOSE"" – double O.
""JONES"" – uses J, O, N, E, S. This fits: _ O _ S E → J O N S E.

""JONES"" is a valid 5-letter English word, and tests J and N as new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A and R are not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓).

Position map so far:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
4: S (✓) — so position 4 must be S
5: E (✓) — so position 5 must be E

Known letters in the word: O, S, E (with S and E already placed at 4 and 5).  
O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Possible structure: _ _ O _ S E, _ O _ _ S E, or O _ _ _ S E.

We can rule out:
- Letters A and R (confirmed not in word).
- Position 3 might be O, but we should test O in different positions.

Let's choose a word that:
- Keeps S and E fixed at positions 4 and 5.
- Places O in a new position (1 or 2).
- Uses common consonants not yet tested (like T, L, N, H, etc.).

A good candidate: ""T O N S E"" (TONSE) — but is TONSE a valid word? It appears to be a surname or acronym, not a common 5-letter word. 

Next option: ""P O S S E"" — but this repeats S which is already known and doesn't test new letters well.

Try ""D O U S E"" — valid word, tests D and U.

Another option: ""M O U S E"" — tests M and U. This is a common word.

Remaining letters to test should come from the unused frequent consonants:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ O _ S E.

Possible candidates:
