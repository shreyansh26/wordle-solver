For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English (vowels and common consonants)
3. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z to maximize information gain

Common starting words include: ADIEU (many vowels), CRANE (good consonant/vowel mix), SLATE, etc. I'll go with CRANE as it's well-balanced with common letters across different positions and has good letter frequency coverage.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- N is correctly positioned (5th letter is N)
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all

So we know:
1. 5th letter is N
2. No C, R, A, or E in any position
3. The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess would:
- Keep the N in position 5
- Use new letters we haven't tested yet
- Prefer common letters to maximize information

I'll try a word with common consonants and vowels not yet tested. Good options might be: STONE (but O and T are good), MOUND (but O and U are good), or FIGHT. I'll go with STONE as it tests S, T, O while keeping N in place.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,stink,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English (vowels and common consonants)
3. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z to maximize information gain

Common starting words include: ADIEU (many vowels), CRANE (good consonant/vowel mix), SLATE, etc. I'll go with CRANE as it's well-balanced with common letters across different positions and has good letter frequency coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- N is correctly positioned (5th letter is N)
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all

So we know:
1. 5th letter is N
2. No C, R, A, or E in any position
3. The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess would:
- Keep the N in position 5
- Use new letters we haven't tested yet
- Prefer common letters to maximize information

I'll try a word with common consonants and vowels not yet tested. Good options might be: STONE (but O and T are good), MOUND (but O and U are good), or FIGHT. I'll go with STONE as it tests S, T, O while keeping N in place.

   – O and E are absent.

Current pattern: S T _ _ N  
Letters still allowed: all others except C, R, A, E, O.

Good next letters to test: I, U, D, L, M, P, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that fills the 3rd and 4th positions with relatively common unused letters.  
Option: STUMN isn’t valid; STUIN isn’t a word. STUMP is valid but uses P.  
Another: STINK – all letters are still allowed (I, N, K) but N is already known.

We now know the pattern is S T I _ N, and the 4th letter is NOT F, L, G, O, A, R, C, E.

Still-available letters for the 4th position:  
B, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only common 5-letter English word that fits S T I _ N is STINK, but we already tried STING (which puts G in the 5th slot) and N is fixed in 5th, so STINK would have K in 4th. We haven't tested K yet.

Another valid word: STYIN (slang, not common), STIMN (not a word), STIBN (not a word), STIPN (not a word), STIDN (not a word), STIKY (not a word).

The clear remaining common word is STINK, with K as the 4th letter - which we haven't tried yet.

So the only remaining logical guess is STINK.
