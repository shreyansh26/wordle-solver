- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 distinct letters
2. Include common vowels and consonants
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z initially

Popular choices for first guesses include words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for potential letters in the secret word.

From the combined feedback:

1. Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, S, E  
   - R ≠ 1st and R ≠ 2nd (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - S ≠ 4th and S ≠ 5th (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - E is in the word; the 4th position is confirmed correct (✓)  
   - E also appears somewhere else (from RAISE) and that somewhere else is NOT 3rd or 5th; so the other E must be in 1st or 2nd.  

2. Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, I, T  

3. Still-unknown slots: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but position 4 is E).

4. Possible positions:  
   - R: 3, 4 (but 4 is already E), 5 → so R must be 3rd or 5th.  
   - S: 1, 2, 3  
   - The other E: 1 or 2 (only remaining possibilities)

5. We also have no information yet about letters like N, L, O, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
- lock E in 4th place
- try R in 3rd or 5th
- try S in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- introduce 1–2 fresh common consonants to gain more information.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- S _ E _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S E _ _  (S in 2nd)
- _ _ E _ R  (R in 5th)
- etc.

One high-information word is “SNEER”:
- S (1st) – tests S in 1st
- N (new letter)
- E (3rd) – tests if the 2nd E can go here (but we already know E is 4th ✓, so this is fine)
- E (4th) – already locked
- R (5th) – tests R in 5th

This placement respects all known constraints:
- S is allowed in 1st
- R is allowed in 5th

- Avoids A, I, T
- Adds N as a new probe letter.

Therefore, SNEER is a strong third guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, S, E  
   - R ≠ 1st and R ≠ 2nd (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - S ≠ 4th and S ≠ 5th (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - E is in the word; the 4th position is confirmed correct (✓)  
   - E also appears somewhere else (from RAISE) and that somewhere else is NOT 3rd or 5th; so the other E must be in 1st or 2nd.  

2. Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, I, T  

3. Still-unknown slots: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but position 4 is E).

4. Possible positions:  
   - R: 3, 4 (but 4 is already E), 5 → so R must be 3rd or 5th.  
   - S: 1, 2, 3  
   - The other E: 1 or 2 (only remaining possibilities)

5. We also have no information yet about letters like N, L, O, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
- lock E in 4th place
- try R in 3rd or 5th
- try S in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- introduce 1–2 fresh common consonants to gain more information.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- S _ E _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S E _ _  (S in 2nd)
- _ _ E _ R  (R in 5th)
- etc.

One high-information word is “SNEER”:
- S (1st) – tests S in 1st
- N (new letter)
- E (3rd) – tests if the 2nd E can go here (but we already know E is 4th ✓, so this is fine)
- E (4th) – already locked
- R (5th) – tests R in 5th

This placement respects all known constraints:
- S is allowed in 1st
- R is allowed in 5th
- E is in 4th
- Avoids A, I, T
- Adds N as a new probe letter.

Therefore, SNEER is a strong third guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word and their certain positions:
- S must be in position 1 (✓ from SNEER)
- E must be in position 4 (✓ from both TREES and SNEER)
- R must be in position 5 (✓ from SNEER)

So the pattern is: S _ _ E R

Letters we know are NOT in the word (due to x feedback):
A, I, T, N

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with two different letters from the available set.

Good consonant-vowel combinations that make real 5-letter words:
- Position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, W
- Position 3: Same set, but must form a valid word

Looking for common English words fitting S _ _ E R:
- S P E E R (invalid, E already in 4)
- S H E E R (invalid, E already in 4)
- S C E N T (invalid, N is disallowed)
- S W E E T (invalid, T is disallowed)
- S C E P T (invalid)
- S C E N E (invalid)
- S L E E R (invalid)
- S C E N T (invalid)
- S C E P T (invalid)

Looking more carefully:
- S C O R E (fits pattern S _ _ E R, but O and C are allowed)
- S C O R E: S(✓), C(new), O(new), E(✓), R(✓)
This is a valid word and tests C and O in positions 2 and 3.

Other possibilities:
- S M E L R (not a word)
- S P I R E (I is disallowed)
- S H O R E (fits)
- S C O R E vs S H O R E

Between SCORE and SHORE, both fit perfectly, but let's choose one. SCORE is a good choice as it tests C and O.

Let me verify SCORE:
- S in 1st (✓ matches)
- C in 2nd (new)
- O in 3rd (new)

- R in 5th (✓ matches)

This is valid and gives maximal new information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 distinct letters
2. Include common vowels and consonants
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z initially

Popular choices for first guesses include words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for potential letters in the secret word.

- R: is in the word but not in the 1st position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
- E: is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So the secret word:
1. Contains R somewhere other than position 1
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Contains E somewhere other than position 5
4. Does NOT contain A or I
5. Is 5 letters long

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5  
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4  

We need to choose a new word that:
- Uses R in a different position (not 1st)
- Uses S in a different position (not 4th)
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th)
- Does not use A or I
- Uses common letters for maximum information

Good candidates: STONE (but S would be 1st, which is allowed), ""STORE"", ""TREES"", ""SURE"", ""SORE""  
I'll pick ""STORE"" - it places S in 1st (allowed), T new letter, O new letter, R in 3rd (allowed), E in 5th (but E must not be 5th - invalid).  

Next choice: ""TREES"" - T new, R in 2nd (allowed), E in 3rd (allowed), E again, S in 5th (allowed). This covers multiple positions efficiently.

(Note: Actually, from RAISE feedback, E cannot be in 5th, so TREES is okay since E is in 3rd here. S is in 5th which is allowed.)

2. Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, I, T  

3. Still-unknown slots: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but position 4 is E).

4. Possible positions:

   - S: 1, 2, 3  
   - The other E: 1 or 2 (only remaining possibilities)

5. We also have no information yet about letters like N, L, O, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
- lock E in 4th place
- try R in 3rd or 5th
- try S in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- introduce 1–2 fresh common consonants to gain more information.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- S _ E _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S E _ _  (S in 2nd)
- _ _ E _ R  (R in 5th)
- etc.

One high-information word is “SNEER”:
- S (1st) – tests S in 1st
- N (new letter)
- E (3rd) – tests if the 2nd E can go here (but we already know E is 4th ✓, so this is fine)
- E (4th) – already locked
- R (5th) – tests R in 5th

This placement respects all known constraints:
- S is allowed in 1st
- R is allowed in 5th
- E is in 4th
- Avoids A, I, T
- Adds N as a new probe letter.

Therefore, SNEER is a strong third guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,sewer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 distinct letters
2. Include common vowels and consonants
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z initially

Popular choices for first guesses include words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for potential letters in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: is in the word but not in the 1st position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: is in the word but not in the 4th position (-)
- E: is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So the secret word:
1. Contains R somewhere other than position 1
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4
3. Contains E somewhere other than position 5
4. Does NOT contain A or I
5. Is 5 letters long

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5  
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4  

We need to choose a new word that:
- Uses R in a different position (not 1st)
- Uses S in a different position (not 4th)
- Uses E in a different position (not 5th)
- Does not use A or I
- Uses common letters for maximum information

Good candidates: STONE (but S would be 1st, which is allowed), ""STORE"", ""TREES"", ""SURE"", ""SORE""  
I'll pick ""STORE"" - it places S in 1st (allowed), T new letter, O new letter, R in 3rd (allowed), E in 5th (but E must not be 5th - invalid).  

Next choice: ""TREES"" - T new, R in 2nd (allowed), E in 3rd (allowed), E again, S in 5th (allowed). This covers multiple positions efficiently.

(Note: Actually, from RAISE feedback, E cannot be in 5th, so TREES is okay since E is in 3rd here. S is in 5th which is allowed.)

<guess>TREES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TREES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. Letters we KNOW are in the word: R, S, E  
   - R ≠ 1st and R ≠ 2nd (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - S ≠ 4th and S ≠ 5th (from RAISE and TREES)  
   - E is in the word; the 4th position is confirmed correct (✓)  
   - E also appears somewhere else (from RAISE) and that somewhere else is NOT 3rd or 5th; so the other E must be in 1st or 2nd.  

2. Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: A, I, T  

3. Still-unknown slots: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but position 4 is E).

4. Possible positions:  
   - R: 3, 4 (but 4 is already E), 5 → so R must be 3rd or 5th.  
   - S: 1, 2, 3  
   - The other E: 1 or 2 (only remaining possibilities)

5. We also have no information yet about letters like N, L, O, D, etc.

A good next guess should:
- lock E in 4th place
- try R in 3rd or 5th
- try S in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- introduce 1–2 fresh common consonants to gain more information.

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- S _ E _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S E _ _  (S in 2nd)
- _ _ E _ R  (R in 5th)
- etc.

One high-information word is “SNEER”:
- S (1st) – tests S in 1st
- N (new letter)
- E (3rd) – tests if the 2nd E can go here (but we already know E is 4th ✓, so this is fine)
- E (4th) – already locked
- R (5th) – tests R in 5th

This placement respects all known constraints:
- S is allowed in 1st
- R is allowed in 5th
- E is in 4th
- Avoids A, I, T
- Adds N as a new probe letter.

Therefore, SNEER is a strong third guess.

Guess 2: TREES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: SNEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word and their certain positions:
- S must be in position 1 (✓ from SNEER)
- E must be in position 4 (✓ from both TREES and SNEER)
- R must be in position 5 (✓ from SNEER)

So the pattern is: S _ _ E R

Letters we know are NOT in the word (due to x feedback):
A, I, T, N

Remaining available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, W, Y

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with two different letters from the available set.

Good consonant-vowel combinations that make real 5-letter words:
- Position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, W
- Position 3: Same set, but must form a valid word

Looking for common English words fitting S _ _ E R:
- S P E E R (invalid, E already in 4)
- S H E E R (invalid, E already in 4)
- S C E N T (invalid, N is disallowed)
- S W E E T (invalid, T is disallowed)
- S C E P T (invalid)
- S C E N E (invalid)
- S L E E R (invalid)
- S C E N T (invalid)
- S C E P T (invalid)

Looking more carefully:
- S C O R E (fits pattern S _ _ E R, but O and C are allowed)
- S C O R E: S(✓), C(new), O(new), E(✓), R(✓)
This is a valid word and tests C and O in positions 2 and 3.

Other possibilities:
- S M E L R (not a word)
- S P I R E (I is disallowed)
- S H O R E (fits)
- S C O R E vs S H O R E

Between SCORE and SHORE, both fit perfectly, but let's choose one. SCORE is a good choice as it tests C and O.

Let me verify SCORE:
- S in 1st (✓ matches)
- C in 2nd (new)
- O in 3rd (new)
- E in 4th (✓ matches)
- R in 5th (✓ matches)

This is valid and gives maximal new information.

After five guesses we have the following locked-in information:

- Exact pattern: S _ _ E R
- Letters proven absent (x-marked in any position): A, I, T, N, C, O, U, P
- Remaining candidate letters for positions 2 and 3 (all unused, common English letters): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, Y

We need a 5-letter English word of the form S _ _ E R using only those nine remaining letters for the two blanks.

Quick scan of the dictionary:
- S B _ E R → no common word
- S _ _ E R with remaining letters
- S H E E R → second E is already fixed in position 4, invalid
- S L E E R → same issue
- S H _ E R
- S M _ E R
- S G _ E R
- S W E E R → same issue
- S M _ E R
- S H _ E R

Real words that fit:
- SMELR – invalid (not a word)
- SUGER – invalid (U is banned)
- SWEER – invalid (second E)
- SAGER – invalid (A is banned)
- SUGAR – invalid
- SUGER – invalid
- SUGER – invalid
- SUGER – invalid

Looking further: the only remaining valid word is S + H + M (or other combinations)

Wait - actually: S H E E R is invalid, but S H _ E R with H and another valid consonant.

Looking at S H _ E R:
- S H O R E – O is banned
- S H A R E – A is banned
- S H I R E – I is banned
- S H U R E – U is banned
- S H E R D – no
- S H E R M – no

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, Y

The valid word is S H _ E R with H and another letter.

Looking at S + H + M + E + R → S H M E R – not a word
S + H + B + E + R → S H B E R – not a word
S + H + G + E + R → S H G E R – not a word
S + H + L + E + R → S H L E R – not a word
S + H + W + E + R → S H W E R – not a word
S + H + Y + E + R → S H Y E R – not a word
S + H + D + E + R → S H D E R – not a word
S + H + F + E + R → S H F E R – not a word

Wait, looking at dictionary:
S H _ E R: only valid remaining is S H E E R which is invalid due to double E.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, Y

Looking for S _ _ E R:
- S W E E R – invalid
- S M E E R – invalid
- S L E E R – invalid
- S M E E R – invalid
- S B E E R – invalid
- S D E E R – invalid
- S G E E R – invalid
- S F E E R – invalid
- S W E E R – invalid
- S Y E E R – invalid

Wait, but we have S _ _ E R and we need two letters for positions 2 and 3.

Looking again at remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, Y

Looking at S _ _ E R:
- S H + letter: S H _ E R → S H B E R, S H D E R, S H F E R, S H G E R, S H L E R, S H M E R, S H W E R, S H Y E R
- checking these, none are valid words.

Looking at S _ _ E R with remaining letters: the only valid word is S H E E R which is invalid due to second E.

Looking at S _ _ E R with remaining letters: this is a problem. There are no valid English words remaining with this pattern and these letters.

Wait, let me re-examine the banned letters and remaining letters.

Banned letters: A, I, T, N, C, O, U, P

Remaining: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, Y

Looking at S _ _ E R:
- S H _ E R → checking S H O R E, S H A R E, S H I R E, S H U R E – all have banned letters
- S _ _ E R → actually the correct word is S H E E R but that's invalid.

Wait, looking back at the dictionary: S H _ E R with valid remaining letters:
