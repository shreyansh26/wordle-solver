For the first guess, the goal is to gather maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that cover a wide range of frequently used English letters. The word should include vowels and common consonants to test their presence and positions.

A commonly recommended starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination tests for the presence and positions of these high-frequency letters, providing valuable feedback for narrowing down subsequent guesses.

We now know:

- Pattern so far: D R A _ _
- N is definitely in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5 (because in both CRANE and DRANK it came back “-”).
- Therefore N must sit in position 1, 2, or 3.  
  – Position 1 is already D.  
  – Position 2 is R.  
  – Position 3 is A.  
  So N cannot be placed any further left; the only remaining possibility is that N is in position 1, but position 1 is already D. This contradiction means our earlier assumption about placement must be re-checked.

Wait: actually, the feedback “N(-)” in both guesses only says “in the word but wrong position.” In DRANK N was in position 4, so we merely know N ≠ 4. Nothing has ruled out N in position 5 yet. But in DRANK, K in position 5 was marked “x,” so K is out, but N could still be elsewhere. We just have to make sure N is not in position 4. (It already isn’t in DRANK.)

- 1st letter: D (✓)
- 2nd letter: R (✓)
- 3rd letter: A (✓)
- 4th letter: not N
- 5th letter: unknown, but K is out

So word shape: D R A _ _

And N must appear in the word, but not in position 4. The only remaining open positions are 1,4,5. Position 1 is D, so N must be in position 5. Thus the word must end in N.

This contradiction means our earlier assumption about placement must be re-checked.\n\nWait: actually, the feedback “N(-)” in both guesses only says “in the word but wrong position.” In DRANK N was in position 4, so we merely know N ≠ 4. Nothing has ruled out N in position 5 yet. But in DRANK, K in position 5 was marked “x,” so K is out, but N could still be elsewhere. We just have to make sure N is not in position 4.

We simply need a consonant that:

Common consonants left: B, F, G, L, M, P, S, T, V, Y, Z.

Scanning dictionary or memory for DRA_N:
