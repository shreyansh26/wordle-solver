For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in strategic positions to maximize information gain. The best approach is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I want to use as many of these as possible in my first guess. 

Good options might be:
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E (all high frequency letters)
- ""CRANE"" - C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters and has good positional variety.

- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word starts with S
- The word contains T somewhere (but not in the 4th position)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E

Consonants not yet eliminated: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels not yet used/eliminated: I, O, U

Given that we have S and T, and need a 5-letter word, I want to try common letters in the remaining positions. Since we have no vowels confirmed, and E and A are out, possible vowels now are I, O, U.

The T must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5. I'll try placing T in position 2 to test that. For the remaining positions, I'll use common consonants and vowels that haven't been eliminated.

Good candidates:
- STING (S, T, I, N, G)
- STONE (but E is out)
- STINT (but T is already confirmed)
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- STUNK (U is a possible vowel)

I'll go with STING as it uses common letters I and N, and G is also relatively common.

We have the pattern S T I N _ confirmed, and the last letter is not G or K.  
Valid 5-letter English words that start with STIN are:
- STING (G ruled out)
- STINK (K ruled out)
- STINT (T is already in position 2, so the last letter T would repeat, which is allowed)

Since G and K are eliminated, the remaining obvious choice is STINT.
