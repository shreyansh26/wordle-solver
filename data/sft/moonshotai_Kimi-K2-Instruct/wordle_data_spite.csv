For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. A good starting word typically includes vowels and frequently used consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

Another popular option is ""SLATE"" which covers similar ground. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess since it has a good mix of common letters and can help quickly identify or eliminate many possibilities.

So far we know:
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, N.  
- It DOES contain the letter E, and it is in the 5th position.

To narrow down quickly, I want a word that:
1. Has E in position 5 (already locked in).
2. Avoids C, R, A, N entirely.
3. Uses other very common letters to maximize information.

A good second-guess word that satisfies these rules is “MOTHE”:
- M, O, T, H are all high-frequency letters not yet eliminated.

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

   – Confirms E is the 5th letter.

2. MOTHE → M(x) O(x) T(-) H(x) E(✓)  
   – Eliminates M, O, H entirely.  
   – Confirms T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so T must be in 1, 2, or 4).

Remaining possible letters:  
- Vowels left: E (fixed in 5), I, U  
- Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y, Z (but we already know T is somewhere)

We need a 5-letter word:
- Ends with E  
- Contains T somewhere other than position 3  
- Uses none of C, R, A, N, M, O, H, or any previously-eliminated letters.

A good candidate that fits all constraints is “STILE”:
- S: new consonant  
- T: must be in the word (confirmed) and is now in position 2  
- I: new vowel

   – Confirms E is in position 5.

2. MOTHE → M(x) O(x) T(-) H(x) E(✓)  
   – Eliminates M, O, H.  
   – Confirms T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so T must be in 2 or 4).

3. STILE → S(✓) T(-) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)  
   – Confirms S is in position 1.  
   – Confirms I is in position 3.  
   – Confirms E is in position 5.  
   – Eliminates L.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because STILE shows T(-) for position 2).  
     Therefore, T must be in position 4.

So the pattern now is:
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: ? (cannot be C, R, A, N, M, O, H, L, T, E, S, I)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: E  

Letters still allowed for position 2: B, D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Y, Z, etc.  
We need a 5-letter English word that fits S _ I T E.

Possible words: SKITE (British slang, unlikely), SPITE, SUITE.  
""SPITE"" is a common word. Let's check constraints:
- S(1), P(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) – no eliminated letters.  
""SUITE"" is also valid but slightly less common.  
""SPITE"" seems the better choice here.

<guess>SPITE</guess>",SPITE,"From the three guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
   – Eliminates C, R, A, N.  
   – Confirms E is in position 5.

2. MOTHE → M(x) O(x) T(-) H(x) E(✓)  
   – Eliminates M, O, H.  
   – Confirms T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (so T must be in 2 or 4).

3. STILE → S(✓) T(-) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)  
   – Confirms S is in position 1.  
   – Confirms I is in position 3.  
   – Confirms E is in position 5.  
   – Eliminates L.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because STILE shows T(-) for position 2).  
     Therefore, T must be in position 4.

So the pattern now is:
- Position 1: S  
- Position 2: ? (cannot be C, R, A, N, M, O, H, L, T, E, S, I)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: E
