For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants like S, T, N, R, L
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

The word ""AROSE"" is a classic strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me coverage of 5 different common letters across 3 vowels and 2 consonants, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (shown by “-” in the first spot).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word (shown by “x”).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (shown by “-” in the fourth spot).

Therefore the secret word:
- Contains A and S.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E.
- A is NOT in position 1.
- S is NOT in position 4.

Next move: choose a word that:
- Uses A and S in new positions.
- Avoids R, O, E entirely.
- Introduces new, high-frequency consonants and vowels.

Good next candidates include:
- STAIN – uses S, A, and common letters T, I, N, but S is still in spot 1 which we haven’t ruled out yet.
- SLANT – same issue with S in spot 1.
- SNAIL – again S in spot 1.
- TASER – contains E which is ruled out.
- SAINT – S in spot 1 is acceptable because we don’t know the word doesn’t start with S.

SAINT meets all constraints:
- Uses S (moved to spot 1, which is still allowed).
- Uses A (moved to spot 2).
- Avoids R, O, E.
- Introduces I, N, T which are high-frequency letters.

Therefore, SAINT is a solid second guess.

- SCAMP – C, M, P allowed.
- SCUBA – as above, but A is already in position 2.
- SCUFF – F, F allowed if duplicates are possible.
- SHACK – H, C, K allowed.
- SHALM – H, L, M allowed (but SHALM is obscure).
- SHARK – K allowed, but R is ruled out.
- SMALL – L, L allowed.
- SPASM – P, S, M allowed, but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if S repeats.

- STACK – C, K allowed, but T is ruled out.
- STAFF – F, F allowed, but T is ruled out.
- SWAMP – W, M, P allowed.
- SWASH – W, S, H allowed, but S repeats.

Remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must use letters from: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and U is the only remaining vowel).

Let’s think of common words fitting this pattern:
- SCUBA – but contains U (position 4) and B (position 3). However, C is allowed and B is allowed. But we already have A in position 2, so SCUBA would be S C U B A – but position 5 would be A, which is already in position 2. This might violate the ""no repeated letters"" rule if the secret word has no duplicates.
- SAGGY – G is allowed, Y is allowed, but double G might not fit.
- SALAD – D is allowed, but double A might not fit.
- SAPPY – P, Y allowed.
- SCAMP – C, M, P allowed.
- SCUBA – as above, but A is already in position 2.
- SCUFF – F, F allowed if duplicates are possible.
- SHACK – H, C, K allowed.
- SHALM – H, L, M allowed (but SHALM is obscure).
- SHARK – K allowed, but R is ruled out.
- SMALL – L, L allowed.
- SPASM – P, S, M allowed, but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know if S repeats.
- SPUDS – P, U, D, S allowed, but S repeats.
- STACK – C, K allowed, but T is ruled out.
- STAFF – F, F allowed, but T is ruled out.
- SWAMP – W, M, P allowed.
- SWASH – W, S, H allowed, but S repeats.

The most straightforward word seems to be ""SMALL"":
- S(✓) A(✓) L L M.
- L and M are allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.
- No duplicates of already confirmed letters (S and A are single instances).

Let’s go with SMALL as the next guess.

So far we have:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: A ✓ in SAINT, but in SMALL it’s in position 3 and marked “-”, which means A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  Therefore A must be in position 2 (confirmed by SAINT) and the “-” in SMALL simply reconfirms it is not in position 3 (no new info).
- Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T, M, L.
- Remaining candidate letters (besides S, A already locked in positions 1-2):
  Vowels left: U  
  Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need _ _ _ _ _ with:
S A _ _ _

So we need three more characters from the allowed set.  
Common high-frequency consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W  
And the only remaining vowel U.

Likely consonant clusters for positions 3-5:
- B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P plus U.

Quick scan:
- S A B E D – E is out.
- S A C H E – E is out.
- S A U C Y – Y allowed, C allowed.  SAUCY uses only allowed letters and no repeats.
- S A U D A – D allowed, but double A would be unusual and we have no evidence of duplicates yet.
- S A U G E – E out.
- S A U G Y – G, Y allowed.
- S A U N T – N, T already out.
- S A U C E – E out.
- S A U C Y looks clean.
