A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should help determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) – A exists in the word but is not in position 1.

O(x) – O is not in the word at all.  
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  
E(-) – E exists in the word but is not in position 5.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains A and E (but not O, R, or S).
- A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

Remaining letters to try should avoid R, O, S; we already know A and E are present. Common consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess would place A and E in different positions while testing other common consonants. A candidate is “TABLE”.

Check positions:
- T: new consonant in position 1.
- A: moved to position 2.
- B: new consonant in position 3.
- L: new consonant in position 4.
- E: moved to position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this is invalid).

Oops: E can’t be in position 5. Let’s adjust.

Next good candidate is “EARTH” but R is excluded. Avoid R and S.

Candidate: “PEACH” – but C and H not yet tested, positions: P E A C H.

A is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed). This tests P, C, H.

Another candidate: “MEANT” – M, E, A, N, T.

So far we know:

Letters that are in the word: A, E, T  
Letters that are not in the word: R, O, S, M, N  
Positions we’ve ruled out:
- A is not in positions 1 or 3  
- E is not in positions 2 or 5  
- T is in position 5 (✓)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E (each exactly once).
2. Uses T only in position 5.
3. Does NOT contain R, O, S, M, N.
4. Must avoid positions 1 & 3 for A, and positions 2 & 5 for E.

Let’s choose a word that meets these constraints. A quick mental scan:

- T is locked in position 5, so word ends in T.
- A cannot be 1 or 3, so A must be 2 or 4.
- E cannot be 2 or 5, so E must be 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 might be taken by A).
- Available consonants (besides T): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try placing A in position 4 and E in position 1:

structure: E _ _ A T

Pick middle consonants from remaining set – e.g., B and L → E B L A T → “EBLAT” – not valid.  
Next, valid word with E _ _ A T: “EXACT” uses X, C – but C is allowed (not R, O, S, M, N). That works:
E X A C T  
Positions:  
E in 1 – allowed  
X – new consonant  
A in 3 – but feedback already says A is not in position 3. So “EXACT” fails because A would be in position 3.

Try A in position 2 and E in position 3: _ A E _ T  
Need two consonants. Valid word: “CADET”  
C A D E T  
Check constraints:
- C, D not ruled out  
- A in position 2 – allowed  
- E in position 4 – allowed  
- T in 5 – correct  
- Contains no forbidden letters  
“CADET” satisfies everything.

Another check: is “CADET” a valid 5-letter English word? Yes.

Therefore, the next guess is “CADET”.

X – new consonant  
A in 3 – but feedback already says A is not in position 3. So “EXACT” fails because A would be in position 3.

Try A in position 2 and E in position 3: _ A E _ T  
Need two consonants. Valid word: “CADET”  
C A D E T  
Check constraints:
- C, D not ruled out  
- A in position 2 – allowed  
- E in position 4 – allowed  
- T in 5 – correct  
- Contains no forbidden letters  
“CADET” satisfies everything.

Another check: is “CADET” a valid 5-letter English word? Yes.

Therefore, the next guess is “CADET”.

From the new feedback on CADET:

C(-) – C is in the word but in the wrong position (so C is NOT in position 1).  
A(✓) – A is correctly placed in position 2.  
D(x) – D is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is correctly placed in position 4.  
T(✓) – T is correctly placed in position 5.

So far we have:

Pos 1: ?  
Pos 2: A (locked)  
Pos 3: ?  
Pos 4: E (locked)  
Pos 5: T (locked)

Letters known to be in the word: A, C, E, T  
Letters eliminated: R, O, S, M, N, D  
C must be in position 3 (only remaining empty slot).  

Therefore the word must be: C A C E T, but that’s invalid (repeats C and no 5-letter word CACET). Hence, my assumption was wrong.

Wait: the word has 5 distinct letters. We have only 4 distinct letters known so far (A, C, E, T). The missing position 3 must be a new letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Known letters: A(2), E(4), T(5) must be in the word. C is in the word but not in position 1, so C must be in position 3.

So structure: _ A C E T

Only valid 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is “FACET”.

Check constraints:
- F is not yet ruled out (not in any previous guess).  
- All other letters fit feedback perfectly.

Therefore, “FACET” is the logical next guess.
