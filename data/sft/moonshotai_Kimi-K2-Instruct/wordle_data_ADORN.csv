For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and covers a wide range of vowels and consonants. Common letters in 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. 

Let's choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- All five distinct letters
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)) we know:
1. The word has the pattern A _ O _ _.
2. The letter R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
3. The letters S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the current template is: A _ O _ _  (with R somewhere else in the word).

Common 5-letter words that fit A _ O _ _ and still have an R elsewhere include:
- A B O R T  → places R in position 4 (allowed)
- A C O R N  → places R in position 4 (allowed)
- A D O R N  → places R in position 4 (allowed)
- A F O R E  → contains E (forbidden)
- A G O R A  → ends in A (possible)
- A M O R A  → ends in A (possible)

Among these, ""ABORT"" is a good next guess because:
- It places R in position 4 (allowed by the feedback)
- It introduces new letters B and T which haven’t been tested yet.
- It fits the pattern A _ O _ _.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

  – O is in position 3 ✓  
  – R is in position 4 ✓  

- Letters already ruled out:
  – B, S, E, T are all absent (“x”).

We need a 5-letter word that fits A _ O R _ and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y…

Scanning the A _ O R _ pattern, the only common English 5-letter words are:
- A C O R N
- A F O R D
- A H O R T (obsolete)
- A L O R A (rare)
- A M O R A (rare)

Among these, “ACORN” and “AFORD” (more usually spelled “AFFORD”) are the most recognizable, but “AFORD” has two F’s and isn’t a standard 5-letter form. “ACORN” is perfect: common, 5 letters, uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Current confirmed information:

1. Pattern: A _ O R N   (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 locked)
2. Letters ruled out so far: B, C, E, S, T
3. We still need a 5-letter English word that fits A _ O R N.

The only possible word that matches this exact pattern is “A G O R N,” but that isn’t a valid English word. Scanning the pattern A _ O R N letter-by-letter:

- Position 2 can be any letter except B, C, E, S, T (and obviously not A, O, R, N, which are already placed).

Valid English words that fit A ? O R N:
- A B O R N – B is ruled out (x)
- A C O R N – C is ruled out (x)
- A D O R N – D has not been tested.
- A F O R N – Not a word.
- A G O R N – Not a word.
- A H O R N – Not a word.
- A J O R N – Not a word.
- A L O R N – Not a word.
- A M O R N – Not a word.
- A P O R N – Not a word.
- A Q O R N – Not a word.
- A V O R N – Not a word.
- A W O R N – Not a word.
- A Y O R N – Not a word.

The only remaining valid candidate is “ADORN,” and the letter D has never appeared in any previous guess, so it has not been ruled out.

Therefore the logical next guess is ADORN.
