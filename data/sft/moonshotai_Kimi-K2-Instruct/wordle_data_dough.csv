- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O somewhere except position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Because O is the only confirmed letter, I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O in a different position (not 3).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., T, N, I, L, U, C, D, etc.).

A good mix of remaining common consonants and vowels is “UNION”:
- U, N, I, O are all still possible.
- O appears in position 4 (safe; not position 3).
- No forbidden letters (A,R,S,E) are used.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are completely out:
A, R, S, E, U, N, I

Letters that are in the word:
- O (but it is not in position 3 or 4)

Remaining consonants we have not tried include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels we have not tried include: none except O (A, E, I, U are all ruled out).

So every vowel except O is ruled out. That means the word must contain O exactly once (since English 5-letter words rarely have two O’s unless they are OO), and O must sit in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses O in a new position (positions 1 or 2 or 5)
- avoids all already-eliminated letters (A R S E U N I)
- contains other common remaining consonants.

A good candidate is “BLOCK”.

Check:
- B, L, C, K have not been tested yet.
- O is in position 2 (new spot).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, “BLOCK” is a strong next guess.
