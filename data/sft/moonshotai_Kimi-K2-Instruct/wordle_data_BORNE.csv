For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers different positions. Classic strategies include using words with many vowels and common consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- ARISE
- AUDIO

""CRANE"" is often recommended because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is in the correct 5th position (✓).

- R is somewhere in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters C and A are not in the word at all.

To maximize information, we want to test new letters while placing R somewhere else and keeping N and E fixed. Good consonants to try next include S, T, L, D, M, B, etc.

Let’s summarize everything we know so far.

Positions 4 and 5:
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

Letters ruled out:
C, A, U, D (from CRANE and UNDER).

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from CRANE and UNDER feedback).  
  Therefore R MUST be in position 1.

So the pattern so far is:
R _ _ N E

We now need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 that have not been tested yet and are common. Good candidates include S, T, L, M, B, K, I, O, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits R _ _ N E and uses common untested letters.  
“RIVER” – already has R and V, but V is less common.  
“RINSE” – uses I, S. Both I and S are common and untested.  
“RINSE” fits perfectly: R (1), I (2), N (3), S (4), E (5).  
But wait, position 4 must be N, so RINSE would have N in position 3, which conflicts. We need _ _ N E, with N in 4th.

Thus positions are fixed: 1=R, 4=N, 5=E. So the form is R _ _ N E.

Need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s pick common consonants: S, T, L, M, K.

“R S T N E” – no valid word.  
“R A S N E” – A is ruled out.  
“R I S N E” – no.  
“R I P E N” – no, 4th is N but 5th must be E.  
“R I S N E” – not a word.

Actually, we need a valid word of the form R _ _ N E. Possible candidates:
- RIVEN (V is less common)
- RISEN (S and I are common, untested)
- RIFEN (invalid)
- RIXEN (invalid)

“RISEN” is a valid word, uses I and S (both untested), and fits the pattern R I S N E.

Thus, the next guess should be “RISEN”.

Let’s re-examine the accumulated knowledge:

1. Position facts  
   • 4th letter = N (✓ from CRANE)  
   • 5th letter = E (✓ from CRANE)

2. Letters that are in the word but whose exact spots are still unknown  
   • R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (feedback for CRANE, UNDER, RISEN shows R as “-” every time, meaning it’s in the word but never in the tested spot).  
     – Positions already tested for R: 2 (CRANE), 3 (UNDER), 1 (RISEN).  
     – The only remaining untested position is position 3.  
     – Therefore R must sit in position 3.

   So the pattern so far: _ _ R N E.

3. Letters definitely absent from the whole word  
   C, A, U, D, I, S (all gave “x” at least once).

4. Needed: two new letters for positions 1 and 2, avoiding the banned set.

Common consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y …  
Common vowels left: O (only O hasn’t been tried in any position).

Let’s pick a valid English word of the shape _ _ R N E that uses only still-allowed letters.  
Some possibilities:  
– BORNE  
– MORNE (archaic)  
– GORNE (not a word)  
– HORNE (proper noun)  
– TORNE (not a word)  
– LORNE (proper noun)

The only solid candidate that is an ordinary English word is BORNE.

It uses:  
B (new, allowed)  
O (new, allowed)  
R (must be in 3rd)  
N (fixed)  
E (fixed)

No conflicts with any prior feedback.

Hence BORNE is the best next guess.
