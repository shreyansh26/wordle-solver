For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me efficiently check for multiple common vowels and consonants in the secret word.

Current facts:

1. Letters NOT in the word (from arose): A, R, O, S, E  
2. Letters IN the word but not yet in the correct position (from unity):  
   - U is in the word, but position 1 is wrong.  
   - N is in the word, but position 2 is wrong.  
3. Letters NOT in the word (from unity): I, T, Y  

Therefore the secret word must:
- Contain U and N somewhere.  
- NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested: D, L, C, H, G, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Z, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tested left: none except possibly the letter U again.

Since U and N must both appear, and positions 1 and 2 for them are ruled out, let’s look for a word that:
- Has U and N,  
- Uses new letters from the untested pool,  
- Keeps U and N in new spots.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is “FUNGI”.  
- F, G, new letters.  
- U, N already known to be in word.  
- Plausible arrangement.

However, let me quickly double-check the constraints:
- Contains U and N.  
- Excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  
- Uses F, U, N, G, (oops, I already used G) – wait, no, G is fine because it’s new.  
But “fungi” contains the letter I, and feedback on unity shows I is NOT in the word. So “fungi” is invalid.

Need a word with U, N only, and none of the banned letters.

Another candidate: “LUNCH” – but C and H are new, but H and C are fine; however, L, U, N, C, H — but C and H haven’t been ruled out. But “lunch” contains U in position 2, N in position 3, C and H new. That’s allowed because position 2 is not necessarily wrong for U, we just know position 1 is wrong for U. Actually, the feedback for unity said U is in the word but not in position 1. Position 2 could still be correct.

But the word must be five letters with U and N somewhere, avoiding A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.

A valid word: “UNCLE” – no, contains E, which is banned.

“FUNKY” – contains Y, which is banned.

“BLUNT” – contains T, which is banned.

“DUNCE” – contains E, banned.

“UNDID” – contains I and D, but I is banned.

“NUDGE” – contains E.

“UPEND” – contains E and P, but E is banned.

“GULCH” – contains U and new letters G, L, C, H. Does it contain N? No, it doesn’t have N, so invalid.

“BUNNY” – contains Y, banned.

“MUNCH” – contains C, H, U, N, M. M is new. This satisfies: contains U, N; excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

So “MUNCH” is a valid choice.

Another candidate: “PUNCH” – same, but doesn’t use new letters as broadly. “MUNCH” uses M and H and C, all new.

So I will go with MUNCH.

- D U N C H  → “dunch” (rare/obscure)
- F U N C H  → no common word
- G U N C H  → no common word
- L U N C H  → “lunch” (common word)
- P U N C H  → “punch” (but M was already tried in “munch”, and P hasn’t been tried)
So possible candidates: “bunch”, “lunch”, “punch”

All three are valid. I’ll pick one that hasn’t been used yet. “Punch” shares three letters with “munch”, but “P” is a new letter. However, “lunch” uses “L” which is also new. Any of these is fine, but “lunch” seems slightly more neutral.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me efficiently check for multiple common vowels and consonants in the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “arose” were marked “x,” so none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
To maximize new information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters—preferably high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried.  
Good candidates from the remaining common letters include U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced choice that covers several new common letters is:
U N I T Y  
– U, N, I, T, Y have not been tested yet and are all frequent in English five-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) I(x) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:

1. Letters NOT in the word (from arose): A, R, O, S, E  
2. Letters IN the word but not yet in the correct position (from unity):  
   - U is in the word, but position 1 is wrong.  
   - N is in the word, but position 2 is wrong.  
3. Letters NOT in the word (from unity): I, T, Y  

Therefore the secret word must:
- Contain U and N somewhere.  
- NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested: D, L, C, H, G, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Z, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tested left: none except possibly the letter U again.

Since U and N must both appear, and positions 1 and 2 for them are ruled out, let’s look for a word that:
- Has U and N,  
- Uses new letters from the untested pool,  
- Keeps U and N in new spots.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is “FUNGI”.  
- F, G, new letters.  
- U, N already known to be in word.  
- Plausible arrangement.

However, let me quickly double-check the constraints:
- Contains U and N.  
- Excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  
- Uses F, U, N, G, (oops, I already used G) – wait, no, G is fine because it’s new.  
But “fungi” contains the letter I, and feedback on unity shows I is NOT in the word. So “fungi” is invalid.

Need a word with U, N only, and none of the banned letters.

Another candidate: “LUNCH” – but C and H are new, but H and C are fine; however, L, U, N, C, H — but C and H haven’t been ruled out. But “lunch” contains U in position 2, N in position 3, C and H new. That’s allowed because position 2 is not necessarily wrong for U, we just know position 1 is wrong for U. Actually, the feedback for unity said U is in the word but not in position 1. Position 2 could still be correct.

But the word must be five letters with U and N somewhere, avoiding A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.

A valid word: “UNCLE” – no, contains E, which is banned.

“FUNKY” – contains Y, which is banned.

“BLUNT” – contains T, which is banned.

“DUNCE” – contains E, banned.

“UNDID” – contains I and D, but I is banned.

“NUDGE” – contains E.

“UPEND” – contains E and P, but E is banned.

“GULCH” – contains U and new letters G, L, C, H. Does it contain N? No, it doesn’t have N, so invalid.

“BUNNY” – contains Y, banned.

“MUNCH” – contains C, H, U, N, M. M is new. This satisfies: contains U, N; excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

So “MUNCH” is a valid choice.

Another candidate: “PUNCH” – same, but doesn’t use new letters as broadly. “MUNCH” uses M and H and C, all new.

So I will go with MUNCH.

- Position 1 is NOT any of the letters we have tried:  
  – From guess 1: A, R, O, S, E are out  
  – From guess 2: U, N, I, T, Y are out (but U and N already placed)  
  – From guess 3: M is out  
  – From guess 4: L is out  

So the first letter must be one of:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

Looking for common English 5-letter words of the form “_UNCH”:

- B U N C H → “bunch”  
- D U N C H → “dunch” (obscure)  
- G U N C H → “gunch” (slang)  
- P U N C H → “punch”  

Among these, “bunch” and “punch” are the most common.  
“Punch” hasn’t had its first letter P tested yet, but “bunch” with B also hasn’t been tried. Either is valid.

I’ll choose “bunch” because B is earlier in the alphabet and often appears in such words.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will help me efficiently check for multiple common vowels and consonants in the secret word.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “arose” were marked “x,” so none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
To maximize new information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters—preferably high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tried.  
Good candidates from the remaining common letters include U, I, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced choice that covers several new common letters is:
U N I T Y  
– U, N, I, T, Y have not been tested yet and are all frequent in English five-letter words.

<guess>unity</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) I(x) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:

1. Letters NOT in the word (from arose): A, R, O, S, E  
2. Letters IN the word but not yet in the correct position (from unity):  
   - U is in the word, but position 1 is wrong.  
   - N is in the word, but position 2 is wrong.  
3. Letters NOT in the word (from unity): I, T, Y  

Therefore the secret word must:
- Contain U and N somewhere.  
- NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested: D, L, C, H, G, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Z, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tested left: none except possibly the letter U again.

Since U and N must both appear, and positions 1 and 2 for them are ruled out, let’s look for a word that:
- Has U and N,  
- Uses new letters from the untested pool,  
- Keeps U and N in new spots.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is “FUNGI”.  
- F, G, new letters.  
- U, N already known to be in word.  
- Plausible arrangement.

However, let me quickly double-check the constraints:
- Contains U and N.  
- Excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  
- Uses F, U, N, G, (oops, I already used G) – wait, no, G is fine because it’s new.  
But “fungi” contains the letter I, and feedback on unity shows I is NOT in the word. So “fungi” is invalid.

Need a word with U, N only, and none of the banned letters.

Another candidate: “LUNCH” – but C and H are new, but H and C are fine; however, L, U, N, C, H — but C and H haven’t been ruled out. But “lunch” contains U in position 2, N in position 3, C and H new. That’s allowed because position 2 is not necessarily wrong for U, we just know position 1 is wrong for U. Actually, the feedback for unity said U is in the word but not in position 1. Position 2 could still be correct.

But the word must be five letters with U and N somewhere, avoiding A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.

A valid word: “UNCLE” – no, contains E, which is banned.

“FUNKY” – contains Y, which is banned.

“BLUNT” – contains T, which is banned.

“DUNCE” – contains E, banned.

“UNDID” – contains I and D, but I is banned.

“NUDGE” – contains E.

“UPEND” – contains E and P, but E is banned.

“GULCH” – contains U and new letters G, L, C, H. Does it contain N? No, it doesn’t have N, so invalid.

“BUNNY” – contains Y, banned.

“MUNCH” – contains C, H, U, N, M. M is new. This satisfies: contains U, N; excludes A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y.  

So “MUNCH” is a valid choice.

Another candidate: “PUNCH” – same, but doesn’t use new letters as broadly. “MUNCH” uses M and H and C, all new.

So I will go with MUNCH.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on guess 3, we now know:

- Position 2 is U ✓
- Position 3 is N ✓
- Position 4 is C ✓
- Position 5 is H ✓
- The only unknown is position 1

Letters used so far:  
Known to be absent: A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y, M  
Known to be present: U, N, C, H in the exact positions shown above

So the word pattern is:  
_ U N C H

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is U, third N, fourth C, fifth H, and first letter is any letter not yet ruled out.

The remaining letters available for position 1 (not yet excluded) are:
B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit “_UNCH”:

- B U N C H  → “bunch” (common word)
- D U N C H  → “dunch” (rare/obscure)
- F U N C H  → no common word
- G U N C H  → no common word
- L U N C H  → “lunch” (common word)
- P U N C H  → “punch” (but M was already tried in “munch”, and P hasn’t been tried)
So possible candidates: “bunch”, “lunch”, “punch”

All three are valid. I’ll pick one that hasn’t been used yet. “Punch” shares three letters with “munch”, but “P” is a new letter. However, “lunch” uses “L” which is also new. Any of these is fine, but “lunch” seems slightly more neutral.

Let me pick “lunch”.

But wait, the feedback says:
Guess 3: munch -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)

This confirms the last four letters are “UNCH”. The only missing letter is the first one. So the word must be:

[L] U N C H

Where L is the only unknown. “Lunch” is a valid word, and L hasn’t been excluded.

Therefore, the word must be “lunch”.
