- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information for subsequent guesses. Classic strategy suggests using words with common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. Some good starter words include:

- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with STARE as it includes all of the most common letters (S, T, A, R, E) which should give good coverage for initial feedback.

All five letters in STARE (S, T, A, R, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge swath of common letters.  
To maximize information on the next try I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include S, T, A, R, or E.  
Remaining very common consonants: N, L, C, D, M, H, B, F, G, K, etc.  
Remaining common vowels: O, I, U.

A balanced starter that uses fresh high-frequency letters is “CHILD” (C, H, I, L, D).  
It contains three consonants (C, H, L, D) and two vowels (I), none of which were in STARE.

Other options could be “BLIND”, “GUILD”, “FLUNK”, but “CHILD” feels like a good mix of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

From Guess 1 (STARE) we learned: S, T, A, R, E are **not** in the word.

- Letters that are definitely out: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, L, D.
- Letter that **is** in the word: I (unknown position).
- Remaining common letters not yet tried: N, O, U, M, K, B, F, G, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter I (since we know it's in the word).
2. Does **not** contain any of the eliminated letters.
3. Uses other fresh common letters to gather more information.

Good candidates:
- UNION (but N is common and U, O are fresh)
- PIVOT (but T is already out)
- MOUND (D is out)
- GUMMY (G, U, M, M, Y - good letters)
- PINKY (P, I, N, K, Y - all are allowed)
