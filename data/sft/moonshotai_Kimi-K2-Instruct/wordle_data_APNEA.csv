Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting some correct letters to work with for subsequent guesses.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should ideally cover as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good vowel distribution.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the correct first position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ _ with E somewhere after position 1 but not at position 5.

That leaves possible letters for the remaining four positions: any letter except R, O, S.

E must appear somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it’s in the word but not at position 5).

Let’s build possibilities:

- A E _ _ _ – but E could also be in positions 3 or 4.
- A _ E _ _
- A _ _ E _

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with A, containing E in positions 2-4, and excluding R, O, S.

Some candidates:
- ALERT – but R is excluded.
- AGENT – possible, uses G, N, T.
- ABLED – possible, uses B, L, D.
- ASHEN – but S is excluded.
- ACHED – possible, uses C, H, D.

""AGENT"" seems good: starts with A, E in position 2, and uses common letters G, N, T.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This maximizes the chance of getting some correct letters to work with for subsequent guesses.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should ideally cover as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good vowel distribution.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the correct first position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ _ with E somewhere after position 1 but not at position 5.

That leaves possible letters for the remaining four positions: any letter except R, O, S.

E must appear somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it’s in the word but not at position 5).

Let’s build possibilities:

- A E _ _ _ – but E could also be in positions 3 or 4.
- A _ E _ _
- A _ _ E _

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with A, containing E in positions 2-4, and excluding R, O, S.

Some candidates:
- ALERT – but R is excluded.
- AGENT – possible, uses G, N, T.
- ABLED – possible, uses B, L, D.
- ASHEN – but S is excluded.
- ACHED – possible, uses C, H, D.

""AGENT"" seems good: starts with A, E in position 2, and uses common letters G, N, T.

From Guess 2 (AGENT):
- A (position 1) is still correct.
- E is still in the word but not in position 3.
- G, N, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Must contain E, and E is NOT in position 3 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, G, N, T.
- Allowed letters: basically the rest of the alphabet minus the forbidden ones.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.

Let’s list common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with A, containing E in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- A B E _ _ (like ABEAM, ABELE, ABETS) – but need to check forbidden letters.
- A _ _ E _ (like ABLED, ACHED, AXIOM) – but need to check forbidden letters.

From these, ""ABELE"" is a valid word (a type of tree) and fits all constraints:
- Starts with A.
- Has E in position 2.
- Uses only allowed letters (B, L are allowed).

Another valid option could be ""ABLED"", but ""ABELE"" seems more unique and less likely to overlap with other constraints.

Thus, the best next guess is ""ABELE"".

From all prior feedback:

- Position 1: A is fixed (✓ every time).
- E must be in the word, but every prior placement has been rejected:
  – Pos 2 (AE…) → E(-)
  – Pos 3 (…E…) → E(-)
  – Pos 4 (…E…) → E(-)
  – Pos 5 (…E)  → E(-)  
  Therefore **E is impossible**; no remaining position is open for it.  
  Since the rules guarantee the secret word is 5 letters and we know E is required, our deductions must be incomplete.

Rechecking:
- Guess 4 (AECIA) gave A(✓) E(-) C(x) I(x) A(✓).  
  That “E(-)” means E is present in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  The other E’s from earlier guesses were positions 3–5; we have not tried position 2 before, so the negative at 2 does NOT eliminate position 2.  
  Thus **E can indeed be in position 2**.

So the pattern is A E _ _ _ with no R,O,S,G,N,T,B,L,C,I.  
Remaining consonants: D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Need a valid 5-letter word AE***. The only common one left is AEMIC (a spelling variant of “anaemic”).  
It uses M and C. C was already marked x, so AEMIC is invalid.  
Another possibility is AEDIC (rare adjective form) but C is excluded.  
Next: AERED (dialectal) – R excluded.  
AEWED? Not in standard dictionaries.  
AFIELD? Too long.  
AEONS? O excluded.  
The only remaining dictionary entry that fits is:

AERIE – but R is excluded.  
Hence, the only apparently valid candidate that remains is **AEGIS**, yet G was already excluded.  

Rechecking exclusions again: we know **C** was marked x, **I** was marked x, **B,L,T,N,G,O,S,R** too.  
That leaves D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The only real English word of the form AE*** using allowed consonants:

AEDES – C is x, D and S (but S is x) – no.  
AEGIS – G is x.  
AERIE – R is x.  
AECIA – C is x, I is x.  

We have exhausted all standard 5-letter AE*** words. The only remaining valid option is **AEGIS** even though G was marked x, which would contradict. Therefore, one of two things must be true:

1. We missed a word, or  
2. The pattern must be A _ E _ _ (E in position 3) despite earlier E being rejected at 3 by ABELE.

Re-examine: when ABELE was played (ABELE), feedback said  
A(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x) E(-).  
That means:  
- Position 3 E is wrong **position** (E is in word, but not at 3).  
So E could still be at 4 or 5.  
But in AROSE, E at 5 was “-” (wrong position), so E cannot be 5.  
Then E can only be at 4.  
Pattern: A _ _ E _.

Forbidden letters so far: R,O,S,G,N,T,B,L,C,I.

We need A _ _ E _ with two other letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:  
AFIRE – I,R excluded.  
ACHED – C,H excluded.  
AMENE – not a word.  
AKEEL – not a word.  
AJEET – not a word.  
APEEK – not standard.  
ADVEE – not a word.  
AWMED – not a word.  

Only common real word left: **AMEER** (variant of “emir”).  
Check letters: A, M, E, E, R → R excluded.  
**AMEER** fails.  
Next: AMEED – not a word.  

The only remaining valid word obeying all constraints is **ADEEM** (legal term).

Letters: A, D, E, E, M.  
D and M are not yet excluded.  
It fits the pattern A _ _ E _ and avoids all banned letters.

Thus the next guess is **ADEEM**.

Then E can only be at 4.  
Pattern: A _ _ E _.

Forbidden letters so far: R,O,S,G,N,T,B,L,C,I.

We need A _ _ E _ with two other letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:  
AFIRE – I,R excluded.  
ACHED – C,H excluded.  
AMENE – not a word.  
AKEEL – not a word.  
AJEET – not a word.  
APEEK – not standard.  
ADVEE – not a word.  
AWMED – not a word.  

Only common real word left: **AMEER** (variant of “emir”).  
Check letters: A, M, E, E, R → R excluded.  
**AMEER** fails.  
Next: AMEED – not a word.  

The only remaining valid word obeying all constraints is **ADEEM** (legal term).

Letters: A, D, E, E, M.  
D and M are not yet excluded.  
It fits the pattern A _ _ E _ and avoids all banned letters.

Thus the next guess is **ADEEM**.",Guess 5: ADEEM -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) E(-) E(✓) M(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,APNEA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting some correct letters to work with for subsequent guesses.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word should ideally cover as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good vowel distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the correct first position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ _ with E somewhere after position 1 but not at position 5.

That leaves possible letters for the remaining four positions: any letter except R, O, S.

E must appear somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it’s in the word but not at position 5).

Let’s build possibilities:

- A E _ _ _ – but E could also be in positions 3 or 4.
- A _ E _ _
- A _ _ E _

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with A, containing E in positions 2-4, and excluding R, O, S.

Some candidates:
- ALERT – but R is excluded.
- AGENT – possible, uses G, N, T.
- ABLED – possible, uses B, L, D.
- ASHEN – but S is excluded.
- ACHED – possible, uses C, H, D.

""AGENT"" seems good: starts with A, E in position 2, and uses common letters G, N, T.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AGENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) E(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is correct and in position 1.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be in position 5).

From Guess 2 (AGENT):
- A (position 1) is still correct.
- E is still in the word but not in position 3.
- G, N, T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Must contain E, and E is NOT in position 3 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, G, N, T.
- Allowed letters: basically the rest of the alphabet minus the forbidden ones.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.

Let’s list common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with A, containing E in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- A B E _ _ (like ABEAM, ABELE, ABETS) – but need to check forbidden letters.
- A _ _ E _ (like ABLED, ACHED, AXIOM) – but need to check forbidden letters.

From these, ""ABELE"" is a valid word (a type of tree) and fits all constraints:
- Starts with A.
- Has E in position 2.
- Uses only allowed letters (B, L are allowed).

Another valid option could be ""ABLED"", but ""ABELE"" seems more unique and less likely to overlap with other constraints.

Thus, the best next guess is ""ABELE"".

<guess>ABELE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: AGENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) E(-) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ABELE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three prior guesses we now know:

1. A is locked in at position 1 (✓ every time).
2. E is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (all guesses placed E in those spots and got “-”).
3. Therefore the only possible place E can appear is position 2.
4. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, G, N, T, B, L.

So the word must be of the form: A E _ _ _  
We need two more letters, each different from the forbidden set, and together forming a valid 5-letter word.

The remaining common/allowable consonants include, but are not limited to, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Scanning possible two-letter endings that make real words with “AE”:

- AECIA – (valid botanical term)
- AEDES – (mosquito genus)
- AEGIS – (protection, shield)
- AEONS – (plural of eon)
- AERIE – (eagle’s nest) – but R is excluded.
- AEROS – (variant spelling, but O is excluded)
- AECIA seems the safest pick that obeys every constraint.

Hence I will guess “AECIA”.

<guess>AECIA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: AGENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) E(-) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ABELE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x) E(-)
Guess 4: AECIA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) E(-) C(x) I(x) A(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all prior feedback:

- Position 1: A is fixed (✓ every time).
- E must be in the word, but every prior placement has been rejected:
  – Pos 2 (AE…) → E(-)
  – Pos 3 (…E…) → E(-)
  – Pos 4 (…E…) → E(-)
  – Pos 5 (…E)  → E(-)  
  Therefore **E is impossible**; no remaining position is open for it.  
  Since the rules guarantee the secret word is 5 letters and we know E is required, our deductions must be incomplete.

Rechecking:
- Guess 4 (AECIA) gave A(✓) E(-) C(x) I(x) A(✓).  
  That “E(-)” means E is present in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  The other E’s from earlier guesses were positions 3–5; we have not tried position 2 before, so the negative at 2 does NOT eliminate position 2.  
  Thus **E can indeed be in position 2**.

So the pattern is A E _ _ _ with no R,O,S,G,N,T,B,L,C,I.  
Remaining consonants: D,F,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Need a valid 5-letter word AE***. The only common one left is AEMIC (a spelling variant of “anaemic”).  
It uses M and C. C was already marked x, so AEMIC is invalid.  
Another possibility is AEDIC (rare adjective form) but C is excluded.  
Next: AERED (dialectal) – R excluded.  
AEWED? Not in standard dictionaries.  
AFIELD? Too long.  
AEONS? O excluded.  
The only remaining dictionary entry that fits is:

AERIE – but R is excluded.  
Hence, the only apparently valid candidate that remains is **AEGIS**, yet G was already excluded.  

Rechecking exclusions again: we know **C** was marked x, **I** was marked x, **B,L,T,N,G,O,S,R** too.  
That leaves D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The only real English word of the form AE*** using allowed consonants:

AEDES – C is x, D and S (but S is x) – no.  
AEGIS – G is x.  
AERIE – R is x.  
AECIA – C is x, I is x.  

We have exhausted all standard 5-letter AE*** words. The only remaining valid option is **AEGIS** even though G was marked x, which would contradict. Therefore, one of two things must be true:

1. We missed a word, or  
2. The pattern must be A _ E _ _ (E in position 3) despite earlier E being rejected at 3 by ABELE.

Re-examine: when ABELE was played (ABELE), feedback said  
A(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x) E(-).  
That means:  
- Position 3 E is wrong **position** (E is in word, but not at 3).  
So E could still be at 4 or 5.  
But in AROSE, E at 5 was “-” (wrong position), so E cannot be 5.  
Then E can only be at 4.  
Pattern: A _ _ E _.

Forbidden letters so far: R,O,S,G,N,T,B,L,C,I.

We need A _ _ E _ with two other letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:  
AFIRE – I,R excluded.  
ACHED – C,H excluded.  
AMENE – not a word.  
AKEEL – not a word.  
AJEET – not a word.  
APEEK – not standard.  
ADVEE – not a word.  
AWMED – not a word.  

Only common real word left: **AMEER** (variant of “emir”).  
Check letters: A, M, E, E, R → R excluded.  
**AMEER** fails.  
Next: AMEED – not a word.  

The only remaining valid word obeying all constraints is **ADEEM** (legal term).

Letters: A, D, E, E, M.  
D and M are not yet excluded.  
It fits the pattern A _ _ E _ and avoids all banned letters.

Thus the next guess is **ADEEM**.

- A X E L S – X, L allowed? L is forbidden.
- A X E L – too short.
- A Y E R S – Y is allowed, R, S forbidden.
- A Z E R O – Z allowed, R, O forbidden.

The only valid remaining word seems to be ""APEEK"" (which means ""to look or peer"").

Let's verify:
- A P E E K
- Starts with A (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- P and K are not forbidden
- Avoids all forbidden letters

Thus, the next guess is ""APEEK"".",Guess 6: APEEK -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(✓) E(-) E(✓) K(x),FAIL
