For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C (first letter) and R (second letter) are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or R.
- Contains A, N, and E somewhere, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively.

To make a good second guess, I should:
1. Avoid C and R entirely.
2. Place A, N, and E in new positions (not 3, 4, 5 for A,N,E).
3. Include new common letters to test.

A strong candidate is ""STAND"":
- S, T, D are new letters to test.
- A is moved from position 3 to 2.
- N is moved from position 4 to 3.
- D is a new consonant to test.

However, this uses N in position 3 which might not be optimal since we know N is in the word but not position 4. 

""STAND"" would test:
- S (new)

2. STAND → S(x) T(x) A(-) N(-) D(x)

Observations:
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, S, T, D
- Letters known TO be in the word (but still looking for correct positions): A, N, E
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A is NOT in position 3 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STAND). So A is not in 3rd spot.
  – N is NOT in position 4 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 (from STAND). So N is not in 3rd or 4th spot.
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from CRANE).

Therefore, possible positions for each:
- A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a new word that:
- Uses A, N, E (each at least once if possible)
- Places them in new, legal positions
- Avoids C, R, S, T, D entirely
- Introduces other common unused letters (e.g., B, L, M, P, etc.)

Candidate word: PLANE
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A (position 3 was invalid, now placed in 2)
- N (position 3/4 invalid, now placed in 4)
- E (position 5 invalid, now placed in 5 – wait, E was invalid in 5 from CRANE feedback? No, CRANE had E in 5 marked as ""wrong position"", so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is bad. Let me rethink.)

Oops, E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE). So PLANE is invalid because it has E in 5.

Let’s summarize the new information from Guess 3:

ANGEL → A(✓) N(-) G(x) E(✓) L(x)

1. A is correct in position 1, so the word must start with A.
2. E is correct in position 5, so the word must end with E.
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
4. Letters known NOT to appear: C, R, S, T, D, G, L.
5. The remaining unknown positions are 2, 3, 4.
6. The set of letters we still need to place includes N plus any new letters we haven’t tested yet, avoiding the excluded ones.

We must place N somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, 5 are taken by A, ?, E and N cannot be in position 2).

Common letters we have not tested yet: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three more letters (positions 2, 3, 4) and one of them must be N. The other two should be common, unused letters.

A quick way is to try putting N in position 3 and see what common letters fit in positions 2 and 4.

Example structure: A _ N _ E

Possible middle consonants: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s pick common ones:

A B N ? E – but we need a consonant or vowel in position 4. Possible: A B N D E – but D is excluded.

A B N K E – K is new, B is new.

A B N K E → ABENK no... wait, A B N K E is ABKNE – but that’s not a word. Let’s think of real words.

A _ N _ E : Some valid English 5-letter words starting with A and ending with E, with N in 3rd:

- ANILE – ANILE is archaic, low probability
- ANIME – ANIME is valid (but M and I not excluded)
- AINSE – not a word
- ANNEX – but ends in X, E is 5th letter

- ANISE – ANISE is valid (A N I S E) but S is excluded

ANIME:
- A in 1: ✓

Next structure: A _ _ N E

Let’s try A _ _ N E. N is in 4th position (allowed).

We need letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, S, T, D, G, L.

Common consonants and vowels left: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible word: ALONE – but L is excluded

AMINE – M and I not excluded
AWNED – D excluded
APHNE – not a word

Let’s check constraints:
- N is not in position 2 (check, it’s in 4)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C (first letter) and R (second letter) are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or R.
- Contains A, N, and E somewhere, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively.

To make a good second guess, I should:
1. Avoid C and R entirely.
2. Place A, N, and E in new positions (not 3, 4, 5 for A,N,E).
3. Include new common letters to test.

A strong candidate is ""STAND"":
- S, T, D are new letters to test.
- A is moved from position 3 to 2.
- N is moved from position 4 to 3.
- D is a new consonant to test.

However, this uses N in position 3 which might not be optimal since we know N is in the word but not position 4. 

""STAND"" would test:
- S (new)
- T (new) 
- A (now in position 2)
- N (now in position 3)
- D (new)

This seems like a good choice to maximize information.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
2. STAND → S(x) T(x) A(-) N(-) D(x)

Observations:
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, S, T, D
- Letters known TO be in the word (but still looking for correct positions): A, N, E
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A is NOT in position 3 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STAND). So A is not in 3rd spot.
  – N is NOT in position 4 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 (from STAND). So N is not in 3rd or 4th spot.
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from CRANE).

Therefore, possible positions for each:
- A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a new word that:
- Uses A, N, E (each at least once if possible)
- Places them in new, legal positions
- Avoids C, R, S, T, D entirely
- Introduces other common unused letters (e.g., B, L, M, P, etc.)

Candidate word: PLANE
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A (position 3 was invalid, now placed in 2)
- N (position 3/4 invalid, now placed in 4)
- E (position 5 invalid, now placed in 5 – wait, E was invalid in 5 from CRANE feedback? No, CRANE had E in 5 marked as ""wrong position"", so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is bad. Let me rethink.)

Oops, E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE). So PLANE is invalid because it has E in 5.

Let's extract every constraint we now have:

1. A is in position 1 (✓).  
2. E is in position 5 (✓).  
3. N is somewhere in the word, but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (because it was (-) in both ANGEL and AMINE).  
   Therefore N must be in position 3 only.  
4. Letters we already know are **not** in the word:  
   C, R, S, T, D, G, L, M, I.  
5. Positions 2 and 4 are still open and must be filled with letters **not** in the banned list above.

So the word must look like:  
A _ N _ E

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Permitted unused letters (common ones): B, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to pick two distinct letters from that set that make a real 5-letter word.

Possible combinations:
– A B N V E → ABVNE … not a word  
– A B N K E → ABKNE … not a word  
– A B N O E → ABONE … not a word  
– A B N Y E → not a word

– A V N O E → AVONE … no  
– A W N O E → AWONE … no  
– A B N D E → D is banned  
– A B N C E → C is banned  

Let me instead list **real** 5-letter words that fit A _ N _ E and use only allowed letters.

Going through a mental list:

- ANODE – O and D: D is banned  
- ANOLE – O and L: L is banned  
- ANIME – M and I are banned  
- ANKLE – L and K: L banned  
- ANTEE – T banned

- ANELE – second E already used, but E is only in 5th, and we need distinct letters  
- ABUNE – B and U: neither banned  
- AWNED – D and W: D banned  
- ANKER – R banned  
- AVENS – S banned  
- ANKUS – S banned  
- ANKHS – letters not in banned set, but ANKHS is plural, might be obscure  

Actually the Scottish word **ABUNE** (meaning “above”) is valid and uses only A, B, U, N, E, none of which are banned except that B and U are still allowed.  
But a more common word is **ANVIL** – but has L and is only 5 letters, but not ending with E.

Let me re-think: A _ N _ E.

Another real word: **AYNGE** – not a word.

There is **AWNER** – R banned.

Wait, how about **ABNER**? No, R banned.

Actually, simple common word: **ANONE** – not a word.

- ANOLE – O and L, L banned  
- ANISE – S banned  
- ANIME – M and I banned  
- ANKLE – L banned  
- ABUNE – valid (Scots, but playable)  
- AUNTE – T banned  
- AXONE – X unusual, but O and X not banned  

So the only reasonably common, non-banned letters word I can find is **AXONE** (a biological term, plural axon). It uses A, X, O, N, E. None of X or O have been banned yet.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,APNEA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C (first letter) and R (second letter) are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A, N, and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or R.
- Contains A, N, and E somewhere, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively.

To make a good second guess, I should:
1. Avoid C and R entirely.
2. Place A, N, and E in new positions (not 3, 4, 5 for A,N,E).
3. Include new common letters to test.

A strong candidate is ""STAND"":
- S, T, D are new letters to test.
- A is moved from position 3 to 2.
- N is moved from position 4 to 3.
- D is a new consonant to test.

However, this uses N in position 3 which might not be optimal since we know N is in the word but not position 4. 

""STAND"" would test:
- S (new)
- T (new) 
- A (now in position 2)
- N (now in position 3)
- D (new)

This seems like a good choice to maximize information.

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
2. STAND → S(x) T(x) A(-) N(-) D(x)

Observations:
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, S, T, D
- Letters known TO be in the word (but still looking for correct positions): A, N, E
- Positions ruled out so far:
  – A is NOT in position 3 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STAND). So A is not in 3rd spot.
  – N is NOT in position 4 (from CRANE) and NOT in position 3 (from STAND). So N is not in 3rd or 4th spot.
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from CRANE).

Therefore, possible positions for each:
- A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need a new word that:
- Uses A, N, E (each at least once if possible)
- Places them in new, legal positions
- Avoids C, R, S, T, D entirely
- Introduces other common unused letters (e.g., B, L, M, P, etc.)

Candidate word: PLANE
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A (position 3 was invalid, now placed in 2)
- N (position 3/4 invalid, now placed in 4)
- E (position 5 invalid, now placed in 5 – wait, E was invalid in 5 from CRANE feedback? No, CRANE had E in 5 marked as ""wrong position"", so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is bad. Let me rethink.)

Oops, E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE). So PLANE is invalid because it has E in 5.

Alternative: LEANT
- L (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3 – but A was marked as ""wrong position"" in 3 from CRANE, so invalid. A cannot be in 3.)

Another alternative: PANEL
- P (new)
- A (position 2)
- N (position 3 – but N cannot be in 3 from STAND feedback. Invalid.)

Next: MEAN
Only 4 letters, need 5. Extend to MEANY
- M (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3 – invalid again)

Next: YEARN
- Y (new)
- E (position 2)
- A (position 3 – invalid)

Next: BLANK
- B (new)
- L (new)
- A (position 2)
- N (position 3 – invalid)

Next: ANGLE
- A (position 1 – possible)
- N (position 2 – possible)
- G (new)
- L (new)
- E (position 5 – invalid, E cannot be 5)

Next: ANGEL
- A (position 1)
- N (position 2)
- G (new)
- E (position 4)
- L (new)

This looks valid:
- A in 1 (new position, no conflict)
- N in 2 (new position, no conflict)
- E in 4 (new position, no conflict)
- Letters C,R,S,T,D excluded
- New letters G and L introduced

So ANGEL is a good candidate.

ANGEL → A(✓) N(-) G(x) E(✓) L(x)

1. A is correct in position 1, so the word must start with A.
2. E is correct in position 5, so the word must end with E.
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
4. Letters known NOT to appear: C, R, S, T, D, G, L.
5. The remaining unknown positions are 2, 3, 4.
6. The set of letters we still need to place includes N plus any new letters we haven’t tested yet, avoiding the excluded ones.

We must place N somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, 5 are taken by A, ?, E and N cannot be in position 2).

Common letters we have not tested yet: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need three more letters (positions 2, 3, 4) and one of them must be N. The other two should be common, unused letters.

A quick way is to try putting N in position 3 and see what common letters fit in positions 2 and 4.

Example structure: A _ N _ E

Possible middle consonants: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s pick common ones:

A B N ? E – but we need a consonant or vowel in position 4. Possible: A B N D E – but D is excluded.

A B N K E – K is new, B is new.

A B N K E → ABENK no... wait, A B N K E is ABKNE – but that’s not a word. Let’s think of real words.

A _ N _ E : Some valid English 5-letter words starting with A and ending with E, with N in 3rd:

- ANONE – not a word
- ANILE – ANILE is archaic, low probability
- ANIME – ANIME is valid (but M and I not excluded)
- AINSE – not a word
- ANNEX – but ends in X, E is 5th letter
- ANNEX – but N is in 2nd position here (invalid)
- ANKLE – but L is excluded
- ANGLE – already tried, G excluded
- ANISE – ANISE is valid (A N I S E) but S is excluded
- ANIME – ANIME: A(✓) N(-) I(?) M(?) E(✓). Let’s check feasibility.

ANIME:
- A in 1: ✓
- N in 2: but feedback says N is in word, wrong position (in ANGEL it was in 2). So N in 2 is invalid. Thus ANIME is invalid.

Next structure: A _ _ N E

Let’s try A _ _ N E. N is in 4th position (allowed).

We need letters for positions 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, S, T, D, G, L.

Common consonants and vowels left: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible word: ALONE – but L is excluded
AKENE – archaic
AMINE – M and I not excluded
AWNED – D excluded
APHNE – not a word
AZINE – Z unusual
AMENE – not a word
ABUNE – Scottish, rare
ATONE – T excluded
AVINE – not a word

AMINE seems plausible: A M I N E
- A(✓) 1st
- M new
- I new
- N new position (4)
- E(✓) 5th

Let’s check constraints:
- N is not in position 2 (check, it’s in 4)
- No C,R,S,T,D,G,L used
- A and E in correct spots

Yes, AMINE fits.

So AMINE is a good next guess.

2. E is in position 5 (✓).  
3. N is somewhere in the word, but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (because it was (-) in both ANGEL and AMINE).  
   Therefore N must be in position 3 only.  
4. Letters we already know are **not** in the word:  
   C, R, S, T, D, G, L, M, I.  
5. Positions 2 and 4 are still open and must be filled with letters **not** in the banned list above.

So the word must look like:  
A _ N _ E

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.  
Permitted unused letters (common ones): B, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to pick two distinct letters from that set that make a real 5-letter word.

Possible combinations:
– A B N V E → ABVNE … not a word  
– A B N K E → ABKNE … not a word  
– A B N O E → ABONE … not a word  
– A B N Y E → not a word  
– A F N K E → AFNKE … not a word  
– A H N K E → AHNKE … not a word  
– A H N O E → AHOEN … no  
– A P N O E → APONE … no  
– A P N K E → APNKE … no  
– A V N O E → AVONE … no  
– A W N O E → AWONE … no  
– A B N D E → D is banned  
– A B N C E → C is banned  

Let me instead list **real** 5-letter words that fit A _ N _ E and use only allowed letters.

Going through a mental list:

- ANODE – O and D: D is banned  
- ANOLE – O and L: L is banned  
- ANIME – M and I are banned  
- ANKLE – L and K: L banned  
- ANTEE – T banned  
- ANISE – S banned  
- ANELE – second E already used, but E is only in 5th, and we need distinct letters  
- ABUNE – B and U: neither banned  
- AWNED – D and W: D banned  
- ANKER – R banned  
- AVENS – S banned  
- ANKUS – S banned  
- ANKHS – letters not in banned set, but ANKHS is plural, might be obscure  

Actually the Scottish word **ABUNE** (meaning “above”) is valid and uses only A, B, U, N, E, none of which are banned except that B and U are still allowed.  
But a more common word is **ANVIL** – but has L and is only 5 letters, but not ending with E.

Let me re-think: A _ N _ E.

Another real word: **AYNGE** – not a word.

There is **AWNER** – R banned.

Wait, how about **ABNER**? No, R banned.

Actually, simple common word: **ANONE** – not a word.

Let me list valid dictionary words:

- ANODE – O and D, D banned  
- ANOLE – O and L, L banned  
- ANISE – S banned  
- ANIME – M and I banned  
- ANKLE – L banned  
- ABUNE – valid (Scots, but playable)  
- AUNTE – T banned  
- AXONE – X unusual, but O and X not banned  

So the only reasonably common, non-banned letters word I can find is **AXONE** (a biological term, plural axon). It uses A, X, O, N, E. None of X or O have been banned yet.

Let's give **AXONE** a go.
