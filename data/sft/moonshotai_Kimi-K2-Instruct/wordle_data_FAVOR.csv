For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters and good letter distribution. After considering various options, ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (C, R, A, N, E)
2. These are all very common letters in English 5-letter words
3. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
4. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the information we get from the feedback

Letters that are in the word:

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 in RADIO, so it cannot be 5; possible positions: 1,3,4)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- R must be in 3,4, or 5
- O must be in 1,3, or 4
- We need two more letters (not C,N,E,D,I); common candidates: S,T,L,M,B,U,G,H,P,Y,K

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has R somewhere among positions 3,4,5
- Has O somewhere among positions 1,3,4
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (i.e., avoiding C,N,E,D,I)

Possible good candidates:
- BLOAT (B,L,O in 1, A in 2, R missing) – but no R
- ROAST (R in 1 but R cannot be 1 from RADIO feedback)
- MORAL (A in 2, O in 2 impossible, A already 2)
- SOLAR (A in 2, R in 5, O in 1) – letters: S,O,L,A,R – none excluded

Let’s consolidate what we know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
C, N, E, D, I, S, L

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A – but its position is now contradictory:
  • Guess 2 said A in position 2 (✓)  
  • Guess 3 says A in position 4 (-)  
  Since ✓ overrules (-), A is locked in position 2.
- O – in word, wrong position so far (was in 2 then 3); cannot be 2 or 3 → possible 1,4,5 but 2 is A, so 1,4,5.
- R – in word, wrong position so far (was in 2 then 5); cannot be 2 or 5 → possible 1,3,4.

We still need three distinct letters from the remaining pool:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus any already excluded).

We must place:
- A fixed in position 2
- O somewhere in 1,4,5
- R somewhere in 1,3,4
- two new letters in the remaining spots, chosen from the safe pool.

A systematic scan of common words fitting these patterns quickly turns up “BOARD”:

- B new  
- O (allowed in position 1)  
- A fixed in position 2 (✓)  
- R allowed in position 3  
- D is excluded (from Guess 2) – so “BOARD” fails on D.

Next candidate: “COBRA” – C excluded.

Next: “ROACH” – C excluded.

Next: “FORAY” – letters F,O,R,A,Y; positions:

- O at 1 (allowed)
- A at 2 (✓)
- R at 3 (allowed)
- Y new

All letters are from the safe set and the placements satisfy the constraints.

Therefore, “FORAY” is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

So far we know:

I want a word that keeps R and A but moves them to new positions, and uses fresh common letters for the rest.

Letters that are in the word:
- A is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it appeared in positions 1 and 2 before, so it cannot be there; possible positions: 3,4,5)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 in RADIO, so it cannot be 5; possible positions: 1,3,4)

So far we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- R must be in 3,4, or 5
- O must be in 1,3, or 4
- We need two more letters (not C,N,E,D,I); common candidates: S,T,L,M,B,U,G,H,P,Y,K

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has R somewhere among positions 3,4,5
- Has O somewhere among positions 1,3,4
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (i.e., avoiding C,N,E,D,I)

Possible good candidates:
- BLOAT (B,L,O in 1, A in 2, R missing) – but no R
- ROAST (R in 1 but R cannot be 1 from RADIO feedback)
- MORAL (A in 2, O in 2 impossible, A already 2)
- SOLAR (A in 2, R in 5, O in 1) – letters: S,O,L,A,R – none excluded
- POLAR (P,O,L,A,R) – same as SOLAR but P instead of S

Let's extract every constraint revealed so far.

Letters known NOT to be in the word (marked “x” at least once):
C, N, E, D, I, S, L, Y

Letters known to be in the word (at least one of each):
- A – via Guess 2 (✓ position 2).  
- O – via Guess 2 (wrong position) and Guess 3 (wrong position).  
- R – via Guess 1 (wrong position) and Guess 4 (wrong position).  
- F – via Guess 4 (✓ position 1).

Current fixed facts:
1. Position 1 = F (✓ from Guess 4)  
2. Position 2 = A (✓ from Guess 2)  

Positions still open: 3, 4, 5.

Constraints on remaining letters:
- O must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because it was already ruled out of 2 and 3, and 1 is F).  
- R must be somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it was already ruled out of 2 and 5, and 1 is F).  
- Whatever we put in positions 3–5 must be chosen from the still-legal letters:  
  B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  (common ones that haven’t been used).

We need two more distinct letters (since O and R already occupy two of the three remaining slots).

A quick scan of common English word patterns fitting F A _ _ _ with O and R in the last three positions yields:

F A R O _  (needs a fifth letter)  
F A R _ O  
F A O R _  
F A O _ R  
F A _ O R  
F A _ R O  

Checking the first one: F A R O ? – needs a legal fifth letter that is not already excluded and hasn’t appeared; T is still safe → FAROT – but FAROT is not a recognized word.

Second pattern: F A R _ O – legal letters B, G, H, K, M… → FARGO (not valid), FARMO (not a word), FARPO (invalid)… none common.

Third pattern: F A O R _ – needs one more letter; T is safe → F A O R T → “FAORT” (not a word).

Fourth pattern: F A O _ R – same issue.

Fifth pattern: F A _ O R – using B gives F A B O R → “FABOR” (not a word).  Using M gives F A M O R → “FAMOR” (not a word).

Sixth pattern: F A _ R O – using B gives F A B R O → “FABRO” (not a word).

Next idea: maybe O and R are adjacent but swapped from above.  Try:

F A O R B → “FAORB” (invalid)  
F A R O B → “FAROB” (invalid)

Another possibility: the word has another vowel in the mix.  U is still allowed.  Try F A O U R → “FAOUR” (invalid).  

Wait—let’s list the remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out: B, G, H, K, M, P, T, W.

Let’s test actual dictionary words:

- F A T O R – “FATOR” (not common)  
- F A M O R – “FAMOR” (rare)  
- F A B O R – “FAVOR” (but V is still allowed)  
  F A V O R – yes!  All letters: F(✓), A(✓), V (new, legal), O (must be placed), R (must be placed).  
  Positions: 1=F, 2=A, 3=V, 4=O, 5=R – this fits every constraint.

So the next logical word is “FAVOR”.

F A R O _  (needs a fifth letter)  
F A R _ O  
F A O R _  
F A O _ R  
F A _ O R  
F A _ R O  

Checking the first one: F A R O ? – needs a legal fifth letter that is not already excluded and hasn’t appeared; T is still safe → FAROT – but FAROT is not a recognized word.

Second pattern: F A R _ O – legal letters B, G, H, K, M… → FARGO (not valid), FARMO (not a word), FARPO (invalid)… none common.

Third pattern: F A O R _ – needs one more letter; T is safe → F A O R T → “FAORT” (not a word).

Fourth pattern: F A O _ R – same issue.

Fifth pattern: F A _ O R – using B gives F A B O R → “FABOR” (not a word).  Using M gives F A M O R → “FAMOR” (not a word).

Sixth pattern: F A _ R O – using B gives F A B R O → “FABRO” (not a word).

Next idea: maybe O and R are adjacent but swapped from above.  Try:

F A O R B → “FAORB” (invalid)  
F A R O B → “FAROB” (invalid)

Another possibility: the word has another vowel in the mix.  U is still allowed.  Try F A O U R → “FAOUR” (invalid).  

Wait—let’s list the remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out: B, G, H, K, M, P, T, W.

Let’s test actual dictionary words:

- F A T O R – “FATOR” (not common)  
- F A M O R – “FAMOR” (rare)  
- F A B O R – “FAVOR” (but V is still allowed)  
  F A V O R – yes!  All letters: F(✓), A(✓), V (new, legal), O (must be placed), R (must be placed).  
  Positions: 1=F, 2=A, 3=V, 4=O, 5=R – this fits every constraint.

So the next logical word is “FAVOR”.",Guess 5: FAVOR -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
