For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and no repeats. Common English letters in 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats. This gives good coverage to check for these high-frequency letters and their positions.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong opening choice.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That wipes out five of the most common letters, so a good second guess should:

- avoid any of A, R, O, S, E  
- include a fresh set of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain  
- still be a valid 5-letter word.

The next set of frequent letters (after A, E, O, R, S) is roughly: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, P, M, Y…  
A word that combines several of these while avoiding the banned letters is “UNITY”.  
Its letters (U, N, I, T, Y) have not been tested yet, and they are all reasonably common, giving us broad coverage.

So far we have:

- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters confirmed present (somewhere): I, Y  
- Position hints:  
  – I is NOT in position 3 (since it was marked “-” in position 3 of UNITY)  
  – Y is definitely in position 5 (marked “✓” in position 5 of UNITY)

We need a word that:
1. Uses five distinct letters (to maximize information).  
2. Contains both I and Y.  
3. Places Y in position 5.  
4. Avoids every letter already ruled out.  
5. Ideally uses new common consonants (D, L, C, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, W) plus possibly a new vowel (only vowels left that haven’t been tested are basically I, plus maybe the occasional other vowel).

Let’s pick a word meeting those constraints:  
- Ends in Y.  
- Contains I elsewhere (not in position 3).  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  
- Uses new common consonants.

- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3)  
- Letters F, L, M have not been tested yet.  

“FILMY” is in the standard Wordle word list and satisfies every constraint.

Another reasonable option could be “LIMPY” or “WIMPY”; they’re equivalent in information value. I’ll go with FILMY.

Current constraints:

- Letters confirmed present: I, Y  
- Position constraints:
  – Y must be in position 5 (✓ on both prior guesses)
  – I must not be in position 2 or 3 (it appeared as “-” in both positions already)

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been used: C, D, G, H, K, P, V, W, B  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I (confirmed present) and possibly others if we allow repeats, but we should avoid repeats to maximize information.

We need a word that:
1. Ends in Y (position 5)
2. Contains I somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out
4. Uses as many new consonants as possible

Possible positions for I: 1 or 4 (but 4 is adjacent to Y, so let’s consider 1)

Let’s look for patterns like:
- I _ _ _ Y
- _ _ _ I Y (but I can’t be in 3 or 2, so 4 is allowed)

Let’s list possible valid English words fitting I _ _ _ Y:
- IVY (too short)
- ICILY (5 letters, but has L which is ruled out)
- INLAY (N and A ruled out)
- IDYLL (L ruled out, double L)
- ICKY (K not ruled out, but too short)
- IMBUE (doesn’t fit)
- IGGY (too short)
- ICHOR (O ruled out)
- ITCHY (T ruled out)
- IVORY (V, O, R ruled out)

Hmm, not many. Let’s try _ _ _ I Y:
- PIKIY (not a word)
- DICIY (not a word)
- WIKIY (not a word)

Let’s try other patterns, possibly I in position 1:

- I _ _ _ Y: “ITCHY” – T is ruled out
- I _ _ _ Y: “ICKY” – K is allowed, but needs 5 letters
- I _ _ _ Y: “ICILY” – L is ruled out

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe use I in position 4 (second last): _ _ _ I Y
Valid words:
- “CAVIY” – not a word
- “PIQIY” – no
- “CIVIL” – doesn’t end in Y

All these have double G, which is acceptable. Let’s pick one with new letters. “PIGGY” has P, G – both untested.

Another option: I in position 1 with new letters:

- “INNER” no
- “ICING” no
- “IDYLL” L ruled out
- “IGLOO” O ruled out
- “IMAGO” A, O, G, M – M, A, O ruled out

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,IMPLY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and no repeats. Common English letters in 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats. This gives good coverage to check for these high-frequency letters and their positions.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong opening choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That wipes out five of the most common letters, so a good second guess should:

- avoid any of A, R, O, S, E  
- include a fresh set of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain  
- still be a valid 5-letter word.

The next set of frequent letters (after A, E, O, R, S) is roughly: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, P, M, Y…  
A word that combines several of these while avoiding the banned letters is “UNITY”.  
Its letters (U, N, I, T, Y) have not been tested yet, and they are all reasonably common, giving us broad coverage.

- Position hints:  
  – I is NOT in position 3 (since it was marked “-” in position 3 of UNITY)  
  – Y is definitely in position 5 (marked “✓” in position 5 of UNITY)

We need a word that:
1. Uses five distinct letters (to maximize information).  
2. Contains both I and Y.  
3. Places Y in position 5.  
4. Avoids every letter already ruled out.  
5. Ideally uses new common consonants (D, L, C, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, W) plus possibly a new vowel (only vowels left that haven’t been tested are basically I, plus maybe the occasional other vowel).

Let’s pick a word meeting those constraints:  
- Ends in Y.  
- Contains I elsewhere (not in position 3).  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  
- Uses new common consonants.

Candidate word: “HILDY” – not a valid English word (I think).  
Candidate word: “FILMY” – contains F, I, L, M, Y.  
- Y is in position 5 ✓  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3)  
- Letters F, L, M have not been tested yet.  

“FILMY” is in the standard Wordle word list and satisfies every constraint.

Another reasonable option could be “LIMPY” or “WIMPY”; they’re equivalent in information value. I’ll go with FILMY.

Updated constraints:

Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, G  
Letters confirmed present: I, Y  
Y must be in position 5 (✓ every time)

I must appear somewhere, but in previous guesses it has already been tried in positions 2, 3, and 4 and always marked “-”.  
Therefore I cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
The only remaining place for I is position 1.

So the word must be: I _ _ _ Y

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
Consonants: B, C, D, H, K, V, W, X, Z (and a few others)  
Vowels: only I is confirmed; others (A, E, O, U already out) hence no other vowel usable.

We need three consonants to fill positions 2,3,4, all distinct and from the allowed set.  
Looking for valid English words that start with I and end with Y:

- IVY – too short  
- ICILY – contains L (out) and I repeats  
- IDYLL – L out  
- INLAY – N, A out  
- ICHOR – O out  
- IRONY – R, O out  
- IVORY – V, O, R out  
- IMPHY – M out  
- IXTLY – not a word  
- ICKY – K allowed, but needs two more consonants  
- INKEY – not a word  
- IDYLY – not standard  

Scanning the Wordle dictionary, the only common 5-letter word that starts with I, ends with Y, and uses only still-allowed letters is:

- ICKY – too short  
Actually, there seems to be no standard 5-letter word that exactly fits I _ _ _ Y while respecting all letter bans.  
This suggests we must allow a repeat of I or reconsider, but repeating I would waste information.

Rechecking: we missed “IVORY” has O and R banned; “ITCHY” has T banned; “INFER” no Y.  
Another candidate: “WICCY” – not valid.  
“CHIMY” – M banned.  
“WHITY” – T banned.  
“KIVVY” – V, K allowed, but double V.

The best valid word fitting all constraints turns out to be “WICCY” but it is not recognized.  
However, “WIMPY” was ruled out earlier (M banned).  
“BIVVY” – B, I, V, V, Y – B, V allowed, double V acceptable. This is a recognized word for a small tent.

Checking:  
B – allowed  
I – must be in position 1  
V – allowed  
V – allowed (repeat okay)  
Y – allowed  

Therefore “BIVVY” is acceptable.

Another simple one: “DIXXY” – but X is allowed, though less common.

Among common choices, “BIVVY” is best.

However, let’s verify:  
- B allowed  
- I in 1  
- V allowed  
- V allowed  
- Y in 5  

Yes, meets all rules.

Therefore, next guess is BIVVY.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,IMPLY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and no repeats. Common English letters in 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats. This gives good coverage to check for these high-frequency letters and their positions.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong opening choice.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That wipes out five of the most common letters, so a good second guess should:

- avoid any of A, R, O, S, E  
- include a fresh set of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain  
- still be a valid 5-letter word.

The next set of frequent letters (after A, E, O, R, S) is roughly: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, P, M, Y…  
A word that combines several of these while avoiding the banned letters is “UNITY”.  
Its letters (U, N, I, T, Y) have not been tested yet, and they are all reasonably common, giving us broad coverage.

<guess>UNITY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters confirmed present (somewhere): I, Y  
- Position hints:  
  – I is NOT in position 3 (since it was marked “-” in position 3 of UNITY)  
  – Y is definitely in position 5 (marked “✓” in position 5 of UNITY)

We need a word that:
1. Uses five distinct letters (to maximize information).  
2. Contains both I and Y.  
3. Places Y in position 5.  
4. Avoids every letter already ruled out.  
5. Ideally uses new common consonants (D, L, C, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, W) plus possibly a new vowel (only vowels left that haven’t been tested are basically I, plus maybe the occasional other vowel).

Let’s pick a word meeting those constraints:  
- Ends in Y.  
- Contains I elsewhere (not in position 3).  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  
- Uses new common consonants.

Candidate word: “HILDY” – not a valid English word (I think).  
Candidate word: “FILMY” – contains F, I, L, M, Y.  
- Y is in position 5 ✓  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3)  
- Letters F, L, M have not been tested yet.  

“FILMY” is in the standard Wordle word list and satisfies every constraint.

Another reasonable option could be “LIMPY” or “WIMPY”; they’re equivalent in information value. I’ll go with FILMY.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: FILMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, L, M  
- Letters confirmed present: I, Y  
- Position constraints:
  – Y must be in position 5 (✓ on both prior guesses)
  – I must not be in position 2 or 3 (it appeared as “-” in both positions already)

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been used: C, D, G, H, K, P, V, W, B  
Remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out: I (confirmed present) and possibly others if we allow repeats, but we should avoid repeats to maximize information.

We need a word that:
1. Ends in Y (position 5)
2. Contains I somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out
4. Uses as many new consonants as possible

Possible positions for I: 1 or 4 (but 4 is adjacent to Y, so let’s consider 1)

Let’s look for patterns like:
- I _ _ _ Y
- _ _ _ I Y (but I can’t be in 3 or 2, so 4 is allowed)

Let’s list possible valid English words fitting I _ _ _ Y:
- IVY (too short)
- ICILY (5 letters, but has L which is ruled out)
- INLAY (N and A ruled out)
- IDYLL (L ruled out, double L)
- ICKY (K not ruled out, but too short)
- IMBUE (doesn’t fit)
- IGGY (too short)
- ICHOR (O ruled out)
- ITCHY (T ruled out)
- IVORY (V, O, R ruled out)

Hmm, not many. Let’s try _ _ _ I Y:
- PIKIY (not a word)
- DICIY (not a word)
- WIKIY (not a word)

Let’s try other patterns, possibly I in position 1:
- I _ _ _ Y: possible valid word “IVORY” but O and R are ruled out
- I _ _ _ Y: “ITCHY” – T is ruled out
- I _ _ _ Y: “ICKY” – K is allowed, but needs 5 letters
- I _ _ _ Y: “ICILY” – L is ruled out

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe use I in position 4 (second last): _ _ _ I Y
Valid words:
- “CAVIY” – not a word
- “PIQIY” – no
- “CIVIL” – doesn’t end in Y
- “CIVIC” – no
- “CIGGY” – G is allowed, but double G
- “PIGGY” – P, G, G, Y – G is allowed, P is allowed, Y is allowed, I in position 4
- “PIGGY” – letters: P, I, G, G, Y – but double G is okay, but we have G to test
- “WIGGY” – W, I, G, G, Y – W is allowed
- “BIGGY” – B, I, G, G, Y – B is allowed
- “DIGGY” – D, I, G, G, Y – D is allowed
- “CIGGY” – C, I, G, G, Y – C is allowed

All these have double G, which is acceptable. Let’s pick one with new letters. “PIGGY” has P, G – both untested.

Another option: I in position 1 with new letters:
- I _ _ _ Y: “IVORY” ruled out
- “IVY” too short
- “INNER” no
- “ICING” no
- “IDYLL” L ruled out
- “IGLOO” O ruled out
- “IMAGO” A, O, G, M – M, A, O ruled out
- “Ilium” no
- “IKIWI” not a word
- “IGGYP” no

Seems like “PIGGY” is the simplest valid word fitting constraints.

Let me check “PIGGY” meets all:
- P, I, G, G, Y – Y in 5, I in 4 (not 2 or 3), P and G are new, G is allowed (not ruled out)
- All letters: P, I, G, G, Y – none are in the banned list

Therefore, PIGGY is a valid next guess.

Therefore I cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
The only remaining place for I is position 1.

So the word must be: I _ _ _ Y

We need three consonants to fill positions 2,3,4, all distinct and from the allowed set.

Another candidate: “WICCY” – not valid.  
“CHIMY” – M banned.  
“WHITY” – T banned.  
“KIVVY” – V, K allowed, but double V.

The best valid word fitting all constraints turns out to be “WICCY” but it is not recognized.  
However, “WIMPY” was ruled out earlier (M banned).  
“BIVVY” – B, I, V, V, Y – B, V allowed, double V acceptable. This is a recognized word for a small tent.

Checking:  
B – allowed  
I – must be in position 1  
V – allowed  
V – allowed (repeat okay)  
Y – allowed  

Therefore “BIVVY” is acceptable.

Another simple one: “DIXXY” – but X is allowed, though less common.

Among common choices, “BIVVY” is best.

Current locked-in facts:

1. Y must be in position 5 (✓ on every guess).
2. I is definitely in the word, but it has now been tried in positions 2, 3, 4 (twice), and 1 (BIVVY) and always came back “-”.  
   → The only remaining possibility is that I is in position 2.  
   (Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are now impossible for I.)

3. Letters completely ruled out:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, G, P, B, V  
   → Still-allowed consonants: C, D, H, K, W, X, Z …  
   → Still-allowed vowels: only I (others are all out).

So the pattern must be:  
_ I _ _ Y

We need three consonants (positions 1, 3, 4) from the still-allowed set.

Looking at the Wordle dictionary, the only common 5-letter word that fits _ I _ _ Y with all letters from the allowed set is:

C I D Y Y  → invalid (double Y)  
W I C K Y → W, I, C, K, Y — all allowed  
(“WICKY” is not a standard word, but “WICKY” isn’t valid; the valid word is “WICKY”? Actually, “WICKY” isn’t listed in Wordle’s lexicon. Recheck.)

Valid dictionary entries:  
- “DICKEY” (too long)  
- “WIDGY” – G is out  
- “WICKY” – not valid  
- “CIGGY” – G out  
- “KINKY” – K, I, N, K, Y – N out  
- “DICKY” – D, I, C, K, Y – D, C, K allowed, Y in 5, I in 2 — this is 5 letters and valid.

Check letters: D, I, C, K, Y  
All are still permitted, and the pattern _ I _ _ Y is met with I in position 2 (never yet marked ✓, so it’s possible).

Therefore DICKY is the only remaining viable common word.

(Confirming: D, I, C, K, Y – none have been ruled out; positions: D(1) I(2) C(3) K(4) Y(5) – perfect.)
