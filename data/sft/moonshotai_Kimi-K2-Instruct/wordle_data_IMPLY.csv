For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants quickly. Good starting words often include a mix of common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good feedback on letter presence and positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the target word.  
That eliminates the most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Since no vowel from AROSE is allowed, the remaining common vowels are I and U.  
For consonants, I can safely pick from letters not in {A, R, O, S, E}.  
A well-known starting mix that avoids those letters is U, I, T, N, L.

What we know so far:

- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: Y (correct position 5) and I (somewhere in the word, but not position 3).

Common remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels to consider: only I is confirmed; Y is also acting as a vowel-like ending.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with Y (position 5 = Y),
- contains I somewhere other than position 3,
- uses only letters from the allowed set {B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Z} plus I and Y.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants quickly. Good starting words often include a mix of common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". These cover multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good feedback on letter presence and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the target word.  
That eliminates the most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Since no vowel from AROSE is allowed, the remaining common vowels are I and U.  
For consonants, I can safely pick from letters not in {A, R, O, S, E}.  
A well-known starting mix that avoids those letters is U, I, T, N, L.

A 5-letter word that uses some of these is “UNITY”.

Common remaining consonants: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels to consider: only I is confirmed; Y is also acting as a vowel-like ending.  

We need a 5-letter word that:

Letters confirmed IN the word:  
- Y (must be at position 5)  
- I (must be somewhere other than positions 2 or 3)

Unused letters still available from the alphabet (no X, K, Z yet):  
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y, containing I, with I not in positions 2 or 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
- _ I _ _ Y (I in position 2) → ruled out by feedback (I cannot be in 2).  
- _ _ I _ Y (I in position 3) → ruled out by feedback.  
- I _ _ _ Y (I in position 1)  
- _ _ _ I Y (I in position 4)  

Next, search for valid 5-letter words ending in Y, containing I, avoiding banned letters.

Candidate words:  
- DINGY – uses D, G (allowed); I in position 2 → invalid.  
- WICKY – W, C, K allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- VICID – doesn’t end in Y.  
- PIGGY – I in position 2 → invalid.  
- JIMPY – M banned.  
- HICKY – H, C, K allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- KIPPY – P allowed, I in position 2 → invalid.  
- BIDRY – not a valid word.  
- CIVVY – V allowed, I in position 2 → invalid.  
- ZIPPY – Z, P allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- WIGGY – W, G allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- VIBGY → invalid.  

Valid options left:  
- DICKY – D, C, K allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- WILDY – L banned.  
- GIDDY – G, D allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- PICKY – P, C, K allowed; I in position 2 → invalid.  
- JIMMY – M banned.  

Wait – none of these work because all have I in position 2 or 3. Let’s look for I in position 1 or 4.

I _ _ _ Y:  
- IVORY – V allowed, O banned → invalid.  
- ICILY – C allowed, but second I is in position 3 → invalid.  
- ICKY – too short.  
- IDYLL – L banned.  

_ _ _ I Y:  
- HIPPY – P allowed, I in position 4, ends in Y. H, P allowed.  
- ZIPPY – I in position 4, Z, P allowed.  
- WIMPY – M banned.  
- JIFFY – F, J allowed; I in position 4.  
- BIDDY – D allowed; I in position 4.  

From these, HIPPY, JIFFY, BIDDY, ZIPPY are valid.  
HIPPY and ZIPPY share letters with banned letters? No – H, I, P, Y, Z are all allowed.  
Choose HIPPY for its common letters.

Letters definitely in the word:  
- Y (position 5, ✓ every time)  
- I (somewhere, shown by “-” in guesses)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, H  

Unused letters still available:  
B, C, D, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Structure we are looking for:  
_ _ P I Y  (I must be in position 4, since positions 2, 3, and 5 are taken or known)  
OR  
_ I P _ Y  (but position 4 is unknown)  

We need a 5-letter word that:  
- ends in Y,  
- has P in position 3,  
- has I in position 4,  
- uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities that fit the pattern _ _ P I Y.

Check dictionary:  
DIPPY – D, I, P, P, Y → valid word, letters all allowed.  
GIPPY – G, I, P, P, Y → valid word, letters all allowed.  
HIPPY – already guessed, H banned (invalid).  

Between DIPPY and GIPPY, both fit constraints.  
Choose DIPPY since D is common and hasn’t been tested yet.

Still-unused letters (alphabet minus the banned ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends  . . P I Y
- starts with one of the still-unused letters (B C G J K Q V W X Z)
- uses only allowed letters

The pattern is: _ _ P I Y

Looking for dictionary words that match **??PIY** and use only the allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ZIPPY – but Z and P, P, I, Y; P already in place, Z allowed.  
- GIPPY – G allowed.  
- KIPPY – K allowed.  
- CIPPY – C allowed.  
- BIPPY – B allowed.  
- JIPPY – J allowed.  
- VIPPY – V allowed.  
- QIPPY – Q allowed.  

All fit the pattern, but we have only one guess left.  
Among these, **ZIPPY** is the most common English word, and none of its letters are banned.  
Therefore ZIPPY satisfies every constraint.
