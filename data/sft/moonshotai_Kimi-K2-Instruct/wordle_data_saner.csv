For the first guess, the best approach is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to quickly identify possible letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of frequent letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One of the most optimal starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination provides good coverage of frequent letters and helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(✓) : The first letter is S.
- L(x) : L is not in the word.
- A(-) : A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) : T is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word starts with S, contains A and E somewhere (but A not in position 3 and E not in position 5), and does not contain L or T. We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A and E, and avoids L and T.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1 (but 1 is S), 2, 3, 4

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S _ _ A E (but E can’t be in 5)
- S _ A _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
- S A _ _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
- S _ E A _ (possible)
- S E _ _ A (possible)
- S _ _ E A (possible)

Some candidate words:
- SPEAR (S, P, E, A, R) – fits all constraints: starts with S, has A and E, no L or T, A is in 4 (not 3), E is in 3 (not 5).
- SHARE – but H is not ruled out yet, but let’s see if it’s better.
- STEAK – but T is ruled out.
- SCARE – C is possible, but let’s check SPEAR first.

SPEAR seems like a strong next guess.

Summary of constraints so far:

1. Correct letters in their positions:
   - S in position 1
   - R in position 5

2. Letters that are present but misplaced:
   - A (not in position 3)
   - E (not in position 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - L, T, P

4. Word structure now looks like: S _ _ _ R

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in position 2 or 4
- E can be in position 2, 3, or 4

Let’s list possible combinations:

Case 1: A in position 2 → S A _ _ R  
   Then E must be in position 3 or 4  
   - S A E _ R → SAE_R → need a valid word: SAE_R can’t form a valid word (no vowel/consonant pattern fits here easily)
   - S A _ E R → SA_ER → possible words: SAGER (but G isn’t tested yet), SAFER (F not tested yet), SANER (N not tested yet), SABER (B not tested yet)

Case 2: A in position 4 → S _ _ A R  
   Then E must be in position 2 or 3  
   - S E _ A R → SE_AR → possible words: SEGAR (but G not tested), SEPAR (not a word), SEDAR (not a word), SEMAR (not a word)
   - S _ E A R → S_EAR → possible words: SMEAR (M not tested yet), SHEAR (H not tested yet)

From these options, the most promising valid words are:
- SAFER (A in 2, E in 4, F not yet tested)
- SANER (A in 2, E in 4, N not yet tested)
- SMEAR (E in 2, A in 4, M not yet tested)
- SABER (A in 2, E in 4, B not yet tested)

All these fit the constraints. Among them, ""SANER"" or ""SABER"" seem good because they introduce new consonants (N or B) to test. ""SANER"" is slightly more common in everyday usage, so I'll go with that.
