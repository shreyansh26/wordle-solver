For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting hits. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, T, L) which can help quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE were rejected, so we now know the secret word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.  
We need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels.  
Common consonants not yet tried: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Common vowels not yet tried: O, I, U.  
A balanced first follow-up guess is often “CRONY” or “DONOR”, but to maximize coverage I’ll pick a word that uses three new vowels plus two new consonants.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, N, D

Letters confirmed in the word (but in wrong positions): R, O, U

So the secret word definitely contains R, O, U somewhere, but NOT in the positions they appeared in ROUND (i.e., R is not 1st, O is not 2nd, U is not 3rd).

Remaining common consonants still allowed (not yet used): C, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels still allowed: I, (Y sometimes); O and U are already confirmed, A and E are out.

We have R, O, U locked in; we need two more letters, ideally common consonants.

A good next step is to try R, O, U in new positions and add two fresh common consonants.  One balanced choice is “CURIO” – it reuses all three known letters plus C and I.  But “I” is still untested; swapping “I” for another consonant might be safer.

Another balanced option with known-good letters plus two new common consonants: “PORCH” – but O is in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Instead, let’s place R, O, U in new positions and pick two high-frequency consonants: C and M.  A valid word is “CORNU” but that keeps U in 4th place, which is allowed (no prior info on 4th).  However, CORNU is obscure.

A more common word: “CRUMP” – uses C, M with R, O, U, but U is in position 3, which was already marked wrong in ROUND.

Better: move U to 1st, R to 3rd, O to 4th, and add two new consonants.  That gives U _ R O _.  Common word: “CURIO” again, but it has I.

Another high-frequency consonant pair: B and K.  Try “BROOK”: but O is in 2nd position which is disallowed.

A solid word that respects all constraints:
- Uses R, O, U
- Moves each to a new position (R≠1, O≠2, U≠3)
- Adds two new common consonants

Satisfying all: “CROUP” – C (new), R (moved to 2nd), O (moved to 3rd), U (moved to 4th), P (new).  All constraints satisfied.

So the next guess is CROUP.

Current knowledge:

Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, N, D, P  
Letters confirmed in the word (but wrong positions): R, O  
Letters confirmed in the exact position: U in 4th spot  

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ U _

Available letters: all consonants except S, L, T, N, D, P  
Available vowels: I, plus the already confirmed R and O must appear somewhere in the remaining slots 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not in their previous wrong positions).

We have to place R and O into any of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, and fill the remaining two empty spots with new letters (preferably high-frequency consonants).

Possible placements for R and O (avoiding their previous wrong positions):
- R was in 1st in ROUND and 2nd in CROUP, so R cannot be 1 or 2.
- O was in 2nd in ROUND and 3rd in CROUP, so O cannot be 2 or 3.

Therefore:
- R can only go in positions 3 or 5
- O can only go in positions 1 or 5

Let’s consider the combinations:

1) R in 3, O in 1 → pattern O _ R U _
   Fill remaining two spots (positions 2 and 5) with new consonants.
   A common word fitting this: O B R U M (OB RUM – not valid), O B R U T (OB RUT – not a word), O C R U X (not common), O F R U M (no), etc. – nothing common.

2) R in 3, O in 5 → pattern _ _ R U O
   Fill positions 1 and 2 with new consonants.
   Good candidate: M I R U O (invalid), C H R U O (CH RUO – no), F R U O (no), etc. – again no common word.

3) R in 5, O in 1 → pattern O _ _ U R
   Fill positions 2 and 3 with new consonants.
   Candidate: O C H U R – invalid, O B J U R – invalid, O M B U R – invalid, O P Q U R – invalid. No common word.

4) R in 5, O in 2 → but O cannot be in 2 (was 2 in ROUND, ruled out).

5) R in 5, O in 5 – impossible (both can't be in 5).

Thus, the only plausible placements are R in 3 and O in 1 or 5.  The common words fitting are scarce.  Let me think of valid English words:

- ""HUMOR"" comes to mind as a valid 5-letter word: H U M O R.  
  Check constraints:  
  - Contains U in 2nd position – but we know U must be in 4th.  So HUMOR is invalid.

- ""FUROR"" – U in 2nd, same problem.

- ""JUROR"" – U in 2nd.

- ""COURT"" – U in 3rd, invalid.

- ""GOURD"" – U in 3rd, but D is eliminated.

- ""FLUOR"" – U in 3rd.

- ""GROUP"" – but P eliminated.

- ""O R B U M"" – invalid.

- ""B U R R O"" – invalid.

- ""M U R R O"" – invalid.

- ""W O R U M"" – invalid.

Actually, let me re-examine the placement constraints more carefully.  For R and O:

R was in 1st in ROUND and 2nd in CROUP → so R cannot be 1 or 2.  Thus R can be 3, 4, or 5.  But 4 is taken by U.  So R can be 3 or 5.

O was in 2nd in ROUND and 3rd in CROUP → so O cannot be 2 or 3.  Thus O can be 1, 4, or 5.  4 is taken by U.  So O can be 1 or 5.

Thus valid placements:

Case 1: R in 3, O in 1 → O _ R U _
Case 2: R in 3, O in 5 → _ _ R U O
Case 3: R in 5, O in 1 → O _ _ U R
Case 4: R in 5, O in 5 – impossible.

Now, let’s find common words fitting:

Case 1: O _ R U _  
Need consonants for positions 2 and 5.  
Valid word: ""FORUM"" – F O R U M.  
Check: F, M are new, R is in 3 (allowed), O is in 2 – but O cannot be in 2 (was 2 in ROUND).  So FORUM is invalid.

""CORUM"" – C and M new, but O is in 2 – invalid.

""GORUM"" – no.

""BORUM"" – no.

""JORUM"" – no.

Case 2: _ _ R U O  
Need consonants for 1 and 2.  
Valid word: ""CHRUO"" – invalid.  
""SHRUO"" – invalid.  
""BRUIO"" – no.  
Actually, no common word.

Case 3: O _ _ U R  
Need consonants for 2 and 3.  
Valid word: ""OCCUR"" – O C C U R.  
Check: C is new, C in 2, C in 3 – but R is in 5 (allowed), O is in 1 (allowed), U in 4 (correct), no eliminated letters.  
OCCUR is a valid English word, and it satisfies all constraints.

Let me verify:

O – allowed in 1st (O was previously in 2 and 3, so 1 is okay)  
C – new  
C – new  
U – locked in 4th  
R – allowed in 5th (R was 1st and 2nd before, 5th is okay)  

No eliminated letters.  All good.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""OCCUR"".
