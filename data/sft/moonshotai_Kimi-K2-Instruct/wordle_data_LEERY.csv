For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Common starting guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A, T, E are all vowels that appear frequently
- This gives us good coverage across different positions

This should help us quickly identify which common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (✗)
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (✗)
- T is NOT in the word (✗)
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So we know:
- The letters L and E are somewhere in the word, but we don’t know where yet.
- S, A, T are definitely out.
- The word has two vowels so far: E (and potentially others like I, O, U, Y, but A is out).

Good next words contain L and E in different positions, and avoid S, A, T. A common strategy is to try words with new letters while placing known letters in new spots. 

A strong follow-up is “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U are new letters.
- L is moved from position 2 to 4.
- E is moved from position 5 to 3.
- Avoids all banned letters (S, A, T).

This should help place L and E correctly and test C, R, U.

Current state summary

Letters we now know:
- Absent (x): S, A, T, C, U, O, D  
- Present somewhere (-): L, E, R  

Placements we have ruled out:
- L ≠ positions 2, 4 (from guesses 1 and 3) and position 3 (guess 2) → L must be 1 or 5  
- E ≠ positions 3, 5 (from guesses 1 and 3) and position 4 (guess 2) → E must be 1 or 2  
- R ≠ position 2 (guess 2) and position 5 (guess 3) → R must be 1, 3, or 4  

We still need to test one more vowel and a couple of common consonants that haven’t appeared yet (N, I, Y, etc.).  
Because L can only be 1 or 5 and E only 1 or 2, we can try a word that forces both letters into possible positions while introducing new letters.

A word that fits:
- uses L, E, R once each  
- places L in position 5 (forcing it to stay or be confirmed)  
- places E in position 2 (forcing it to stay or be confirmed)  
- introduces new letters I and N (common but not yet used)

Candidate word: “INLER” – but INLER is not in common word lists.  
Instead, “LINER” fits: L in 1, I and N new, E in 3 (still within its allowed positions 1 or 2), R in 5 – but R already ruled out at 5 (guess 3).  
Let me adjust: “LINED” uses D, already banned.  
A better dictionary match that keeps the needed placement constraints: “LIFER” (but F new, and R is placed in 4).  

Rechecking:
L must be 1 or 5  
E must be 1 or 2  

Try the word “LINED” – D already banned.  
Next: “LIVER” – V new, but E would be 4 (already ruled out).  
Next: “LIVER” no good.

Better: “RELIC” uses C (banned), no good.  
“RENAL” uses A (banned).  
“REIGN” – G new, I new, N new. Places R 1, E 2, I 3, G 4, N 5.  
But E must be 1 or 2, so E in 2 is allowed; R in 1 is allowed.  
All letters used are not on the banned list.

Therefore “REIGN” satisfies:
- contains R (position 1), E (position 2) both allowed
- contains new letters I, G, N
- no banned letters

This should give the tightest next information.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LEERY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Common starting guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A, T, E are all vowels that appear frequently
- This gives us good coverage across different positions

This should help us quickly identify which common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (✗)
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (✗)
- T is NOT in the word (✗)
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So we know:
- The letters L and E are somewhere in the word, but we don’t know where yet.
- S, A, T are definitely out.
- The word has two vowels so far: E (and potentially others like I, O, U, Y, but A is out).

Good next words contain L and E in different positions, and avoid S, A, T. A common strategy is to try words with new letters while placing known letters in new spots. 

A strong follow-up is “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U are new letters.
- L is moved from position 2 to 4.
- E is moved from position 5 to 3.
- Avoids all banned letters (S, A, T).

This should help place L and E correctly and test C, R, U.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we can build a definitive list of letters that are present, absent, and their positions:

Absent letters (x): S, A, T, C, U  
Present letters (-): L, E, R  (each appears somewhere but is not yet in the right slot)

Known positions so far (5 slots):
1. ?  
2. ?  
3. ?  
4. ?  
5. ?  

L must be in 1, 3, or 5 (it was positions 2 and 4 in the previous guesses and always marked -).  
E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (it was 5 and 3 previously).  
R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was 2 previously).

I want a word that:
- Uses all three known letters (L, E, R) so we can lock their positions.  
- Introduces two new common letters that have not yet been tried (e.g., N and D to cover more ground).  
- Keeps the known letters in fresh slots.

A good candidate is “OLDER”  
Positions:  
O – new, vowel, hasn’t been tested.  
L – new position 2.  
D – new consonant.  
E – new position 4.  
R – new position 5.

This should let us confirm or adjust L, E, R placement while gaining new information from O and D.

We now have four rounds of feedback.

Summary of what we know:

Absent letters (x): S, A, T, C, U, O, D, I, G, N  
Present/evaluated letters:
- L (in word but wrong spot in every try so far)
- R (only in word, wrong spot, but not in position 1)
- E (now locked in position 2)

Positions confirmed:
- Position 2 is E (✓)

Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled only from allowed letters.
Allowed letters at this point (not yet ruled out): B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed as absent). But we know:
- L must be somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 but not 2)
- R must be somewhere (positions 3, 4, 5 because position 1 was tried as R(-) in guess 4)  
So word has letters: E (fixed in position 2), L, R, plus two other letters from the allowed set.

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Contains L and R in positions 3,4,5 (since R can't be 1 and L can't be 2)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible structure: _ E L R _ or _ E _ L R, etc.

A good candidate: FERLY (archaic but valid) - uses F, Y which haven't been tested, and places L and R in new spots.

But to be more certain, let's try a word that places L and R in distinct positions and introduces new common letters.

Let's try ""JEWEL"" – but W and J might be too rare. 

Another candidate: ""HERLS"" – but S is banned.

Another: ""PERLS"" – S banned.

How about ""FLEER"" – repeats E, but we only know one E is fixed. But we need 5 distinct letters.

Wait, better: ""MELER"" – not a word.

Let's try ""MERLE"" – M, E (locked at 2), R (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5). But E is already at 2, so this would have two Es, which is allowed unless contradicted.

But ""MERLE"" is a valid word (a type of bird/color) and uses:
- M (new)
- E (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3)
- L (position 4)
- E (position 5)

This tests:
- L in 4 (new)
- R in 3 (new)
- M is new
- Double E is allowed

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for L and R and introduces M.

A good candidate: FERLY (archaic but valid) - uses F, Y which haven't been tested, and places L and R in new spots.

But to be more certain, let's try a word that places L and R in distinct positions and introduces new common letters.

Let's try ""JEWEL"" – but W and J might be too rare. 

Another candidate: ""HERLS"" – but S is banned.

Another: ""PERLS"" – S banned.

How about ""FLEER"" – repeats E, but we only know one E is fixed. But we need 5 distinct letters.

Wait, better: ""MELER"" – not a word.

Let's try ""MERLE"" – M, E (locked at 2), R (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5). But E is already at 2, so this would have two Es, which is allowed unless contradicted.

But ""MERLE"" is a valid word (a type of bird/color) and uses:
- M (new)
- E (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3)
- L (position 4)
- E (position 5)

This tests:
- L in 4 (new)
- R in 3 (new)
- M is new
- Double E is allowed

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for L and R and introduces M.",Guess 5: MERLE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) R(-) L(-) E(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LEERY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Common starting guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- L is also common
- A, T, E are all vowels that appear frequently
- This gives us good coverage across different positions

This should help us quickly identify which common letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (✗)
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (✗)
- T is NOT in the word (✗)
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So we know:
- The letters L and E are somewhere in the word, but we don’t know where yet.
- S, A, T are definitely out.
- The word has two vowels so far: E (and potentially others like I, O, U, Y, but A is out).

Good next words contain L and E in different positions, and avoid S, A, T. A common strategy is to try words with new letters while placing known letters in new spots. 

A strong follow-up is “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U are new letters.
- L is moved from position 2 to 4.
- E is moved from position 5 to 3.
- Avoids all banned letters (S, A, T).

This should help place L and E correctly and test C, R, U.

Guess 2: CRUEL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) U(x) E(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we can build a definitive list of letters that are present, absent, and their positions:

Absent letters (x): S, A, T, C, U  
Present letters (-): L, E, R  (each appears somewhere but is not yet in the right slot)

Known positions so far (5 slots):
1. ?  
2. ?  
3. ?  
4. ?  
5. ?  

L must be in 1, 3, or 5 (it was positions 2 and 4 in the previous guesses and always marked -).  
E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (it was 5 and 3 previously).  
R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was 2 previously).

I want a word that:
- Uses all three known letters (L, E, R) so we can lock their positions.  
- Introduces two new common letters that have not yet been tried (e.g., N and D to cover more ground).  
- Keeps the known letters in fresh slots.

A good candidate is “OLDER”  
Positions:  
O – new, vowel, hasn’t been tested.  
L – new position 2.  
D – new consonant.  
E – new position 4.  
R – new position 5.

This should let us confirm or adjust L, E, R placement while gaining new information from O and D.

Guess 3: OLDER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) L(-) D(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state summary

Letters we now know:
- Absent (x): S, A, T, C, U, O, D  
- Present somewhere (-): L, E, R  

Placements we have ruled out:
- L ≠ positions 2, 4 (from guesses 1 and 3) and position 3 (guess 2) → L must be 1 or 5  
- E ≠ positions 3, 5 (from guesses 1 and 3) and position 4 (guess 2) → E must be 1 or 2  
- R ≠ position 2 (guess 2) and position 5 (guess 3) → R must be 1, 3, or 4  

We still need to test one more vowel and a couple of common consonants that haven’t appeared yet (N, I, Y, etc.).  
Because L can only be 1 or 5 and E only 1 or 2, we can try a word that forces both letters into possible positions while introducing new letters.

A word that fits:
- uses L, E, R once each  
- places L in position 5 (forcing it to stay or be confirmed)  
- places E in position 2 (forcing it to stay or be confirmed)  
- introduces new letters I and N (common but not yet used)

Candidate word: “INLER” – but INLER is not in common word lists.  
Instead, “LINER” fits: L in 1, I and N new, E in 3 (still within its allowed positions 1 or 2), R in 5 – but R already ruled out at 5 (guess 3).  
Let me adjust: “LINED” uses D, already banned.  
A better dictionary match that keeps the needed placement constraints: “LIFER” (but F new, and R is placed in 4).  

Rechecking:
L must be 1 or 5  
E must be 1 or 2  

Try the word “LINED” – D already banned.  
Next: “LIVER” – V new, but E would be 4 (already ruled out).  
Next: “LIVER” no good.

Better: “RELIC” uses C (banned), no good.  
“RENAL” uses A (banned).  
“REIGN” – G new, I new, N new. Places R 1, E 2, I 3, G 4, N 5.  
But E must be 1 or 2, so E in 2 is allowed; R in 1 is allowed.  
All letters used are not on the banned list.

Therefore “REIGN” satisfies:
- contains R (position 1), E (position 2) both allowed
- contains new letters I, G, N
- no banned letters

This should give the tightest next information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have four rounds of feedback.

Summary of what we know:

Absent letters (x): S, A, T, C, U, O, D, I, G, N  
Present/evaluated letters:
- L (in word but wrong spot in every try so far)
- R (only in word, wrong spot, but not in position 1)
- E (now locked in position 2)

Positions confirmed:
- Position 2 is E (✓)

Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled only from allowed letters.
Allowed letters at this point (not yet ruled out): B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed as absent). But we know:
- L must be somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 but not 2)
- R must be somewhere (positions 3, 4, 5 because position 1 was tried as R(-) in guess 4)  
So word has letters: E (fixed in position 2), L, R, plus two other letters from the allowed set.

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Contains L and R in positions 3,4,5 (since R can't be 1 and L can't be 2)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible structure: _ E L R _ or _ E _ L R, etc.

A good candidate: FERLY (archaic but valid) - uses F, Y which haven't been tested, and places L and R in new spots.

But to be more certain, let's try a word that places L and R in distinct positions and introduces new common letters.

Let's try ""JEWEL"" – but W and J might be too rare. 

Another candidate: ""HERLS"" – but S is banned.

How about ""FLEER"" – repeats E, but we only know one E is fixed. But we need 5 distinct letters.

Wait, better: ""MELER"" – not a word.

Let's try ""MERLE"" – M, E (locked at 2), R (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5). But E is already at 2, so this would have two Es, which is allowed unless contradicted.

But ""MERLE"" is a valid word (a type of bird/color) and uses:
- M (new)
- E (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3)
- L (position 4)
- E (position 5)

This tests:
- L in 4 (new)
- R in 3 (new)
- M is new
- Double E is allowed

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for L and R and introduces M.

Let's consolidate what we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are OUT (x):
S, A, T, C, U, O, D, I, G, N, M

Letters that are IN (confirmed at least once by a dash):
L, E, R  

We also have one absolute positional fact:
- Position 2 is E (✓ from both REIGN and MERLE)

So the word looks like:  _  E  _  _  _

The remaining letters must be drawn from:
E, L, R (plus any other letters not yet declared out: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Constraints on the three letters we know must appear:
- E is fixed at position 2.  
- R has appeared with “wrong position” in every column except column 2 (which is already E).  
  Therefore R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- L has appeared with “wrong position” in columns 2, 3, 4, 5 so far.  
  The only spot never tried for L is column 1.  
  ⇒ L must be in position 1.

This pins down:
1: L  
2: E  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?  

We still need both R and one more letter (which could be a second E, or another consonant).  
Because we have only three letters left to place and we already know R must appear, we can test a structure that places R in one of the open slots and fills the remaining one with a fresh consonant.
