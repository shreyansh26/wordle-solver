For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of hitting letters in the secret word. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like ""S"", ""T"", ""R"", ""N"", or ""L"". 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters in various positions.

The first guess “SLATE” produced five x’s, meaning none of its letters—S, L, A, T, E—appear in the hidden word at all.  
That information immediately eliminates many common English words, so my next guess should avoid those five letters entirely and instead probe a fresh set of high-frequency letters.

Good candidates for the remaining common letters include:
- R, I, N, O, U, C, H, D, P, M, etc.

A balanced starter word using five distinct, frequent letters not yet ruled out is “CHORI” (C, H, O, R, I). Testing these letters will give maximal new information while respecting the constraints.

1. The word starts with C.
2. The word contains an I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The remaining letters (positions 2-5) must be chosen from the still-unused alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters.
