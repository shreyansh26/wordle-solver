For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Good options include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Very common consonant  
- E: Most common vowel

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down future guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all “x”, so they are NOT in the word at all.
- E is “✓”, so the word ends with the letter E in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, L, A, T
- Last letter is E
- Still need four other letters, none of which can be S, L, A, or T.

Common remaining consonants that haven’t been tested yet: R, N, C, M, P, D, F, G, H, K, B, V, W, Y, etc.
Common remaining vowels (since A is out): I, O, U are still possible.

Let’s try a word that uses frequently-occurring consonants and a fresh vowel, and ends in E. A good candidate is “CRIME”:
- C, R, I, M haven’t been used yet.
- Ends in E.

It satisfies all constraints.

So far we have:

- E is definitely in position 5 (✓).
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, I, M.

We also know positions 1-4 cannot contain any of these nine letters.

Still-available consonants (common ones): D, N, G, B, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y …  
Still-available vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

We need four new letters for positions 1-4, none of which are in the forbidden set, followed by the already-fixed E in position 5.

A good mix of fresh common letters is D, O, N, G.  
Putting them in the order D-O-N-G gives “DONGE”, but that isn’t a real English word.  
Re-arranging them into a valid word: “DOGNE” – still invalid.  
Next common combination: B-O-U-N → “BOUNE” – invalid.  

A valid 5-letter word meeting the constraints is “PUDGE”:
- P, U, D, G have not been used yet.
- Ends in E.
- Contains no forbidden letters.

Hence, “PUDGE” is a solid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, I, M, P, U.
- Letters confirmed in the word (but positions unknown): D, G.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ D E or _ _ D _ E or _ D _ _ E or D _ _ _ E, with letters from the remaining pool.

Remaining available letters (not yet used or ruled out):
Vowels: O, Y (Y can act as a vowel)
Consonants: B, F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need 2 more letters besides D, G, E to make a 5-letter word.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in E that contain D and G but none of the forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""HEDGE"" - but H hasn't been tested and E is already fixed at end
- ""BUDGE"" - but U is forbidden
- ""WEDGE"" - W hasn't been tested
- ""FUDGE"" - U is forbidden
- ""NUDGE"" - U is forbidden
- ""DODGE"" - O and D haven't been ruled out, and it's a valid word

Let's try ""DODGE"":
- Contains D and G (from PUDGE feedback)
- Ends with E
- Uses O and D which are still allowed
- Doesn't contain any forbidden letters

This seems like a good next guess.

<guess>DODGE</guess>",DODGE,"From the feedback so far:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, I, M, P, U.
- Letters confirmed in the word (but positions unknown): D, G.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ D E or _ _ D _ E or _ D _ _ E or D _ _ _ E, with letters from the remaining pool.

Remaining available letters (not yet used or ruled out):
Vowels: O, Y (Y can act as a vowel)
Consonants: B, F, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
