For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the target word. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it covers multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let's parse the new feedback from ""TONED"":

- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (we originally thought it was fixed at position 5, but this contradicts the first feedback: E was ✓ in AROSE which had E in position 5. Therefore, the E(-) here must mean that E is in the word but *not* in position 4. Since AROSE had E(✓) in position 5, the only consistent interpretation is that E must be in position 5 – so the E(-) here is potentially confusing. However, re-reading: the feedback symbols are relative to the guess, so in TONED, E was in position 4, and the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already know from AROSE that E is acceptable in position 5, this is consistent.)
- D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

Summary:
- O is locked in position 2.
- E is in the word and must be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback).
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N.

So the word structure is:
_ O _ _ E

And we need to place D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, plus two other letters from the remaining pool (excluding A, R, S, T, N).

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (others may be used if needed but O and E are already placed).

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: D, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, I, U.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ E with D in one of the blanks.

Let's think of words:
- DOBLE? Not a word.
- COBDE? Not a word.
- PODGE? Not a word.
- LODGE – this fits:
   - L, O, D, G, E
   - O is position 2 (✓)
   - E is position 5 (✓)
   - D is position 3 (allowed since it can't be position 5)
   - L and G are new consonants
   - No ruled-out letters (A, R, S, T, N) are present.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Common starting words include those with letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the target word. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it covers multiple vowels and common consonants.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E must be the last letter (position 5).
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- A, R, and S are completely absent.

Letters I still need to place: O (somewhere except position 3) and four new letters that don’t include A, R, or S.

Good candidates for the remaining four slots should be consonants that are common and not yet ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, P, etc. Vowels are mostly ruled out except for the already-found O (and the fixed E at the end). 

A word that fits:
- Ends with E.
- Has O somewhere not in position 3.
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or S.

I’ll try “TONED”:
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- O is in position 2 (allowed because it can’t be in position 3).
- E is in position 5 (matches ✓).
- No A, R, or S.

This keeps common letters and respects all feedback.

Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's parse the new feedback from ""TONED"":

- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (we originally thought it was fixed at position 5, but this contradicts the first feedback: E was ✓ in AROSE which had E in position 5. Therefore, the E(-) here must mean that E is in the word but *not* in position 4. Since AROSE had E(✓) in position 5, the only consistent interpretation is that E must be in position 5 – so the E(-) here is potentially confusing. However, re-reading: the feedback symbols are relative to the guess, so in TONED, E was in position 4, and the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already know from AROSE that E is acceptable in position 5, this is consistent.)
- D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

Summary:
- O is locked in position 2.
- E is in the word and must be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback).
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N.

So the word structure is:
_ O _ _ E

And we need to place D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, plus two other letters from the remaining pool (excluding A, R, S, T, N).

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (others may be used if needed but O and E are already placed).

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: D, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, I, U.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ E with D in one of the blanks.

Let's think of words:
- DOBLE? Not a word.
- COBDE? Not a word.
- PODGE? Not a word.
- LODGE – this fits:
   - L, O, D, G, E
   - O is position 2 (✓)
   - E is position 5 (✓)
   - D is position 3 (allowed since it can't be position 5)
   - L and G are new consonants
   - No ruled-out letters (A, R, S, T, N) are present.

So ""LODGE"" seems like a strong candidate.

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the target word. Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it covers multiple vowels and common consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E must be the last letter (position 5).
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- A, R, and S are completely absent.

Letters I still need to place: O (somewhere except position 3) and four new letters that don’t include A, R, or S.

Good candidates for the remaining four slots should be consonants that are common and not yet ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, P, etc. Vowels are mostly ruled out except for the already-found O (and the fixed E at the end). 

A word that fits:
- Ends with E.
- Has O somewhere not in position 3.
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or S.

I’ll try “TONED”:
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- O is in position 2 (allowed because it can’t be in position 3).
- E is in position 5 (matches ✓).
- No A, R, or S.

This keeps common letters and respects all feedback.

<guess>TONED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's parse the new feedback from ""TONED"":

- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (we originally thought it was fixed at position 5, but this contradicts the first feedback: E was ✓ in AROSE which had E in position 5. Therefore, the E(-) here must mean that E is in the word but *not* in position 4. Since AROSE had E(✓) in position 5, the only consistent interpretation is that E must be in position 5 – so the E(-) here is potentially confusing. However, re-reading: the feedback symbols are relative to the guess, so in TONED, E was in position 4, and the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4. Since we already know from AROSE that E is acceptable in position 5, this is consistent.)
- D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

Summary:
- O is locked in position 2.
- E is in the word and must be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback).
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N.

So the word structure is:
_ O _ _ E

And we need to place D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, plus two other letters from the remaining pool (excluding A, R, S, T, N).

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (others may be used if needed but O and E are already placed).

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: D, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, I, U.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ E with D in one of the blanks.

Let's think of words:
- DOBLE? Not a word.
- COBDE? Not a word.
- PODGE? Not a word.
- LODGE – this fits:
   - L, O, D, G, E
   - O is position 2 (✓)
   - E is position 5 (✓)
   - D is position 3 (allowed since it can't be position 5)
   - L and G are new consonants
   - No ruled-out letters (A, R, S, T, N) are present.

So ""LODGE"" seems like a strong candidate.

<guess>LODGE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TONED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) D(-)
Guess 3: LODGE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- Position 1: L(x) → first letter is **not** L.
- Position 2: O(✓) → second letter **must** be O.
- Position 3: D(✓) → third letter **must** be D.
- Position 4: G(✓) → fourth letter **must** be G.
- Position 5: E(✓) → fifth letter **must** be E.

So the only unknown is the first letter, and the pattern is:

_ O D G E

We just need a valid 5-letter word that starts with any letter except L, A, R, S, T, N (those have already been ruled out).

The remaining possible starting letters include: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s check common words matching ?ODGE:

- BODGE – yes, valid (British informal: “bodge”)
- CODGE – not standard
- FODGE – not standard
- HODGE – rare, often part of a name
- MODGE – not standard
- PODGE – yes, valid (informal for a chubby person)
- WODGE – yes, valid (British informal for a chunk/lump)

Among these, the clearest standard word is “BODGE”.

Therefore, the next guess should start with B.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the exact pattern:  
_ O D G E  

Letters that have been eliminated for the first position (from previous feedback):  
A, R, S, T, N, L, B  

We need a 5-letter word of the form ?ODGE where the first letter is still allowed.  
Let’s list common English words that fit:

- CODGE – not standard
- FODGE – not standard
- HODGE – uncommon
- JODGE – not a word
- MODGE – not standard
- PODGE – valid (informal)
- WODGE – valid (British informal)
- YODGE – not standard
- KODGE – not standard
- VODGE – not standard

Among these, the clearest valid choices are “PODGE” and “WODGE”. Between them, “PODGE” is more widely recognized in everyday usage.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “PODGE”.
