For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some correct letters. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". It includes:
- A (vowel)
- R (consonant)
- O (vowel)
- S (consonant)
- E (vowel)

This gives a good mix of frequently used letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Starts with S, has E in the 3rd position.
- Uses new letters not yet tested.
- Uses U as the only remaining vowel possibility.

The word ""SMELT"" comes to mind:
- S ✓, _ , E ✓, _, _ – but L is new, M is new, but T is already out.
""SPELK"" – but P, L, K are new, but E is correct.

Let me try ""SPELK"" – but K is not common and P is okay, but maybe ""SELDM"" is not a word.

Wait, a better word is ""SLEPT"":
- S ✓, L (new), E ✓, P (new), T (out) – but T is out. So ""SLEPT"" is invalid.

Alternative: ""SUGED"" – but not a valid word.

Another: ""SPEND"" – but N is out.

Another: ""SUEDE"":
- S ✓, U (new vowel), E ✓, D (new), E – but we need 5 unique positions, and E is already 3rd.

Wait, the pattern is S _ E _ _.

Let me look for valid words fitting S _ E _ _ with remaining letters.

Examples: Suede, sweep, sweet, slept, sleet, etc.

From these:
- ""SLEET"" – T is out.
- ""SWEEP"" – P is new, W is new.
- ""SWEET"" – T is out.
- ""SUEDE"" – D is new, U is new vowel.

""SUEDE"" fits:
- S ✓, U (new), E ✓, D (new), E – but E is already 3rd, so 5th can't be E again as per feedback (E was - in arose, meaning not 5th). So ""SUEDE"" has E in 5th, which is invalid.

""SWEPT"" – T is out.

""SMELT"" – T is out.

""SKELP"" – K, L, P, but P is new, K is new, but is ""SKELP"" a word? It's obscure.

""SKEDS"" – not a word.

""SKENE"" – E is 3rd, but this has E in 5th which is invalid.

""SKEDS"" – no.

""SEDGE"" – D, G, but E is 3rd, and word is S E D G E – but E is 3rd and 5th, which is invalid.

""SEMIS"" – I, S, but I is out, S is first.

""SEWED"" – W, D, E, but E is 3rd.

""SHELF"" – H, L, F – new letters, H is new, L is new, F is new.

Yes, ""SHELF"":
- S ✓, H (new), E ✓, L (new), F (new). This introduces H, L, F and fits S _ E _ _.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U

A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". It includes:
- A (vowel)
- R (consonant)
- O (vowel)

- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, R, or O.  
- S is not the 4th letter.  
- E is not the 5th letter.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses S and E in different positions.  
- Avoids A, R, O.  
- Includes new common consonants to test other letters (like T, L, N, D, etc.).

A candidate that fits is ""STEIN"":
- S (1st) – satisfies that S is in the word (and 1 ≠ 4).  
- T (new consonant).  
- E (2nd) – satisfies that E is in the word (and 2 ≠ 5).  
- I (new vowel).

This should give additional information about T, I, N while preserving the known letters S and E.

From the feedback on ""speed"":
- S(✓) – confirmed first position.  
- P(x) – P is not in the word.  
- E(✓) – confirmed third position.  
- E(-) – there is another E in the word but not in the fourth position.  
- D(-) – D is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Current knowledge:
Pattern: S _ E _ _
Additional constraints:
- A second E exists somewhere except 4th or 5th – so it must be in 2nd position.  
- D exists but not in 5th – so it must be in 4th position.

Thus the only remaining blanks are:
- 2nd letter = E  
- 4th letter = D

Therefore the word is S E E D _.
But we need a 5-letter word beginning S-E-E-D-?, so the last letter must be a consonant not yet eliminated.  
Eliminated list so far: A, R, O, T, I, N, H, L, F, P.  
Possible final consonants: B, C, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y.  
Valid word: ""SEEDY"" or ""SEEDS"".  
Between these, ""SEEDY"" is more likely.
