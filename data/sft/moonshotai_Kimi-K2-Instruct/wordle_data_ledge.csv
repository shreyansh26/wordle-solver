For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, ""SLATE"" is another excellent choice as it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English words. Between these options, ""SLATE"" might give slightly better coverage of consonants, so I'll go with that.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2.
- Does not contain S, A, or T.

Next guess should use new common letters to find remaining consonants and vowels. Good candidates are letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc. A word like ""LIVER"" uses L in position 1 (new position), I, V, and R (common letters), while keeping the known E at the end.

From the new feedback:

Guess 2: LIVER  
L(✓) I(x) V(x) E(-) R(x)

This tells us:

1. L is in the correct position (position 1), so the word starts with L.
2. E is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 5 (since E(-) implies it’s in the word but not in that exact spot).  
3. The letters I, V, R are not in the word at all.

Combining everything we know so far:
- Word starts with L.
- Ends with E (from SLATE feedback), BUT now we know E is NOT in position 5. This seems like a contradiction at first glance. However, let’s re-examine:

Wait! The feedback for LIVER says E(-), meaning E is in the word but NOT in position 5. But the SLATE feedback said E(✓), meaning E is in position 5. This must be a misinterpretation. Actually, in SLATE, E(✓) means E is correct in position 5, so E is definitely in position 5. The LIVER feedback’s E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (where it was placed in LIVER), which aligns with E being in position 5. So no contradiction.

So we now know:
- Word starts with L.
- Word ends with E.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, I, V, R.
- L is fixed in position 1, E in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word of the form L _ _ _ E, excluding the forbidden letters. The remaining letters to consider are common ones like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, W, Y. 

A good next guess would test common consonants in positions 2-4. ""LOWER"" would be ideal, but R is out. ""LODGE"" uses D and G, but G and D are less common. ""LONGE"" uses N and G. ""LUNGE"" uses U, N, G. 

Another good choice is ""LODGE"", but let’s check for more common letters: ""LANCE"" uses N and C, but C is less common than N. ""LOBBY"" uses B and Y, but we don’t know about B yet. 

The word ""LOWER"" is invalid because R is out. ""LOBBE"" isn’t a word. ""LUMEN"" uses M and N, but E is already fixed at the end. 

""LUNGE"" seems reasonable: L _ _ _ E, with U, N, G. Let’s check if ""LUNGE"" is valid (yes, it’s a word). This tests U, N, G in positions 2-4.

But maybe a better approach is to use more common letters first. ""LOBBE"" isn’t valid, ""LODGE"" uses O, D, G. ""LODGE"" is a valid word and tests O, D, G.

But ""LODGE"" has G, which is less common. Another alternative: ""LUMEN"" (but E is already at the end). 

Wait, let’s list possible words starting with L and ending with E, excluding the forbidden letters (S, A, T, I, V, R):

Valid candidates:
- L O B B E (invalid, ""lobbe"" isn’t a word)
- L O D G E → LODGE
- L U N G E → LUNGE
- L O N G E → (invalid)
- L U M P E → (invalid)

""LODGE"" seems more likely to yield useful info, as O and D are common. Let’s go with LODGE.

2. O(x) – letter O is not in the word at all.
3. D(✓) – letter D is correct in position 4.
4. G(✓) – letter G is correct in position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The word ""LOWER"" is invalid because R is out. ""LOBBE"" isn’t a word. ""LUMEN"" uses M and N, but E is already fixed at the end. 

""LUNGE"" seems reasonable: L _ _ _ E, with U, N, G. Let’s check if ""LUNGE"" is valid (yes, it’s a word). This tests U, N, G in positions 2-4.

But maybe a better approach is to use more common letters first. ""LOBBE"" isn’t valid, ""LODGE"" uses O, D, G. ""LODGE"" is a valid word and tests O, D, G.

Rechecking, the actual everyday word is “LEDGE,” which would be L E D G E.  
Let’s verify this pattern:  
- L(✓) – correct  
- E in position 2 (new)  
- D in position 4 (✓)  
- G in position 3 (✓)  
- E in position 5 (✓)

So the correct word must be LEDGE.

- L(✓) – position 1 = L
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word
- D(✓) – position 4 = D
- G(✓) – position 3 = G
- E(✓) – position 5 = E

So the word is fixed as L _ G D E, and the only slot left is the second letter.  
Letters already eliminated (from all guesses):
