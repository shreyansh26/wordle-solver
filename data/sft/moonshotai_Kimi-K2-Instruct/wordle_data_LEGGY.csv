Since this is my first guess, I don't have any prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common vowels and consonants. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, T, L and common vowels A, E)
- CRANE (contains R, N, and common vowels A, E)
- AUDIO (all vowels, but less consonant info)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but poor consonant coverage)

I'll choose CRANE because it covers:
- C (moderately common)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters while allowing me to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N at all.
- All other letters are still possible.

To maximize information with the second guess, I want a word that:
1. Places E in a new position (positions 1-4 are open).
2. Uses a fresh set of common consonants not yet tested.
3. Avoids C, R, A, N entirely.

Good consonants left to test: S, T, L, D, B, G, M, P, etc.  
Common vowels left to test: I, O, U.

I'll choose a word that spreads these across positions.  
A balanced choice is STILE:
- S, T, L are common consonants we haven’t tested.
- I is another common vowel we haven’t tested.
- E moves to the 4th position (from 5th in CRANE).

This tests 4 new consonants (S, T, L, I) and re-tests E in a new spot.

Third-round recap:

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, B, O, W  
Known to be in the word: L and E  
Known positions:
- E is NOT at 1, 4, or 5 ⇒ E must be at 2 or 3.
- L is NOT at 2, 3, or 4 ⇒ L must be at 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters NOT in the eliminated list.
2. Places E at 2 or 3.
3. Places L at 1 or 5.
4. Introduces fresh candidates for the remaining two slots.

Remaining consonants still allowed: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels allowed: U (since A, I, O eliminated, E already used)

Let’s try to test two new consonants in one guess while respecting the positional constraints.

Option 1: L at 1, E at 2 ⇒ L E _ _ _
We need two more letters from the remaining pool.  
Take K and D: L E K D ?  (must be 5 letters)  
Make a valid word: L E G U M  (but M is fine, U is fine)  
But we need to check dictionary: LEGUM is valid.

Option 2: E at 2, L at 5 ⇒ _ E _ _ L  
Take G and U: G E M U L (GEMUL is not a word)  
Try D E M U L (invalid).

Option 3: E at 3, L at 1 ⇒ L _ E _ _  
Take H and D: L H E D ?  (L H E D _ ) → L H E D ? doesn’t form a word.

Option 4: E at 3, L at 5 ⇒ _ _ E _ L  
Take K and U: M U E K L (invalid)  
Take D and U: D U E K L (invalid).

From these, LEGUM seems the best valid choice.

But LEGUM uses U, which is still possible.  
Let’s confirm:  
- L at 1 (valid slot)  
- E at 2 (valid slot)  
- G, U, M are new and allowed.

Thus, LEGUM is a strong candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common vowels and consonants. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, T, L and common vowels A, E)
- CRANE (contains R, N, and common vowels A, E)
- AUDIO (all vowels, but less consonant info)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but poor consonant coverage)

I'll choose CRANE because it covers:
- C (moderately common)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters while allowing me to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N at all.
- All other letters are still possible.

To maximize information with the second guess, I want a word that:
1. Places E in a new position (positions 1-4 are open).
2. Uses a fresh set of common consonants not yet tested.
3. Avoids C, R, A, N entirely.

Good consonants left to test: S, T, L, D, B, G, M, P, etc.  
Common vowels left to test: I, O, U.

I'll choose a word that spreads these across positions.  
A balanced choice is STILE:
- S, T, L are common consonants we haven’t tested.
- I is another common vowel we haven’t tested.
- E moves to the 4th position (from 5th in CRANE).

This tests 4 new consonants (S, T, L, I) and re-tests E in a new spot.

- C, R, A, N, S, T, I are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 or 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word:
- Contains E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Contains L somewhere other than position 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated, e.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place E in a new slot (1-3).
2. Re-test L in a new slot (1-3 or 5).
3. Introduce fresh likely consonants.

I’ll pick a word that does this while avoiding eliminated letters.  
Let me try: BLOKE
- B, K, O are new common letters.
- L in position 2 (re-testing L).
- E in position 5 (but we know E isn’t in 5), so that’s a mistake.  
Let me rethink.

Better placement for E is 1-3.  
How about: MELON
- M, O fresh.
- E in position 2.
- L in position 3 (valid).
- N is already eliminated (from CRANE), so bad.

Next: ELBOW
- E in 1 (valid).
- L in 2 (valid).
- B, O, W fresh.

This avoids eliminated letters and positions.
