For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, and Y. Words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", or ""RAISE"" are good starting points because they contain several of these common letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because:
- A, R, O, S, E are all very common letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are often in words
- The consonants R and S are also very frequent
- This combination should give good information about what letters are in the word

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-)  ― A is in the word but in the wrong position  
R(x)  ― R is NOT in the word  
O(x)  ― O is NOT in the word  
S(x)  ― S is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  ― E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position  

So we now know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1
- It does not contain R, O, or S

Common 5-letter words ending in E with an A somewhere and no R, O, S:
Possible letter sets now exclude R, O, S. We still have A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but focus on high frequency ones).

A good next guess should test new common consonants and keep the known E at the end. A word like ""PLATE"" would reuse P, L, A, T, E but P and L and T are all still possible. ""PLATE"" has A in position 3 instead of 1, and tests P, L, T (all common). 

Another candidate: ""FLAME"" – tests F, L, M.  
""GLADE"" – tests G, L, D.  
""CRANE"" – tests C, N.  

I’ll go with “PLATE” because P, L, T are all common consonants we haven’t tested yet, and it places A in a new position while keeping E at the end.

2. Put A in a new position (try 2 first).
3. Test fresh, common consonants to narrow down choices quickly.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A(-)  ― A is in the word but in the wrong position  
R(x)  ― R is NOT in the word  
O(x)  ― O is NOT in the word  
S(x)  ― S is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  ― E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position  

So we now know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1
- It does not contain R, O, or S

Common 5-letter words ending in E with an A somewhere and no R, O, S:
Possible letter sets now exclude R, O, S. We still have A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but focus on high frequency ones).

A(-)  ― A is in the word but in the wrong position  
R(x)  ― R is NOT in the word  
O(x)  ― O is NOT in the word  
S(x)  ― S is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  ― E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position  

So we now know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1
- It does not contain R, O, or S

Common 5-letter words ending in E with an A somewhere and no R, O, S:
Possible letter sets now exclude R, O, S. We still have A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but focus on high frequency ones).

A good next guess should test new common consonants and keep the known E at the end. A word like ""PLATE"" would reuse P, L, A, T, E but P and L and T are all still possible. ""PLATE"" has A in position 3 instead of 1, and tests P, L, T (all common). 

Another candidate: ""FLAME"" – tests F, L, M.  
""GLADE"" – tests G, L, D.  
""CRANE"" – tests C, N.  

I’ll go with “PLATE” because P, L, T are all common consonants we haven’t tested yet, and it places A in a new position while keeping E at the end.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know.

Confirmed:
- E is in position 5.
- A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since in PLATE it was in position 3 and still marked “-”).
- Letters definitely not in the word: R, O, S, P, L, T.

Remaining positions for A: 2 or 3 (because it can’t be 1, 4, or 5).

So the pattern is:
_ _ _ _ E
with A in either position 2 or 3.

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E fixed in position 5.
2. Put A in a new position (try 2 first).
3. Test fresh, common consonants to narrow down choices quickly.

Candidate word that satisfies: HABIT? No, ends with T (banned).  
CABLE? L banned.  
CHAVE? V is ok, but A already tried in 3.  
MADGE? D,G ok, but A in 3 again.  
BANHE? N,H ok, but H is less common.  

A better word: CAGE? Too short.  
MAINE? M,A,I,N,E.  
- M and N are common, I is a vowel worth testing.  
- A in position 2 (new).  
- E in position 5 (known).  
- No banned letters.  

Let’s go with MAINE.

<guess>MAINE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: MAINE -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

- M(✓) – M is in the word and in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 2 (finally locked in).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So the current known pattern is:
M A _ _ E

Letters already ruled out:
R, O, S, P, L, T, I, N.

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones and already used M, A, E):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need common consonants for positions 3 and 4. Common letters that fit: B, C, D, F, G, H, K.

Let’s try a word that uses two fresh consonants, e.g., C and K:
- M A C K E → ""MACK E"" is invalid (6 letters).
- M A C E _ – but we already have E at 5.
- M A C H E → ""MACHE"" (valid word, uncommon but okay).
- M A D G E → ""MADGE"" (common, but G and D are fresh).
- M A F F E → no, double F is less likely.

""MADGE"" is a good candidate: D and G are both common, not ruled out, and fit positions 3 and 4.

Let’s pick MADGE.

Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, P, L, T, I, N, D, G.

Remaining letters for positions 3 and 4 (still unused and not ruled out):
B, C, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A, M, E already fixed).

Common English letters in that set: B, C, F, H, K, U.
We want two-letter combinations that form a valid 5-letter word MA _ _ E.

Possible valid words:
- MACHE – but H is ok and C is ok.  
- MACKE – not a word.  
- MAFKE – not a word.  
- MACHE is the only common one.
