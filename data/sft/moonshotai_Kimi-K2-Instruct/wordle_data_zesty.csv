This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information. The best strategy for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains all very common letters
2. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information I can get from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word, but not in position 1
- L(x): L is not in the word at all
- A(x): A is not in the word at all
- T(✓): T is in the word and in position 4
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th spot ( _ _ _ T _ )
2. The word contains S and E somewhere, but S is not first and E is not last
3. The word does NOT contain L or A

We need a word that:
- Has T in position 4
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3, or 5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3, or 4, but 4 is already T, so 1,2, or 3)
- Does not have L or A

Possible good next guesses:
- STEEL (but has double E which might not be ideal)
- STONE (but has A-like vowel O, and N is common)
- SETON (but has O)
- SENTO (but has O and N)
- PESTO (but has O and P)

Looking for words with T in position 4, and containing S and E but not A or L:
- PESTS (but has double S)
- BESTS (but has double S)
- VESTS (but has double S)
- HASTE (but has A)
- BASTE (but has A)
- FESTS (but has double S)
- GESTS (but has double S)

A better choice might be ""PESTO"", but it has O. Let me think of words with E and S but not A or L, T in position 4:
- ESTER
- ETHOS (but O)
- EFTS (too short)
- ESTOP (but has O and P)

Actually, looking at valid 5-letter words:
- VESTS (but S is in position 5, which is allowed since E can't be 5)
- PESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- BESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- HESTS (S in 5, E in 2)

But these have double S which might not be optimal. Let me try ""ESTER"":
- E S T E R
- Has T in 3, not 4 - doesn't work

Wait, I need T in position 4. Let me think differently:
Word structure: _ _ _ T _
Must have S (not in 1) and E (not in 5), no A or L.

Possible patterns:
- S in 2: _ S _ T _
- S in 3: _ _ S T _
- S in 5: _ _ _ T S

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking at words:
- E S T E R - T is 3, not 4
- P E S T O - T is 4, has E and S, no A or L, but has O
- R E S T S - T is 4, E is 2, S is 3 and 5 - but double S
- B E S T S - same double S issue
- M E S T A - has A
- F E S T A - has A
- V E S T S - same double S

Hmm, most words with this pattern have A or double letters. Let me try ""PESTO"":
- P E S T O
- T is 4 ✓
- E is 2 ✓
- S is 3 ✓
- No A or L ✓
- Has O, but that's acceptable as new info

PESTO seems like the best available option here.

Based on the previous feedback, we know:
- T is in position 4
- S and E are in the word (but S≠1, E≠5)
- L and A are NOT in the word

A good next guess that fits these constraints is PESTO, as it places T in position 4 and includes both S and E in valid positions while avoiding A and L.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,zesty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information. The best strategy for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains all very common letters
2. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information I can get from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word, but not in position 1
- L(x): L is not in the word at all
- A(x): A is not in the word at all
- T(✓): T is in the word and in position 4
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th spot ( _ _ _ T _ )
2. The word contains S and E somewhere, but S is not first and E is not last
3. The word does NOT contain L or A

We need a word that:
- Has T in position 4
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3, or 5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3, or 4, but 4 is already T, so 1,2, or 3)
- Does not have L or A

Possible good next guesses:
- STEEL (but has double E which might not be ideal)
- STONE (but has A-like vowel O, and N is common)
- SETON (but has O)
- SENTO (but has O and N)
- PESTO (but has O and P)

Looking for words with T in position 4, and containing S and E but not A or L:
- PESTS (but has double S)
- BESTS (but has double S)
- VESTS (but has double S)
- HASTE (but has A)
- BASTE (but has A)
- FESTS (but has double S)
- GESTS (but has double S)

A better choice might be ""PESTO"", but it has O. Let me think of words with E and S but not A or L, T in position 4:
- ESTER
- ETHOS (but O)
- EFTS (too short)
- ESTOP (but has O and P)

Actually, looking at valid 5-letter words:
- VESTS (but S is in position 5, which is allowed since E can't be 5)
- PESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- BESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- HESTS (S in 5, E in 2)

But these have double S which might not be optimal. Let me try ""ESTER"":
- E S T E R
- Has T in 3, not 4 - doesn't work

Wait, I need T in position 4. Let me think differently:
Word structure: _ _ _ T _
Must have S (not in 1) and E (not in 5), no A or L.

Possible patterns:
- S in 2: _ S _ T _
- S in 3: _ _ S T _
- S in 5: _ _ _ T S

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking at words:
- E S T E R - T is 3, not 4
- P E S T O - T is 4, has E and S, no A or L, but has O
- R E S T S - T is 4, E is 2, S is 3 and 5 - but double S
- B E S T S - same double S issue
- M E S T A - has A
- F E S T A - has A
- V E S T S - same double S

Hmm, most words with this pattern have A or double letters. Let me try ""PESTO"":
- P E S T O
- T is 4 ✓
- E is 2 ✓
- S is 3 ✓
- No A or L ✓
- Has O, but that's acceptable as new info

PESTO seems like the best available option here.Based on the previous feedback, we know:
- T is in position 4
- S and E are in the word (but S≠1, E≠5)
- L and A are NOT in the word

A good next guess that fits these constraints is PESTO, as it places T in position 4 and includes both S and E in valid positions while avoiding A and L.

Let's re-examine all feedback carefully.

Previous deductions:
- Position 4 is T
- Position 2 must be E (from PESTO feedback showing E(✓) in position 2)
- Position 3 must be S (from PESTO feedback showing S(✓) in position 3)

But the new feedback on CHEST is:
C(x) H(x) E(-) S(-) T(-)

This indicates our previous interpretation was incomplete. The feedback symbols apply to the letter positions in that specific guess, not globally. Let me re-analyze:

From SLATE:
- S(-): S exists but not at position 1
- T(✓): T exists and is at position 4
- E(-): E exists but not at position 5
- L(x): L not in word
- A(x): A not in word

From PESTO:
- E(✓): E is at position 2
- S(✓): S is at position 3
- T(✓): T is at position 4
- P(x): P not in word
- O(x): O not in word

From CHEST:
- C(x): C not in word
- H(x): H not in word
- E(-): E exists but not at position 3 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 2)
- S(-): S exists but not at position 4 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 3)
- T(-): T exists but not at position 5 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 4)

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T

The pattern is: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out so far: A, L, O, P, C, H

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ E S T _ and doesn't contain any of the ruled out letters.

Valid candidates:
- BREST (B,R allowed)
- DREST (not a word)
- FREST (not a word)
- GREST (not a word)
- JESTS (but S already at 3)
- KESTS (not standard)
- NESTS (but S already at 3)
- RESTS (but S already at 3)
- TESTS (but T already at 4)
- VESTS (but S already at 3)
- WESTS (but S already at 3)
- ZESTS (but S already at 3)

Actually, looking at _ E S T _, the only common valid word appears to be BREST or possibly GUEST (but GUEST doesn't fit the E at position 2).

Wait, let me reconsider - we need to check if there are other valid patterns. The feedback shows the positions relative to each guess, not absolute positions. Let me more carefully map the positions:

From SLATE (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: S(-) - S exists, not at 1
- Position 2: L(x) - L not in word
- Position 3: A(x) - A not in word
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: E(-) - E exists, not at 5

From PESTO (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: P(x) - P not in word
- Position 2: E(✓) - E is at position 2
- Position 3: S(✓) - S is at position 3
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: O(x) - O not in word

From CHEST (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: C(x) - C not in word
- Position 2: H(x) - H not in word
- Position 3: E(-) - E exists, but not at position 3 (consistent - it's at 2)
- Position 4: S(-) - S exists, but not at position 4 (consistent - it's at 3)
- Position 5: T(-) - T exists, but not at position 5 (consistent - it's at 4)

So our confirmed pattern remains: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out: A, L, O, P, C, H

We're looking for _ E S T _ with no A, L, O, P, C, H in the word.

Valid words fitting _ E S T _:
- BREST (B, R allowed - R not ruled out)
- FREST (not a word)
- GREST (not a word)
- DREST (not a word)

BREST appears to be the only valid word matching this pattern.

From all feedback:
- Confirmed positions: _ E S T _
- Ruled out letters: A, L, O, P, C, H

The only common valid word matching this pattern is BREST.

<guess>BREST</guess>",BREST,"Let's re-examine all feedback carefully.

Previous deductions:
- Position 4 is T
- Position 2 must be E (from PESTO feedback showing E(✓) in position 2)
- Position 3 must be S (from PESTO feedback showing S(✓) in position 3)

But the new feedback on CHEST is:
C(x) H(x) E(-) S(-) T(-)

This indicates our previous interpretation was incomplete. The feedback symbols apply to the letter positions in that specific guess, not globally. Let me re-analyze:

From SLATE:
- S(-): S exists but not at position 1
- T(✓): T exists and is at position 4
- E(-): E exists but not at position 5
- L(x): L not in word
- A(x): A not in word

From PESTO:
- E(✓): E is at position 2
- S(✓): S is at position 3
- T(✓): T is at position 4
- P(x): P not in word
- O(x): O not in word

From CHEST:
- C(x): C not in word
- H(x): H not in word
- E(-): E exists but not at position 3 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 2)
- S(-): S exists but not at position 4 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 3)
- T(-): T exists but not at position 5 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 4)

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T

The pattern is: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out so far: A, L, O, P, C, H

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ E S T _ and doesn't contain any of the ruled out letters.

Valid candidates:
- BREST (B,R allowed)
- DREST (not a word)
- FREST (not a word)
- GREST (not a word)
- JESTS (but S already at 3)
- KESTS (not standard)
- NESTS (but S already at 3)
- RESTS (but S already at 3)
- TESTS (but T already at 4)
- VESTS (but S already at 3)
- WESTS (but S already at 3)
- ZESTS (but S already at 3)

Actually, looking at _ E S T _, the only common valid word appears to be BREST or possibly GUEST (but GUEST doesn't fit the E at position 2).

Wait, let me reconsider - we need to check if there are other valid patterns. The feedback shows the positions relative to each guess, not absolute positions. Let me more carefully map the positions:

From SLATE (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: S(-) - S exists, not at 1
- Position 2: L(x) - L not in word
- Position 3: A(x) - A not in word
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: E(-) - E exists, not at 5

From PESTO (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: P(x) - P not in word
- Position 2: E(✓) - E is at position 2
- Position 3: S(✓) - S is at position 3
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: O(x) - O not in word

From CHEST (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: C(x) - C not in word
- Position 2: H(x) - H not in word
- Position 3: E(-) - E exists, but not at position 3 (consistent - it's at 2)
- Position 4: S(-) - S exists, but not at position 4 (consistent - it's at 3)
- Position 5: T(-) - T exists, but not at position 5 (consistent - it's at 4)

So our confirmed pattern remains: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out: A, L, O, P, C, H

We're looking for _ E S T _ with no A, L, O, P, C, H in the word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,zesty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information. The best strategy for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains all very common letters
2. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information I can get from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word, but not in position 1
- L(x): L is not in the word at all
- A(x): A is not in the word at all
- T(✓): T is in the word and in position 4
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th spot ( _ _ _ T _ )
2. The word contains S and E somewhere, but S is not first and E is not last
3. The word does NOT contain L or A

We need a word that:
- Has T in position 4
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3, or 5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3, or 4, but 4 is already T, so 1,2, or 3)
- Does not have L or A

Possible good next guesses:
- STEEL (but has double E which might not be ideal)
- STONE (but has A-like vowel O, and N is common)
- SETON (but has O)
- SENTO (but has O and N)
- PESTO (but has O and P)

Looking for words with T in position 4, and containing S and E but not A or L:
- PESTS (but has double S)
- BESTS (but has double S)
- VESTS (but has double S)
- HASTE (but has A)
- BASTE (but has A)
- FESTS (but has double S)
- GESTS (but has double S)

A better choice might be ""PESTO"", but it has O. Let me think of words with E and S but not A or L, T in position 4:
- ESTER
- ETHOS (but O)
- EFTS (too short)
- ESTOP (but has O and P)

Actually, looking at valid 5-letter words:
- VESTS (but S is in position 5, which is allowed since E can't be 5)
- PESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- BESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- HESTS (S in 5, E in 2)

But these have double S which might not be optimal. Let me try ""ESTER"":
- E S T E R
- Has T in 3, not 4 - doesn't work

Wait, I need T in position 4. Let me think differently:
Word structure: _ _ _ T _
Must have S (not in 1) and E (not in 5), no A or L.

Possible patterns:
- S in 2: _ S _ T _
- S in 3: _ _ S T _
- S in 5: _ _ _ T S

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking at words:
- E S T E R - T is 3, not 4
- P E S T O - T is 4, has E and S, no A or L, but has O
- R E S T S - T is 4, E is 2, S is 3 and 5 - but double S
- B E S T S - same double S issue
- M E S T A - has A
- F E S T A - has A
- V E S T S - same double S

Hmm, most words with this pattern have A or double letters. Let me try ""PESTO"":
- P E S T O
- T is 4 ✓
- E is 2 ✓
- S is 3 ✓
- No A or L ✓
- Has O, but that's acceptable as new info

PESTO seems like the best available option here.Based on the previous feedback, we know:
- T is in position 4
- S and E are in the word (but S≠1, E≠5)
- L and A are NOT in the word

A good next guess that fits these constraints is PESTO, as it places T in position 4 and includes both S and E in valid positions while avoiding A and L.

Guess 2: PESTO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word, but not at position 1.
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.
   - A and L are not in the word.

2. PESTO → P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
   - E is fixed in position 2.
   - S is fixed in position 3.
   - T is confirmed at position 4.
   - P and O are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant (no vowel A, and O is out)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: unknown, must be a consonant (E cannot be here, and A, O, L, P are out)

Letters already ruled out: A, L, O, P

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known E, S, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ E S T _ with remaining letters allowed.

Possible candidates:
- BREST (but R is allowed)
- CHEST
- DREST (not a word)
- FEST_ (needs ending)
- GEST_ (needs ending)
- HEST_ (needs ending)
- JEST_ (needs ending)
- KEST_ (needs ending)
- MEST_ (needs ending)
- NEST_ (needs ending)
- QUEST (but Q needs U)
- RESTS (but we already have T at 4, so can't be)
- TESTS (T already in place)
- VESTS (but S already at 3, can't be same)
- WEST_ (needs ending)
- ZEST_ (needs ending)

Looking at valid words:
- CHEST (C, H, E, S, T) - fits perfectly
- BREST (B, R, E, S, T) - but R is allowed
- NESTS (but S already used at 3)
- JESTS (but S already used at 3)
- FESTS (but S already used at 3)

CHEST is the most straightforward valid word that fits the pattern and hasn't used any ruled-out letters.The pattern we now know is: _ E S T _  
We also know the letters P, A, L, O are not in the word.  
A good candidate that fits is CHEST.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after four guesses.

1. SLATE →  S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(✓)  E(-)
   - T is in the word and is in the 4th position.
   - S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
   - L and A are NOT in the word.

2. PESTO →  P(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)  T(✓)  O(x)
   - Position 2 is E (because E(✓) in position 2).
   - Position 3 is S (because S(✓) in position 3).
   - Position 4 is T (already confirmed).
   - P and O are NOT in the word.

3. CHEST →  C(x)  H(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
   - C and H are NOT in the word.
   - E is somewhere (already know it’s in position 2).
   - S is somewhere (already know it’s in position 3).
   - T is somewhere (already know it’s in position 4).

4. BREST →  B(x)  R(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
   - B and R are NOT in the word.

Summary of fixed knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ E S T _
- Letters not in the word: A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R

We need a five-letter word that fits: ? E S T ?  
The first and fifth positions must be letters that have NOT been ruled out and do not conflict with the feedback.

Available letters (not ruled out): D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, E, T which are already placed.

Common English endings for “_ E S T _”:
- D E S T ?  → No common words
- F E S T ?  → FESTS (double S invalid because S is already fixed at position 3)
- G E S T ?  → GESTS (double S same issue)
- I E S T ?  → IEST?  no standard word
- J E S T ?  → JESTS (double S again)
- K E S T ?  → KESTS (not standard)
- M E S T ?  → MEST?  no standard word
- N E S T ?  → NESTS (double S again)
- U E S T ?  → No standard word
- V E S T ?  → VESTS (double S again)
- W E S T ?  → WESTS (double S again)
- Z E S T ?  → ZESTS (double S again)

The only remaining plausible five-letter English word that fits _ E S T _ and has not been ruled out and has no repeats of already-placed letters is:

D E S T Y  → “DESTY” (not a standard word)
J E S T Y  → “JESTY” (not a standard word)
F E S T Y  → “FESTY” (not a standard word)
G E S T Y  → “GESTY” (not a standard word)
M E S T Y  → “MESTY” (not a standard word)
N E S T Y  → “NESTY” (not a standard word)

None of these are valid English words. This implies an error in our earlier assumption about exact position locks. Let’s re-examine PESTO feedback more carefully.

PESTO feedback: P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
- E(✓) means E is in the word AND in position 2.
- S(✓) means S is in the word AND in position 3.
- T(✓) means T is in the word AND in position 4.

So the pattern is indeed locked: _ E S T _

But after ruling out B and R, no common English word fits _ E S T _ without repeating S or using disallowed letters.

This indicates we must have missed a letter. Looking back at the ruled-out list: A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R. The missing common letter is N.

The word “NEST_” won’t work because N is allowed but we have S already in position 3. 

However, the word “JESTS” uses S twice. That’s invalid.

Wait – let me double-check the dictionary: the only valid English word fitting “_ E S T _” with no repeats of S, and with letters not ruled out, is “VEST” plus a letter, but “VESTS” doubles S. 

But we have not ruled out D yet. The word “DESTY” is not valid. 

After careful reconsideration, the only remaining valid word is:

“DESTY” is invalid. “GESTY” is invalid. 

Upon exhaustive search, the only valid English word that fits _ E S T _ without repeating letters and using allowed letters is:

“WESTS” – but S repeats.

“ZESTS” – S repeats.

“NESTS” – S repeats.

“FESTS” – S repeats.

“JESTS” – S repeats.

“MESTS” – non-word.

“KESTS” – non-word.

“YESTS” – non-word.

“XESTS” – non-word.

“QUEST” – but Q needs U, and U not ruled out.

“QUEST” would be _ E S T _ , but T is 4th, so Q U E S T – but that has U in 1, E in 2, S in 3, T in 4. That’s five letters. And letters Q, U, E, S, T:  
- Q not ruled out  
- U not ruled out  
- E confirmed at 2  
- S confirmed at 3  
- T confirmed at 4  

And QUEST has no A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R.

That fits perfectly.

Therefore, the correct next guess is QUEST.

After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ E S T _ and uses only allowed letters is QUEST.

Summary of fixed knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ E S T _

We need a five-letter word that fits: ? E S T ?  
The first and fifth positions must be letters that have NOT been ruled out and do not conflict with the feedback.

Available letters (not ruled out): D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, E, T which are already placed.

G E S T Y  → “GESTY” (not a standard word)
M E S T Y  → “MESTY” (not a standard word)
N E S T Y  → “NESTY” (not a standard word)

None of these are valid English words. This implies an error in our earlier assumption about exact position locks. Let’s re-examine PESTO feedback more carefully.

PESTO feedback: P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
- E(✓) means E is in the word AND in position 2.
- S(✓) means S is in the word AND in position 3.
- T(✓) means T is in the word AND in position 4.

So the pattern is indeed locked: _ E S T _

But after ruling out B and R, no common English word fits _ E S T _ without repeating S or using disallowed letters.

This indicates we must have missed a letter. Looking back at the ruled-out list: A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R. The missing common letter is N.

The word “NEST_” won’t work because N is allowed but we have S already in position 3. 

However, the word “JESTS” uses S twice. That’s invalid.

Wait – let me double-check the dictionary: the only valid English word fitting “_ E S T _” with no repeats of S, and with letters not ruled out, is “VEST” plus a letter, but “VESTS” doubles S. 

But we have not ruled out D yet. The word “DESTY” is not valid. 

After careful reconsideration, the only remaining valid word is:

“DESTY” is invalid. “GESTY” is invalid. 

Upon exhaustive search, the only valid English word that fits _ E S T _ without repeating letters and using allowed letters is:

“WESTS” – but S repeats.

“ZESTS” – S repeats.

“NESTS” – S repeats.

“FESTS” – S repeats.

“JESTS” – S repeats.

“MESTS” – non-word.

“KESTS” – non-word.

“YESTS” – non-word.

“XESTS” – non-word.

“QUEST” – but Q needs U, and U not ruled out.

“QUEST” would be _ E S T _ , but T is 4th, so Q U E S T – but that has U in 1, E in 2, S in 3, T in 4. That’s five letters. And letters Q, U, E, S, T:  
- Q not ruled out  
- U not ruled out  
- E confirmed at 2  
- S confirmed at 3  
- T confirmed at 4  

And QUEST has no A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R.

That fits perfectly.

Therefore, the correct next guess is QUEST.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ E S T _ and uses only allowed letters is QUEST.",Guess 5: QUEST -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(x) E(-) S(-) T(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information. The best strategy for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants.

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains all very common letters
2. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter English words

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to maximize the information I can get from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word, but not in position 1
- L(x): L is not in the word at all
- A(x): A is not in the word at all
- T(✓): T is in the word and in position 4
- E(-): E is in the word, but not in position 5

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th spot ( _ _ _ T _ )
2. The word contains S and E somewhere, but S is not first and E is not last
3. The word does NOT contain L or A

We need a word that:
- Has T in position 4
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3, or 5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3, or 4, but 4 is already T, so 1,2, or 3)
- Does not have L or A

Possible good next guesses:
- STEEL (but has double E which might not be ideal)
- STONE (but has A-like vowel O, and N is common)
- SETON (but has O)
- SENTO (but has O and N)
- PESTO (but has O and P)

Looking for words with T in position 4, and containing S and E but not A or L:
- PESTS (but has double S)
- BESTS (but has double S)
- VESTS (but has double S)
- HASTE (but has A)
- BASTE (but has A)
- FESTS (but has double S)
- GESTS (but has double S)

A better choice might be ""PESTO"", but it has O. Let me think of words with E and S but not A or L, T in position 4:
- ESTER
- ETHOS (but O)
- EFTS (too short)
- ESTOP (but has O and P)

Actually, looking at valid 5-letter words:
- VESTS (but S is in position 5, which is allowed since E can't be 5)
- PESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- BESTS (S in 5, E in 2)
- HESTS (S in 5, E in 2)

But these have double S which might not be optimal. Let me try ""ESTER"":
- E S T E R
- Has T in 3, not 4 - doesn't work

Wait, I need T in position 4. Let me think differently:
Word structure: _ _ _ T _
Must have S (not in 1) and E (not in 5), no A or L.

Possible patterns:
- S in 2: _ S _ T _
- S in 3: _ _ S T _
- S in 5: _ _ _ T S

And E must be in 1,2, or 3.

Looking at words:
- E S T E R - T is 3, not 4
- P E S T O - T is 4, has E and S, no A or L, but has O
- R E S T S - T is 4, E is 2, S is 3 and 5 - but double S
- B E S T S - same double S issue
- M E S T A - has A
- F E S T A - has A
- V E S T S - same double S

Hmm, most words with this pattern have A or double letters. Let me try ""PESTO"":
- P E S T O
- T is 4 ✓
- E is 2 ✓
- S is 3 ✓
- No A or L ✓
- Has O, but that's acceptable as new info

PESTO seems like the best available option here.Based on the previous feedback, we know:
- T is in position 4
- S and E are in the word (but S≠1, E≠5)
- L and A are NOT in the word

A good next guess that fits these constraints is PESTO, as it places T in position 4 and includes both S and E in valid positions while avoiding A and L.

Guess 2: PESTO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - S is in the word, but not at position 1.
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.
   - A and L are not in the word.

2. PESTO → P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
   - E is fixed in position 2.
   - S is fixed in position 3.
   - T is confirmed at position 4.
   - P and O are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- Position 1: unknown, must be a consonant (no vowel A, and O is out)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: unknown, must be a consonant (E cannot be here, and A, O, L, P are out)

Letters already ruled out: A, L, O, P

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known E, S, T.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching _ E S T _ with remaining letters allowed.

Possible candidates:
- BREST (but R is allowed)
- CHEST
- DREST (not a word)
- FEST_ (needs ending)
- GEST_ (needs ending)
- HEST_ (needs ending)
- JEST_ (needs ending)
- KEST_ (needs ending)
- MEST_ (needs ending)
- NEST_ (needs ending)
- QUEST (but Q needs U)
- RESTS (but we already have T at 4, so can't be)
- TESTS (T already in place)
- VESTS (but S already at 3, can't be same)
- WEST_ (needs ending)
- ZEST_ (needs ending)

Looking at valid words:
- CHEST (C, H, E, S, T) - fits perfectly
- BREST (B, R, E, S, T) - but R is allowed
- NESTS (but S already used at 3)
- JESTS (but S already used at 3)
- FESTS (but S already used at 3)

CHEST is the most straightforward valid word that fits the pattern and hasn't used any ruled-out letters.The pattern we now know is: _ E S T _  
We also know the letters P, A, L, O are not in the word.  
A good candidate that fits is CHEST.

Guess 3: CHEST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(-) S(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's re-examine all feedback carefully.

Previous deductions:
- Position 4 is T
- Position 2 must be E (from PESTO feedback showing E(✓) in position 2)
- Position 3 must be S (from PESTO feedback showing S(✓) in position 3)

But the new feedback on CHEST is:
C(x) H(x) E(-) S(-) T(-)

This indicates our previous interpretation was incomplete. The feedback symbols apply to the letter positions in that specific guess, not globally. Let me re-analyze:

From SLATE:
- S(-): S exists but not at position 1
- T(✓): T exists and is at position 4
- E(-): E exists but not at position 5
- L(x): L not in word
- A(x): A not in word

From PESTO:
- E(✓): E is at position 2
- S(✓): S is at position 3
- T(✓): T is at position 4
- P(x): P not in word
- O(x): O not in word

From CHEST:
- C(x): C not in word
- H(x): H not in word
- E(-): E exists but not at position 3 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 2)
- S(-): S exists but not at position 4 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 3)
- T(-): T exists but not at position 5 (but we know from PESTO it's at position 4)

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T

The pattern is: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out so far: A, L, O, P, C, H

We need a 5-letter word that matches _ E S T _ and doesn't contain any of the ruled out letters.

Valid candidates:
- BREST (B,R allowed)
- DREST (not a word)
- FREST (not a word)
- GREST (not a word)
- JESTS (but S already at 3)
- KESTS (not standard)
- NESTS (but S already at 3)
- RESTS (but S already at 3)
- TESTS (but T already at 4)
- VESTS (but S already at 3)
- WESTS (but S already at 3)
- ZESTS (but S already at 3)

Actually, looking at _ E S T _, the only common valid word appears to be BREST or possibly GUEST (but GUEST doesn't fit the E at position 2).

Wait, let me reconsider - we need to check if there are other valid patterns. The feedback shows the positions relative to each guess, not absolute positions. Let me more carefully map the positions:

From SLATE (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: S(-) - S exists, not at 1
- Position 2: L(x) - L not in word
- Position 3: A(x) - A not in word
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: E(-) - E exists, not at 5

From PESTO (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: P(x) - P not in word
- Position 2: E(✓) - E is at position 2
- Position 3: S(✓) - S is at position 3
- Position 4: T(✓) - T is at position 4
- Position 5: O(x) - O not in word

From CHEST (positions 1-5):
- Position 1: C(x) - C not in word
- Position 2: H(x) - H not in word
- Position 3: E(-) - E exists, but not at position 3 (consistent - it's at 2)
- Position 4: S(-) - S exists, but not at position 4 (consistent - it's at 3)
- Position 5: T(-) - T exists, but not at position 5 (consistent - it's at 4)

So our confirmed pattern remains: _ E S T _

Letters ruled out: A, L, O, P, C, H

We're looking for _ E S T _ with no A, L, O, P, C, H in the word.

Valid words fitting _ E S T _:
- BREST (B, R allowed - R not ruled out)
- FREST (not a word)
- GREST (not a word)
- DREST (not a word)

BREST appears to be the only valid word matching this pattern.From all feedback:
- Confirmed positions: _ E S T _
- Ruled out letters: A, L, O, P, C, H

The only common valid word matching this pattern is BREST.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate what we now know after four guesses.

1. SLATE →  S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(✓)  E(-)
   - T is in the word and is in the 4th position.
   - S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
   - L and A are NOT in the word.

2. PESTO →  P(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)  T(✓)  O(x)
   - Position 2 is E (because E(✓) in position 2).
   - Position 3 is S (because S(✓) in position 3).
   - Position 4 is T (already confirmed).
   - P and O are NOT in the word.

3. CHEST →  C(x)  H(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
   - C and H are NOT in the word.
   - E is somewhere (already know it’s in position 2).
   - S is somewhere (already know it’s in position 3).
   - T is somewhere (already know it’s in position 4).

4. BREST →  B(x)  R(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
   - B and R are NOT in the word.

Summary of fixed knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ E S T _
- Letters not in the word: A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R

We need a five-letter word that fits: ? E S T ?  
The first and fifth positions must be letters that have NOT been ruled out and do not conflict with the feedback.

Available letters (not ruled out): D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S, E, T which are already placed.

Common English endings for “_ E S T _”:
- D E S T ?  → No common words
- F E S T ?  → FESTS (double S invalid because S is already fixed at position 3)
- G E S T ?  → GESTS (double S same issue)
- I E S T ?  → IEST?  no standard word
- J E S T ?  → JESTS (double S again)
- K E S T ?  → KESTS (not standard)
- M E S T ?  → MEST?  no standard word
- N E S T ?  → NESTS (double S again)
- U E S T ?  → No standard word
- V E S T ?  → VESTS (double S again)
- W E S T ?  → WESTS (double S again)
- Z E S T ?  → ZESTS (double S again)

The only remaining plausible five-letter English word that fits _ E S T _ and has not been ruled out and has no repeats of already-placed letters is:

D E S T Y  → “DESTY” (not a standard word)
J E S T Y  → “JESTY” (not a standard word)
F E S T Y  → “FESTY” (not a standard word)
G E S T Y  → “GESTY” (not a standard word)
M E S T Y  → “MESTY” (not a standard word)
N E S T Y  → “NESTY” (not a standard word)

None of these are valid English words. This implies an error in our earlier assumption about exact position locks. Let’s re-examine PESTO feedback more carefully.

PESTO feedback: P(x) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓) O(x)
- E(✓) means E is in the word AND in position 2.
- S(✓) means S is in the word AND in position 3.
- T(✓) means T is in the word AND in position 4.

So the pattern is indeed locked: _ E S T _

But after ruling out B and R, no common English word fits _ E S T _ without repeating S or using disallowed letters.

This indicates we must have missed a letter. Looking back at the ruled-out list: A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R. The missing common letter is N.

The word “NEST_” won’t work because N is allowed but we have S already in position 3. 

However, the word “JESTS” uses S twice. That’s invalid.

Wait – let me double-check the dictionary: the only valid English word fitting “_ E S T _” with no repeats of S, and with letters not ruled out, is “VEST” plus a letter, but “VESTS” doubles S. 

But we have not ruled out D yet. The word “DESTY” is not valid. 

After careful reconsideration, the only remaining valid word is:

“DESTY” is invalid. “GESTY” is invalid. 

Upon exhaustive search, the only valid English word that fits _ E S T _ without repeating letters and using allowed letters is:

“WESTS” – but S repeats.

“ZESTS” – S repeats.

“NESTS” – S repeats.

“FESTS” – S repeats.

“JESTS” – S repeats.

“MESTS” – non-word.

“KESTS” – non-word.

“YESTS” – non-word.

“XESTS” – non-word.

“QUEST” – but Q needs U, and U not ruled out.

“QUEST” would be _ E S T _ , but T is 4th, so Q U E S T – but that has U in 1, E in 2, S in 3, T in 4. That’s five letters. And letters Q, U, E, S, T:  
- Q not ruled out  
- U not ruled out  
- E confirmed at 2  
- S confirmed at 3  
- T confirmed at 4  

And QUEST has no A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R.

That fits perfectly.

Therefore, the correct next guess is QUEST.After carefully analyzing all feedback, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ E S T _ and uses only allowed letters is QUEST.

From every guess so far we have ruled out the following letters:

A, L, O, P, C, H, B, R, Q, U

and we still have absolute certainty about:

- T is in position 4
- E is somewhere (but not in 5, and not in 2 according to QUEST’s E(-) in position 2)

Wait: the QUEST feedback says E(-) **in position 2**, which contradicts the earlier PESTO E(✓) in position 2.  
The only way both statements can simultaneously be true is if PESTO’s E(✓) meant “right letter, right spot”, and QUEST’s E(-) meant “right letter, NOT in spot 2”.  
So the earlier (apparently locked) pattern _ E S T _ is **wrong**.  
We must reinterpret.

Re-construct from scratch:

1. SLATE  
   S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(✓)  E(-)  
   → T is at position 4  
   → S exists, not at 1  
   → E exists, not at 5  
   → A, L absent

2. PESTO  
   P(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)  T(✓)  O(x)  
   → E is at position 2  
   → S is at position 3  
   → T is at position 4  
   → P, O absent

3. CHEST  
   C(x)  H(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → C, H absent  
   → E not at 3 (consistent; we think it’s at 2)  
   → S not at 4 (consistent; we think it’s at 3)  
   → T not at 5 (consistent; we think it’s at 4)  

4. BREST  
   B(x)  R(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → B, R absent  
   → same confirmations as above

5. QUEST  
   Q(x)  U(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → Q, U absent  
   → E not at 2 (contradicts step 2)  
   → S not at 3 (contradicts step 2)  
   → T not at 4 (contradicts step 1)

The contradiction means our interpretation of the symbols must be **per-guess only**, not absolute positions.  
Let me re-interpret as relative feedback for each guess:

- A ✓ means that **exact position** is correct.  
- A - means the letter is in the word but **elsewhere**.  
- A x means the letter is **not in the word at all**.

Redoing:

1. SLATE  
   S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(✓)  E(-)  
   → T is **position 4**  
   → S is present, **not at 1**  
   → E is present, **not at 5**  
   → A, L absent

2. PESTO  
   P(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)  T(✓)  O(x)  
   → E is **position 2**  
   → S is **position 3**  
   → T is **position 4** (agrees)  
   → P, O absent

Thus pattern locked to: _ E S T _

3. CHEST (pattern _ E S T _)  
   C(x)  H(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → C, H absent  
   → E not at 3 (fine, it’s at 2)  
   → S not at 4 (fine, it’s at 3)  
   → T not at 5 (fine, it’s at 4)

4. BREST (pattern _ E S T _)  
   B(x)  R(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → B, R absent  
   → same confirmations

5. QUEST (pattern _ E S T _)  
   Q(x)  U(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)  
   → Q, U absent  
   → E not at 2 **← contradiction**

Conclusion: _ E S T _ is impossible because QUEST tells us E is NOT at 2.  
Therefore we must reinterpret the PESTO feedback differently.  
Let me strictly map **per guess**:

Each feedback line is independent and applies to the **guess itself**, not to absolute positions.

Let’s tabulate all constraints derived from the letters **in their given positions**:

- Letters in correct spot (✓):
  – SLATE: T at 4
  – PESTO: E at 2, S at 3, T at 4
  These agree → T is at 4, E at 2, S at 3 → pattern _ E S T _

- Letters ruled out entirely (x):
  A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R, Q, U

- Additional “exists but not here” (-) constraints:
  – SLATE: S not at 1, E not at 5
  – PESTO: none beyond the ✓
  – CHEST: E not at 3 (redundant), S not at 4 (redundant), T not at 5 (redundant)
  – BREST: same redundancies
  – QUEST: E not at 2 (!!!)  ← new fact

The new fact from QUEST is **fatal** to _ E S T _.

Therefore the PESTO feedback **cannot** have meant E at 2 and S at 3.  
The only consistent way is that in PESTO the symbols are:

- E(✓) means E is correct **somewhere in the word** (not necessarily spot 2)  
- S(✓) means S is correct **somewhere in the word**  
- T(✓) means T is correct **somewhere in the word**

This is the only resolution.  
Hence let me re-interpret all feedback under the **official rule** (✓ = correct letter + correct spot, – = correct letter wrong spot, x = absent).

Re-interpret each guess:

Guess 1: SLATE
- S(-)  L(x)  A(x)  T(✓)  E(-)
  → T at position 4
  → S present, not at 1
  → E present, not at 5
  → A, L absent

Guess 2: PESTO
- P(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)  T(✓)  O(x)
  → E at position 2
  → S at position 3
  → T at position 4  (consistent)
  → P, O absent

Guess 3: CHEST
- C(x)  H(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
  → C, H absent
  → E present, not at 3  (already at 2: consistent)
  → S present, not at 4  (already at 3: consistent)
  → T present, not at 5  (already at 4: consistent)

Guess 4: BREST
- B(x)  R(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
  → B, R absent
  → same redundancies

Guess 5: QUEST
- Q(x)  U(x)  E(-)  S(-)  T(-)
  → Q, U absent
  → E present, not at 2   ← **CONTRADICTION** with Guess 2

The contradiction proves that the feedback must contain an inconsistency or I must have mis-read.  
Rechecking: QUEST feedback given is Q(x) U(x) E(-) S(-) T(-) — that is, **E(-)** means “E is in the word but not in position 2”.  
But Guess 2 said **E(✓)** in position 2.  
These two statements are incompatible.

Therefore the only possible resolution is that there was a misinterpretation.  
Given the strict rules, the feedback **must** be read exactly as per guess row:

Guess 2: PESTO → E(✓) at position 2 is absolute.  
Guess 5: QUEST → E(-) at position 2 directly contradicts it.

Hence the feedback as provided is contradictory.  
But under the strict rules we must accept the literal feedback.

Therefore let me proceed with the **only pattern that is internally consistent**:

From Guess 2 (PESTO) we have absolute locks:
- Position 2: E  
- Position 3: S  
- Position 4: T  

Hence word is _ E S T _  

From all guesses, letters **not in the word** are:
A, L, P, O, C, H, B, R, Q, U

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 5 (and must not repeat S or T):
D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English words of the form ? E S T ? :

- DESTS – invalid (double S)
- FESTS – invalid
- GESTS – invalid
- JESTS – invalid
- KESTS – invalid
- MESTS – invalid
- NESTS – invalid
- VESTS – invalid
- WESTS – invalid
- YESTS – invalid
- ZESTS – invalid

None exist.  
The only actual English five-letter word fitting _ E S T _ is “BREST”, but B and R are ruled out.

Therefore the contradiction implies the secret word must be **TESTY** (which has T twice) or **TESTS** (S twice) – both contain duplicates of already placed letters, which is impossible.

After exhaustive check, the only remaining valid word under the constraints is:

**WESTS** – but S repeats.  
**NESTS** – same.  
**VEST**  – too short.

Upon complete dictionary scan, the **only** actual valid word left that does not reuse S or T and uses only allowed letters is:

**ZESTY**

Pattern: Z E S T Y  
- Position 2: E – allowed by PESTO E(✓)  
- Position 3: S – allowed by PESTO S(✓)  
- Position 4: T – allowed by PESTO T(✓)  
- Letters Z, Y not ruled out.  

Hence the next guess is ZESTY.
