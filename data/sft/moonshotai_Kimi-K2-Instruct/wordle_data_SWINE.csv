For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means using a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - high vowel count)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Looking at the most common letters in English, E is the most frequent, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, and S. A good strategy is to include as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage.

""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- S (very common first letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

So far we know:
- S is in the correct 1st position.
- E is in the correct 5th position.
- Letters **L, A, T** are not in the word at all.

Therefore the word looks like:  
S _ _ _ E  

Common letters we still want to test are: R, I, N, O, D, etc.  
Since we have two known letters and three unknown, we need a word that:
1. Starts with S, ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain L, A, or T.
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Possible candidates:
- SINCE (good, uses I, N, C)
- SPICE (uses P, I, C)
- SHINE (uses H, I, N)
- SLIDE – but contains L, so invalid
- SIREN – uses I, R, N

""SHINE"" is attractive because it introduces H, I, N, which are all common and haven’t been ruled out.

We now have:

S _ I N E

Letters definitely in the word (and their positions):
- S at 1
- I at 3
- N at 4
- E at 5

Letters definitely NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, H, P

We only need to fill position 2 with a letter that:
- has not been used (so not L, A, T, H, P)
- is a consonant that makes a real 5-letter word with S I N E.

Common remaining consonants: R, C, K, G, B, D, M, V, W, F …

Real English words that fit S _ I N E:
- S C I N E – too rare
- S K I N E – rare
- S W I N E – well-known word
- S C I N E – already rare
- S R I N E – archaic variant of “shrine”
- S C I N E – not in common use

Among these, “SWINE” is the clearest, common English word. It introduces W, a new letter, in position 2.

If that fails, we’ll know W is wrong and can try another consonant (e.g., “SCINE” or “SKINE”) but we should try the most common possibility next.

Therefore, guess “SWINE”.
