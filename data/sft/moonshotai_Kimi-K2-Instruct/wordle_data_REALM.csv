For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best initial guesses typically include common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Good starting words often contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, L, N)
- No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)

After considering several options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- All five most common letters in English words
- Three vowels (A, O, E) to test vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives us a strong foundation to work with regardless of the feedback received.

We now know:

- R E A _ _ are the first three letters (R✓, E✓, A✓).
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, D, Y.
- We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen only from the remaining unused alphabet (no repeats, no forbidden letters).

Remaining letters (excluding the ones already ruled out) include: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want a common English word beginning with REA and avoiding the banned letters.

Possible endings:
- REAF_ – no common word
- REAG_ – no
- REAH_ – no
- REAK_ – no
- REAL – REAL_ needs one more letter, REALM is 5 letters, but M is allowed.
- REAM – already 4 letters, need 5.
- REAN – no
- REAP_ – REAP + (B, H, etc.) ⇒ REAP + H = REAPH (no)
- REAR_ – repeats R (invalid)
- REAV_ – no
- REAW_ – no
- REAX_ – no
- REAZ_ – no

Let’s look for standard words:
- realm – R E A L M – all letters allowed, none ruled out
- rearm – repeats R
- reap + (l, m, n, p) – doesn’t make 5-letter words
- reaph – no
- reaks – S is banned
- reamy – Y is banned
- real + n = realn – no
- real + m = realm – yes

So “realm” seems the only plausible, common English word left that begins with REA and uses allowed letters.

Check:
- R ✓ E ✓ A ✓ L M – neither L nor M have been ruled out, and none of the banned letters appear.
