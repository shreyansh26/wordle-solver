Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. A good starting word should help eliminate or confirm as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. One widely recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which is also popular among Wordle players. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (feedback “-”).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word (feedback “x”).

So the secret word:
- definitely contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

My next guess should:
1. keep the confirmed letter A (but move it away from position 1).
2. avoid the eliminated letters R, O, S, E.
3. introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Popular remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, etc.
Popular remaining vowels: I, U (we already know A is present).

A balanced word that satisfies these requirements is “UNTIL”:
- It includes the confirmed letter A? No… oops, I just realized I forgot to include A. Let me rethink.

I need a word that includes A, excludes R, O, S, E, and still gives good coverage.  
Let me try “ADMIT”:
- A is here, but in position 1, which we know is wrong.  
Move A to position 2: “MADLY”? Still has A in position 2, but also has D and L.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D.  
“PLAIN” has A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, N.  

Between these, “PLAIN” seems stronger because N is very common. Let’s use that.

Summary of what we now know:

1. The word contains A (but not in positions 1 or 3).
2. The word contains I, and from PLAIN we know I is in the correct position (5th letter).
3. The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, N are NOT in the word.

So far we have the pattern: _ _ _ _ I with A appearing somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is already taken by I, so A must be in position 2 or 4.

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- ends with I
- contains A in position 2 or 4
- avoids all ruled-out letters

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 2: _A__I → e.g., “CABRI” (but C is allowed), but CABRI is not a valid 5-letter English word.
- If A is in position 4: ___AI → e.g., “CHAI” is 4 letters. We need 5. “VILLA” has L (ruled out). “RABID” has R (ruled out).

Let’s think of 5-letter words ending in I with A in position 2 or 4:
- “TAPIR” – but P is ruled out, R is ruled out.
- “CAULI” – C is allowed, A is allowed in 2nd position, U is allowed, L is ruled out.
- “BASIL” – ends with L, which is ruled out.
- “BASIC” – ends with C, but A is 2nd, S ruled out.
- “HABIT” – ends with T, but A is 2nd, B is allowed, H is allowed, I is allowed, T is allowed. But we need to end with I.
- “HUMID” – ends with D, but I is 4th, D allowed, U, M, H allowed. But needs to end with I.
- “CAMPI” – P is ruled out.
- “RADII” – R is ruled out.
- “FACAI” – not a word.
- “MAFIA” – ends with A, but we need I at end.

Best so far: “CUBIC” – ends with C, but we need I at end.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending with I that contain A and avoid ruled-out letters:

- “CACTI” – C, A, C, T, I. Contains C, A, T, I. Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N – none present. A is 2nd. This fits!
- “BASIL” – L is ruled out.

2. The word contains I, and from PLAIN we know I is in the correct position (5th letter).
3. The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, N are NOT in the word.

So far we have the pattern: _ _ _ _ I with A appearing somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is already taken by I, so A must be in position 2 or 4.

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- ends with I
- contains A in position 2 or 4
- avoids all ruled-out letters

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 2: _A__I → e.g., “CABRI” (but C is allowed), but CABRI is not a valid 5-letter English word.
- If A is in position 4: ___AI → e.g., “CHAI” is 4 letters. We need 5. “VILLA” has L (ruled out). “RABID” has R (ruled out).

Let’s think of 5-letter words ending in I with A in position 2 or 4:
- “TAPIR” – but P is ruled out, R is ruled out.
- “CAULI” – C is allowed, A is allowed in 2nd position, U is allowed, L is ruled out.
- “BASIL” – ends with L, which is ruled out.
- “BASIC” – ends with C, but A is 2nd, S ruled out.
- “HABIT” – ends with T, but A is 2nd, B is allowed, H is allowed, I is allowed, T is allowed. But we need to end with I.
- “HUMID” – ends with D, but I is 4th, D allowed, U, M, H allowed. But needs to end with I.
- “CAMPI” – P is ruled out.
- “RADII” – R is ruled out.
- “FACAI” – not a word.
- “MAFIA” – ends with A, but we need I at end.

Best so far: “CUBIC” – ends with C, but we need I at end.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending with I that contain A and avoid ruled-out letters:

- “CACTI” – C, A, C, T, I. Contains C, A, T, I. Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N – none present. A is 2nd. This fits!
- “BASIL” – L is ruled out.
- “HUMID” – ends with D, not I.
- “TAPIR” – P, R ruled out.
- “CACTI” seems good.

Let’s check CACTI:
- C, A, C, T, I.
- Contains A (in 2nd position – allowed) and I (in 5th – matches feedback).
- No ruled-out letters.

Let’s organize what we now know:

Confirmed letters and positions  
- I is in the word (from PLAIN) but NOT in position 5 (because PLAIN gave I(✓) while CACTI gives I(-))  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (CACTI gave A(✓))

Forbidden letters (never appear): R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T  
Allowed positions  
- A must be in position 2  
- I must appear somewhere other than position 5

Therefore the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _ and must contain I somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 1 (since 5 is ruled out).

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-confirmed A and I.

A good next guess should:
1. put A in position 2  
2. include I in a new position  
3. introduce several new common letters from the allowed set  
4. still be a valid 5-letter English word

Possible patterns:  
- B A _ I _  → could be BAGID? No such word  
- B A _ _ I → BAMBI?  (B, A, M, B, I) – contains M and B, both still allowed – valid English word  
- G A _ I _ → GAMIN?  But N is forbidden  
- D A I _ _ → DAIKY?  Not a word  

BAMBI fits:  
- A is in position 2 (matches ✓)  
- I is in position 5, but we just saw that I(-) in CACTI means I is NOT in position 5, so BAMBI is impossible.

Try I in position 3:  
B A I _ _  → BAILS? L is forbidden  
D A I _ _ → DAILY? L, Y – L forbidden  
F A I _ _ → FAIRY? R, Y – R forbidden  

Try I in position 4:  
B A _ I _  → BABID? Not a word  
B A _ _ I already rejected (I can’t be 5)  
D A _ I _ → DAVID?  D, A, V, I, D – valid word, letters D, V not yet ruled out and all others allowed  

DAVID:  
- A is 2nd (matches ✓)  
- I is 4th (allowed, since it’s a new position)  
- letters D, V not yet tested  

Looks good.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:

- does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

My next guess should:
1. keep the confirmed letter A (but move it away from position 1).
2. avoid the eliminated letters R, O, S, E.
3. introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Popular remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these requirements is “UNTIL”:

I need a word that includes A, excludes R, O, S, E, and still gives good coverage.

Move A to position 2: “MADLY”? Still has A in position 2, but also has D and L.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D.

Let's consolidate everything we now know from the four guesses:

Summary of constraints:
- Word length: 5 letters
- Known positions:
  - Position 2: A (✓ from both CACTI and DAVID)
  - Position 4: I (✓ from DAVID)
  - Thus the pattern is: _ A _ I _
- Letters that must appear: A, I
- Letters that must NOT appear (because they gave x):
  R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T, D, V
- Letters that are still allowed (and haven't been ruled out):
  B, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and I are already placed)

We need a valid English word that fits: ? A ? I ?

Let's list possible candidates using the remaining letters, avoiding any ruled-out letters:

- B: B A ? I ? → BAGGY? (G is allowed, Y is allowed) → BAGGY has G twice; valid word
- F: F A ? I ? → FAIRY? R and Y → R is ruled out
- G: G A ? I ? → GAMIC? C is ruled out
- H: H A ? I ? → HAMID? M and D → D is ruled out
- J: J A ? I ? → JAMBI? M and B → valid? No, not a standard word
- K: K A ? I ? → KAMIK? K and M → valid word (Kamik is a type of boot)
- M: M A ? I ? → MAGIC? C and G → C is ruled out
- U: U A ? I ? → UA is not a common start for 5-letter words
- W: W A ? I ? → WAIST? S is ruled out
- Y: Y A ? I ? → YACHT? C and H → C is ruled out
- Z: Z A ? I ? → ZAMBI? M and B → not a standard word

Best remaining candidates that are valid English words:
- BAGGY
- KAMIK

KAMIK is a bit obscure; BAGGY is more common. Let's go with BAGGY.

Check BAGGY against constraints:
- Letters: B, A, G, G, Y
- Ruled-out letters: none of R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T, D, V appear → OK
- Pattern: _ A _ I _ → BAGGY is B A G G Y → doesn't match (needs I in 4th position, but has G). Oops, mistake.

Realize my error: the pattern is _ A _ I _, so we need the 4th letter to be I, and 2nd is A.

So we need words like ? A I ? ? or ? A ? I ?

Wait, from DAVID we have:
D A V I D → positions:
1: D(x)
2: A(✓)
3: V(x)
4: I(✓)
5: D(x)

Thus confirmed positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: I

Thus pattern is: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 5 with letters not in the forbidden set.

Let's try to find words like: X A Y I Z where X, Y, Z ∈ {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, W, Y} (and not repeating ruled-out letters)

Possible candidates:
- B A G I Y → BAGIY? Not a word
- B A M I X → BAMIX? Not a word
- G A M I K → GAMIK? Not standard
- H A M I D → D is ruled out
- K A M I K → K A M I K → valid (Inuit boot)
- F A K I R → F A K I R → R is ruled out
- J A I L Y → L is ruled out
- M A G I C → C is ruled out
- M A F I A → F, A, I, A → A repeats? Doesn't matter, but pattern is _ A _ I _ → MAFIA is M A F I A → fits:
  - Position 2: A ✓
  - Position 4: I ✓
  - Letters: M, A, F, I, A → all letters allowed (M, F not ruled out)
  - No forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T, D, V absent → OK

MAFIA seems like the clearest remaining valid word that fits.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,MAXIM,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequently used consonants. A good starting word should help eliminate or confirm as many common letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words include: A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. One widely recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters might be in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which is also popular among Wordle players. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (feedback “-”).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word (feedback “x”).

So the secret word:
- definitely contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

My next guess should:
1. keep the confirmed letter A (but move it away from position 1).
2. avoid the eliminated letters R, O, S, E.
3. introduce new common letters to narrow things down.

Popular remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, etc.
Popular remaining vowels: I, U (we already know A is present).

A balanced word that satisfies these requirements is “UNTIL”:
- It includes the confirmed letter A? No… oops, I just realized I forgot to include A. Let me rethink.

I need a word that includes A, excludes R, O, S, E, and still gives good coverage.  
Let me try “ADMIT”:
- A is here, but in position 1, which we know is wrong.  
Move A to position 2: “MADLY”? Still has A in position 2, but also has D and L.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D.  
“PLAIN” has A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, N.  

Between these, “PLAIN” seems stronger because N is very common. Let’s use that.

<guess>PLAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

1. The word contains A (but not in positions 1 or 3).
2. The word contains I, and from PLAIN we know I is in the correct position (5th letter).
3. The letters R, O, S, E, P, L, N are NOT in the word.

So far we have the pattern: _ _ _ _ I with A appearing somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is already taken by I, so A must be in position 2 or 4.

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- ends with I
- contains A in position 2 or 4
- avoids all ruled-out letters

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 2: _A__I → e.g., “CABRI” (but C is allowed), but CABRI is not a valid 5-letter English word.
- If A is in position 4: ___AI → e.g., “CHAI” is 4 letters. We need 5. “VILLA” has L (ruled out). “RABID” has R (ruled out).

Let’s think of 5-letter words ending in I with A in position 2 or 4:
- “TAPIR” – but P is ruled out, R is ruled out.
- “CAULI” – C is allowed, A is allowed in 2nd position, U is allowed, L is ruled out.
- “BASIL” – ends with L, which is ruled out.
- “BASIC” – ends with C, but A is 2nd, S ruled out.
- “HABIT” – ends with T, but A is 2nd, B is allowed, H is allowed, I is allowed, T is allowed. But we need to end with I.
- “HUMID” – ends with D, but I is 4th, D allowed, U, M, H allowed. But needs to end with I.
- “CAMPI” – P is ruled out.
- “RADII” – R is ruled out.
- “FACAI” – not a word.
- “MAFIA” – ends with A, but we need I at end.

Best so far: “CUBIC” – ends with C, but we need I at end.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending with I that contain A and avoid ruled-out letters:

- “CACTI” – C, A, C, T, I. Contains C, A, T, I. Ruled-out letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N – none present. A is 2nd. This fits!
- “BASIL” – L is ruled out.
- “HUMID” – ends with D, not I.
- “TAPIR” – P, R ruled out.
- “CACTI” seems good.

Let’s check CACTI:
- C, A, C, T, I.
- Contains A (in 2nd position – allowed) and I (in 5th – matches feedback).
- No ruled-out letters.

Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: CACTI -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) C(x) T(x) I(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s organize what we now know:

Confirmed letters and positions  
- I is in the word (from PLAIN) but NOT in position 5 (because PLAIN gave I(✓) while CACTI gives I(-))  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (CACTI gave A(✓))

Forbidden letters (never appear): R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T  
Allowed positions  
- A must be in position 2  
- I must appear somewhere other than position 5

Therefore the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _ and must contain I somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 1 (since 5 is ruled out).

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-confirmed A and I.

A good next guess should:
1. put A in position 2  
2. include I in a new position  
3. introduce several new common letters from the allowed set  
4. still be a valid 5-letter English word

Possible patterns:  
- B A _ I _  → could be BAGID? No such word  
- B A _ _ I → BAMBI?  (B, A, M, B, I) – contains M and B, both still allowed – valid English word  
- G A _ I _ → GAMIN?  But N is forbidden  
- D A I _ _ → DAIKY?  Not a word  

BAMBI fits:  
- A is in position 2 (matches ✓)  
- I is in position 5, but we just saw that I(-) in CACTI means I is NOT in position 5, so BAMBI is impossible.

Try I in position 3:  
B A I _ _  → BAILS? L is forbidden  
D A I _ _ → DAILY? L, Y – L forbidden  
F A I _ _ → FAIRY? R, Y – R forbidden  

Try I in position 4:  
B A _ I _  → BABID? Not a word  
B A _ _ I already rejected (I can’t be 5)  
D A _ I _ → DAVID?  D, A, V, I, D – valid word, letters D, V not yet ruled out and all others allowed  

DAVID:  
- A is 2nd (matches ✓)  
- I is 4th (allowed, since it’s a new position)  
- letters D, V not yet tested  

Looks good.

  - Letters: M, A, F, I, A → all letters allowed (M, F not ruled out)
  - No forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, C, T, D, V absent → OK

MAFIA seems like the clearest remaining valid word that fits.

This gives us good coverage to see which of these letters might be in the secret word.\n\nAnother good option is ""SLATE"" which is also popular among Wordle players.

Remaining unused letters that can appear in positions 3 and 5:
