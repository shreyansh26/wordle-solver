Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A popular first guess choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words, helping us quickly determine which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word:
- Contains S and E, but not A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4 (since it was marked - in AROSE, which has S as the 4th letter).
- E is not in position 5 (since it was marked - in AROSE, which has E as the 5th letter).

I need a new guess that:
- Uses S and E, but not A, R, or O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good next guess would be ""STEIN"", but it contains 'I' and 'N' which we haven't tested yet, and positions S and E differently. However, 'T' hasn't been tested either, and it’s a common consonant. 

Another option is ""SLEET"", but that repeats E and we don’t know if letters can repeat. To maximize information, let’s avoid repeats for now.

Let me try ""STEPS"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4).
- E is in position 3 (not 5).
- T, P are new letters to test.
- No repeats.

But ""STEPS"" has S in position 1 and 5, which might not be ideal. Alternatively, ""SHEET"" uses H, which is less common, but might not cover enough ground.

Let's update our knowledge:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, P, M, C
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S (fixed at position 1), E, and now I (since I was marked - in SEMIC, meaning it's in the word but wrong position)
3. Position restrictions:
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from STEPS and AROSE)
   - I cannot be in position 4 (from SEMIC)
   - S is fixed at position 1 (✓ from STEPS and SEMIC)

So the word structure is: S _ _ _ _
With letters to use: E, I, and possibly others from remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Possible positions:
- E must be in position 2 or 4
- I must be in position 2, 3, or 5

Looking at possible combinations:
If E is in position 2: S E I _ _ or S E _ I _
If E is in position 4: S _ E I _ or S _ I _ E

Let's think of valid English words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters. 

Possible candidates:
- SHEIK (but H is untested, and K is untested)
- SIEGE (but G is untested)
- SINCE (N is untested)
- SPINE (but P is known to be not in the word)
- SLICE (but C is known to be not in the word)
- SINED (but D is untested)

Looking at these, ""SINCE"" seems like a good choice:
- S (position 1) ✓
- I (position 2) - this could be correct or wrong position
- N (new letter, untested)
- C (but C is known to be not in the word) - wait, this is bad, C is not allowed.

Let me rethink. ""SHEIK"":
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (untested)
- E (position 3 - but E cannot be in position 3 from earlier feedback)
- I (position 4 - allowed since I can be here)
- K (untested)

But E cannot be in position 3, so SHEIK is invalid.

""SHINE"":

""SINEW"":
- S (1) ✓

- N (untested)

- W (untested)
This fits all constraints:
- S fixed at 1
- E at 4 (allowed position)
- I at 2 (allowed position, since I can be anywhere except 4)
- Uses only untested letters N and W from allowed set
- No forbidden letters
