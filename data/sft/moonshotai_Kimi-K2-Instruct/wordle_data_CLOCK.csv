For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like 'A', 'E', 'O'
- Common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N'

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (three common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters present in the word.

Other good options could be ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is my preferred choice for the first guess.

From the new feedback:

1. O is still in the word, but it is **NOT** in position 3 (it moved from ✓ to -).
2. P, I, N, T are **NOT** in the word.

Updated constraints:
- Word length: 5 letters
- Must contain the letter O (but not in position 3)
- Must not contain: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T

Remaining vowels to test: U, Y (plus possibly combinations like OU, OY)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English word that:
- Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Avoids all the forbidden letters

Let’s list possible positions for O:
- O _ _ _ _
- _ O _ _ _
- _ _ _ O _
- _ _ _ _ O

Candidate words:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D (all allowed)
- COUCH: C, O, U, C, H (but C repeats, and we're not sure about C yet)
- FOUL: too short
- BOUGH: B, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- DOUGH: D, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- MOULD: M, O, U, L, D (all allowed)

Among these, ""DOUGH"" and ""COULD"" are strong. ""DOUGH"" covers more new letters (D, G, H, U), while ""COULD"" covers C, U, L, D. ""DOUGH"" seems slightly better as it tests G and H which are high-frequency consonants.

But ""COULD"" is also a good choice. Between the two, ""COULD"" is more common in Wordle solvers.

Wait, let me double-check:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D - none of these are in the forbidden list, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Known constraints
1. O is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in POINT and COULD it was marked ‘-’ when in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and in AROSE it was marked ✓ in position 3 and then later demoted to ‘-’, which means it is ONLY allowed in position 2).
   Therefore: O must be in position 2.

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D.

3. Letters that **are** in the word, but their exact positions are still unknown:
   - C (marked ✓ in position 1 in COULD, so C is definitely in the word and is in position 1)
   - L (marked ‘-’ in position 4 in COULD, so L is definitely in the word, but not in position 4)

So we now have:
C _ O _ _

and L must appear somewhere else (cannot be in position 4).

Possible remaining consonants & vowels to fill positions 3, 4, 5:
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any other vowels not yet tested: Y can act as a vowel, but we’ve already eliminated A, E, I, U).

We need:
- Position 3: already fixed as O
- Position 4: any allowed letter except L (since L cannot be 4)
- Position 5: any allowed letter

But we also have to place L somewhere. The only positions it can be are 3 or 5, but position 3 is O, so L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is forced:
C _ O _ L

But we still need to choose a consonant for position 2 (and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters).

Allowed consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common English word that fits C ? O ? L, where the second letter is one of the above.

Let’s list plausible English 5-letter words that fit C _ O _ L:
- COBOL (a programming language, but uses B and L)
- COGOL (not a word)
- COHOL (not a word)
- COVOL (not a word)
- COYOL (not a word)
- COBOL is the only real word that fits.

But does COBOL satisfy all constraints?
- Letters used: C, O, B, O, L.
- C is allowed in position 1.
- O is allowed in position 2 (matches our deduction).
- B is not yet eliminated (✓).
- L must be in the word, and here it is in position 5 (allowed).
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is COBOL.

(If COBOL turned out to be incorrect, we would know B is wrong, but for now it is the only valid English word fitting the constraints.)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like 'A', 'E', 'O'
- Common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N'

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (three common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters present in the word.

Other good options could be ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is my preferred choice for the first guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and is in the 3rd position (✓)

So the pattern is _ _ O _ _ and the remaining letters must avoid A, R, S, E.  
We still want to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).  
A good next guess should:
1. Keep the O in position 3.
2. Introduce new, common letters we haven’t tried yet.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

Candidate letters to include: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

One strong word fitting these criteria is ""POINT"":
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Introduces P, I, N, T (all common letters we haven’t tested yet).
- Avoids A, R, S, E.

Other valid options could be ""DOING"", ""JOINT"", or ""CLOUD"", but ""POINT"" is a balanced choice.

1. O is still in the word, but it is **NOT** in position 3 (it moved from ✓ to -).
2. P, I, N, T are **NOT** in the word.

Updated constraints:
- Word length: 5 letters
- Must contain the letter O (but not in position 3)
- Must not contain: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T

Remaining vowels to test: U, Y (plus possibly combinations like OU, OY)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English word that:
- Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Avoids all the forbidden letters

Let’s list possible positions for O:
- O _ _ _ _
- _ O _ _ _
- _ _ _ O _
- _ _ _ _ O

Candidate words:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D (all allowed)
- COUCH: C, O, U, C, H (but C repeats, and we're not sure about C yet)
- FOUL: too short
- BOUGH: B, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- DOUGH: D, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- MOULD: M, O, U, L, D (all allowed)

Among these, ""DOUGH"" and ""COULD"" are strong. ""DOUGH"" covers more new letters (D, G, H, U), while ""COULD"" covers C, U, L, D. ""DOUGH"" seems slightly better as it tests G and H which are high-frequency consonants.

But ""COULD"" is also a good choice. Between the two, ""COULD"" is more common in Wordle solvers.

Wait, let me double-check:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D - none of these are in the forbidden list, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
- Here O is in position 2, which is allowed.

So ""COULD"" is a valid and strong next guess.

   Therefore: O must be in position 2.

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:

3. Letters that **are** in the word, but their exact positions are still unknown:
   - C (marked ✓ in position 1 in COULD, so C is definitely in the word and is in position 1)
   - L (marked ‘-’ in position 4 in COULD, so L is definitely in the word, but not in position 4)

So we now have:
C _ O _ _

and L must appear somewhere else (cannot be in position 4).

Possible remaining consonants & vowels to fill positions 3, 4, 5:
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any other vowels not yet tested: Y can act as a vowel, but we’ve already eliminated A, E, I, U).

We need:

- Position 5: any allowed letter

But we also have to place L somewhere. The only positions it can be are 3 or 5, but position 3 is O, so L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is forced:
C _ O _ L

But we still need to choose a consonant for position 2 (and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters).

Allowed consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common English word that fits C ? O ? L, where the second letter is one of the above.

Let’s list plausible English 5-letter words that fit C _ O _ L:
- COBOL (a programming language, but uses B and L)

- All letters are valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is COBOL.

From the new feedback on COBOL:

1. C is still correct in position 1 (✓).
2. O is still in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because in COBOL it was in positions 2 and 4 and both were marked '-'). This is a crucial contradiction with our previous deduction that O must be in position 2. The feedback is telling us O is NOT in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but it must be in the word. This is impossible for a 5-letter word unless the feedback is being interpreted incorrectly.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback history carefully:

- AROSE: O was marked ✓ (correct position 3)
- POINT: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)
- COULD: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)
- COBOL: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)

This sequence shows:
- Initially O was in position 3 (✓)
- Then in subsequent guesses, O appeared in positions 2, 2, 2,4 respectively and was marked ""-"" each time
- This means O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- The only remaining position for O is position 1, but position 1 is already taken by C (✓)

This appears to be a contradiction, which suggests an error in my interpretation. Let me re-examine:

Looking back at the feedback:
- AROSE: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 (correct)
- POINT: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in word but NOT position 2
- COULD: C(✓) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(x) → O is in word but NOT position 2
- COBOL: C(✓) O(-) B(x) O(-) L(-) → O is in word but NOT positions 2 or 4

Therefore:
- O must be in position 3 (from AROSE's ✓)
- All other positions for O are invalid based on subsequent feedback
- But we have C(✓) in position 1, which is fixed

So the pattern must be: C _ O _ _

We also know:
- L is in word (from COULD's L(-)) but NOT in position 4 (from COULD) or position 5 (from COBOL)
- So L must be in position 2
- This gives us: C L O _ _

We need one more letter for position 5, avoiding all eliminated letters:
Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D, B
Allowed: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting CLO_ _, the most common is:
C L O C K - but C repeats, and we don't know if repeats are allowed
C L O U D - but U and D are eliminated
C L O G S - S is eliminated
C L O M P - P is eliminated
C L O V E - E is eliminated
C L O V N - not a word
C L O M B - B is eliminated
C L O F T - F is allowed
C L O W N - W is allowed

Looking at these, ""CLOFT"" is valid but rare. ""CLOWN"" is more common and all letters are allowed.
Both C and L are confirmed, O is confirmed in position 3.
So the most reasonable next guess is CLOWN.

Based on the feedback, the pattern is now:

- C at position 1 (✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like 'A', 'E', 'O'
- Common consonants like 'R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N'

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O, E (three common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters present in the word.

Other good options could be ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is my preferred choice for the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and is in the 3rd position (✓)

So the pattern is _ _ O _ _ and the remaining letters must avoid A, R, S, E.  
We still want to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).  
A good next guess should:
1. Keep the O in position 3.
2. Introduce new, common letters we haven’t tried yet.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

Candidate letters to include: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

One strong word fitting these criteria is ""POINT"":
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Introduces P, I, N, T (all common letters we haven’t tested yet).
- Avoids A, R, S, E.

Other valid options could be ""DOING"", ""JOINT"", or ""CLOUD"", but ""POINT"" is a balanced choice.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. O is still in the word, but it is **NOT** in position 3 (it moved from ✓ to -).
2. P, I, N, T are **NOT** in the word.

Updated constraints:
- Word length: 5 letters
- Must contain the letter O (but not in position 3)
- Must not contain: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T

Remaining vowels to test: U, Y (plus possibly combinations like OU, OY)
Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid English word that:
- Has O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- Avoids all the forbidden letters

Let’s list possible positions for O:
- O _ _ _ _
- _ O _ _ _
- _ _ _ O _
- _ _ _ _ O

Candidate words:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D (all allowed)
- COUCH: C, O, U, C, H (but C repeats, and we're not sure about C yet)
- FOUL: too short
- BOUGH: B, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- DOUGH: D, O, U, G, H (all allowed)
- MOULD: M, O, U, L, D (all allowed)

Among these, ""DOUGH"" and ""COULD"" are strong. ""DOUGH"" covers more new letters (D, G, H, U), while ""COULD"" covers C, U, L, D. ""DOUGH"" seems slightly better as it tests G and H which are high-frequency consonants.

But ""COULD"" is also a good choice. Between the two, ""COULD"" is more common in Wordle solvers.

Wait, let me double-check:
- COULD: C, O, U, L, D - none of these are in the forbidden list, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
- Here O is in position 2, which is allowed.

So ""COULD"" is a valid and strong next guess.

Guess 3: COULD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Known constraints
1. O is in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because in POINT and COULD it was marked ‘-’ when in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and in AROSE it was marked ✓ in position 3 and then later demoted to ‘-’, which means it is ONLY allowed in position 2).
   Therefore: O must be in position 2.

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D.

3. Letters that **are** in the word, but their exact positions are still unknown:
   - C (marked ✓ in position 1 in COULD, so C is definitely in the word and is in position 1)
   - L (marked ‘-’ in position 4 in COULD, so L is definitely in the word, but not in position 4)

So we now have:
C _ O _ _

and L must appear somewhere else (cannot be in position 4).

Possible remaining consonants & vowels to fill positions 3, 4, 5:
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any other vowels not yet tested: Y can act as a vowel, but we’ve already eliminated A, E, I, U).

We need:
- Position 3: already fixed as O
- Position 4: any allowed letter except L (since L cannot be 4)
- Position 5: any allowed letter

But we also have to place L somewhere. The only positions it can be are 3 or 5, but position 3 is O, so L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is forced:
C _ O _ L

But we still need to choose a consonant for position 2 (and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters).

Allowed consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a common English word that fits C ? O ? L, where the second letter is one of the above.

Let’s list plausible English 5-letter words that fit C _ O _ L:
- COBOL (a programming language, but uses B and L)
- COGOL (not a word)
- COHOL (not a word)
- COVOL (not a word)
- COYOL (not a word)
- COBOL is the only real word that fits.

But does COBOL satisfy all constraints?
- Letters used: C, O, B, O, L.
- C is allowed in position 1.
- O is allowed in position 2 (matches our deduction).
- B is not yet eliminated (✓).
- L must be in the word, and here it is in position 5 (allowed).
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is COBOL.

(If COBOL turned out to be incorrect, we would know B is wrong, but for now it is the only valid English word fitting the constraints.)

Guess 4: COBOL -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) B(x) O(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on COBOL:

1. C is still correct in position 1 (✓).
2. O is still in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because in COBOL it was in positions 2 and 4 and both were marked '-'). This is a crucial contradiction with our previous deduction that O must be in position 2. The feedback is telling us O is NOT in position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but it must be in the word. This is impossible for a 5-letter word unless the feedback is being interpreted incorrectly.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback history carefully:

- AROSE: O was marked ✓ (correct position 3)
- POINT: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)
- COULD: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)
- COBOL: O was marked - (in word but wrong position)

This sequence shows:
- Initially O was in position 3 (✓)
- Then in subsequent guesses, O appeared in positions 2, 2, 2,4 respectively and was marked ""-"" each time
- This means O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- The only remaining position for O is position 1, but position 1 is already taken by C (✓)

This appears to be a contradiction, which suggests an error in my interpretation. Let me re-examine:

Looking back at the feedback:
- AROSE: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x) → O is in position 3 (correct)
- POINT: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x) → O is in word but NOT position 2
- COULD: C(✓) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(x) → O is in word but NOT position 2
- COBOL: C(✓) O(-) B(x) O(-) L(-) → O is in word but NOT positions 2 or 4

Therefore:
- O must be in position 3 (from AROSE's ✓)
- All other positions for O are invalid based on subsequent feedback
- But we have C(✓) in position 1, which is fixed

So the pattern must be: C _ O _ _

We also know:
- L is in word (from COULD's L(-)) but NOT in position 4 (from COULD) or position 5 (from COBOL)
- So L must be in position 2
- This gives us: C L O _ _

We need one more letter for position 5, avoiding all eliminated letters:
Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D, B
Allowed: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting CLO_ _, the most common is:
C L O C K - but C repeats, and we don't know if repeats are allowed
C L O U D - but U and D are eliminated
C L O G S - S is eliminated
C L O M P - P is eliminated
C L O V E - E is eliminated
C L O V N - not a word
C L O M B - B is eliminated
C L O F T - F is allowed
C L O W N - W is allowed

Looking at these, ""CLOFT"" is valid but rare. ""CLOWN"" is more common and all letters are allowed.
Both C and L are confirmed, O is confirmed in position 3.
So the most reasonable next guess is CLOWN.Based on the feedback, the pattern is now:

- C at position 1 (✓)
- O at position 3 (✓ from AROSE)
- L must be in position 2 (since it can't be 4 or 5)
- Need to test a new consonant in position 5 while avoiding all eliminated letters

Letters that **are** in the word, but their exact positions are still unknown:\n   - C (marked ✓ in position 1 in COULD, so C is definitely in the word and is in position 1)\n   - L (marked ‘-’ in position 4 in COULD, so L is definitely in the word, but not in position 4)\n\nSo we now have:\nC _ O _ _\n\nand L must appear somewhere else (cannot be in position 4).\n\nPossible remaining consonants & vowels to fill positions 3, 4, 5:\nAllowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any other vowels not yet tested: Y can act as a vowel, but we’ve already eliminated A, E, I, U).\n\nWe need:\n- Position 3: already fixed as O\n- Position 4: any allowed letter except L (since L cannot be 4)\n- Position 5: any allowed letter\n\nBut we also have to place L somewhere. The only positions it can be are 3 or 5, but position 3 is O, so L must be in position 5.\n\nThus the pattern is forced:\nC _ O _ L\n\nBut we still need to choose a consonant for position 2 (and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters).\n\nAllowed consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want a common English word that fits C ? O ? L, where the second letter is one of the above.\n\nLet’s list plausible English 5-letter words that fit C _ O _ L:\n- COBOL (a programming language, but uses B and L)\n- COGOL (not a word)\n- COHOL (not a word)\n- COVOL (not a word)\n- COYOL (not a word)\n- COBOL is the only real word that fits.\n\nBut does COBOL satisfy all constraints?\n- Letters used: C, O, B, O, L.\n- C is allowed in position 1.\n- O is allowed in position 2 (matches our deduction).\n- B is not yet eliminated (✓).\n- L must be in the word, and here it is in position 5 (allowed).\n- All letters are valid.\n\nTherefore, the next logical guess is COBOL.\n\n(If COBOL turned out to be incorrect, we would know B is wrong, but for now it is the only valid English word fitting the constraints.)\n\n<guess>COBOL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COULD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) U(x) L(-) D(x)\nGuess 4: COBOL -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) B(x) O(-) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on COBOL:\n\n1.

We now have the first three letters locked in:

C L O _ _

and we know the last two letters are NOT W or N and must avoid the long list of already-eliminated letters:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, D, B, W, N.

Allowed letters still available (and common in final positions):
F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter English words beginning with CLO…
- CLOGS – S is eliminated
- CLOMP – P is eliminated
- CLOUD – U and D are eliminated
- CLOVE – E is eliminated
- CLOAK – A and K are available, but A is eliminated
- CLOTH – T and H: T is eliminated
- CLOMB – B is eliminated
- CLOMP – P is eliminated
- CLOYS – Y is allowed, S is eliminated
- CLOFF – not a word
- CLOMP – already saw P is out
- CLOCH – not a word
- CLOKE – E is eliminated
- CLOWK – not a word
- CLOMP – again P is out

A valid, common word that fits is “CLOMP,” but P is eliminated.  
The next plausible, common word is “CLOMB,” but B is eliminated.  

Actually, let’s list every possible combination with allowed letters:

Allowed for positions 4 and 5 (no repeats of eliminated letters):

Position 4: any of F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Position 5: any of the same, but must form a real word.

Scanning the mental dictionary, the only remaining common word is:

C L O C K – but C repeats, and we have no info forbidding repeats.

However, C is already confirmed in positions 1 and 3 is O. Re-using C is acceptable unless Wordle forbids repeats (it doesn’t). So:

C L O C K

Both C’s are allowed, and K has never been tested. This is a valid word.

Another candidate: C L O G G – not valid.

C L O G H – not a word.

C L O F G – not a word.

C L O M K – not a word.

C L O V K – not a word.

C L O K Y – not a word.

C L O G Y – not a word.

C L O D Y – D and Y: D is eliminated.

C L O F Y – not a word.

C L O K E – E is eliminated.

C L O K K – not valid.

C L O F F – valid word (meaning a blow or strike).  

Between “CLOFF” and “CLOCK,” “CLOCK” is far more common.

So the strongest next guess is “CLOCK.”
