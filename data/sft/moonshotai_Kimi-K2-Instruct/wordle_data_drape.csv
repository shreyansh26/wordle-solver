For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers high frequency letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - similar coverage
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T) - good vowel/consonant mix

I'll go with **ROAST** as it includes:
- Two vowels (O, A) which are very common
- Three high-frequency consonants (R, S, T)
- Avoids repeating any letters to maximize information

From the last feedback on ROAST:
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(x)  → O is not in the word at all  
A(✓)  → A is in the word AND in position 3  
S(x)  → S is not in the word  
T(x)  → T is not in the word  

So we now know:
- Position 3 is A
- R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (not 1)
- We can eliminate O, S, T entirely
- We still need four more letters (including R)

Good letters to try next are common ones that have not been ruled out: E, I, N, L, C, H, B, M, P, U, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Uses R somewhere other than position 1
3. Introduces new common letters
4. Uses no O, S, or T

A strong candidate is “CRANE”:

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Known positions:
- A is fixed in position 3 (✓).

Letters that must appear somewhere (but not yet placed):
- R – earlier shown to be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (because in ROAST it was “-” at 1, in CRANE “✓” at 2, in PEARL “-” at 4, and it is not at 5 because PEARL put it at 4 and got “-”).  
  Therefore R has nowhere left except position 3 … but position 3 is A.  
  That is impossible, so I must have mis-read the feedback.

Re-examine carefully:
- PEARL feedback was P(-) E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x).

“R(-)” means R is in the word but NOT at position 4.

Summary of R placements tried so far:
- Position 1 (ROAST) → R(-) → not 1  
- Position 2 (CRANE) → R(✓) → it IS at 2  
- Position 4 (PEARL) → R(-) → not 4  
So R must be at 2 or 5.  
But at CRANE we got R(✓) at 2, so R is definitely in position 2.

Likewise for E:
- CRANE: E at 5 → E(✓) → must be at 5 (because PEARL put E at 2 and got (-), so E is NOT 1,2,3,4; therefore E must be 5).  
  But wait: PEARL feedback was E(-) at 2, meaning E is in the word but not at 2.  
  CRANE feedback was E(✓) at 5.  
  That locks E at position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 5: E  

Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown.  
Letters ruled out: O, S, T, C, N, L, P.  
Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4.  
A high-frequency consonant pair is B and D.

Test “BREAD”:
- B at 1, R at 2, E at 3? No, E must be at 5.  
  Let me re-state: the word form is _ R A _ E.

Good candidate: B R A V E  
- B(new), R(✓ at 2), A(✓ at 3), V(new), E(✓ at 5).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,drape,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers high frequency letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - similar coverage
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T) - good vowel/consonant mix

I'll go with **ROAST** as it includes:
- Two vowels (O, A) which are very common
- Three high-frequency consonants (R, S, T)
- Avoids repeating any letters to maximize information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the last feedback on ROAST:
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(x)  → O is not in the word at all  
A(✓)  → A is in the word AND in position 3  
S(x)  → S is not in the word  
T(x)  → T is not in the word  

So we now know:
- Position 3 is A
- R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (not 1)
- We can eliminate O, S, T entirely
- We still need four more letters (including R)

Good letters to try next are common ones that have not been ruled out: E, I, N, L, C, H, B, M, P, U, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Uses R somewhere other than position 1
3. Introduces new common letters
4. Uses no O, S, or T

A strong candidate is “CRANE”:
- C (new letter)
- R (known to exist, placed in position 2)
- A (fixed in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- E (new letter)

No O, S, or T, and it gives us info on C, N, E.

Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

To place R and E:
- R can be 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is A, so 4 or 5)  
- E can be 1, 2, or 4  

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3  
- Put R in a new spot (4 or 5)  
- Put E in a new spot (1, 2, or 4)  
- Introduce new common letters

Consider “PEARL”:
- P(new), E(pos 1), A(pos 3), R(pos 4), L(new) → satisfies all constraints.

Alternative “REALM” would repeat L, M, but E is at 2, R at 3 → 3 is A, conflict.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,drape,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers high frequency letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - similar coverage
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T) - good vowel/consonant mix

I'll go with **ROAST** as it includes:
- Two vowels (O, A) which are very common
- Three high-frequency consonants (R, S, T)
- Avoids repeating any letters to maximize information

<guess>ROAST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the last feedback on ROAST:
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(x)  → O is not in the word at all  
A(✓)  → A is in the word AND in position 3  
S(x)  → S is not in the word  
T(x)  → T is not in the word  

So we now know:
- Position 3 is A
- R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (not 1)
- We can eliminate O, S, T entirely
- We still need four more letters (including R)

Good letters to try next are common ones that have not been ruled out: E, I, N, L, C, H, B, M, P, U, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Uses R somewhere other than position 1
3. Introduces new common letters
4. Uses no O, S, or T

A strong candidate is “CRANE”:
- C (new letter)
- R (known to exist, placed in position 2)
- A (fixed in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- E (new letter)

No O, S, or T, and it gives us info on C, N, E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
1. Position 3: A (✓)  
2. R is in the word, but NOT in positions 1 or 2  
3. E is in the word, but not in position 5  
4. Letters ruled out so far: O, S, T, C, N  

We have three known letters: A (position 3), R (positions 3-5), E (positions 1-4).  
Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

To place R and E:
- R can be 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is A, so 4 or 5)  
- E can be 1, 2, or 4  

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3  
- Put R in a new spot (4 or 5)  
- Put E in a new spot (1, 2, or 4)  
- Introduce new common letters

Consider “PEARL”:
- P(new), E(pos 1), A(pos 3), R(pos 4), L(new) → satisfies all constraints.

Alternative “REALM” would repeat L, M, but E is at 2, R at 3 → 3 is A, conflict.

“PEARL” seems clean.

Guess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: PEARL -> FEEDBACK: P(-) E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Known positions:
- A is fixed in position 3 (✓).

Letters that must appear somewhere (but not yet placed):
- R – earlier shown to be in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (because in ROAST it was “-” at 1, in CRANE “✓” at 2, in PEARL “-” at 4, and it is not at 5 because PEARL put it at 4 and got “-”).  
  Therefore R has nowhere left except position 3 … but position 3 is A.  
  That is impossible, so I must have mis-read the feedback.

Re-examine carefully:
- PEARL feedback was P(-) E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x).

“R(-)” means R is in the word but NOT at position 4.

Summary of R placements tried so far:
- Position 1 (ROAST) → R(-) → not 1  
- Position 2 (CRANE) → R(✓) → it IS at 2  
- Position 4 (PEARL) → R(-) → not 4  
So R must be at 2 or 5.  
But at CRANE we got R(✓) at 2, so R is definitely in position 2.

Likewise for E:
- CRANE: E at 5 → E(✓) → must be at 5 (because PEARL put E at 2 and got (-), so E is NOT 1,2,3,4; therefore E must be 5).  
  But wait: PEARL feedback was E(-) at 2, meaning E is in the word but not at 2.  
  CRANE feedback was E(✓) at 5.  
  That locks E at position 5.

So far we have:
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A  
- Position 5: E  

Positions 1 and 4 are still unknown.  
Letters ruled out: O, S, T, C, N, L, P.  
Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4.  
A high-frequency consonant pair is B and D.

Test “BREAD”:
- B at 1, R at 2, E at 3? No, E must be at 5.  
  Let me re-state: the word form is _ R A _ E.

Good candidate: B R A V E  
- B(new), R(✓ at 2), A(✓ at 3), V(new), E(✓ at 5).  
It introduces two new letters at once.

Another usable candidate: F R A M E  
But BRAVE is slightly more common.

I’ll go with BRAVE.

<guess>BRAVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: PEARL -> FEEDBACK: P(-) E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x)
Guess 4: BRAVE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate the exact facts we now have:

1. A is fixed in position 3 (from every guess).
2. R is fixed in position 2 (from CRANE: R✓ at position 2).
3. E is fixed in position 5 (from CRANE: E✓ at position 5).
4. Letters ruled out completely:  
   O, S, T, C, N, L, P, B, V.

So the pattern is: _ R A _ E.

Letters still available for positions 1 and 4:  
D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, W, Y (plus any others not yet tried).

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4 from that list.  
High-frequency unused consonants are D, F, G, H.

A common word fitting _R A _E is GRADE, but D and G are both still available.

Let’s check GRADE:
- G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, D at 4, E at 5.  
- Letters G and D are both still possible.

This seems like the best next guess to nail down the final two letters.
