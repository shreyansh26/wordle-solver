For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters in English. The best starting words typically include multiple vowels and common consonants. Some top choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered one of the strongest opening words, containing:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers letters from both the front and back halves of the alphabet

So far we know:
- A is in the word and is in the **correct** position (position 3).
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all.

The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _

Now I want a second guess that:
- Keeps A in the third spot.
- Introduces as many new, common letters as possible that weren’t already ruled out.
- Good remaining candidates include letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong choice that fits _ _ A _ _ and uses five entirely new letters is:
- GRAPE (G, P, E are ruled out because of E and R already, so skip)
- SLATE (S, L, T are new, but E is ruled out)
- PLAID (P, L, I, D are new)
- STAMP (S, T, M, P are new, but I prefer more vowel coverage)

I’ll go with “PLAID” because it introduces four new letters (P, L, I, D) while preserving the known position of A.

We now have two pieces of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word and fixed in position 3.  
   – C, R, N, E are absent.

2. PLAID → P(-) L(x) A(✓) I(x) D(x)  
   – A is still correct in position 3.  
   – L, I, D are NOT in the word.  
   – P is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So the pattern is _ _ A _ _ and the only letters we know are possibly present are P (not in spot 1) and A (fixed in spot 3).

We also know these letters are OUT: C, R, N, E, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters to test: S, T, O, U, B, G, H, M, K, Y, F, V, W, X, Z, etc.

I want a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3.
- Uses as many of the still-allowed common letters as possible.
- Uses P somewhere other than position 1.

Quick scan for words of the form _ _ A _ _ that avoid all forbidden letters and place P in spots 2–5:

- SPA??  – S is allowed, P not in spot 1 → spot 2: S P A ? ? → 3-letter word pattern SPA?? but we need 5 letters.  
- TAP??  – T allowed, P in spot 2: T P A ? ? → TP is not a typical start.  
- SPO??  – O allowed, P in spot 2: S P O A ? – but that’s 4 letters; need 5.  
- SOAK? – K allowed: S O A K ? – but where does P go?  
- PUMPS – P starts; not allowed because P must not be in spot 1.  
- GAMMA – has M, A, but A is already fixed in spot 3.  
- GAP?? – P in spot 3, but A is already fixed in spot 3 so P cannot be there.  
- GOATS – has O, A, T, S; no P; let’s keep P in play.  
- PAWSY – P in spot 1; not allowed.  
- PASTY – P in spot 1; not allowed.  
- STAMP – P in spot 4; S, T, A, M, P; all letters allowed (S, T, M, P are still possible).  
  – Pattern: _ _ A _ _ with P in spot 4: S T A M P → STAMP  
  – No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, I, D) appear.

STAMP seems perfect: it keeps A in position 3, places P in a legal spot (4), and brings in new letters S, T, M.
