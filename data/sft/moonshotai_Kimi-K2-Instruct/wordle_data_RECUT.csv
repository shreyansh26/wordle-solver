For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters frequently found in English 5-letter words. This maximizes the information gained from the feedback. Some excellent starting words include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words use a mix of common vowels and consonants.

I've decided to go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This combination should give us good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on RAISE:

R(✓) – R is in the correct first position.
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 5).

So we know:
- Word pattern: R _ _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: A, I, S
- Letter E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Good next step: pick a word that starts with R, contains E in one of the remaining spots, and avoids A, I, S. Also include a few other common consonants to test more letters.

Possible words: ROBED, ROWER, ROGER, REBEL, ROPER, RENAL, RECAP, etc.

""ROBED"" uses:
- R (✓)
- O (new vowel)
- B (common consonant)
- E (needs to be placed)
- D (common consonant)

This tests O, B, D, and places E in position 4.

Current constraints:

1. R E _ _ _  (positions 1 and 2 are locked)
2. Forbidden letters so far: A, I, S, O, B, D, H
3. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word: E is already placed in position 2.
4. Remaining feedback:
   - T(-): T is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C(-): C is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word looks like: R E _ _ _
- T must appear in either position 4 or 5.
- C must appear in either position 3 or 5.

Possible placements:
- If C is in position 3: R E C _ _  and T must be in 4 or 5. Valid 5-letter words: RECUT, RECTO (but O is forbidden), RECIT (I forbidden), RECKT (not a word), RECAP (A forbidden).
- If C is in position 5: R E _ _ C and T must be in position 3 or 4. Valid 5-letter words: RENGC (not a word), RELIC (I forbidden), REMIC (not common), RETCH (already played), REWEC (not a word), REFIC (not a word).

Looking for valid words that fit R E _ _ _ with T and C in remaining positions:
- R E C T _  → RECT_  needs a 5th letter. RECTO (O forbidden), RECTA (A forbidden), RECTI (I forbidden). No valid words.
- R E _ C T  → Examples: RENCT, RELCT, REFCT, REGCT, REKCT - none are valid words.
- R E T C _  → RETC_ - no valid words.
- R E _ T C  → Examples: RENTC, RELTC, REFTC, REGTC - none are valid words.

Alternative: Maybe both T and C are in positions 4 and 5, but swapped:
- R E _ T C  → RENTC (invalid)
- R E _ C T  → RENCT (invalid)

Hmm, this suggests we might need to look for words with double letters or other combinations. Let me reconsider possible words starting with RE that include T and C but avoid all forbidden letters.

Valid words starting with RE that include T and C:
- RECUT (C in 3, T in 5) - uses U which hasn't been tested
- RECTO (invalid due to O)
- RECIT (invalid due to I)
- REACT (invalid due to A)

RECUT seems to be the only valid option:
- R E C U T
- C is in position 3 (allowed, since previous feedback only said C is not in position 4)
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since previous feedback only said T is not in position 3)
- U is a new untested vowel that might be acceptable
- No forbidden letters are used (A, I, S, O, B, D, H are avoided)
