For the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information about the letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)

I'll go with SLATE as it contains some of the most common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E) in English, giving us a good chance to find letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:  
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).  
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (✓), so the word must contain an E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Since we now know four letters that are definitely absent, we should pick a word that:  
1. Still uses the letter E (but not in position 5).  
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.  
3. Introduces as many other common consonants and vowels as possible.

Good candidates:  
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) – uses common letters, E not in position 5.  
- FIERY (F, I, E, R, Y) – but Y is less common.  
- MERGE (M, E, R, G, E) – repeats E, not ideal.

From the two pieces of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S, L, A, T are NOT in the word; E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
2. CHORE → C and H are in the word but NOT in their current positions (2 and 3); O and R are NOT in the word at all; E is again confirmed to be in the word and still not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, L, A, T, O, R  
- Letters that must appear: C, H, E  
- E cannot be in position 5.  
- C is present but not in position 1.  
- H is present but not in position 2.  

We now want a 5-letter word that:
- Contains C, H, E  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, O, R  
- Places E somewhere in positions 1-4  
- Places C somewhere in positions 2-5  
- Places H somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints yields “NICHE”:
- Letters: N, I, C, H, E  
- Contains C, H, E  
- Avoids S, L, A, T, O, R  
- E is in position 5 → not allowed (from feedback E is ✓ but not in position 5) – so NICHE is invalid.

Next candidate: “DENCH” – but D and N haven’t been ruled out yet, and H would be in position 5, which is allowed for H. However, “DENCH” is not a common English word.

Better candidate: “PERCH” – but R is forbidden.

Another: “CACHE” – C appears twice, and A is forbidden.

Another: “PENCE” – P, N, E, N, C, E – but N appears twice and E twice, and P hasn’t been ruled out, but positions: C is in position 4 (allowed), H is missing entirely.

Wait, we need both C and H.

Next try: “CHEEK” – but K hasn’t been ruled out, and E appears twice with one in position 5 → invalid.

Another: “CHECK” – K not ruled out, but again C in position 1 (forbidden), and E in position 4 (allowed).

Another: “CHIVE” – I and V not ruled out, but V is less common. CHIVE:
- Letters: C, H, I, V, E  
- Contains C, H, E

Another: “ECHID” – but D not ruled out, and “ECHID” is not a word.

Another: “HECKE” – not a word.

Another: “NICHE” was invalid due to E in 5. Try to shift letters.

Next candidate: “DENCH” – but D and N haven’t been ruled out yet, and H would be in position 5, which is allowed for H. However, “DENCH” is not a common English word.

Better candidate: “PERCH” – but R is forbidden.

Another: “BEACH” – A is forbidden.

Another: “CACHE” – C appears twice, and A is forbidden.

Another: “PENCE” – P, N, E, N, C, E – but N appears twice and E twice, and P hasn’t been ruled out, but positions: C is in position 4 (allowed), H is missing entirely.

Wait, we need both C and H.

Next try: “CHEEK” – but K hasn’t been ruled out, and E appears twice with one in position 5 → invalid.

Another: “CHECK” – K not ruled out, but again C in position 1 (forbidden), and E in position 4 (allowed).

Another: “CHIVE” – I and V not ruled out, but V is less common. CHIVE:
- Letters: C, H, I, V, E  
- Contains C, H, E  
- Avoids S, L, A, T, O, R  
- C is in position 1 (from feedback C is -, so not in position 1) → invalid.

Another: “ECHID” – but D not ruled out, and “ECHID” is not a word.

Another: “HECKE” – not a word.

Another: “NICHE” was invalid due to E in 5. Try to shift letters.

Next: “PEACH” – A forbidden.

Next: “FRECH” – not a word.

Next: “WENCH” – W not ruled out:
- Letters: W, E, N, C, H  
- Contains C, H, E  
- Avoids forbidden letters  
- E is in position 2 (allowed)  
- C is in position 4 (allowed)  
- H is in position 5 (allowed)  

“WENCH” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Thus, our next guess is WENCH.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from all three guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear):  
S, L, A, T, O, R, W  

Confirmed letters (all must appear):  
E, N, C, H  

Position knowledge so far:
1. E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 1 & 2).
2. N is in the word and currently sits in position 3 (from Guess 3).
3. C is in the word and currently sits in position 4 (from Guess 3).
4. H is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3).

That leaves only one possible un-used position for H: position 1.  
That also forces the E into position 2 (positions 3 and 4 are taken, and 5 is forbidden).

So the fixed skeleton is:
1 2 3 4 5  
H E N C _  

The only remaining letter must be a fifth letter that:
- is NOT one of S, L, A, T, O, R, W, and  
- is not already used (E, N, C, H are already in the word).

Scanning the alphabet for common English letters left:  
B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

The most plausible 5-letter word fitting H E N C _ is:

HENCH  – but that uses H twice (invalid).  
Hence the only viable everyday word is:

Hence → that’s six letters.  
So we must find a 5-letter word.  
The only dictionary 5-letter word fitting H E N C _ is “HENCE”.

Check:  
H(✓) E(✓) N(✓) C(✓) E – the final E would be a repeat of the E already placed, which is allowed in Wordle-style games as long as the hidden word has two E’s.  
But we have no evidence the secret word has two E’s.  
We need a different fifth letter.

Common letters still available: D, G, K, B, M, etc.  
The only common English 5-letter word that is H E N C _ is “HENCE”, but let’s test: H E N C D → “HENCD” not a word.  
Next possibility: H E N C K → “HENCK” not a word.  
H E N C G → “HENCG” not a word.  
H E N C I → “HENC I” not a word.  
H E N C M → “HENCM” not a word.

Wait, we have N in position 3, C in position 4, H in position 1, E in position 2, so the only position left for the fifth letter is position 5.  
The fifth letter must be one we have not ruled out and must not clash with any constraints.

Among remaining letters, the most likely everyday 5-letter word is “HENCE”.  
Even though it repeats E, it’s the only common word.  
Therefore, “HENCE” is our best and essentially only choice.
