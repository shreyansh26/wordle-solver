For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

1. ""SLATE"" - contains S, L, A, T, E
2. ""CRANE"" - contains C, R, A, N, E  
3. ""ADIEU"" - contains A, D, I, E, U
4. ""RAISE"" - contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, I'm going to choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are **not** in the word at all (marked x).
- E is in the word and is in the **correct** position (5th letter).

So the pattern so far is ` _ _ _ _ E ` with the letters C, R, A, N ruled out.

Next step: choose a new word that preserves the known E in position 5 and tests a fresh set of common consonants and vowels. Good letters to test now include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc. I’ll pick a word that uses several of these and ends in E.

“SLIDE” looks like a good candidate: it has S, L, I, D plus the confirmed E. None of S, L, I, D were ruled out, and none of C, R, A, N appear, so it’s safe.

So far we know:
- The word ends in E (position 5).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- C, R, A, N, S, I, D are not present at all.

We still need to test the remaining common letters: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc., while keeping the final E fixed and avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Include L but place it somewhere other than position 2.
3. Test several new consonants.

“PLUME” is a good choice:
- P, U, M are all fresh letters.
- L is placed at position 2 (but feedback shows L is not in position 2, so we might still learn something).
- Ends with the confirmed E.

But “PLUME” keeps L in position 2, which we already know is wrong. Let’s shift L to position 1 instead: “LUMPE” isn’t a valid word. Another valid option is “BUGLE” – but G is less common. 

“MOUSE” is valid, ends in E, places L nowhere, but we need to include L. So “MULCH” isn’t valid (ends in H). 

A better choice is “BLOKE”:
- B, O, K are new letters.
- L is now in position 2 (but we know L isn’t in position 2 from SLIDE feedback). Oops, same issue.

Let’s try “GLOBE” – but G is less common and O is in position 2, but we want to test new letters. Actually, we need L not in position 2. “ELBOW” is invalid (ends in W). 

A valid option is “TULLE” – but ends in LE, and position 5 must be E, so that’s invalid. 

“OLIVE” – but ends in E, O in pos1, L in pos2. L is in pos2 (wrong). 

“UNCLE” – but C is ruled out.

“WHELP” – not 5 letters ending in E.

“FLUME” – F is new, L not in pos2 (it’s pos2 again), but we know L is wrong in pos2. So no.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E that include L, with L not in pos2, and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, I, D). The remaining alphabet letters are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate words:
- “BLOKE” – invalid, L in pos2.
- “FOLLE” – not a word.

- “LUMEN” – ends in N, ruled out.
- “MULED” – D ruled out.
- “POULE” – P, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Between “HOYLE”, “JOULE”, and “POULE”, “JOULE” is well-known and tests J, O, U, L, E. 

But “JOULE” is perhaps less common. “POULE” is also a word (French for hen, but valid in some word lists). 

A better, more common word is “HUMBLE” – but that’s 6 letters. 

Another valid option: “BUGLE” – B, U, G, L, E. L is pos4, which is fine. G is acceptable.

But “BUGLE” has G, which is less common. 

“MOTLE” – not a word. 

“VOULE” – not a word. 

“TUPLE” – T, U, P, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Let’s go with “TUPLE”:
- T, U, P are new letters.
- L is in pos4 (not pos2, so consistent with feedback).

- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- C, R, A, N, S, I, D are not present at all.

We still need to test the remaining common letters: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc., while keeping the final E fixed and avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Include L but place it somewhere other than position 2.
3. Test several new consonants.

“PLUME” is a good choice:
- P, U, M are all fresh letters.
- L is placed at position 2 (but feedback shows L is not in position 2, so we might still learn something).
- Ends with the confirmed E.

But “PLUME” keeps L in position 2, which we already know is wrong. Let’s shift L to position 1 instead: “LUMPE” isn’t a valid word. Another valid option is “BUGLE” – but G is less common. 

“MOUSE” is valid, ends in E, places L nowhere, but we need to include L. So “MULCH” isn’t valid (ends in H). 

A better choice is “BLOKE”:
- B, O, K are new letters.
- L is now in position 2 (but we know L isn’t in position 2 from SLIDE feedback). Oops, same issue.

Let’s try “GLOBE” – but G is less common and O is in position 2, but we want to test new letters. Actually, we need L not in position 2. “ELBOW” is invalid (ends in W). 

A valid option is “TULLE” – but ends in LE, and position 5 must be E, so that’s invalid. 

“OLIVE” – but ends in E, O in pos1, L in pos2. L is in pos2 (wrong). 

“UNCLE” – but C is ruled out.

“WHELP” – not 5 letters ending in E.

“FLUME” – F is new, L not in pos2 (it’s pos2 again), but we know L is wrong in pos2. So no.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E that include L, with L not in pos2, and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, I, D). The remaining alphabet letters are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate words:
- “BLOKE” – invalid, L in pos2.
- “FOLLE” – not a word.
- “GLOBE” – L in pos2.
- “HOYLE” – H, O, Y, L, E. L is in pos4, which is acceptable (not pos2). This is valid.
- “JOULE” – J, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.
- “KUGEL” – ends in L.
- “LOUIE” – starts with L, but L is pos1 (acceptable), but I is ruled out.
- “LUMEN” – ends in N, ruled out.
- “MULED” – D ruled out.
- “POULE” – P, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Between “HOYLE”, “JOULE”, and “POULE”, “JOULE” is well-known and tests J, O, U, L, E. 

But “JOULE” is perhaps less common. “POULE” is also a word (French for hen, but valid in some word lists). 

A better, more common word is “HUMBLE” – but that’s 6 letters. 

Another valid option: “BUGLE” – B, U, G, L, E. L is pos4, which is fine. G is acceptable.

But “BUGLE” has G, which is less common. 

“MOTLE” – not a word. 

“VOULE” – not a word. 

“TUPLE” – T, U, P, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Let’s go with “TUPLE”:
- T, U, P are new letters.
- L is in pos4 (not pos2, so consistent with feedback).
- Ends with confirmed E.
- No forbidden letters.

From all the feedback so far we have:

2. Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, I, D, T, P

   - L is in the word (already placed).
   - U is somewhere in the word but **not** in position 2.

- contains U somewhere in positions 1-3,  
- never uses any of the forbidden letters listed above.

Candidate letters still allowed: B F G H J K M O Q V W X Y Z

Let’s list possible patterns that satisfy:
- Position 5: E  
- Position 4: L  
- Position 2 or 3 must be U (since U cannot be in position 2 from SLIDE feedback, it must sit in position 1 or 3).

Possible word shapes:
  U _ _ L E   or   _ _ U L E   or   _ U _ L E (but not _ U _ L E because U would be in position 2 which is ruled out).

- Ends in LE (positions 4 & 5 correct).  
- Contains U in position 3 (allowed).  
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:

1. ""SLATE"" - contains S, L, A, T, E
2. ""CRANE"" - contains C, R, A, N, E  
3. ""ADIEU"" - contains A, D, I, E, U
4. ""RAISE"" - contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, I'm going to choose ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word.

So the pattern so far is ` _ _ _ _ E ` with the letters C, R, A, N ruled out.

Next step: choose a new word that preserves the known E in position 5 and tests a fresh set of common consonants and vowels. Good letters to test now include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc. I’ll pick a word that uses several of these and ends in E.

“SLIDE” looks like a good candidate: it has S, L, I, D plus the confirmed E. None of S, L, I, D were ruled out, and none of C, R, A, N appear, so it’s safe.

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- C, R, A, N, S, I, D are not present at all.

We still need to test the remaining common letters: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc., while keeping the final E fixed and avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Include L but place it somewhere other than position 2.
3. Test several new consonants.

“PLUME” is a good choice:
- P, U, M are all fresh letters.
- L is placed at position 2 (but feedback shows L is not in position 2, so we might still learn something).
- Ends with the confirmed E.

But “PLUME” keeps L in position 2, which we already know is wrong. Let’s shift L to position 1 instead: “LUMPE” isn’t a valid word. Another valid option is “BUGLE” – but G is less common. 

“MOUSE” is valid, ends in E, places L nowhere, but we need to include L. So “MULCH” isn’t valid (ends in H). 

A better choice is “BLOKE”:
- B, O, K are new letters.
- L is now in position 2 (but we know L isn’t in position 2 from SLIDE feedback). Oops, same issue.

Let’s try “GLOBE” – but G is less common and O is in position 2, but we want to test new letters. Actually, we need L not in position 2. “ELBOW” is invalid (ends in W). 

A valid option is “TULLE” – but ends in LE, and position 5 must be E, so that’s invalid. 

“OLIVE” – but ends in E, O in pos1, L in pos2. L is in pos2 (wrong). 

“UNCLE” – but C is ruled out.

“WHELP” – not 5 letters ending in E.

“FLUME” – F is new, L not in pos2 (it’s pos2 again), but we know L is wrong in pos2. So no.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E that include L, with L not in pos2, and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, I, D). The remaining alphabet letters are: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate words:
- “BLOKE” – invalid, L in pos2.
- “FOLLE” – not a word.
- “GLOBE” – L in pos2.
- “HOYLE” – H, O, Y, L, E. L is in pos4, which is acceptable (not pos2). This is valid.
- “JOULE” – J, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.
- “KUGEL” – ends in L.
- “LOUIE” – starts with L, but L is pos1 (acceptable), but I is ruled out.
- “LUMEN” – ends in N, ruled out.
- “MULED” – D ruled out.
- “POULE” – P, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Between “HOYLE”, “JOULE”, and “POULE”, “JOULE” is well-known and tests J, O, U, L, E. 

But “JOULE” is perhaps less common. “POULE” is also a word (French for hen, but valid in some word lists). 

A better, more common word is “HUMBLE” – but that’s 6 letters. 

Another valid option: “BUGLE” – B, U, G, L, E. L is pos4, which is fine. G is acceptable.

But “BUGLE” has G, which is less common. 

“MOTLE” – not a word. 

“VOULE” – not a word. 

“TUPLE” – T, U, P, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.

Let’s go with “TUPLE”:
- T, U, P are new letters.

3. Additional clues:

   - U is somewhere in the word but **not** in position 2.

- contains U somewhere in positions 1-3,  
- never uses any of the forbidden letters listed above.

Candidate letters still allowed: B F G H J K M O Q V W X Y Z  
plus the confirmed U and L, E.

Let’s list possible patterns that satisfy:
- Position 5: E  
- Position 4: L  
- Position 2 or 3 must be U (since U cannot be in position 2 from SLIDE feedback, it must sit in position 1 or 3).

Possible word shapes:
  U _ _ L E   or   _ _ U L E   or   _ U _ L E (but not _ U _ L E because U would be in position 2 which is ruled out).

So only:
  U _ _ L E   or   _ _ U L E

Check real 5-letter words that fit:

- U _ _ L E:  
  – UMBLE (not a common word)  
  – UGGLE (non-word)  
  – UVULE (non-word)

- _ _ U L E:  
  – HUMLE (non-word)  
  – MUGLE (non-word)  
  – BUGLE (B, U, G, L, E) – G is allowed, word is valid.  
  – FUGLE (non-word)  
  – VUGLE (non-word)  
  – JUGLE (non-word)

The only valid English word fitting all constraints is **BUGLE**.

- Uses only allowed letters (B, U, G, L, E).  
- Places U in position 2 (but we already know from SLIDE feedback that U is **not** in position 2).  
Wait! BUGLE has U in position 2, but SLIDE feedback said U is in the word but **wrong position** in SLIDE (i.e., it cannot be in position 2).  
So BUGLE’s U is in the same disallowed spot. Therefore BUGLE is invalid.

Next candidate:  
Look for _ _ U L E:

- MOULE – M, O, U, L, E – M and O are allowed, word is valid.  
- FOULE – F, O, U, L, E – F, O allowed, word valid.  
- HUMLE – non-word  
- WOULE – non-word  

Between MOULE and FOULE, MOULE is more common (a small cake, but accepted in many word lists).

Therefore MOULE satisfies all constraints:

- Contains U in position 3 (allowed).

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include:\n\n1. ""SLATE"" - contains S, L, A, T, E\n2. ""CRANE"" - contains C, R, A, N, E  \n3. ""ADIEU"" - contains A, D, I, E, U\n4. ""RAISE"" - contains R, A, I, S, E\n\nAmong these, I\'m going to choose ""CRANE"" because it has:\n- C (very common consonant)\n- R (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- N (common consonant)\n- E (most common ending letter)\n\nThis combination should help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n- C, R, A, N are **not** in the word at all (marked x).\n- E is in the word and is in the **correct** position (5th letter).\n\nSo the pattern so far is ` _ _ _ _ E ` with the letters C, R, A, N ruled out.\n\nNext step: choose a new word that preserves the known E in position 5 and tests a fresh set of common consonants and vowels. Good letters to test now include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc. I’ll pick a word that uses several of these and ends in E.\n\n“SLIDE” looks like a good candidate: it has S, L, I, D plus the confirmed E. None of S, L, I, D were ruled out, and none of C, R, A, N appear, so it’s safe.\n\n<guess>SLIDE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SLIDE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n- The word ends in E (position 5).\n- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.\n- C, R, A, N, S, I, D are not present at all.\n\nWe still need to test the remaining common letters: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc., while keeping the final E fixed and avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\nA good next word should:\n1. Keep E in position 5.\n2. Include L but place it somewhere other than position 2.\n3. Test several new consonants.\n\n“PLUME” is a good choice:\n- P, U, M are all fresh letters.\n- L is placed at position 2 (but feedback shows L is not in position 2, so we might still learn something).\n- Ends with the confirmed E.\n\nBut “PLUME” keeps L in position 2, which we already know is wrong. Let’s shift L to position 1 instead: “LUMPE” isn’t a valid word. Another valid option is “BUGLE” – but G is less common. \n\n“MOUSE” is valid, ends in E, places L nowhere, but we need to include L. So “MULCH” isn’t valid (ends in H). \n\nA better choice is “BLOKE”:\n- B, O, K are new letters.\n- L is now in position 2 (but we know L isn’t in position 2 from SLIDE feedback). Oops, same issue.\n\nLet’s try “GLOBE” – but G is less common and O is in position 2, but we want to test new letters. Actually, we need L not in position 2. “ELBOW” is invalid (ends in W). \n\nA valid option is “TULLE” – but ends in LE, and position 5 must be E, so that’s invalid. \n\n“OLIVE” – but ends in E, O in pos1, L in pos2. L is in pos2 (wrong). \n\n“UNCLE” – but C is ruled out.\n\n“WHELP” – not 5 letters ending in E.\n\n“FLUME” – F is new, L not in pos2 (it’s pos2 again), but we know L is wrong in pos2. So no.\n\nLet’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E that include L, with L not in pos2, and avoiding forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, I, D).

Valid.\n- “KUGEL” – ends in L.\n- “LOUIE” – starts with L, but L is pos1 (acceptable), but I is ruled out.\n- “LUMEN” – ends in N, ruled out.\n- “MULED” – D ruled out.\n- “POULE” – P, O, U, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.\n\nBetween “HOYLE”, “JOULE”, and “POULE”, “JOULE” is well-known and tests J, O, U, L, E. \n\nBut “JOULE” is perhaps less common. “POULE” is also a word (French for hen, but valid in some word lists). \n\nA better, more common word is “HUMBLE” – but that’s 6 letters. \n\nAnother valid option: “BUGLE” – B, U, G, L, E. L is pos4, which is fine. G is acceptable.\n\nBut “BUGLE” has G, which is less common. \n\n“MOTLE” – not a word. \n\n“VOULE” – not a word. \n\n“TUPLE” – T, U, P, L, E. L is pos4. Valid.\n\nLet’s go with “TUPLE”:\n- T, U, P are new letters.\n- L is in pos4 (not pos2, so consistent with feedback).\n- Ends with confirmed E.\n- No forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>TUPLE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SLIDE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: TUPLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) U(-) P(x) L(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From all the feedback so far we have:\n\n1.

Remaining single-letter possibilities for position 1 (from the still-allowed set B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z) that make a valid 5-letter English word ending in “OULE”:

- B  →  BOULE  (valid word)
