2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters in 5-letter words. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should provide good feedback on several key letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. First letter is S.
2. Letters not in the word: L, A.
3. Letters in the word (positions unknown): T, E.
4. Letters still unknown: positions 2, 3, and possibly 4, 5 (but T and E are in the word, just not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).

I want a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Does not contain L or A.
- Contains T and E in new positions (T not in 4th, E not in 5th).
- Uses common letters for the remaining positions.

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Starts with S.
- Contains T (now in 2nd position, which is allowed since original T was in 4th).
- Contains E (now in 3rd position, which is allowed since original E was in 5th).
- Uses common letters I and N for remaining spots.
- Does not contain L or A.
