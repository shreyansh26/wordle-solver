3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The strategy for the first guess should aim to maximize information gain by covering common letters and common patterns. Many players start with words like ""ADIEU"" to test many vowels, or ""SLATE"" / ""CRANE"" to test common consonants and vowels. 

""SLATE"" is a popular opening guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we learned:

- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word and is in the 3rd position (✓).

So the word looks like: _ _ A _ _

We still need to test common consonants and vowels. The remaining most-frequent letters are R, N, I, O, C, D, U, P, etc., since we’ve ruled out S, L, T, E.

A good next guess would:
1. Keep A in the 3rd slot.
2. Introduce several new, high-frequency letters.
3. Avoid any letters we now know are absent.

Candidate words that fit: RADIO, RAPID, CABIN, RABID, MANIC, etc.

- Keeps A in the 3rd position.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are OUT.

2. RADIO → R(-) A(-) D(x) I(✓) O(x)
   - A is NOT in position 2 (it should be a dash, but the feedback letter is A(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2).  
   - The dash for A indicates that A exists somewhere else in the word, but we already know from SLATE that A is in position 3. So this feedback is redundant; it just confirms A is in the word (position 3) and not in position 2.  
   - I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - R is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
   - D and O are NOT in the word.

So now we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A I _
- Letters still to place: R (must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5; but 3 is A and 4 is I, so R must be in position 2 or 5).
- Other letters to test: common ones that haven’t been ruled out yet (N, C, B, G, F, H, etc.).

Possible words fitting the pattern _ _ A I _:
- BRAIN: but B, N are new; R is in position 1 or 5. R could be in position 5: _ B A I R? No, that would be B in position 1, but R needs to be in position 2 or 5. So _ R A I _ or _ _ A I R.
- TRAIN: T is out.
- GRAIN: G is new, R could be in position 5.
- CHAIR: C, H are new, R in position 5.

Let’s test CHAIR:
- C, H are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (matches).
- I is in position 4 (matches).
- R is in position 5 (which is allowed since R just needs to be in the word and not in position 1).

This covers new letters and fits the constraints.
