For the first guess, we want a word that can help us quickly identify common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some common starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has:
1. S (very common starting letter)
2. L (common consonant)
3. A (common vowel)
4. T (common consonant)
5. E (the most common ending letter in English words)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback:

- S (first letter) – x → NOT present in the word  
- L (second letter) – x → NOT present in the word  
- A (third letter) – ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (third slot)  
- T (fourth letter) – - → T is in the word but NOT in the fourth position  
- E (fifth letter) – x → NOT present in the word  

So we know:
1. The word has an A in position 3.  
2. It contains T somewhere other than position 4.  
3. It does NOT contain S, L, or E at all.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep A in the third position.  
- Include T, but not in position 4.  
- Avoid S, L, E.  

A structured word satisfying these constraints could be “CRATE”:
- C R A T E  
  – A is in the 3rd slot (kept).  
  – T is now in the 5th slot (allowed, since we only know T is NOT in the 4th).  
  – No S, L, or E.  

Another valid candidate would be “GRAIN”, but it omits T entirely; we’d rather test T now. So “CRATE” is a strong choice.

Current certainties:
- A is locked into the 3rd position (✓ each time).
- C is correct in 1st position (✓).
- T is present but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it appeared twice with “-”, so the only remaining slot for T is the 2nd position).
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, E, R (from CRATE, R was “-” so it’s present but not in 2nd place; however, since C is already correct in 1st, and T is now forced into 2nd, R cannot fit anywhere else without displacing a known correct letter, so R must be absent).

So the pattern so far is:
C  T  A  _  _

We need two more letters, neither S, L, E, R, and we want to test fresh common consonants/vowels to close the remaining blanks.

Good remaining consonants: N, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is used).

A high-frequency letter combination that fits: N and I.
Word: C T A N I  → “CTANI” is invalid (not a real word).
Rearranging to a valid word: C T A N I  → “ACTIN” doesn’t start with C.
Next idea: C T A I N → “CAITN” invalid.
How about “CAINT”, invalid.

Real valid word fitting C T A _ _: “CATTY” – but T already used.
“CANTY” – Y is uncommon, and N is good.
“CANTO” – O vowel fits, real word.

C A N T O – but C is 1st, A 3rd, T must be 2nd.
So correct structure is C T A _ _.

Valid 5-letter words starting with C T A:
- CTAKS – invalid
- CTANE – invalid
- CTARN – invalid
Actually, no common words start C T A.

Hence I must reconsider whether T is forced into 2nd slot. Let me re-evaluate:
- T cannot be 4th or 5th (from SLATE and CRATE feedback).  
- T cannot be 2nd (from CRATE feedback: R was “-”, but T itself in CRATE was 4th with “-”).  
Wait, in CRATE the T was in 4th position and marked “-”, so T not in 4th.  
In SLATE the T was in 4th position and marked “-”, confirming T not in 4th.  
Are there any restrictions on T's position beyond that? No, the 2nd and 5th positions remain untested for T.

Thus T could be 2nd or 5th (but 5th was E in CRATE, ruled out, and E is invalid anyway).  
So T could be 2nd or 3rd, but 3rd is A, so T must be 2nd.

So the pattern is indeed C T A _ _.

Looking for valid English words matching C T A _ _:  
“CTANE” – invalid  
“CTASM” – invalid  
Actually, no standard 5-letter word starts with CTA. This suggests an inconsistency.

Re-examining feedback:
- CRATE: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) T(-) E(x)  
  – C(1st)=good  
  – A(3rd)=good  
  – T is somewhere else (not 4th)  
  – R is present but not in 2nd (so R must be in 3rd,4th,5th; but 3rd=A, so R could be 4th or 5th).  
  – E absent.

Thus the pattern is:
C _ A _ _  
With T present not in 4th, and R present not in 2nd.  
Thus possible placements:  
- T could be 2nd or 5th  
- R could be 4th or 5th  
- No S,L,E  

Testing word: C A R T O – but C must be 1st, A 3rd.  
Word must be C _ A _ _ with T and R somewhere.

Possible valid word: C R A T E – but E is out.  
C R A T N – invalid  
C A R T N – invalid  
How about C H A R T – but H not tested.  
C R A N T – invalid.

Another approach: place T in 5th, R in 4th: C _ A R T  
Valid word: C A R T – too short.  
C R A T – too short.

Actually, the correct structure is:
C _ A _ _ with T somewhere (2nd or 5th) and R somewhere (2nd,4th,5th) but not overlapping with T.

Let’s try C I A R T – invalid  
C O A R T – invalid  
Real valid word: C R A T E – E out.  
C R A N T – invalid.

Next idea: C O A T S – S is out.  
C L A R T – L out.  
C A R T Y – Y uncommon.

Realizing no common word fits C _ A _ _ with both T and R, likely R is absent (despite CRATE marking R as “-” meaning R is in wrong position; but since C and A are fixed, R has nowhere else to go, so R must actually be absent). This implies an inconsistency in prior assumption.

Re-reading: in CRATE, R was marked “-” (present but wrong position). With C fixed in 1st and A in 3rd, R cannot fit in remaining positions (2,4,5) without repeating or displacing known letters. This suggests R is actually absent, and the feedback was misinterpreted. Possibly “-” was used for present but wrong position, but with no valid placement remaining, R must be absent. Thus, likely an error in prior step.

Correct interpretation: in CRATE, R was “-” (present but wrong position), so R must be in the word somewhere, but positions 1,3 are taken, so R must be in 2nd,4th, or 5th, but not 2nd (as it was 2nd in CRATE with “-”). So R must be 4th or 5th.

Thus possible patterns:
C _ A R _  or  C _ A _ R

And T must be present, not 4th, so T in 2nd or 5th.

Combining:
If R is 4th: C _ A R _ → T must be 2nd or 5th
- C T A R _ – invalid word  
- C _ A R T – valid word: C A R T _ – too short  
  Actually, C A R T _ – no.

Real valid word: C R A T E – E out.  
C O A R T – invalid.

Next pattern: R is 5th: C _ A _ R  
Then T must be 2nd: C T A _ R  
Valid word: C T A _ R → “CTARR” invalid.

Real word: C A T C H – but C is 1st, A 3rd: C _ A _ _ → C A T C H doesn’t fit.

Next valid candidate: C H A R T – H untested, R 4th, T 5th.  
C H A R T:  
- C(1st)=✓  
- H(new)  
- A(3rd)=✓  
- R(present, now 4th)  
- T(present, now 5th)  

This is a valid word, tests H, keeps C and A, places R and T in new spots, avoids banned letters.

Based on the feedback, we now know:

- R exists in the word but is **not** in the 2nd position.

So T could be 2nd or 3rd, but 3rd is A, so T must be 2nd.

So the pattern is indeed C T A _ _.

Looking for valid English words matching C T A _ _:  
“CTANE” – invalid  
“CTASM” – invalid  
Actually, no standard 5-letter word starts with CTA. This suggests an inconsistency.

Re-examining feedback:
- CRATE: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) T(-) E(x)  
  – C(1st)=good  
  – A(3rd)=good  
  – T is somewhere else (not 4th)  
  – R is present but not in 2nd (so R must be in 3rd,4th,5th; but 3rd=A, so R could be 4th or 5th).  
  – E absent.

Thus the pattern is:
C _ A _ _  
With T present not in 4th, and R present not in 2nd.  
Thus possible placements:  
- T could be 2nd or 5th  
- R could be 4th or 5th  
- No S,L,E  

Testing word: C A R T O – but C must be 1st, A 3rd.  
Word must be C _ A _ _ with T and R somewhere.

Possible valid word: C R A T E – but E is out.  
C R A T N – invalid  
C A R T N – invalid  
How about C H A R T – but H not tested.  
C R A N T – invalid.

Another approach: place T in 5th, R in 4th: C _ A R T  
Valid word: C A R T – too short.  
C R A T – too short.

Actually, the correct structure is:
C _ A _ _ with T somewhere (2nd or 5th) and R somewhere (2nd,4th,5th) but not overlapping with T.

Let’s try C I A R T – invalid  
C O A R T – invalid  
Real valid word: C R A T E – E out.  
C R A N T – invalid.

Next idea: C O A T S – S is out.  
C L A R T – L out.  
C A R T Y – Y uncommon.

Realizing no common word fits C _ A _ _ with both T and R, likely R is absent (despite CRATE marking R as “-” meaning R is in wrong position; but since C and A are fixed, R has nowhere else to go, so R must actually be absent). This implies an inconsistency in prior assumption.

Re-reading: in CRATE, R was marked “-” (present but wrong position). With C fixed in 1st and A in 3rd, R cannot fit in remaining positions (2,4,5) without repeating or displacing known letters. This suggests R is actually absent, and the feedback was misinterpreted. Possibly “-” was used for present but wrong position, but with no valid placement remaining, R must be absent. Thus, likely an error in prior step.

Correct interpretation: in CRATE, R was “-” (present but wrong position), so R must be in the word somewhere, but positions 1,3 are taken, so R must be in 2nd,4th, or 5th, but not 2nd (as it was 2nd in CRATE with “-”). So R must be 4th or 5th.

Thus possible patterns:
C _ A R _  or  C _ A _ R

And T must be present, not 4th, so T in 2nd or 5th.

Combining:
If R is 4th: C _ A R _ → T must be 2nd or 5th
- C T A R _ – invalid word  
- C _ A R T – valid word: C A R T _ – too short  
  Actually, C A R T _ – no.

Real valid word: C R A T E – E out.  
C O A R T – invalid.

Next pattern: R is 5th: C _ A _ R  
Then T must be 2nd: C T A _ R  
Valid word: C T A _ R → “CTARR” invalid.

Real word: C A T C H – but C is 1st, A 3rd: C _ A _ _ → C A T C H doesn’t fit.

Next valid candidate: C H A R T – H untested, R 4th, T 5th.  
C H A R T:  
- C(1st)=✓  
- H(new)  
- A(3rd)=✓  
- R(present, now 4th)  
- T(present, now 5th)  

This is a valid word, tests H, keeps C and A, places R and T in new spots, avoids banned letters.

<guess>CHART</guess>Based on the feedback, we now know:
- C is correct in the 1st position.  
- A is correct in the 3rd position.  
- T exists in the word but is **not** in the 4th position.  
- R exists in the word but is **not** in the 2nd position.  
- S, L, E are absent.

A good word that fits these rules and tests the remaining positions for T, R, and a new consonant is:",Guess 3: CHART -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
