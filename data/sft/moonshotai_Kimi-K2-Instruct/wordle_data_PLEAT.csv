This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoid repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible.
3. Include vowels and common consonants to test their presence.

Popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""RAISE"". These words cover common letters (vowels like A/E and consonants like R/S/T/L/N). 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _  (L is fixed in position 2).
- Letters present somewhere: A, T, E.
- Letters absent: S.

Next guess should:
1. Keep L in position 2.
2. Try to place A, T, E in new positions (A not 3, T not 4, E not 5).
3. Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CLATE” (but T is not allowed in 4). 
Better: “FLAME” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “PLATE” – but T is not allowed in 4.
Try “BLAME” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “GLADE” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “ALTAR” – but L must be in position 2.

Next, consider “ELATE” – E is in position 1 (new spot), L fixed in 2, A moves to 3 (but A can’t be in 3), so invalid.
Try “LEANT” – but L must be in position 2, so invalid.

Realizing constraints:
- L is fixed in 2.
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- T must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2 is L, so 1,3,5).
- E must be in 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is L, so 1,3,4).

A valid arrangement could be:
- Position 1: T or E or A

- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _  (L is fixed in position 2).
- Letters present somewhere: A, T, E.
- Letters absent: S.

Next guess should:
1. Keep L in position 2.
2. Try to place A, T, E in new positions (A not 3, T not 4, E not 5).
3. Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CLATE” (but T is not allowed in 4). 
Better: “FLAME” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “PLATE” – but T is not allowed in 4.
Try “BLAME” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “GLADE” – but E is not allowed in 5.
Try “ALTAR” – but L must be in position 2.

Next, consider “ELATE” – E is in position 1 (new spot), L fixed in 2, A moves to 3 (but A can’t be in 3), so invalid.
Try “LEANT” – but L must be in position 2, so invalid.

Realizing constraints:
- L is fixed in 2.
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- T must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2 is L, so 1,3,5).
- E must be in 1,2,3,4 (but 2 is L, so 1,3,4).

A valid arrangement could be:
- Position 1: T or E or A
- Position 3: T or E or A
- Position 4: E or A
- Position 5: A or T

Let’s try “ELATE” – but A is in 3 (invalid per feedback).
Try “ALERT”:
- A is in 1 (valid, not 3).
- L is in 2 (correct).
- E is in 3 (valid, not 5).
- R is new.
- T is in 5 (valid, not 4).

This fits all constraints.

Letters to avoid: S, R  

Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 4.  
We know A must appear once (since it was marked “-” twice), so either:
- A is in position 4, or
- A is in position 1 (but feedback says it’s not in 1), so A must be in 4.

Thus tentative pattern: _ L E A T  

We just need a valid consonant for position 1 that hasn’t been ruled out and hasn’t been used yet.  
Available consonants (excluding S, R, L, T): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pick a common one. Good choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoid repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible.
3. Include vowels and common consonants to test their presence.

Popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""RAISE"". These words cover common letters (vowels like A/E and consonants like R/S/T/L/N). 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

We now know the exact pattern: _ L E A T (positions 2–5 are locked).

Letters confirmed not in the word: S, R, B, C.

Only the first letter remains unknown. We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ?LEAT.

Checking a dictionary list:
- CLEAT – ruled out (C was rejected)
- BLEAT – ruled out (B was rejected)
- PLEAT – valid and not yet tried
- FLEAT, GLEAT, DLEAT, etc. – either invalid or uncommon

Thus PLEAT is the only remaining common word that fits.
