For the first guess, I want to pick a word that:
1. Contains common English letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Uses vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities

Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, AUDIO, etc.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it:
- Uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Has no repeating letters
- Contains 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

All five letters in CRANE were marked “x”, so none of C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge swath of common 5-letter words, so I want a new starting guess that uses completely different letters—preferably ones that are still very common in English and give me broad coverage.

Good letters to try now:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, etc.

I’ll avoid any word that contains C, R, A, N, E (including plurals or forms that reuse those letters).  
A popular second-step word that uses none of those five letters is “SLIMY”; it contains S, L, I, M, Y—all high-frequency letters and no repeats.

Another solid choice would be “DOUBT”, but the U and B are slightly less common than the letters in SLIMY, so I’ll go with SLIMY.

Letters completely ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, M, Y

2. Contains the **letter I** (confirmed in word).
3. Uses four **new, common** letters to maximize information.
4. Has no repeated letters.

Candidate words:
- DOUGH → contains O, U, G, H (but no I)
- PIVOT → contains P, V, O, T (but V is lower-frequency)
- BIGHT → contains B, G, H, T (but H-G-T together is niche)
- FIGHT → F, G, H, T with I (F less common)
- TUBID → contains T, U, B, D with I (but rare word)

“BUILT” is ideal: B, U, I, L, T.
- Uses B, U, I, T: all new letters.
- However, L was already ruled out by SLIMY (L is x), so BUILT is invalid.

Next best: “TOUCH” – T, O, U, C, H – but C is already out.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, M, Y, H
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
  – B in position 1 (✓)  
  – I in position 2 (✓)  
  – G in position 3 (✓)  
  – T in position 5 (✓)

The pattern is therefore: B I G _ T

We need a common 5-letter word that matches B I G _ T.

The only English 5-letter word that fits B I G _ T is BIGOT.

Let's check the remaining letters against the “not-in-word” set:  
– O is allowed (hasn’t been ruled out).  
– T is already confirmed.

Hence BIGOT satisfies every constraint.
