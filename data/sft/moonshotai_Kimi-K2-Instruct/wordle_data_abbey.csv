For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. The best starting words typically have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequent consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Looking at letter frequency in English, the top 5-letter words for Wordle are often ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These all contain highly frequent letters.

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 different, highly probable letters in good positions. Even if none are correct, we'll have eliminated 5 very common letters, which is valuable information.

So far we know:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

We need letters that avoid S, L, T and must include both A and E somewhere else.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, D, P, B, G, etc.  
Good vowels left: A, E (already known), I, O, U.

A solid second-guess strategy is to keep the known letters (A, E) and introduce new high-frequency letters.  
Let’s try a word that uses A and E in different positions while bringing in R, N, C, etc.

“CRANE” won’t work because we already know T is out (so N is allowed) but let’s see:
- C (new consonant)
- R (new consonant)
- A (known to exist, now in position 3 again – but we know A is NOT in 3, so skip this placement).
Wait, CRANE has A in 3 which we already ruled out.

Instead, let’s try “REACT”:
- R (new consonant)
- E (known, now in position 2 – allowed since E was only ruled out of 5)
- A (known, now in position 3 – but A was ruled out of 3, so this is bad)
Nope, same issue.

Try “PEACH”:
- P (new consonant)
- E (known, now in position 2 – allowed)
- A (known, now in position 3 – ruled out)
Still bad.

Try “EARLY”:
- E (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- A (known, now in position 2 – allowed)

Consolidating all feedback so far:

Letters that ARE in the word (-), but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
A (not in position 3 or 5)  
E (not in position 2 or 5)

A (must appear at least once, and only positions 1, 2, 4 are open)  
E (must appear at least once, and only positions 1, 3, 4 are open)

Consonants still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: A, E (already constrained), O, U

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and E exactly once each (since we have no evidence of duplicates)  
- places A only at 1, 2, or 4  
- places E only at 1, 3, or 4  
- uses none of the eliminated consonants (S, L, T, M, D)  
- introduces new high-frequency consonants to maximize information gain

Good candidates:  
- “CRANE” – C, R, N are new, but A would be in position 3 (ruled out).  
- “REACT” – R, C, T; but T is out.  
- “PEACH” – P, C, H; but A would be in 3 (out).  
- “REACH” – R, C, H; A in 3 (out).

Looking at letter frequency in English, the top 5-letter words for Wordle are often ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". These all contain highly frequent letters.

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 different, highly probable letters in good positions. Even if none are correct, we'll have eliminated 5 very common letters, which is valuable information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

We need letters that avoid S, L, T and must include both A and E somewhere else.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, D, P, B, G, etc.  
Good vowels left: A, E (already known), I, O, U.

A solid second-guess strategy is to keep the known letters (A, E) and introduce new high-frequency letters.  
Let’s try a word that uses A and E in different positions while bringing in R, N, C, etc.

“CRANE” won’t work because we already know T is out (so N is allowed) but let’s see:
- C (new consonant)
- R (new consonant)
- A (known to exist, now in position 3 again – but we know A is NOT in 3, so skip this placement).
Wait, CRANE has A in 3 which we already ruled out.

Instead, let’s try “REACT”:
- R (new consonant)
- E (known, now in position 2 – allowed since E was only ruled out of 5)
- A (known, now in position 3 – but A was ruled out of 3, so this is bad)
Nope, same issue.

Try “PEACH”:
- P (new consonant)
- E (known, now in position 2 – allowed)
- A (known, now in position 3 – ruled out)
Still bad.

Try “EARLY”:
- E (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- A (known, now in position 2 – allowed)
- R (new consonant)
- L (ruled out)
- Y (new)
L is out, so skip.

Try “MEDIA”:
- M (new consonant)
- E (known, now in position 2 – allowed)
- D (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- A (known, now in position 5 – allowed, since A was only ruled out of 3)
This looks good: avoids S, L, T, includes A in a new spot (5) and E in a new spot (2), and introduces D, M, I.

Let’s go with MEDIA.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: MEDIA -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating all feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, T, M, D, I

Letters that ARE in the word (-), but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
A (not in position 3 or 5)  
E (not in position 2 or 5)

That leaves the set of still-possible letters:  
A (must appear at least once, and only positions 1, 2, 4 are open)  
E (must appear at least once, and only positions 1, 3, 4 are open)

Consonants still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: A, E (already constrained), O, U

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both A and E exactly once each (since we have no evidence of duplicates)  
- places A only at 1, 2, or 4  
- places E only at 1, 3, or 4  
- uses none of the eliminated consonants (S, L, T, M, D)  
- introduces new high-frequency consonants to maximize information gain

Good candidates:  
- “CRANE” – C, R, N are new, but A would be in position 3 (ruled out).  
- “REACT” – R, C, T; but T is out.  
- “PEACH” – P, C, H; but A would be in 3 (out).  
- “REACH” – R, C, H; A in 3 (out).  
- “CABER” – C, B, R; A in 2, E in 4 – positions are allowed, and consonants are all new.  
- “BEACH” – B, C, H; A in 3 (out).  
- “CACHE” – C, H; A in 2, E in 5 (E in 5 is out).  

“CABER” fits perfectly:
- C, B, R are new consonants.  
- A is at position 2 (allowed).  
- E is at position 4 (allowed).  
No eliminated letters appear.

Let’s lock this in as the next guess.

Current constraints:
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, M, D, I, C, R  
- Letters we know ARE in the word and their known positions:
  – B is correct at position 3 (✓)  
  – E is correct at position 4 (✓)  
- Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are unknown:
  – A (not in positions 2, 3, 5)  
  – E also appears, but we’ve already placed it correctly at position 4, so no more E in other positions is required.

Required word pattern so far:  
_ _ B E _

We still need two more letters (positions 1 and 2) from the remaining allowed consonants:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
and vowels: A, O, U (since E is already placed).

A must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5.  
Position 1 or position 2 are open for A.  
But position 2 is the second letter, and we have _ _ B E _.  
So A must be at position 1 or 2.  
But position 2 is not allowed for A (from CABER feedback: A is not in position 2).  
Thus, A must be at position 1.

So the pattern is:  
A _ B E _

Now we just need a valid consonant for position 2 from the allowed set:  
Allowed consonants: F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Common consonants: F, G, H, N, P  

Let’s try “H” for position 2: A H B E _  
But “AHBEX” isn’t a valid word.  
Next, N: A N B E _ → “ANBEL” – invalid.  
G: A G B E _ → “AGBEX” – invalid.  
F: A F B E _ → “AFBEX” – invalid.  
K: A K B E _ → “AKBEL” – invalid.  
P: A P B E _ → “APBEL” – invalid.  
Hmm, none of these produce valid words.  

Let me reconsider: perhaps A is not at position 1.  
Wait, from CABER feedback: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
From MEDIA feedback: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
From SLATE feedback: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
So A must be at position 1 or 4.  
But position 4 is already taken by E, so A must be at position 1.  

Thus, the pattern must be A _ B E _, and the missing letter (position 2) must be a consonant from the allowed list.  
The only common English words that fit A _ B E _ are:  
“AMBER” – but M is eliminated  
“ANGER” – but R is eliminated  
“ASKEW” – but S is eliminated  
“ABBEY” – B is already at position 3, so duplicate B is possible, but let’s check letters:  
ABBEY: A (allowed), B (allowed), B (duplicate), E (allowed), Y (allowed).  
Letters used: A, B, B, E, Y.
