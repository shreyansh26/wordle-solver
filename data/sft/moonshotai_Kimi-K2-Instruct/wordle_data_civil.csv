For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gained
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to test more unique letters)

After considering options like ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", and ""AUDIO"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- It tests the very common 'S' and 'E' which appear in many 5-letter words
- These letters appear in high frequency in English
- No letter is repeated

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means:

- We must avoid A, R, O, S, E in the next guess.  
- The secret word can only use the remaining 21 letters.  

To gather fresh information, we need a word that:
1. Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.  
2. Contains common consonants and at least one vowel from the remaining set.  
3. Has no repeating letters.

The remaining vowels are I, U, Y.  
The next-most-common consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good blend is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L  
- Includes two vowels (U, I) and three popular consonants (N, T, L).  
- No repeats and none of the ruled-out letters.

Current deductions:

1. Letters known NOT in the word (x): A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, H  
2. Positions known so far:  
   - Position 3: I → from UNTIL (✓) but CHILL gives I(-) → contradiction?  
   Wait: “I(✓)” in UNTIL says I is in position 3 and correct.  
   In CHILL the pattern is C(✓) H(x) I(-) L(-) L(✓).  
   The symbols apply to each letter of the guess:  
   - C(✓) → C is in the word and in the correct spot (position 1).  
   - H(x) → H is not in the word.  
   - I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 3 this time.  
   - L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4 this time.  
   - L(✓) → L is in the word and in the correct spot (position 5).

So the updated constraints are:
- C is fixed in position 1.  
- L is fixed in position 5.  
- I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- Letters to exclude: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, H.  
- Word pattern so far: C _ _ _ L  
- The middle three letters must come from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowel I.

We need to place I in positions 2 or 4, and fill the remaining slot(s) with other allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- C I _ _ L – needs two more letters.  
- C _ I _ L – needs two more letters.  
- C _ _ I L – needs two more letters.

A quick scan of common English words matching C _ _ _ L:
- CIVIL → letters C, I, V, I, L – repeats I, but I is allowed.  
  Check constraints: C(1)✓, L(5)✓, I appears in 2 and 4.  
  Letters used: C, I, V, L – all allowed.  
  No excluded letters.  
  I is in position 2 and 4; both are allowed since I just can’t be in 3.

Let’s go with CIVIL.
