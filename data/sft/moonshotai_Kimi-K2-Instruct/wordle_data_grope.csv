Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information to narrow down future guesses. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words, while avoiding letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z). 

Some effective starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - good for vowels)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - optimized for letter frequency)

I'll go with CRANE as it's a very common choice among Wordle players and covers excellent letter combinations.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word at all.

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

- The pattern is _ R _ _ E  
- Letters already confirmed: R in position 2, E in position 5  
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N  

To maximize information on the second guess, I want to introduce several new common letters while keeping R and E in their known positions. Good consonants to try are S, T, L, D, M, P, etc. A good set of letters that avoids the eliminated ones is S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, G, H.

A word that uses as many new common letters as possible while fitting the _ R _ _ E pattern is STARE (but A is eliminated), so TRIBE (but A is eliminated), or GRIPE (but A is eliminated). 

After checking, the word BROKE fits perfectly:
- B, O, K are new letters to test.
- R is correctly placed in position 2.
- E is correctly placed in position 5.
- Uses no previously eliminated letters (C, A, N).

We need a letter for position 1 and a letter for position 4. We want to test as many new common letters as possible in one guess.

Good candidate pattern: ? R O ? E

Possible combinations:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - good for vowels)

So far we know:  
- The pattern is _ R _ _ E  
- Letters already confirmed: R in position 2, E in position 5  
- Letters eliminated: C, A, N  

To maximize information on the second guess, I want to introduce several new common letters while keeping R and E in their known positions. Good consonants to try are S, T, L, D, M, P, etc. A good set of letters that avoids the eliminated ones is S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, G, H.

A word that uses as many new common letters as possible while fitting the _ R _ _ E pattern is STARE (but A is eliminated), so TRIBE (but A is eliminated), or GRIPE (but A is eliminated). 

After checking, the word BROKE fits perfectly:
- B, O, K are new letters to test.
- R is correctly placed in position 2.
- E is correctly placed in position 5.
- Uses no previously eliminated letters (C, A, N).
