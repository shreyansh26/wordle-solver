Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful information. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, and ideally include some vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- ROAST
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

Among these, CRANE is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word, either in correct or incorrect positions.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the second position.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A (but not in position 2).
- The letters C, R, N, E are ruled out.

1. Includes the letter A somewhere except position 2.
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested, such as L, S, T, O, I, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is SLATY. It has:
- S, L, T, Y that haven’t been tested yet.
- A appears in position 3 (so it satisfies the “A not in position 2” rule).
- No C, R, N, E.

Another candidate could be FLOAT, but it uses F and O, and A is in position 3.

Another possibility is PLAID, but it uses D and I, and A is in position 2 (which is disallowed because A(-) in CRANE came from position 2, so A must be somewhere else).

SLATY seems like a solid choice based on these constraints.

Let's summarize the constraints after the three guesses.

1. Letters **in** the secret word (with their positions in ADULT):
   - U at position 2 (✓)
   - L at position 4 (✓)
   - T at position 5 (✓)

2. Letters **ruled out** (never appear):
   - C, R, N, E, S, Y, D

3. Letters whose **position is restricted**:
   - A is in the word, but not at positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and SLATY), and ADULT shows A at position 1 is wrong (-), so A must be at position 4.
   - L is in the word and not at position 2 (from SLATY), and in ADULT it's at 4 (✓), so L must be at position 4.
   - T is in the word and not at position 4 (from SLATY), and in ADULT it's at 5 (✓), so T must be at position 5.

4. So far we have:
   - Position 1: ?
   - Position 2: U
   - Position 3: ?
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 5: T

5. Letters remaining to guess: positions 1 and 3 must come from the unused set {A, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}, excluding the ruled-out letters.

6. Since A must be in the word (from CRANE), and we've placed L and T, A must be in position 4. But position 4 is already L. This is a contradiction, meaning our earlier assumption must be adjusted.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From ADULT:
- A(-) at position 1 → A is in the word but not at position 1.
- From CRANE: A(-) at position 2 → A is in the word but not at position 2.
- From SLATY: A(-) at position 3 → A is in the word but not at position 3.

Thus A must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 has L (✓) and position 5 has T (✓), so A cannot be placed. This means our interpretation must be wrong.

Ah! The ADULT feedback shows:
- A(-) at position 1: A is in the word, but not at position 1.
- D(x) at position 2: D is not in the word.
- U(✓) at position 2: U is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
- L(✓) at position 3: L is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) at position 4: T is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).

Wait, the positions in ADULT are:
A (1), D (2), U (3), L (4), T (5).

So the feedback is:
- A(-) at 1: A is in word, not at 1.
- D(x) at 2: D not in word.
- U(✓) at 3: U is correct at 3.
- L(✓) at 4: L is correct at 4.
- T(✓) at 5: T is correct at 5.

Now the constraints are:
- Fixed letters: _ U L T
- A is in the word but not at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by U,L,T and A is not at 1. This seems impossible.

Wait, the word is 5 letters, and we have:
Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: U (✓)
4: L (✓)
5: T (✓)

From CRANE:
- A(-) at 2: A is in word, not at 2.

From SLATY:
- A(-) at 3: A is in word, not at 3.

From ADULT:
- A(-) at 1: A is in word, not at 1.

But positions 3,4,5 are fixed as U,L,T, so A can only be at 2, but A(-) from CRANE says A is not at 2. This implies A is not in the word, which contradicts A(-) from CRANE and SLATY.

This suggests an inconsistency in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the feedback correctly:

Feedback format:
Each position gets a symbol for the letter in that position.

ADULT feedback:
Position 1: A(-) → A is in word but not at 1.
Position 2: D(x) → D is not in word.
Position 3: U(✓) → U is in word and at 3.
Position 4: L(✓) → L is in word and at 4.
Position 5: T(✓) → T is in word and at 5.

Thus the word structure is: ? ? U L T, where the first two letters are not A or D.

From earlier:
- A is in word but not at 1,2,3 (from CRANE and SLATY), so must be at 4 or 5, but 4 is L and 5 is T. This is impossible.

This indicates I must have misread the positions. Let me re-map the feedback carefully:

In ADULT:
Letters: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5)
Feedback symbols correspond to these positions:
1: A(-) → A in word, not at 1.
2: D(x) → D not in word.
3: U(✓) → U correct at 3.
4: L(✓) → L correct at 4.
5: T(✓) → T correct at 5.

Thus the word must be: [not A or D] [not D] U L T, and must contain A somewhere. But positions 3,4,5 are U,L,T, so A must be at 1 or 2, but:
- A(-) at 1 → A not at 1.
- From CRANE: A(-) at 2 → A is in word but not at 2.

This is impossible. The only resolution is that the feedback mapping is position-wise, and the word is: _ _ U L T, and must include A, but A cannot be at 1,2,3,4,5. This contradiction implies that the word cannot have A, which conflicts with A(-) from CRANE and SLATY.

This suggests an error in interpreting the feedback. The correct interpretation is that:
- A(-) from CRANE means the letter A is in the word but not at position 3 (since CRANE has A at 3, and it got (-)).
- In SLATY, A is at 3 and gets (-), confirming A is not at 3.
- In ADULT, A is at 1 and gets (-), so A is not at 1.

Thus A is in the word but not at 1 or 3.

Current fixed letters from ADULT:
- U is at 3 (✓)
- L is at 4 (✓)
- T is at 5 (✓)

So word structure: _ _ U L T, and must include A. The only possible position for A is 2.

Thus the word is: _ A U L T

Now we need a 5-letter word matching A _ U L T, which is impossible because positions 2,3,4,5 are A,U,L,T. This indicates the structure must be:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: U (✓)
4: L (✓)
5: T (✓)

And word must contain A (not at 1 or 3). Thus A must be at 2.

Thus the word is: ? A U L T

Now we need a letter for position 1 that:
- Is not in {C,R,N,E,S,Y,D} (from previous x feedback)
- Is not A (since A is at 2)
- Forms a valid 5-letter word ending in AULT.

Possible words: FAULT, GAULT, VAULT, MAULT, etc.

From remaining letters (not ruled out): F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, etc.

VAULT is a valid word:
- V not ruled out.
- A at 2 (ok, not at 1 or 3).
- U,L,T fixed at 3,4,5.

Check:
- V not in previous x list.
- A at 2 is allowed (only excluded at 1 and 3).
- U,L,T match.
- No disallowed letters.

Thus VAULT is a valid next guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be structured as _ A U L T, where the first letter is not yet determined and must not be any of the already excluded letters. A valid English word fitting this pattern is VAULT.

<guess>VAULT</guess>",VAULT,"Let's summarize the constraints after the three guesses.

1. Letters **in** the secret word (with their positions in ADULT):
   - U at position 2 (✓)
   - L at position 4 (✓)
   - T at position 5 (✓)

2. Letters **ruled out** (never appear):
   - C, R, N, E, S, Y, D

3. Letters whose **position is restricted**:
   - A is in the word, but not at positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and SLATY), and ADULT shows A at position 1 is wrong (-), so A must be at position 4.
   - L is in the word and not at position 2 (from SLATY), and in ADULT it's at 4 (✓), so L must be at position 4.
   - T is in the word and not at position 4 (from SLATY), and in ADULT it's at 5 (✓), so T must be at position 5.

4. So far we have:
   - Position 1: ?
   - Position 2: U
   - Position 3: ?
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 5: T

5. Letters remaining to guess: positions 1 and 3 must come from the unused set {A, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z}, excluding the ruled-out letters.

6. Since A must be in the word (from CRANE), and we've placed L and T, A must be in position 4. But position 4 is already L. This is a contradiction, meaning our earlier assumption must be adjusted.

Wait, let's re-examine:

From ADULT:
- A(-) at position 1 → A is in the word but not at position 1.
- From CRANE: A(-) at position 2 → A is in the word but not at position 2.
- From SLATY: A(-) at position 3 → A is in the word but not at position 3.

Thus A must be at position 4 or 5. But position 4 has L (✓) and position 5 has T (✓), so A cannot be placed. This means our interpretation must be wrong.

Ah! The ADULT feedback shows:
- A(-) at position 1: A is in the word, but not at position 1.
- D(x) at position 2: D is not in the word.
- U(✓) at position 2: U is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
- L(✓) at position 3: L is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) at position 4: T is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).

Wait, the positions in ADULT are:
A (1), D (2), U (3), L (4), T (5).

So the feedback is:
- A(-) at 1: A is in word, not at 1.
- D(x) at 2: D not in word.
- U(✓) at 3: U is correct at 3.
- L(✓) at 4: L is correct at 4.
- T(✓) at 5: T is correct at 5.

Now the constraints are:
- Fixed letters: _ U L T
- A is in the word but not at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? Wait, positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by U,L,T and A is not at 1. This seems impossible.

Wait, the word is 5 letters, and we have:
Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: U (✓)
4: L (✓)
5: T (✓)

From CRANE:
- A(-) at 2: A is in word, not at 2.

From SLATY:
- A(-) at 3: A is in word, not at 3.

From ADULT:
- A(-) at 1: A is in word, not at 1.

But positions 3,4,5 are fixed as U,L,T, so A can only be at 2, but A(-) from CRANE says A is not at 2. This implies A is not in the word, which contradicts A(-) from CRANE and SLATY.

This suggests an inconsistency in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the feedback correctly:

Feedback format:
Each position gets a symbol for the letter in that position.

ADULT feedback:
Position 1: A(-) → A is in word but not at 1.
Position 2: D(x) → D is not in word.
Position 3: U(✓) → U is in word and at 3.
Position 4: L(✓) → L is in word and at 4.
Position 5: T(✓) → T is in word and at 5.

Thus the word structure is: ? ? U L T, where the first two letters are not A or D.

From earlier:
- A is in word but not at 1,2,3 (from CRANE and SLATY), so must be at 4 or 5, but 4 is L and 5 is T. This is impossible.

This indicates I must have misread the positions. Let me re-map the feedback carefully:

In ADULT:
Letters: A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5)
Feedback symbols correspond to these positions:
1: A(-) → A in word, not at 1.
2: D(x) → D not in word.
3: U(✓) → U correct at 3.
4: L(✓) → L correct at 4.
5: T(✓) → T correct at 5.

Thus the word must be: [not A or D] [not D] U L T, and must contain A somewhere. But positions 3,4,5 are U,L,T, so A must be at 1 or 2, but:
- A(-) at 1 → A not at 1.
- From CRANE: A(-) at 2 → A is in word but not at 2.

This is impossible. The only resolution is that the feedback mapping is position-wise, and the word is: _ _ U L T, and must include A, but A cannot be at 1,2,3,4,5. This contradiction implies that the word cannot have A, which conflicts with A(-) from CRANE and SLATY.

This suggests an error in interpreting the feedback. The correct interpretation is that:
- A(-) from CRANE means the letter A is in the word but not at position 3 (since CRANE has A at 3, and it got (-)).
- In SLATY, A is at 3 and gets (-), confirming A is not at 3.
- In ADULT, A is at 1 and gets (-), so A is not at 1.

Thus A is in the word but not at 1 or 3.

Current fixed letters from ADULT:
- U is at 3 (✓)
- L is at 4 (✓)
- T is at 5 (✓)

So word structure: _ _ U L T, and must include A. The only possible position for A is 2.

Thus the word is: _ A U L T

Now we need a 5-letter word matching A _ U L T, which is impossible because positions 2,3,4,5 are A,U,L,T. This indicates the structure must be:

Positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: U (✓)
4: L (✓)
5: T (✓)

And word must contain A (not at 1 or 3). Thus A must be at 2.

Thus the word is: ? A U L T

Now we need a letter for position 1 that:
- Is not in {C,R,N,E,S,Y,D} (from previous x feedback)
- Is not A (since A is at 2)
- Forms a valid 5-letter word ending in AULT.

Possible words: FAULT, GAULT, VAULT, MAULT, etc.

From remaining letters (not ruled out): F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, etc.

VAULT is a valid word:
- V not ruled out.
- A at 2 (ok, not at 1 or 3).
- U,L,T fixed at 3,4,5.

Check:
- V not in previous x list.
- A at 2 is allowed (only excluded at 1 and 3).
- U,L,T match.
- No disallowed letters.

Thus VAULT is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback, the word must be structured as _ A U L T, where the first letter is not yet determined and must not be any of the already excluded letters. A valid English word fitting this pattern is VAULT.",Guess 4: VAULT -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) A(✓) U(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
