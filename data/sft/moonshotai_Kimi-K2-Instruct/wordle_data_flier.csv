For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will help identify which of these letters are in the target word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the correct position (✓) – so it must be the second letter.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong place (-).

From the feedback so far:

Guess 1: SLATE
- S(x) – S is out.
- L(✓) – L is in the correct spot (position 2).
- A(x) – A is out.
- T(x) – T is out.
- E(-) – E is present but not in position 1.

- L(✓) – L is correctly in position 2 (confirmed again).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct spot here (position 4).
- R(✓) – R is in the correct spot here (position 5).

So we now know the partial pattern and confirmed letters:
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
Pattern looks like: _ L _ E R

Letters still allowed: can use any not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, D).

Let’s find a word that fits _ L _ E R and uses common remaining letters to test positions 1 and 3. The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, etc. Vowels still open include I, O, U (E already used).

A good candidate is “FLER_” but FLER isn’t a word. Actually, with pattern _ L _ E R, we can test:

- C: CL _ ER → “CLUER” – not valid.
- B: BL _ ER → “BLUER” – valid.
- F: FL _ ER → “FLEER” – valid but rarer.
- G: GL _ ER → “GLUER” – valid.
- H: “HL” doesn’t form a valid start.
- M: “ML” doesn’t form a valid start.
- N: “NL” doesn’t form a valid start.
- P: PL _ ER → “PLEUR” – not valid.

Consonants left (common ones): C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, Y  

Quick scan for valid English words fitting _ L _ E R:

– M: ML* invalid  
– N: NL* invalid  
– P: PL _ ER → PLYER (valid, uses Y)  
– W: WL* invalid  
– Y at position 3 gives C L Y E R? CLYER is not a standard word.  

Next simplest common consonant after P is H, but HL* not a start.  
Best remaining common consonant is N, but NL* not start.  
So check vowels:

Next option with remaining consonants:  
– G: G L I E R → GLIER (invalid)

Wait – test FLEER? (F L E E R) but double E at 3/4 may conflict.  
But our pattern is _ L _ E R, so position 3 must be a single letter, position 4 is E.  
So _ L _ E R – 3rd letter must be a single letter.  

P L Y E R – PLYER: valid word (means someone who plies). It uses P (not yet tested), Y (not tested), fits the pattern, and P and Y are still allowed.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,flier,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will help identify which of these letters are in the target word and their possible positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x).
- L is in the correct position (✓) – so it must be the second letter.
- A is not in the word (x).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong place (-).

So the word has the pattern: _ L _ _ _  
Known letters: L (2nd), E somewhere (not 5th).  
Letters to avoid: S, A, T.  

Next I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in 2nd position.
- Contains E but not in 5th position.
- Does NOT contain S, A, T.

I’ll pick a word that introduces new common consonants to test. ""ETHER"" would be good, but it has T (forbidden). ""ELDER"" has D and R, common letters, and fits the constraints.

<guess>ELDER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ELDER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(✓) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

Guess 1: SLATE
- S(x) – S is out.
- L(✓) – L is in the correct spot (position 2).
- A(x) – A is out.
- T(x) – T is out.
- E(-) – E is present but not in position 1.

Guess 2: ELDER
- E(-) – E is present but not in position 1 (already knew that).
- L(✓) – L is correctly in position 2 (confirmed again).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the correct spot here (position 4).
- R(✓) – R is in the correct spot here (position 5).

So we now know the partial pattern and confirmed letters:
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
Pattern looks like: _ L _ E R

Letters still allowed: can use any not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, D).

Let’s find a word that fits _ L _ E R and uses common remaining letters to test positions 1 and 3. The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried include B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, etc. Vowels still open include I, O, U (E already used).

A good candidate is “FLER_” but FLER isn’t a word. Actually, with pattern _ L _ E R, we can test:

- C: CL _ ER → “CLUER” – not valid.
- B: BL _ ER → “BLUER” – valid.
- F: FL _ ER → “FLEER” – valid but rarer.
- G: GL _ ER → “GLUER” – valid.
- H: “HL” doesn’t form a valid start.
- M: “ML” doesn’t form a valid start.
- N: “NL” doesn’t form a valid start.
- P: PL _ ER → “PLEUR” – not valid.

Among valid options, “BLUER” uses B and U, both untested and common enough, and fits the pattern perfectly. Let’s go with that.
