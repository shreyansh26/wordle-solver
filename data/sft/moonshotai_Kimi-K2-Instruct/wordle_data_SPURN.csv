For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word should ideally contain different letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, O, T, N, S, L, I.

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, and E are NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. The remaining four positions cannot contain L, A, T, or E.

I should choose a word that:
- Keeps S as the first letter.
- Uses entirely different letters for positions 2-5.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

Good consonants to try next: N, R, I, C, H, O, U, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Current information:
1. First letter is S (✓)
2. Fourth letter is R (✓)
3. Letters eliminated so far: L, A, T, E, H, I, K, C, O
4. From the last feedback:
   - S(✓) – still correct
   - C(x) – C is not in the word
   - O(x) – O is not in the word
   - U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 4
   - R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know it's in position 4)

So the pattern is: S _ _ R _, and U must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has R in the 4th position
- Contains U in one of positions 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's brainstorm:
- Position 5 can't be R (already in 4), and must be other allowed letters. Could be U, e.g., S _ _ R U
- Position 2 or 3 could be U.

Common words:
- ""SURGE"" – but E is eliminated
- ""SPURN"" – N is allowed, P is allowed
- ""SUGAR"" – but A is eliminated
- ""SUNDR"" – not a word
- ""SWORD"" – O is eliminated
- ""SWURB"" – not a word
- ""SPUR_"" – like ""SPURS"" but S is already used
- ""SPURT"" – T is eliminated
- ""SPURN"" – N is allowed, fits pattern S P U R N

SPURN:
- S (✓)
- P (new)
- U (must be in word, here in position 3)
- R (✓)
- N (new)
All letters are allowed and not yet ruled out.
