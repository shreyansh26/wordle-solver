This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z, etc.)
4. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Some popular strategic first guesses include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong strategic choice that covers many common letters and includes 3 vowels (A, E) plus 2 common consonants (C, R, N). This should give good initial information about the presence and positions of these letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in first position
- R is correct in second position
- A, N, E are not in the word at all

So the word structure is: C R _ _ _

Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with CR that don't contain A, N, or E:
- CRISP (C R I S P) - uses I, S, P
- CROOK (C R O O K) - uses O, K
- CRUMP (C R U M P) - uses U, M, P

- CROCK (C R O C K) - O, C, K

3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z, etc.)
4. Be a valid 5-letter English word

Some popular strategic first guesses include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong strategic choice that covers many common letters and includes 3 vowels (A, E) plus 2 common consonants (C, R, N). This should give good initial information about the presence and positions of these letters.

Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with CR that don't contain A, N, or E:
- CRISP (C R I S P) - uses I, S, P
- CROOK (C R O O K) - uses O, K
- CRUMP (C R U M P) - uses U, M, P

- A(x) – already known
- Second S(-) – the S is not in position 4, so we must place it in position 3.
Thus the skeleton is: C R S _ S

We still need a single letter for position 4 that:
- Has not been eliminated yet: eliminated letters so far = {A, N, E, I, P, O}

Common remaining consonants / vowels: U, T, D, L, M, Y, F, G, H, K, B, V, W

Valid 5-letter English words fitting CR S _ S:
- CRUST (CRUST) – letters C, R, U, S, T – U and T are still allowed.
- CRSDS – not a word.
- CRGMS – not a word.

The only legitimate word left is CRUST, and it satisfies all constraints.

From CRUST feedback we now know:

- Exact pattern: C R U S _
- Only the last letter remains unknown.
- All letters used so far (C, R, U, S, T) except the one in position 5 have been confirmed.
- Eliminated letters: A, N, E, I, P, O, T

Therefore the missing letter must be one of the remaining consonants or vowels not yet used and not eliminated. Common ones left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

Valid 5-letter English words that start with CRUS:
- CRUSH  (H is still allowed)
- CRUSE  (E is eliminated)
- CRUST  (already tried, T is eliminated)
- CRUSY  (rare, but Y is allowed)
- CRUSK  (rare, K is allowed)

CRUSH is the most common and fits every constraint.

So the only remaining candidate is CRUSH.
