For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, N, O, L. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's highly recommended among Wordle enthusiasts for its letter coverage and frequency analysis.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it shows as -).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A cannot be in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not present at all.

Next guess should:
- Include A in a different position (not 3rd).
- Avoid S, L, T, E.
- Use other common consonants like N, R, C, D, M, etc.

Possible good candidates:
- MARCH (M, A, R, C, H) – all new letters and A in 2nd position.
- CHARD (C, H, A, R, D) – A in 3rd position again, so skip (since A can't be 3rd).
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – A in 3rd position again, skip.
- DRANK (D, R, A, N, K) – A in 3rd position, skip.

From the three guesses so far we have:

Known absent letters: S, L, T, E, M, C, Y, D  
Known present letters (but still in unknown positions): A, R, H  
Positions that have been eliminated for each known letter:
- A has shown up in positions 2, 3, 5 → A cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → only 1 or 4 left  
- R has shown up in positions 3, 4 → R cannot be in 3, 4 → only 1, 2, 5 left  
- H has shown up in positions 1, 5 → H cannot be in 1, 5 → only 2, 3, 4 left  

We still need two more distinct consonants (each letter counts only once toward “present”).  
Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that:
- uses A, R, H  
- places A in 1 or 4  
- places R in 1, 2, or 5  
- places H in 2, 3, or 4  
- uses only letters from the remaining pool {A, R, H, plus any unused consonants not yet ruled out}

Fresh consonants we can safely try: N, K, P, G, B, F, V, etc.

Let’s build a pattern:
- If A goes in 1, then R could go in 2 or 5, H in 2,3,4 but avoiding overlap.

Trying A 1, R 5, H 2: A H _ _ R → need two middle consonants; e.g., A H N _ R → AHNER (invalid).  
A H N G R – invalid.  
No common words fit.

Trying A 4, R 2, H 3: _ R H A _ → e.g., F R H A N – invalid.

Trying A 1, R 2, H 3: A R H _ _ – need two more letters, e.g., A R H N K – invalid.

Instead, look at the remaining pool and known constraints.  
A clean pattern is: A _ H R _ or A _ _ H R, etc.

Real word that fits constraints: APHID – but D already ruled out.

Another: ARHAT – contains T (ruled out).

Consider HARBOR – too long.

Consider BARON – B, N new, but A 2 is blocked.

Consider HARPA – P new, but A 4 is ok, R 2 is ok, H 1 blocked.  

Try H 2, A 4, R 5: _ H _ A R  
Need first and third letters fresh consonants.

Valid word: N H A R (but 4 letters).

Valid 5-letter word: F H A R _ – nothing.

Try H 3, A 1, R 5: A _ H _ R  
Need middle consonants. Valid word: A N H O R – invalid.

Valid word: A N H E R – invalid.

Let’s try H 3, A 4, R 2: _ R H A _  
Valid word: F R H A N – not a word.

Valid word: G R A H N – invalid.

But the pattern A R H N works if we rearrange.

Try A R N H _ – no.

Finally, a valid real word that fits all constraints:

Insert N and K: A N H K R – invalid.

Insert N and I: A N H I R – invalid.

Insert B and N: A B H N R – invalid.

Insert F and N: A F H N R – invalid.

Wait, another angle: H 3, A 4, R 1: R _ H A _  
Need middle consonant. Real word: R A H A N – invalid.

R O H A N – O allowed, H 3 ok, A 4 ok, R 1 ok, N new.  
ROHAN is a valid word and meets all constraints.

So:
ROHAN

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, N, O, L. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's highly recommended among Wordle enthusiasts for its letter coverage and frequency analysis.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it shows as -).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A cannot be in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not present at all.

Next guess should:
- Include A in a different position (not 3rd).
- Avoid S, L, T, E.
- Use other common consonants like N, R, C, D, M, etc.

Possible good candidates:
- MARCH (M, A, R, C, H) – all new letters and A in 2nd position.
- CHARD (C, H, A, R, D) – A in 3rd position again, so skip (since A can't be 3rd).
- CRANK (C, R, A, N, K) – A in 3rd position again, skip.
- DRANK (D, R, A, N, K) – A in 3rd position, skip.
- MANOR (M, A, N, O, R) – A in 2nd position, good.

I’ll go with MARCH, as it introduces M, R, C, H and moves A to position 2.

Possible positions:
A: 1, 4, 5  
R: 1, 2, 4, 5  
H: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We still need two more consonants. We haven’t used D, N, P, K, Y, G, etc. To maximize information, pick common ones.

A good next word should place A, R, H in new spots and add two fresh common consonants.

Candidate: DRAHY (D, R, A, H, Y) — but ""DRAHY"" is not a valid Wordle word.

Common valid word: HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)

Interpretation:
- R: present but wrong position (cannot be 1)
- O: present but wrong position (cannot be 2)
- H: in correct position (3)
- A: present but wrong position (cannot be 4)
- N: not in the word

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, M, C, Y, D, N
- Letters confirmed in the word and their constraints:
   – A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → A must be in position 1
   – R cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 → R must be in positions 2 or 5
   – O cannot be in position 2 → O must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is H, 1 is A) → O must be in positions 4 or 5
   – H is fixed in position 3

Word structure: A _ H _ _

We still need two more distinct consonants, chosen from the remaining unused letters: B, F, G, K, P, V, W, etc.

Also, the letters we must use once more:
- R must appear once (in position 2 or 5)
- O must appear once (in position 4 or 5)

Since position 5 can only hold one letter, R and O cannot both be in position 5. So:
Case 1: R in position 2 → O must be in position 4
Case 2: R in position 5 → O must be in position 4 (but then word would be A _ H O R, which is valid)

So possible patterns:
- A R H O _ (need 5th letter, must be new consonant)
- A _ H O R (need 2nd letter, must be new consonant)

Let’s find valid English words for each.

Pattern A R H O _:
ARHOT – not valid.
ARHON – n removed.
ARHOB – not common.

Pattern A _ H O R:
Need 2nd letter fresh consonant, valid word:
A C H O R – C is eliminated.
A B H O R – B is allowed and “ABHOR” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
ABHOR:
A:1 – ok (must be 1)
B:2 – new, allowed
H:3 – correct
O:4 – ok (cannot be 2, so 4 is allowed)
R:5 – ok (cannot be 1,3,4)

All constraints satisfied.
