For my first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters and can give me a lot of information. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it uses all five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are among the most frequent in English words.

- Letters present: R, S
- Letters absent: A, O, E
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

I need a new word that uses R and S, avoids A, O, E, and tests new common consonants. Good candidates are words like STRIP, TRUST, FIRST, CRISP, etc.  
""CRISP"" uses C, R, I, S, P – all new letters that haven’t been tested yet, while placing R in position 2 (allowed since R just can’t be in position 2 originally, but we have no info on other positions) and S in position 4 (but feedback says S isn’t in position 4 – so CRISP is invalid).

Let's summarize the full feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - R and S are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
   - A, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. FIRST → F(x) I(x) R(-) S(-) T(✓)  
   - T is correct in position 5.  
   - R is NOT in position 3, and S is NOT in position 4.  
   - F and I are not in the word.

3. BURST → B(x) U(-) R(-) S(-) T(✓)  
   - T is still correct in position 5.  
   - U appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
   - R is NOT in position 3 (already known), and now we know R is also NOT in position 1 (because it got “-” here).  
   - S is NOT in position 4 (already known), and now we also know S is NOT in position 3.  
   - B is not in the word.

Known constraints so far:
- Word ends with T (position 5 = T).  
- Must contain R, S, and U exactly once each.  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → the only legal position for R is position 4.  
- S cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → the only legal position for S is position 1.  
- U cannot be in position 2 → it must be in position 2 or 3, but since position 2 is now open, we’ll test it.

Thus the word must be:  
S _ U R T

Only the second letter remains unknown, and it must be a consonant not yet eliminated (cannot be A, O, E, F, I, B). Looking at common consonants we have not tried: C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching S _ U R T that is in the English word list.  
The only common valid word that fits this pattern is:

S + C + U + R + T  →  SCURT (not a real word)  
S + L + U + R + T  →  SLURT (not a real word)  
S + P + U + R + T  →  SPURT (valid!)

SPURT is the only plausible candidate.
