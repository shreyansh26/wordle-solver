For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are present
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are in many 5-letter words
- All letters are fairly common in English

This should give me good initial information about the presence of at least 5 common letters in the word, which can guide my next guesses effectively.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, O, I, T.

Letters that **are** definitely in the word (and how they were marked):
- R : present, but not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 again (from tries). So R ≠ 2.
- S : present, but not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 5 (from tries). So S ∉ {4,5}.
- E : present and **already locked into position 4** (from tries). Therefore the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions ruled out so far:
- Letter 1: cannot be A, O, I, T
- Letter 2: cannot be R, A, O, I, T
- Letter 3: no restrictions beyond “no A, O, I, T” yet
- Letter 4: is E
- Letter 5: cannot be S, A, O, I, T

Remaining candidate letters (among the most common consonants + remaining vowels):
- Consonants left to place: R, S, plus common others (N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, M, P, W, Y, K, V, X, Z)
- Vowels left: U (since we’ve ruled out A, O, I; E is already used at 4)

We know both R and S must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (1,2,3,5).  
Also, S cannot be in position 5, so S must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
R cannot be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, or 5.

A simple high-frequency word that satisfies these constraints is “PRESS”:
- P – new consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.
- R – consonant we know is in the word; this puts R in position 2, but we know from the earlier feedback that R cannot be in position 2 (both arose and tries showed R was wrong in that spot). So “PRESS” is invalid because it violates R ≠ 2.

Next option: “SERGE”
- S – must be used and is allowed in position 1 (positions 4 and 5 are banned for S).
- E – already locked at 4, so fits.
- R – needs to appear and is allowed in position 3 (not banned there).
- G – new consonant.
- E – duplicate in position 5: but we only need one E and it’s already fixed at 4, so the second E is redundant and might not be helpful.

Let’s pick “SURER” instead:
- S – allowed in position 1.
- U – new vowel we haven’t tried.
- R – can go in position 3 (allowed).
- E – fixed at 4.
- R – duplicate R; again not ideal.

Let’s avoid duplicates and pick “SURGE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- U (2) – new vowel.
- R (3) – allowed.
- G (4) – but 4 is already E, so invalid.

We must keep E at 4, so the word is _ _ _ E _.

A tidy candidate is “USERS”, but E is fixed at 4, so that would be _ _ _ E S, making the word _ _ _ E S – but S in position 5 is banned. So “USERS” is invalid.

Next: “SURED” is not a word.

Try “SERVE”:
- S 1 – allowed.
- E 2 – allowed.
- R 3 – allowed.
- V 4 – but 4 is E, so conflict.

Ah, we have to keep 4 fixed as E, so the word is: ? ? ? E ?

Let’s put S in 1, R in 3, and the remaining positions can be common consonants or the vowel U.

Candidate: “SURED” – not valid.

Candidate: “SUPER”
- S 1 – allowed.
- U 2 – allowed.
- P 3 – allowed.
- E 4 – already fixed.
- R 5 – allowed (R not in 2, and we don’t yet know 5 is illegal for R).

This uses every letter we know must appear and tests a new consonant P plus the vowel U.  
Checks:
- S (position 1) – allowed (not 4 or 5).
- U (position 2) – new vowel.
- P (position 3) – new consonant.
- E (position 4) – correct.
- R (position 5) – allowed (R not in 2, no ban on 5).

So the word is SUPER.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, O, I, T.

Letters that **are** definitely in the word (and how they were marked):
- R : present, but not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 again (from tries). So R ≠ 2.
- S : present, but not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 5 (from tries). So S ∉ {4,5}.
- E : present and **already locked into position 4** (from tries). Therefore the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions ruled out so far:
- Letter 1: cannot be A, O, I, T
- Letter 2: cannot be R, A, O, I, T
- Letter 3: no restrictions beyond “no A, O, I, T” yet
- Letter 4: is E
- Letter 5: cannot be S, A, O, I, T

Remaining candidate letters (among the most common consonants + remaining vowels):
- Consonants left to place: R, S, plus common others (N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, M, P, W, Y, K, V, X, Z)
- Vowels left: U (since we’ve ruled out A, O, I; E is already used at 4)

We know both R and S must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (1,2,3,5).  
Also, S cannot be in position 5, so S must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
R cannot be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, or 5.

A simple high-frequency word that satisfies these constraints is “PRESS”:
- P – new consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.
- R – consonant we know is in the word; this puts R in position 2, but we know from the earlier feedback that R cannot be in position 2 (both arose and tries showed R was wrong in that spot). So “PRESS” is invalid because it violates R ≠ 2.

Next option: “SERGE”
- S – must be used and is allowed in position 1 (positions 4 and 5 are banned for S).
- E – already locked at 4, so fits.
- R – needs to appear and is allowed in position 3 (not banned there).
- G – new consonant.
- E – duplicate in position 5: but we only need one E and it’s already fixed at 4, so the second E is redundant and might not be helpful.

Let’s pick “SURER” instead:
- S – allowed in position 1.
- U – new vowel we haven’t tried.
- R – can go in position 3 (allowed).
- E – fixed at 4.
- R – duplicate R; again not ideal.

Let’s avoid duplicates and pick “SURGE”:
- S (1) – allowed.
- U (2) – new vowel.
- R (3) – allowed.
- G (4) – but 4 is already E, so invalid.

We must keep E at 4, so the word is _ _ _ E _.

A tidy candidate is “USERS”, but E is fixed at 4, so that would be _ _ _ E S, making the word _ _ _ E S – but S in position 5 is banned. So “USERS” is invalid.

Next: “SURED” is not a word.

Try “SERVE”:
- S 1 – allowed.
- E 2 – allowed.
- R 3 – allowed.
- V 4 – but 4 is E, so conflict.

Ah, we have to keep 4 fixed as E, so the word is: ? ? ? E ?

Let’s put S in 1, R in 3, and the remaining positions can be common consonants or the vowel U.

Candidate: “SURED” – not valid.

Candidate: “SUPER”
- S 1 – allowed.
- U 2 – allowed.
- P 3 – allowed.
- E 4 – already fixed.
- R 5 – allowed (R not in 2, and we don’t yet know 5 is illegal for R).

This uses every letter we know must appear and tests a new consonant P plus the vowel U.  
Checks:
- S (position 1) – allowed (not 4 or 5).
- U (position 2) – new vowel.
- P (position 3) – new consonant.
- E (position 4) – correct.
- R (position 5) – allowed (R not in 2, no ban on 5).

So the word is SUPER.

From the three guesses we have:

Known letters that ARE in the word and are now locked in place:
- S at position 1 ✓
- E at position 4 ✓

Known letters that ARE in the word but NOT yet locked:
- R – cannot be positions 2 or 5 (from arose and super feedback), so R must be at 3.

Known letters that are absolutely NOT in the word:
A, O, I, T, U, P

So the hidden word is now:
S _ R E _

We need common consonants for positions 2 and 5 that have not been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, M, W, Y, K, V.

The high-frequency combination “SNERD” is not a word, but “SIRED” and “SORED” use ruled-out letters.

A valid dictionary word that fits is “SERGE” (but G is at 3, which is already R).

Another valid word: “SARGE” – uses A (ruled out).

How about “SORED” – uses O (ruled out).

Actually, let’s just list valid 5-letter patterns:
S ? R E ?

Looking at common English words fitting S _ R E _, the simplest are:
- SCREE – two E’s and C (but E is already at 4)
- SIREE – uses I (ruled out)
- SCREE – uses C (not ruled out) but position 5 needs another consonant
- SPREE – uses P (ruled out)

Valid ones left:
- SCREE – ok, C & R ok
- SHRED – only one E, but D is ok
- SHREW – ok

Let’s pick “SHRED”:

E 4 ✓
D (new, ok)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are present
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are in many 5-letter words
- All letters are fairly common in English

This should give me good initial information about the presence of at least 5 common letters in the word, which can guide my next guesses effectively.

So R ≠ 2.\n- S : present, but not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 5 (from tries). So S ∉ {4,5}.\n- E : present and **already locked into position 4** (from tries). Therefore the word looks like: _ _ _ E _\n\nPositions ruled out so far:\n- Letter 1: cannot be A, O, I, T\n- Letter 2: cannot be R, A, O, I, T\n- Letter 3: no restrictions beyond “no A, O, I, T” yet\n- Letter 4: is E\n- Letter 5: cannot be S, A, O, I, T\n\nRemaining candidate letters (among the most common consonants + remaining vowels):\n- Consonants left to place: R, S, plus common others (N, L, D, C, H, G, B, F, M, P, W, Y, K, V, X, Z)\n- Vowels left: U (since we’ve ruled out A, O, I; E is already used at 4)\n\nWe know both R and S must appear somewhere in the remaining four positions (1,2,3,5).  \nAlso, S cannot be in position 5, so S must be in 1, 2, or 3.  \nR cannot be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, or 5.\n\nA simple high-frequency word that satisfies these constraints is “PRESS”:\n- P – new consonant that hasn’t been tested yet.\n- R – consonant we know is in the word; this puts R in position 2, but we know from the earlier feedback that R cannot be in position 2 (both arose and tries showed R was wrong in that spot).

From the four rounds we have:

1. Letters and positions already **locked**:  
   S (1), H (2), R (3), E (4)

2. Letters that are **in the word** but whose positions aren’t yet fixed:  
   none – every revealed letter is already in its correct place.

3. Letters **not in the word** at all:  
   A, O, I, T, U, P, D

So the hidden word is now:  
S H R E _

The only unknown is position 5.  
Available letters (not ruled out): any consonant or vowel except the excluded ones.  
Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, G, B, F, M, W, Y, K, V … and vowels: only E is used (E already at 4), but we can repeat E if needed.

Looking at real 5-letter words that begin with “SHRE”:

- SHREW – valid word  
- SHRED – already tried with D ruled out  
- SHREE – uses E again at 5, but we have no ban on repeating E.

Between the two likely words, “SHREW” uses a new unused letter W, while “SHREE” duplicates E.  
Since D is ruled out, “SHREW” is the only safe remaining choice.

Therefore the word must be SHREW.
