For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers many frequently used letters in English. This will help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters in the secret word.

Let's consolidate what we know after the two guesses:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I.

Letters that we know ARE in the word and their statuses:
- R: in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- S: in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- E: in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (because E(✓) in TRIES).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E

And it must contain:
- R somewhere in positions 1, 4 (since not 2 or 3)
- S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We need a new guess that:
1. Places E in position 5 again (since we know it's correct there)
2. Tests possible positions for R and S
3. Introduces new common consonants

Looking at possible positions:
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R E
- Then S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3

Let's try ""SURER"":
- S in position 1
- U new letter
- R in position 3 (but we know R can't be in position 3 from TRIES feedback) - wait no, in TRIES R was in position 2, so position 3 is still possible for R.

Wait, let me re-examine R placement:
- In AROSE: R was in position 2 (feedback: R(-) - so not position 2)
- In TRIES: R was in position 2 again (feedback: R(-) - confirming not position 2)
So R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, position 5 is E, so R could be 1, 3, or 4.

For S:
- In AROSE: S in position 4 (feedback S(-) - not position 4)
- In TRIES: S in position 5 (feedback S(-) - not position 5)
So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""PRESS"":
- P new letter
- R in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2)
So that's invalid.

How about ""SPEER"":

- E repeated but we already know E is in position 5

Let’s update the deductions with the new feedback from SPEER:

Known facts about the secret word (length = 5):

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, T, I, P.  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed at least once):
   - S — now known to be in position 1 (✓ in SPEER)
   - E — now known to be in position 5 (✓ in previous TRIES and confirmed again here)
3. Additional positional constraints:
   - R — must appear somewhere (present from AROSE and TRIES), but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (because:  
     – in SPEER it was in position 5 and got “-” (wrong place),  
     – in TRIES it was in position 2 and got “-”,  
     – in AROSE it was in position 2 and got “-”).  
     Therefore R must be in position 1, but position 1 is already S, so R cannot be there either.  
     This is a contradiction: R must exist in the word but cannot fit in any position.  
   Wait, let me double-check:

   - R in AROSE (position 2) → “-” → not position 2
   - R in TRIES (position 2) → “-” → again not position 2
   - R in SPEER (position 5) → “-” → not position 5
   - R has never been tried in positions 1, 3, 4 yet.

   So actually R could still be in 1, 3, or 4.

   But S is confirmed in position 1, so R cannot be in position 1.

   Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

4. E is locked into position 5.

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ _ E  
with R required in position 3 or 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with S
- ends with E
- contains R in position 3 or 4
- does not contain any of A, O, T, I, P

Simple candidates:
- S R _ _ E
- S _ R _ E

Common words:
– S R A K E → contains A (forbidden)
– S R I K E → contains I (forbidden)
– S R O K E → contains O (forbidden)
– S T R E E → contains T (forbidden)
– S P R E E → contains P (forbidden)

How about S C R E E? C is allowed, R in position 3.  
But SCREE is a valid 5-letter word.

Another: S C R A E → invalid (A).  
S W R E E → SWREE not a word.  
S H R E E → not a common word.  
S C R E E seems the only valid one quickly.

Let me verify: yes, “SCREE” is a recognized English word meaning a mass of loose stones (geology term).

So I’ll guess “SCREE” which places R in position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains: R, S, E (each at least once).
- Does NOT contain: A, O.
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Next I want a guess that:
1. Keeps the known letters R, S, E on the board (so I can learn their correct slots).
2. Introduces new, common letters to maximize information.
3. Uses positions not yet ruled out for each of R, S, E.

A balanced choice is “TRIES”.
- T, I – new letters, common in 5-letter words.
- R, I, E, S – all letters whose positions we still need to test.
- Positions:
  – R placed in slot 2 (where we already know it’s NOT correct, but this helps confirm).
  – E placed in slot 5 (where we know it’s NOT correct, but again helps confirm).
  – S placed in slot 4 (where we know it’s NOT correct).
  – T placed in slot 1.
  – I placed in slot 3.

This pattern should help narrow down the exact placement of R, S, E while checking T and I.

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we know after the two guesses:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I.

Letters that we know ARE in the word and their statuses:
- R: in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- S: in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- E: in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (because E(✓) in TRIES).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E

And it must contain:
- R somewhere in positions 1, 4 (since not 2 or 3)
- S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We need a new guess that:
1. Places E in position 5 again (since we know it's correct there)
2. Tests possible positions for R and S
3. Introduces new common consonants

Looking at possible positions:
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R E
- Then S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3

Let's try ""SURER"":
- S in position 1
- U new letter
- R in position 3 (but we know R can't be in position 3 from TRIES feedback) - wait no, in TRIES R was in position 2, so position 3 is still possible for R.

Wait, let me re-examine R placement:
- In AROSE: R was in position 2 (feedback: R(-) - so not position 2)
- In TRIES: R was in position 2 again (feedback: R(-) - confirming not position 2)
So R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, position 5 is E, so R could be 1, 3, or 4.

For S:
- In AROSE: S in position 4 (feedback S(-) - not position 4)
- In TRIES: S in position 5 (feedback S(-) - not position 5)
So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""PRESS"":
- P new letter
- R in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2)
So that's invalid.

How about ""SPEER"":
- S in position 1
- P new letter
- E in position 5 (correct)
- E repeated but we already know E is in position 5
- R in position 4

This seems good:
- Tests S in position 1
- Tests R in position 4
- Introduces P
- Keeps E in correct position

From all the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, T, I, P, C.
2. Letters KNOWN to be in the word and their exact positions:
   - S is fixed in position 1 (✓ in both SPEER and SCREE).
   - R is fixed in position 3 (✓ in SCREE).
   - E is fixed in position 5 (✓ in TRIES, SPEER, SCREE).
3. So the secret word currently looks like: S _ R _ E

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that:
- Have never been ruled out (not in {A, O, T, I, P, C})
- Are common English consonants.

Available, common consonants not yet tried include: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but remember we already have R and S in the word, so no duplicates unless the word repeats letters).

Possible pairs for positions 2 and 4:
Examples: B and N → S B R N E → SBRNE (not a word)
          F and N → S F R N E → SFRNE (not a word)
          H and N → S H R N E → SHRNE (not a word)
          L and D → S L R D E → SLRDE (not a word)
          H and D → S H R D E → SHRDE (not a word)

          B and M → S B R M E → SBRM E (not a word)
          G and N → S G R N E → SGRNE (not a word)

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words that are S _ R _ E:

- S H R E E → SHREE (valid variant spelling) – but E is already fixed in 5 and we don't have a second E confirmed.
- S K R E W → but W is position 4, and we need to check if W is allowed (not ruled out)
- S K R E W → SKREW (slang, not standard)
- S P R E E → but P is ruled out
- S M R E K → no
- S M R E G → no
- S H R E K → SHREK (the ogre name, proper noun)
- S H R E D → SHRED (valid word)
- S H R E D → positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=R, 4=D, 5=E → matches S _ R _ E.

So SHRED is a valid candidate that fits all constraints:
- S, H, R, D, E
- S in 1 (OK)
- R in 3 (OK)
- E in 5 (OK)
- H in 2 and D in 4 are new letters not yet ruled out.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,shrew,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers many frequently used letters in English. This will help me quickly eliminate or confirm several letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains: R, S, E (each at least once).
- Does NOT contain: A, O.
- R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Next I want a guess that:
1. Keeps the known letters R, S, E on the board (so I can learn their correct slots).
2. Introduces new, common letters to maximize information.
3. Uses positions not yet ruled out for each of R, S, E.

A balanced choice is “TRIES”.
- T, I – new letters, common in 5-letter words.
- R, I, E, S – all letters whose positions we still need to test.
- Positions:
  – R placed in slot 2 (where we already know it’s NOT correct, but this helps confirm).
  – E placed in slot 5 (where we know it’s NOT correct, but again helps confirm).
  – S placed in slot 4 (where we know it’s NOT correct).
  – T placed in slot 1.
  – I placed in slot 3.

This pattern should help narrow down the exact placement of R, S, E while checking T and I.

<guess>TRIES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we know after the two guesses:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I.

Letters that we know ARE in the word and their statuses:
- R: in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- S: in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- E: in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (because E(✓) in TRIES).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E

And it must contain:
- R somewhere in positions 1, 4 (since not 2 or 3)
- S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3 (since not 4 or 5)

We need a new guess that:
1. Places E in position 5 again (since we know it's correct there)
2. Tests possible positions for R and S
3. Introduces new common consonants

Looking at possible positions:
- If R is in position 4: _ _ _ R E
- Then S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3

Let's try ""SURER"":
- S in position 1
- U new letter
- R in position 3 (but we know R can't be in position 3 from TRIES feedback) - wait no, in TRIES R was in position 2, so position 3 is still possible for R.

Wait, let me re-examine R placement:
- In AROSE: R was in position 2 (feedback: R(-) - so not position 2)
- In TRIES: R was in position 2 again (feedback: R(-) - confirming not position 2)
So R cannot be in position 2, but could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, position 5 is E, so R could be 1, 3, or 4.

For S:
- In AROSE: S in position 4 (feedback S(-) - not position 4)
- In TRIES: S in position 5 (feedback S(-) - not position 5)
So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let's try ""PRESS"":
- P new letter
- R in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2)
So that's invalid.

How about ""SPEER"":
- S in position 1
- P new letter
- E in position 5 (correct)
- E repeated but we already know E is in position 5
- R in position 4

This seems good:
- Tests S in position 1
- Tests R in position 4
- Introduces P
- Keeps E in correct position

Guess 3: SPEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update the deductions with the new feedback from SPEER:

Known facts about the secret word (length = 5):

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, T, I, P.  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed at least once):
   - S — now known to be in position 1 (✓ in SPEER)
   - E — now known to be in position 5 (✓ in previous TRIES and confirmed again here)
3. Additional positional constraints:
   - R — must appear somewhere (present from AROSE and TRIES), but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (because:  
     – in SPEER it was in position 5 and got “-” (wrong place),  
     – in TRIES it was in position 2 and got “-”,  
     – in AROSE it was in position 2 and got “-”).  
     Therefore R must be in position 1, but position 1 is already S, so R cannot be there either.  
     This is a contradiction: R must exist in the word but cannot fit in any position.  
   Wait, let me double-check:

   - R in AROSE (position 2) → “-” → not position 2
   - R in TRIES (position 2) → “-” → again not position 2
   - R in SPEER (position 5) → “-” → not position 5
   - R has never been tried in positions 1, 3, 4 yet.

   So actually R could still be in 1, 3, or 4.

   But S is confirmed in position 1, so R cannot be in position 1.

   Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4.

4. E is locked into position 5.

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ _ E  
with R required in position 3 or 4.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with S
- ends with E
- contains R in position 3 or 4
- does not contain any of A, O, T, I, P

Simple candidates:
- S R _ _ E
- S _ R _ E

Common words:
– S R A K E → contains A (forbidden)
– S R I K E → contains I (forbidden)
– S R O K E → contains O (forbidden)
– S T R E E → contains T (forbidden)
– S P R E E → contains P (forbidden)

How about S C R E E? C is allowed, R in position 3.  
But SCREE is a valid 5-letter word.

Another: S C R A E → invalid (A).  
S W R E E → SWREE not a word.  
S H R E E → not a common word.  
S C R E E seems the only valid one quickly.

Let me verify: yes, “SCREE” is a recognized English word meaning a mass of loose stones (geology term).

So I’ll guess “SCREE” which places R in position 3.

   - R is fixed in position 3 (✓ in SCREE).
   - E is fixed in position 5 (✓ in TRIES, SPEER, SCREE).
3. So the secret word currently looks like: S _ R _ E

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that:
- Have never been ruled out (not in {A, O, T, I, P, C})
- Are common English consonants.

Available, common consonants not yet tried include: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but remember we already have R and S in the word, so no duplicates unless the word repeats letters).

Possible pairs for positions 2 and 4:
Examples: B and N → S B R N E → SBRNE (not a word)
          F and N → S F R N E → SFRNE (not a word)
          H and N → S H R N E → SHRNE (not a word)
          L and D → S L R D E → SLRDE (not a word)
          H and D → S H R D E → SHRDE (not a word)

          B and M → S B R M E → SBRM E (not a word)
          G and N → S G R N E → SGRNE (not a word)

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words that are S _ R _ E:

- S H R E E → SHREE (valid variant spelling) – but E is already fixed in 5 and we don't have a second E confirmed.
- S K R E W → but W is position 4, and we need to check if W is allowed (not ruled out)
- S K R E W → SKREW (slang, not standard)
- S P R E E → but P is ruled out
- S M R E K → no
- S M R E G → no
- S H R E K → SHREK (the ogre name, proper noun)
- S H R E D → SHRED (valid word)
- S H R E D → positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=R, 4=D, 5=E → matches S _ R _ E.

So SHRED is a valid candidate that fits all constraints:
- S, H, R, D, E
- S in 1 (OK)
- R in 3 (OK)
- E in 5 (OK)
- H in 2 and D in 4 are new letters not yet ruled out.

After Guess 5 (SHRED) we received:

S(✓) H(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)

This confirms all these letters are in their exact spots except D (position 4), so:

- S is locked in position 1  
- H is locked in position 2  
- R is locked in position 3  
- E is locked in position 5  
- Position 4 must be a letter that is NOT D and also not any previously ruled-out letters: {A, O, T, I, P, C, D}

That leaves common consonants such as B, F, G, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word of the form S H R _ E.

Real English words fitting that pattern:

SHRUB, SHRUG, SHRUM, SHRUN, SHRVE (not a word), etc.

The most common dictionary words are SHRUB and SHRUG.  Between them, SHRUG uses G, a letter not yet tested, and is more common than SHRUB in typical word lists, so I’ll guess SHRUG.
