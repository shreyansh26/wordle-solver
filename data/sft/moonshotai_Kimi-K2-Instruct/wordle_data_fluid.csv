For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage across the alphabet. The goal is to maximize information gain by using letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I want to avoid using the same letter twice to get more information. 

A great starting word would be ""AROSE"" because:
- Uses 5 unique common letters
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- Covers many possibilities for future guesses
- Is a valid English word

This should give good feedback on 5 very frequent letters and help narrow down the possibilities effectively.

All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) have been marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

A 5-letter word that uses five fresh, frequent letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L). This gives coverage of a new vowel (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L) while being a valid English word.

So far we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E completely.

2. until → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(-)  
   - I is correct in position 4.  
   - U and L exist in the word but are in wrong positions.  
   - N and T are not in the word.

Therefore, the word pattern is: _ _ _ I _

Letters still possible: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus B, L, U (but U and L already confirmed present). We must place U and L somewhere else, and I is locked at 4.

Since L came back “-”, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Since U came back “-”, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, but not 4 (already I).

We need three more letters from the remaining pool. To test useful consonants, a good next word would be “FLICK”:

- Uses F, L, C, K (all still possible).  
- Places L in position 2 → if it’s correct we’ll see ✓; if it’s still “-” we know L is in 1, 3, or 5.  
- Uses C and K to test new consonants.  
- Ends with CK – common English ending, still valid.

This maximizes information gain while respecting confirmed letters/positions.

Let’s condense the clues so far.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, C, K, plus the letters already ruled out by “x” in earlier guesses.

Letters we know ARE in the word, just not where they first appeared:  
U, L, plus the letter I (which is confirmed in position 4).

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 4 = I (✓)
- F is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is correct in position 2 (✓)

Therefore we already have:
F L _ I _

We still need two more letters for positions 3 and 5.  
From the remaining unused common letters that have not been ruled out, decent candidates are D, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y.  
We also still need to place the letter U somewhere in the word (it was marked “-” earlier).

Since U was marked “-”, it must appear in the word but cannot be in position 1 (F) or position 2 (L) or position 4 (I).  
Thus U must be in position 3 or 5.

A valid 5-letter word that fits F L _ I _ while placing U in position 3 is “FLUID”.

- F and L are already locked at 1 and 2 (matches ✓).  
- U placed in position 3 satisfies the “-” clue from earlier.  
- D is a common consonant that has not been ruled out.  

“FLUID” is a valid English word and respects every clue so far.
