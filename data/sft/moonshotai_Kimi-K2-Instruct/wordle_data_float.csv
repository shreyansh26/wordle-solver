For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Popular starting words like ""ADIEU"", ""AUDIO"", or ""ARISE"" follow this strategy. ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a strong chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""ARISE"" seems optimal for the first guess as it covers more vowels.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- definitely has an A somewhere (but not in the 1st position).
- definitely does NOT have R, I, S, E.
- still unknown: letters T, N, L, O, U, C, D, M, etc.

Since A cannot be in the 1st position, it could be in positions 2-5.  
I want a new guess that:
1. moves A to a different position,
2. introduces other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet,
3. avoids R, I, S, E entirely.

Good candidate starting words that fit: ""ADOPT"", ""ABOUT"", ""ALONE"", ""TOAST"", ""FLOAT"", etc.  
""ABOUT"" is attractive because it places A in position 2, uses common letters B, O, U, T, and gives information on O, U, T.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – ARISE  
A(-)  : A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
R, I, S, E all (x) → these four letters are absent.  

Round 2 – ABOUT  
A(-)  : A is still not in position 1 (consistent).  
B(x)  : B is NOT in the word.  
O(✓)  : O is in the word AND in position 3.  
U(x)  : U is NOT in the word.  
T(✓)  : T is in the word AND in position 5.

Current certainties:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, U.  
- Letters definitely in the word: A, O, T.  
  – O is locked in position 3.  
  – T is locked in position 5.  
- A must appear somewhere among positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  (But positions 3 and 5 are already taken by O and T, so A can only be in 2 or 4.)

Word skeleton so far: _ _ O _ T with A in either position 2 or 4.

Possible letter set for remaining blanks: any of the remaining alphabet except the six ruled-out letters.

Good consonants still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need one consonant for position 1 and either one more consonant (if A is in position 4) or two consonants (if A is in position 2).

Let’s try placing A in position 4 first, because that leaves fewer unknowns (only position 1 and 2).  So the pattern is: _ A O _ T, but position 4 would be A, so pattern becomes _ A O A T.  However, that would repeat A, which is allowed but less likely in Wordle (though possible).  A more promising pattern is _ _ O A T (A in position 4).

Remaining letters needed: positions 1 and 2.  Common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P.

Let’s try “FLOAT”:  
F, L, O, A, T → checks against all rules:
- contains only allowed letters (none of R,I,S,E,B,U).  
- O and T are in correct positions 3 and 5.  
- A is in position 4 (different from previous positions).  
- F and L haven’t been tested yet.

This guess will give information on F and L positions while confirming A in 4.
