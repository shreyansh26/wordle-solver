This is the first guess, so there's no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by testing common letters and positions. 

A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters to quickly narrow down the alphabet.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Include vowels and common consonants.

Popular starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, etc. Among these, CRANE is a strong choice because:
- C, R, N are common consonants.
- A and E are common vowels.
- No repeated letters.
- Covers a good spread of the alphabet.

Thus, CRANE seems optimal for the first guess.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked with ‘x’, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we need a word made only from the remaining letters of the alphabet, while still trying to cover as many common remaining letters as possible in the new guess.

Remaining common letters include (but are not limited to): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

A strong second guess should:
- avoid any of C, R, A, N, E.
- use five distinct letters to maximize information.
- include several high-frequency consonants and at least one vowel that is still possible.

A well-regarded candidate is “SLOTH”:
- Letters: S, L, O, T, H – none of which are in {C, R, A, N, E}.
- It has a common vowel (O) and four different consonants.
- All letters are different, maximizing coverage.

From the feedback so far we know:

- C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H, B, P are all absent (x).
- Word must contain U and Y.
- M is present but **not** in the 3rd position (because it got a dash “-” instead of a tick “✓”).

Letters still left to try (that haven’t been ruled out):  
U, Y, plus the remaining letters D, F, G, I, K, V, W, Z, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Uses U somewhere (exact position unknown).
2. Uses Y somewhere (exact position unknown).
3. Uses M in any position **except** the 3rd.
4. Uses only letters that have **not** been eliminated.

Scanning common five-letter words satisfying these constraints, one good candidate is “MUDDY”:
- M (allowed anywhere but 3rd; here it’s 1st)  
- U (must appear; here it’s 2nd)  
- D, D, Y – all still allowed letters.  
- Y is included (4th position).

This tests two new consonants (D) and keeps M and U in play while satisfying the constraints.
