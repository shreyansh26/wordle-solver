For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify useful information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these.

After considering some options, I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This word uses 5 different common letters and should give good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

We now know:

- R is in the correct position (position 2)
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3
- E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5
- A and S are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _ with O and E appearing somewhere, but not in the positions we tried.

Since O is not in position 3, it could be in 1, 4, or 5.
Since E is not in position 5, it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

We also know A and S are not in the word, so we can eliminate words containing those letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words that have R in position 2, and contain O and E, but not A or S.

Some possibilities:
- CROME (but uses M which is less common)
- DROVE (uses D and V, but V is less common)
- BROKE (B, K aren't super common but this seems decent)
- GROPE (P is less common)
- TROPE (P is less common)
- PROBE (P is less common)
- CRORE (double R, might not be valid)
- DROKE (not sure if valid)
- GROKE (not a common word)

""GROPE"" seems like a decent choice, but let me think of others. ""BROKE"" is a common word that fits all constraints:
- B isn't used yet
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - but wait, we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback. So BROKE is invalid.

Next option: ""DROVE""
- D isn't used yet
- R in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - again, position 3 is invalid for O
- V is present, E is in position 5 - but we know E isn't in position 5

So we need O and E in other positions. Let me rethink:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4
- R is fixed in position 2

Let's try ""ORDER"":
- O in position 1
- R in position 2
- D in position 3
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

This uses O, R, E in valid positions, and introduces D which is common. The double R might be a concern though.

Another option: ""TOWER""
- T in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROGER"":
- R in 1 - but must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROPER"":
- R in 1 - invalid.

""CORER"":
- R in 2 (✓)
- O in 3 - invalid (O can't be in 3)
- E in 4 (✓)
- C in 1
- R in 5

But O in 3 is invalid per feedback.

""FOREC"" - not a word.

""WORSE"" - but S is invalid.

""GORED"":
- G in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""BORED"":
- B in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""CORED"":
- C in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

Let me systematically list possibilities:
Pattern: _ R _ _ _
Positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4

Possible combinations:
1. O in 1, E in 3: O R E _ _
   Possible words: ORECT (not common), ORENT (not a word), OREND (not a word)

2. O in 1, E in 4: O R _ E _
   Possible words: ORBED, ORBED, ORFEE (not common), ORCHE (not a word)

3. O in 4, E in 1: E R _ O _
   Possible words: ERGOT (valid), ERODE (but E is in 1, but we have E in 3,4,5? Wait no, E can be 1,3,4)
   Actually for E R _ O _, E is in 1, which is allowed.

4. O in 4, E in 3: _ R E O _
   Possible words: GREOT (not a word), PREON (not common), DREON (not a word)

5. O in 5, E in 1: E R _ _ O
   Possible words: ERGOS (invalid, S not allowed), ERGOT (but T is last, O is 5), but we need O in 5 which is allowed, E in 1 which is allowed: ERGOT

6. O in 5, E in 3: _ R E _ O
   Possible words: GRENO (not a word), PRENO (not a word)

From these, ""ERGOT"" seems like the best option - it's a valid word meaning a type of fungus, follows all constraints:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (required)
- G in 3
- O in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5

This should help determine the positions of O and E while introducing new letters G and T.
</think>

Based on the feedback that R is in position 2, while O and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, and A/S are not in the word, I'll try ""ERGOT"". This places E in position 1 (allowed), O in position 4 (allowed), and introduces new letters G and T.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these.

After considering some options, I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This word uses 5 different common letters and should give good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- R is in the correct position (position 2)
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3
- E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5
- A and S are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _ with O and E appearing somewhere, but not in the positions we tried.

Since O is not in position 3, it could be in 1, 4, or 5.
Since E is not in position 5, it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

We also know A and S are not in the word, so we can eliminate words containing those letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words that have R in position 2, and contain O and E, but not A or S.

Some possibilities:
- CROME (but uses M which is less common)
- DROVE (uses D and V, but V is less common)
- BROKE (B, K aren't super common but this seems decent)
- GROPE (P is less common)
- TROPE (P is less common)
- PROBE (P is less common)
- CRORE (double R, might not be valid)
- DROKE (not sure if valid)
- GROKE (not a common word)

""GROPE"" seems like a decent choice, but let me think of others. ""BROKE"" is a common word that fits all constraints:
- B isn't used yet
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - but wait, we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback. So BROKE is invalid.

Next option: ""DROVE""
- D isn't used yet
- R in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - again, position 3 is invalid for O
- V is present, E is in position 5 - but we know E isn't in position 5

So we need O and E in other positions. Let me rethink:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4
- R is fixed in position 2

Let's try ""ORDER"":
- O in position 1
- R in position 2
- D in position 3
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

This uses O, R, E in valid positions, and introduces D which is common. The double R might be a concern though.

Another option: ""TOWER""
- T in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROGER"":
- R in 1 - but must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROPER"":
- R in 1 - invalid.

""CORER"":
- R in 2 (✓)
- O in 3 - invalid (O can't be in 3)
- E in 4 (✓)
- C in 1
- R in 5

But O in 3 is invalid per feedback.

""FOREC"" - not a word.

""WORSE"" - but S is invalid.

""GORED"":
- G in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""BORED"":
- B in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""CORED"":
- C in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

Let me systematically list possibilities:
Pattern: _ R _ _ _
Positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4

Possible combinations:
1. O in 1, E in 3: O R E _ _
   Possible words: ORECT (not common), ORENT (not a word), OREND (not a word)

2. O in 1, E in 4: O R _ E _
   Possible words: ORBED, ORBED, ORFEE (not common), ORCHE (not a word)

3. O in 4, E in 1: E R _ O _
   Possible words: ERGOT (valid), ERODE (but E is in 1, but we have E in 3,4,5? Wait no, E can be 1,3,4)
   Actually for E R _ O _, E is in 1, which is allowed.

4. O in 4, E in 3: _ R E O _
   Possible words: GREOT (not a word), PREON (not common), DREON (not a word)

5. O in 5, E in 1: E R _ _ O
   Possible words: ERGOS (invalid, S not allowed), ERGOT (but T is last, O is 5), but we need O in 5 which is allowed, E in 1 which is allowed: ERGOT

6. O in 5, E in 3: _ R E _ O
   Possible words: GRENO (not a word), PRENO (not a word)

From these, ""ERGOT"" seems like the best option - it's a valid word meaning a type of fungus, follows all constraints:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (required)
- G in 3
- O in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5

This should help determine the positions of O and E while introducing new letters G and T.Based on the feedback that R is in position 2, while O and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, and A/S are not in the word, I'll try ""ERGOT"". This places E in position 1 (allowed), O in position 4 (allowed), and introduces new letters G and T.

3. Letters we know are *not* in the word: A, S, G, T.

4. Therefore E must appear in position 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
   O must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2, 4).

Let’s combine these:

Possible positions:

We also need three *new* letters (since we have R, O, E and we must avoid A, S, G, T).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify useful information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these.

After considering some options, I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This word uses 5 different common letters and should give good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- R is in the correct position (position 2)
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3
- E is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5
- A and S are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _ with O and E appearing somewhere, but not in the positions we tried.

Since O is not in position 3, it could be in 1, 4, or 5.
Since E is not in position 5, it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

We also know A and S are not in the word, so we can eliminate words containing those letters.

Let's think of common 5-letter words that have R in position 2, and contain O and E, but not A or S.

Some possibilities:
- CROME (but uses M which is less common)
- DROVE (uses D and V, but V is less common)
- BROKE (B, K aren't super common but this seems decent)
- GROPE (P is less common)
- TROPE (P is less common)
- PROBE (P is less common)
- CRORE (double R, might not be valid)
- DROKE (not sure if valid)
- GROKE (not a common word)

""GROPE"" seems like a decent choice, but let me think of others. ""BROKE"" is a common word that fits all constraints:
- B isn't used yet
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - but wait, we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback. So BROKE is invalid.

Next option: ""DROVE""
- D isn't used yet
- R in position 2 (✓)
- O is in position 3 - again, position 3 is invalid for O
- V is present, E is in position 5 - but we know E isn't in position 5

So we need O and E in other positions. Let me rethink:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4
- R is fixed in position 2

Let's try ""ORDER"":
- O in position 1
- R in position 2
- D in position 3
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

This uses O, R, E in valid positions, and introduces D which is common. The double R might be a concern though.

Another option: ""TOWER""
- T in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROGER"":
- R in 1 - but must be in 2, so invalid.

""ROPER"":
- R in 1 - invalid.

""CORER"":
- R in 2 (✓)
- O in 3 - invalid (O can't be in 3)
- E in 4 (✓)
- C in 1
- R in 5

But O in 3 is invalid per feedback.

""FOREC"" - not a word.

""WORSE"" - but S is invalid.

""GORED"":
- G in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""BORED"":
- B in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

""CORED"":
- C in 1
- O in 2 - but R must be in 2, so invalid.

Let me systematically list possibilities:
Pattern: _ R _ _ _
Positions:
- O can be 1, 4, or 5
- E can be 1, 3, or 4

Possible combinations:
1. O in 1, E in 3: O R E _ _
   Possible words: ORECT (not common), ORENT (not a word), OREND (not a word)

2. O in 1, E in 4: O R _ E _
   Possible words: ORBED, ORBED, ORFEE (not common), ORCHE (not a word)

3. O in 4, E in 1: E R _ O _
   Possible words: ERGOT (valid), ERODE (but E is in 1, but we have E in 3,4,5? Wait no, E can be 1,3,4)
   Actually for E R _ O _, E is in 1, which is allowed.

4. O in 4, E in 3: _ R E O _
   Possible words: GREOT (not a word), PREON (not common), DREON (not a word)

5. O in 5, E in 1: E R _ _ O
   Possible words: ERGOS (invalid, S not allowed), ERGOT (but T is last, O is 5), but we need O in 5 which is allowed, E in 1 which is allowed: ERGOT

6. O in 5, E in 3: _ R E _ O
   Possible words: GRENO (not a word), PRENO (not a word)

From these, ""ERGOT"" seems like the best option - it's a valid word meaning a type of fungus, follows all constraints:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (required)
- G in 3
- O in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5

This should help determine the positions of O and E while introducing new letters G and T.Based on the feedback that R is in position 2, while O and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, and A/S are not in the word, I'll try ""ERGOT"". This places E in position 1 (allowed), O in position 4 (allowed), and introduces new letters G and T.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:

   - O is in the word but not in position 4 (from ergot feedback: O(-)).

3. Letters we know are *not* in the word: A, S, G, T.

4. Therefore E must appear in position 3, 4, or 5 (it can’t be 1 or 2).  
   O must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (it can’t be 2, 4).

Let’s combine these:

Possible positions:
- O can be 1, 3, or 5
- E can be 3, 4, or 5

We also need three *new* letters (since we have R, O, E and we must avoid A, S, G, T).

Let’s try O in position 1 and E in position 3 → O R E _ _  
Need two more letters, avoiding A S G T and any repeats.  
Possible word: O R E A D – but A is out.  
O R E C K – valid.

Check O R E _ _ :
ORECK is a common-enough word.

Let’s check it fits all constraints:
- O at 1 – allowed (not excluded).
- R at 2 – required.
- E at 3 – allowed.
- C and K are fresh letters.
- No forbidden letters A S G T appear.

That seems good.

Current state:

Pattern: _ R _ _ _ (R locked in position 2)

Known letters:
- R ✓ position 2
- O ✓ somewhere (not 1, 4 from feedback)
- E ✓ somewhere (not 1, 3, 5 from feedback)

Latest feedback:
drone → D(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

So:
- D, N now eliminated
- O is confirmed in the word and must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1, 4 are out)
- E is confirmed in the word and must be in position 4 (only remaining option)

Therefore the skeleton is:
_ R _ E _

With O in position 3 or 5.

Option 1: O in position 3 → _ R O E _
Option 2: O in position 5 → _ R _ E O

We need two fresh letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 1 and 3) from remaining unused letters.

Letters already used or ruled out:
A, S, G, T, C, K, D, N

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Option 1: _ R O E _
Need first letter and last letter from remaining set.
Example: F R O E M → ""froem"" (invalid)
         B R O E M → ""broem"" (invalid)
         P R O E M → ""proem"" (valid, but rare)
         F R O E Y → ""froey"" (invalid)
         B R O E Y → ""broey"" (invalid)

Option 2: _ R _ E O
Need first and third letters from remaining set.
Example: F L E E O → invalid (E repeated)
         P I E T O → invalid (T eliminated)
         F L E S O → invalid (S eliminated)
         F I R E O → invalid (R already used)
         B L O E O → invalid (O repeated)
         F L O E O → invalid (O repeated)

Wait, let's reconsider Option 1 with ""F R O E M"" - actually ""proem"" is a recognized word (a preface or preamble), though rare.

Another clean option is ""F R O E Y"" - but ""froey"" isn't valid.

Looking more carefully:

For Option 1 (_ R O E _):
Valid words:
- BROKE (but O would be position 3, which is allowed, but E is position 4 which is allowed - but we have B as fresh letter)
Wait, BROKE would be:
B R O K E - but K is already eliminated.

- FROZE - but Z is unused, but Z is low frequency

Actually let's list possible valid words:

For _ R O E _:
- PROLE (but PROLE is _ R O L E, we need _ R O E _)
- This isn't working well.

For _ R _ E O:
Looking for words like:
- F R E E O → invalid (E repeated)
- P R A E O → invalid (A eliminated)
- P R E E O → invalid (E repeated)
- B R I E O → invalid (I not eliminated, but ""brieo"" isn't valid)

Actually let's try ""F R O E M"" - ""froem"" isn't valid.

Re-evaluating:

The only valid common word seems to be ""B R O K E"" but K is eliminated.

Looking at _ R O E _ pattern, valid words are scarce. Maybe ""F R O E Y"" isn't valid.

Alternative approach: maybe the word is ""P R O B E"" - but that would require B and O in position 3 (allowed), E in position 5 (but E can't be in 5 from our deductions).

Wait, let me recheck E position restriction:

From all feedback:
- E is not in 1 (ergot)
- E is not in 3 (oreck)
- E is not in 5 (drone showed E is not in 5? Wait no - drone feedback was D(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which shows E is in the word and in correct position (position 5)! This contradicts my earlier deduction.

Let me re-examine:

From drone feedback:
D(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is correct in position 2 ✓
- O is in the word and in position 3 ✓
- E is in the word and in position 5 ✓

So the pattern is now: _ R O _ E

We just need to find the first and fourth letters, avoiding eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: A, S, G, T, C, K, D, N

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for words matching: [B,F,H,L,M,P,U,V,W,Y] R O [B,F,H,L,M,P,U,V,W,Y] E

Possible valid words:
- BROKE - but K is eliminated
- FRORE - but R is repeated
- GROVE - but G is eliminated
- PROBE - P and B are fresh
- WROTE - but T is eliminated
- CRORE - but C is eliminated

""PROBE"" fits:
P R O B E
- P is fresh
- B is fresh
- R, O, E are confirmed in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively
</think>

The latest feedback shows:
- R is locked at position 2
- O is confirmed at position 3
- E is confirmed at position 5

So the pattern is _ R O _ E with positions 1 and 4 still to fill, avoiding all eliminated letters (A,S,G,T,C,K,D,N). The most common valid word that fits is:

So:
- D, N now eliminated
- O is confirmed in the word and must be in position 3 or 5 (since 1, 4 are out)

Therefore the skeleton is:

With O in position 3 or 5.

Option 1: O in position 3 → _ R O E _

We need two fresh letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 1 and 3) from remaining unused letters.

- E is not in 3 (oreck)
- E is not in 5 (drone showed E is not in 5? Wait no - drone feedback was D(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which shows E is in the word and in correct position (position 5)! This contradicts my earlier deduction.
