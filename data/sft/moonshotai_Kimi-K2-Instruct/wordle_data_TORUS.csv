For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information about common letters and their positions in the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Some excellent starting words include: AROSE, IRATE, CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU. These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common consonants and both of the most common vowels in English.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains an R somewhere, but NOT in position 2
- It does NOT contain C, A, N, or E

Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants left include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Since R must be somewhere, I'll try to place it in a different spot. A good strategy is to test common consonant/vowel patterns. I'll try a word that includes:
- R in a new position
- New consonants like D, O, S, T
- A likely vowel (O or I)

Good candidates: DROID, SPORT, DRIFT, GROIN, etc.

Now we know:

- Must NOT include: C, A, N, E, D, I.
- Must NOT include: O (from Guess 2 feedback O(-) means O is in the word but in the wrong position – yet all positions are already marked wrong, so O can’t actually be in the word at all; the dash here must indicate “exists, but not here,” but since every slot has been marked wrong for O, this implies O is NOT in the word either).

So the confirmed letters to include:
- R (not in position 2 or 3)

Letters definitely absent:
C, A, N, E, D, I, O

Remaining vowels: U, Y

I’ll test a word with three new popular consonants plus the remaining vowel U. A good example is “FURLS” (F, U, R, L, S). This places R in position 3 again, but that contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the wrong position in DROID (position 2). Actually, in DROID, R is in position 2, so R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, in CRANE, R is in position 2, and it was marked “-” (wrong position), so R cannot be in position 2.

Better to test R in position 5 this time. Let’s pick “HURRY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have U as the only clear vowel left. Actually, we have U and possibly Y. Let’s try a different word that uses R in position 5 and tests U as the vowel. “THUMP” has no R. “BURST” has R in position 4 and tests U, B, S, T. That seems good.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

2. DROID → D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ R is present, but not in position 2  
   ⇒ D, I are absent.  
   Also: O was marked “-”, but every possible position for O (3) was wrong, so O is actually absent.

3. BURST → B(x) U(-) R(✓) S(-) T(-)  
   ⇒ R is in position 3 (✓)  
   ⇒ U, S, T are present but in wrong positions  
   ⇒ B is absent.

Letters we now know:
- Exact: _ _ R _ _
- Required: {R, U, S, T} (R already locked)
- Forbidden: {C, A, N, E, D, I, O, B}

Remaining candidate letters (besides those required):
- vowels: Y (only one left)
- consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We have positions 1, 2, 4, 5 to fill, with:
- position 3 = R
- must use U, S, T somewhere, but not in the positions they occupied in BURST:
    – U was in position 2 → must move
    – S was in position 4 → must move
    – T was in position 5 → must move

So U, S, T must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, avoiding their old spots.

Some valid distributions:
- position 1: U, S, T, or new consonant
- position 2: any except U
- position 4: any except S
- position 5: any except T

A quick systematic scan of common words fitting _ U/R/S/T yields:
- TRUST → positions: T(1),R(2),U(3)… but R must be 3, so discard.
- STRUT → positions: S(1),T(2),R(3),U(4),T(5)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,TORUS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information about common letters and their positions in the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Some excellent starting words include: AROSE, IRATE, CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU. These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common consonants and both of the most common vowels in English.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains an R somewhere, but NOT in position 2
- It does NOT contain C, A, N, or E

Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants left include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Since R must be somewhere, I'll try to place it in a different spot. A good strategy is to test common consonant/vowel patterns. I'll try a word that includes:
- R in a new position
- New consonants like D, O, S, T
- A likely vowel (O or I)

Good candidates: DROID, SPORT, DRIFT, GROIN, etc.

I'll go with ""DROID"" because:
- R is in position 2 (new position from CRANE)
- O is a common vowel not yet tested
- D is common and not yet used
- I is another common vowel
- Another D to maximize information

<guess>DROID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DROID -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:
- Must include the letter R, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- Must NOT include: C, A, N, E, D, I.
- Must NOT include: O (from Guess 2 feedback O(-) means O is in the word but in the wrong position – yet all positions are already marked wrong, so O can’t actually be in the word at all; the dash here must indicate “exists, but not here,” but since every slot has been marked wrong for O, this implies O is NOT in the word either).

So the confirmed letters to include:
- R (not in position 2 or 3)

Letters definitely absent:
C, A, N, E, D, I, O

Remaining vowels: U, Y  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z

I’m looking for a 5-letter word that uses only those remaining letters and places R somewhere in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible structures:
- R _ _ _ _
- _ _ _ R _
- _ _ _ _ R

I’ll test a word with three new popular consonants plus the remaining vowel U. A good example is “FURLS” (F, U, R, L, S). This places R in position 3 again, but that contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the wrong position in DROID (position 2). Actually, in DROID, R is in position 2, so R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, in CRANE, R is in position 2, and it was marked “-” (wrong position), so R cannot be in position 2. In DROID, R is in position 2 again, and again marked “-”, reinforcing that R is not in position 2. So in summary, R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. 

Better to test R in position 5 this time. Let’s pick “HURRY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have U as the only clear vowel left. Actually, we have U and possibly Y. Let’s try a different word that uses R in position 5 and tests U as the vowel. “THUMP” has no R. “BURST” has R in position 4 and tests U, B, S, T. That seems good. All letters are allowed, and R is in position 4 this time.

So my choice: BURST

- position 2: any except U

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   R is present but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.

2. DROID → D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)  
   R still not in position 2; D, I absent; O absent (all positions for O marked wrong).

3. BURST → B(x) U(-) R(✓) S(-) T(-)  
   R is locked in position 3 (✓); U, S, T are in the word but all in wrong positions; B absent.

4. STRUT → S(-) T(-) R(✓) U(✓) T(-)  
   Confirms R in 3, U in 4; shows S and the first T are in wrong positions.  
   The final T is now marked (-), meaning T is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Exact pattern: _ _ R U _
- Letters still needed: S and T must each appear once more, but cannot occupy positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 respectively because:
    – S was in position 1 in STRUT → must move.
    – T was in position 2 in STRUT → must move.
    – T was in position 5 in BURST → must move.
- Allowed letters (besides what’s fixed): only consonants not yet ruled out that can fill positions 1 and 2.  
  Forbidden global set so far: C, A, N, E, D, I, O, B.  
  Allowed consonants left: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions to fill:
- Position 1: any allowed consonant
- Position 2: any allowed consonant
- Position 5: must be either S or T, but:
    – S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (already seen there), so position 5 is legal for S.
    – T cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (already seen there), so position 5 is **not** legal for T.

Hence:
- Position 5 must be S.
- Positions 1 and 2 must be filled by two distinct consonants from the allowed set, and they must include T exactly once (because we still need one more T).

So the pattern is: [allowed consonant including T] [allowed consonant including T] R U S, with T appearing exactly once in positions 1 or 2.

Candidates:
- T _ R U S: THRUS? Not a word.  
- F T R U S → FTRUS not valid.  
- H T R U S → HTRUS not valid.  
- P T R U S → PTRUS not valid.  
- M T R U S → MTRUS not valid.  
- L T R U S → LTRUS not valid.  
- V T R U S → VTRUS not valid.

Wait, we have to choose two *different* consonants for positions 1 and 2, one of which is T.  
Let’s list valid two-consonant starts using T once and another allowed consonant once.

Valid dictionary word fitting _ _ R U S with T in 1 or 2:
- T H R U S → THRUS? Not standard.  
- T R U S _ … but we need _ _ R U S.  
- F T R U S – no.  
- … the only real candidate is THRUS, but that’s not a valid English word.

Realizing the mistake: the only valid 5-letter English word fitting _ _ R U S is “TRUST”, but we already used it and it has T in position 2 (disallowed) and S in position 1 (disallowed).

Therefore, we must reconsider: the pattern is _ _ R U _, and the still-needed letters S and T must each appear once more, but T cannot go in 2 or 5, and S cannot go in 1 or 4.  
That leaves positions 1 and 2 to host T and one other consonant, while S must go in position 5 (only remaining spot).  
But that gives: [T or other] [other or T] R U S.

The only dictionary word that matches is “TRUSS” (T, R, U, S, S), but that uses S twice and we have no evidence S is duplicated.  
Another candidate: “FURRS” – invalid letters.

Realizing we have only one S and one T to place, and we already have R and U fixed, the only remaining possibility is that one of the letters S or T must occupy the only remaining free position (1 or 2) and the other must occupy position 5.  
But position 5 can only take S (T cannot go there), so:

Pattern: [any allowed consonant except T] T R U S → _ T R U S → only “STRUS” which is invalid.  
Pattern: T [any allowed consonant] R U S → T _ R U S → “THRUS” again invalid.

Wait – we have mis-parsed the feedback.  The feedback in STRUT shows:

S(-) T(-) R(✓) U(✓) T(-)  

This means:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- T is in the word but not in position 2
- R is in position 3 ✓
- U is in position 4 ✓
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (but we already know from BURST it’s not in position 5 either)

Hence the T must appear in position 1.

Therefore the only possible word is: T _ R U _ with _ being the letter S (since S must appear and cannot be in positions 1 or 4).  
So the word must be T S R U _ – no valid word.

Realizing we have exhausted possibilities, the correct realization is that the remaining letters S and T must occupy positions 1 and 5 respectively (since T cannot be in 2 or 5, but wait, that’s contradictory).

Re-examining carefully:

We have fixed:
- 3: R
- 4: U

We know:
- S must appear once (from BURST and STRUT) not in positions 1 or 4
- T must appear once (from BURST and STRUT) not in positions 2 or 5

The only positions left are 1, 2, 5.

But:
- S cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2 or 5  
- T cannot be in 2 or 5 → must be in 1  

So the unique arrangement is:
1: T  
2: S  
3: R  
4: U  
5: ?  

But we have only 5 letters, so position 5 cannot exist – this indicates the word is exactly T S R U ? which doesn’t fit 5 letters.

Realizing the only valid dictionary word that fits these constraints is “TRSUT” – not valid.

Stepping back, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “TRUSS” – but that duplicates S, which we have no evidence for.

Finally, the only valid English word fitting all constraints is “TRUSS” – despite the double S, which is the only remaining option.

But “TRUSS” has T in 1 (allowed), R in 3 (fixed), U in 4 (fixed), S in 2 (allowed because S was only banned from 1 and 4), and S in 5 (allowed because S was not banned from 5).  
Wait – S in position 2 was banned?  In STRUT, S was in position 1 and marked (-), so S can be in 2, 3, 4, 5 – but 3 and 4 are taken, so 2 or 5.  
T must be in 1, so the word is T S R U S – “TSRUS” invalid.

Realizing the only valid word is “TRUSS”.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information about common letters and their positions in the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Some excellent starting words include: AROSE, IRATE, CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU. These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common consonants and both of the most common vowels in English.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains an R somewhere, but NOT in position 2
- It does NOT contain C, A, N, or E

Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Common consonants left include B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, etc.

Since R must be somewhere, I'll try to place it in a different spot. A good strategy is to test common consonant/vowel patterns. I'll try a word that includes:
- R in a new position
- New consonants like D, O, S, T
- A likely vowel (O or I)

Good candidates: DROID, SPORT, DRIFT, GROIN, etc.

I'll go with ""DROID"" because:
- R is in position 2 (new position from CRANE)
- O is a common vowel not yet tested
- D is common and not yet used
- I is another common vowel
- Another D to maximize information

<guess>DROID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DROID -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:
- Must include the letter R, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- Must NOT include: C, A, N, E, D, I.
- Must NOT include: O (from Guess 2 feedback O(-) means O is in the word but in the wrong position – yet all positions are already marked wrong, so O can’t actually be in the word at all; the dash here must indicate “exists, but not here,” but since every slot has been marked wrong for O, this implies O is NOT in the word either).

So the confirmed letters to include:
- R (not in position 2 or 3)

Letters definitely absent:
C, A, N, E, D, I, O

Remaining vowels: U, Y  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Z

I’m looking for a 5-letter word that uses only those remaining letters and places R somewhere in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible structures:
- R _ _ _ _
- _ _ _ R _
- _ _ _ _ R

I’ll test a word with three new popular consonants plus the remaining vowel U. A good example is “FURLS” (F, U, R, L, S). This places R in position 3 again, but that contradicts the earlier feedback that R is in the wrong position in DROID (position 2). Actually, in DROID, R is in position 2, so R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, in CRANE, R is in position 2, and it was marked “-” (wrong position), so R cannot be in position 2. In DROID, R is in position 2 again, and again marked “-”, reinforcing that R is not in position 2. So in summary, R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. 

Better to test R in position 5 this time. Let’s pick “HURRY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have U as the only clear vowel left. Actually, we have U and possibly Y. Let’s try a different word that uses R in position 5 and tests U as the vowel. “THUMP” has no R. “BURST” has R in position 4 and tests U, B, S, T. That seems good. All letters are allowed, and R is in position 4 this time.

So my choice: BURST

<guess>BURST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DROID -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: BURST -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) R(✓) S(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ R is present, but not in position 2  
   ⇒ C, A, N, E are absent.

2. DROID → D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ R is present, but not in position 2  
   ⇒ D, I are absent.  
   Also: O was marked “-”, but every possible position for O (3) was wrong, so O is actually absent.

3. BURST → B(x) U(-) R(✓) S(-) T(-)  
   ⇒ R is in position 3 (✓)  
   ⇒ U, S, T are present but in wrong positions  
   ⇒ B is absent.

Letters we now know:
- Exact: _ _ R _ _
- Required: {R, U, S, T} (R already locked)
- Forbidden: {C, A, N, E, D, I, O, B}

Remaining candidate letters (besides those required):
- vowels: Y (only one left)
- consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We have positions 1, 2, 4, 5 to fill, with:
- position 3 = R
- must use U, S, T somewhere, but not in the positions they occupied in BURST:
    – U was in position 2 → must move
    – S was in position 4 → must move
    – T was in position 5 → must move

So U, S, T must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, avoiding their old spots.

Some valid distributions:
- position 1: U, S, T, or new consonant
- position 2: any except U
- position 4: any except S
- position 5: any except T

A quick systematic scan of common words fitting _ U/R/S/T yields:
- TRUST → positions: T(1),R(2),U(3)… but R must be 3, so discard.
- STRUT → positions: S(1),T(2),R(3),U(4),T(5)  
  Check constraints:
  – R is fixed at 3 ✔  
  – U moves from 2→4 ✔  
  – S moves from 4→1 ✔  
  – T moves from 5→2 ✔  
  All letters allowed and constraints satisfied.

STRUT is therefore a legal and informative next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we know after four guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   – R exists, wrong position = not pos 2.

2. DROID → D(x) R(-) O(-) I(x) D(x)
   – R exists, wrong position = not pos 2 (again)  
   – D, I absent  
   – O appeared as “-”, but every possible position is wrong ⇒ O is absent.

3. BURST → B(x) U(-) R(✓) S(-) T(-)
   – R is in position 3 (✓)  
   – U, S, T are all in the word but each in a wrong position:
        U in 2 → must move
        S in 4 → must move
        T in 5 → must move

4. STRUT → S(-) T(-) R(✓) U(✓) T(-)
   – Confirms: R@3, U@4 (both now ✓)  
   – S and T are still in the word but again in wrong positions:
        S in 1 → must move
        T in 2 → must move
        T in 5 → must move

Known fixed letters:
   _ _ R U _

Remaining required letters: S and T (each must appear once and be placed in the two open slots 1, 2, 5).

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, D, I, O, B

So positions 1, 2, 5 must contain S and T in some order, with the remaining slot filled only from the still-allowed consonants {F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, Y}. However, we already have to place S and T, and there are only two free slots (positions 1, 2, 5). Therefore the third slot among those three must not exist, meaning the word must be exactly S and T plus the fixed RU, i.e., a permutation of S, T, R, U plus one more letter—but we have no extra letter required. The only remaining task is to decide where S and T go among positions 1, 2, 5.

Wait—counting shows we actually have **three** open positions (1, 2, 5) but only **two** letters still needed (S, T). That implies one of those positions must be filled with a letter we have not yet tested, yet we have no more required letters. Consequently, the word must be the five letters S, T, R, U plus one **other** letter, but we have no more required letters from feedback. This contradiction can only be resolved by recognizing that the word is S, T, R, U plus one **repeat** of S or T—i.e., either S or T appears twice.

Let’s list the possibilities that fit the mandatory placements:
   – R at 3, U at 4
   – S and T must both appear, and neither can be in the positions already ruled out.

Possible arrangements:
   1 2 3 4 5
   S T R U ?
   S ? R U T
   T ? R U S
   ? S R U T
   ? T R U S
   T S R U ?

Checking each against the forbidden positions:
- S cannot be in 1 (from STRUT feedback)
- T cannot be in 2 or 5 (from BURST and STRUT feedback)

Therefore the only placements left are:
   T S R U _  → position 5 must be T (but T is forbidden at 5) ❌
   S ? R U T  → position 2 must be T (but T is forbidden at 2) ❌
   T ? R U S  → position 2 must be S (allowed) and T at 1 (allowed) ✔
   ? S R U T  → position 1 must be T (allowed) and S at 2 (allowed) ✔
   ? T R U S  → position 2 is T (forbidden) ❌

Thus the two valid patterns are:
   T S R U _  (needs a fifth letter) but position 5 must be T – already used. Contradiction.
   S T R U _  (needs a fifth letter) – but T cannot be at 2. Contradiction.

Wait, we missed re-using a letter. Actually, since S and T are both required and there are three positions (1,2,5) to fill with only two letters, one of them must be duplicated. The only way that works without violating placement bans is:
   S T R U T  – T appears twice, second T is at 5, but T is banned at 5 (from STRUT feedback). ❌
   T S R U S  – S appears twice, second S is at 5 (allowed). ✔
   S S R U T  – S at 1 and 2, but S is banned at 1. ❌
   T T R U S  – T at 1 and 2, but T is banned at 2. ❌

Hence the only remaining candidate is:
   T S R U S  → word = TRUSS

Check constraints:
   R at 3 ✓, U at 4 ✓, S at 2 and 5 (positions 1 and 4 were never banned for S, and 5 is newly allowed because the prior ban was only for T). T at 1 is allowed. All required letters (S, T) appear, none of the forbidden letters are used.

Therefore TRUSS is the unique remaining possibility.
