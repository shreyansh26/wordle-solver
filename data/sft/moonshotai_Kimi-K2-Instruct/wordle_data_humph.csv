Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to start with a word that contains common letters to quickly gather information. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

So far we know:
- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.
- Because these five letters are all excluded, the secret word must be built entirely from the remaining 20 letters.

Common letters not yet tested include R, O, I, N, C, U, D, H, P, G, M, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, J, Q, X. We should pick another word that uses several of the most frequent of these to maximize information gain.

A good second guess should cover several of the remaining high-frequency consonants and vowels. “ROUND” uses:

What we now know:

1. Letters completely ruled out: S,L,A,T,E,R,O,N,D,C  
2. Letters in the word but all four of them are in the **wrong** position: U,H,M,P  
   (since every letter got “-” feedback, none is in its guessed spot).

Therefore the secret word contains:
- U somewhere (but **not** at position 3 or 4)  
- H somewhere (but **not** at position 2)  
- M somewhere (but **not** at position 4)  
- P somewhere (but **not** at position 5)

That leaves the fifth letter as a new consonant or vowel that has not been tested yet.  
The still-available high-frequency letters include: B, F, G, I, K, V, W, Y, etc.

One 5-letter word that uses
- U in a fresh spot  
- H in a fresh spot  
- M in a fresh spot  
- P in a fresh spot  
- and introduces a new consonant

is “WHUMP”:
- W is untested  
- H is now in position 2 (previously was in position 2, but now moved to 2? Oops, 2 is the same spot, so that won’t help. Let’s rethink.)

Better candidate: “MUMPH” is invalid (double M, and P is already in slot 4 again).

Another candidate: “BUMPH” – double M again, plus P still in slot 4.

Instead, let’s pick “GUMPH”:
- G is untested  
- U is now in position 2 (was in 3, then 3, now 2)  
- M is in position 3 (previously 4)  
- P is in position 4 (previously 5)  
- H is in position 5 (previously 2)

This shifts *all* four known letters out of their previous wrong positions, and adds the new letter G.

But “GUMPH” is valid only in British slang. We want a common English word.

Next choice: “PLUMB” – P is already ruled out.

Another valid word: “JUMPY”.
- J is new  
- U in position 2  
- M in position 3  
- P in position 4  
- Y is new  
But P again in 4 (was 5), so P is OK if we shift it left.

However, “JUMPY” would keep P in position 4, same as CHUMP. That’s not ideal.

Let’s try “WHUMP” again but realize H cannot be in position 2. We need H to move to 1,3,4 or 5.

A legal word: “PHUMY” – not valid.

Valid word: “PHUMY” no.

Valid word: “CHIUM” – C is ruled out.

Valid word: “BUMPH” – invalid.

Valid word: “THUMP” – T is ruled out.

Valid word: “WHUMP” – H is in position 2 again (forbidden).

Real valid word: “CHUMP” already used.

Valid word: “CRUMP” – C is out.

Valid word: “FRUMP” – F is untested, R is out.

Valid word: “GRUMP” – G untested, R out.

Valid word: “PLUMB” – P is in 1, L out.

Valid word: “FLUMP” – F untested, L out.

Valid word: “JUMPY” – we already mentioned.

Valid word: “MUHPY” – invalid.

Valid word: “HUMPY” – H in 1 (allowed), U in 2, M in 3, P in 4, Y in 5  
  All four known letters have moved to new positions, and Y is new.

So “HUMPY” seems perfect.

Double-check:
- Letters used: H,U,M,P,Y  
- H was in position 2 (now 1) ✓  
- U was in 3 or 4 (now 2) ✓  
- M was in 4 (now 3) ✓  
- P was in 5 (now 4) ✓  
- Y is new  
- No forbidden letters (S,L,A,T,E,R,O,N,D,C)

Therefore the next guess is HUMPY.
</think>

<guess>HUMPY</guess>",HUMPY,"What we now know:

1. Letters completely ruled out: S,L,A,T,E,R,O,N,D,C  
2. Letters in the word but all four of them are in the **wrong** position: U,H,M,P  
   (since every letter got “-” feedback, none is in its guessed spot).

Therefore the secret word contains:
- U somewhere (but **not** at position 3 or 4)  
- H somewhere (but **not** at position 2)  
- M somewhere (but **not** at position 4)  
- P somewhere (but **not** at position 5)

That leaves the fifth letter as a new consonant or vowel that has not been tested yet.  
The still-available high-frequency letters include: B, F, G, I, K, V, W, Y, etc.

One 5-letter word that uses
- U in a fresh spot  
- H in a fresh spot  
- M in a fresh spot  
- P in a fresh spot  
- and introduces a new consonant

is “WHUMP”:
- W is untested  
- H is now in position 2 (previously was in position 2, but now moved to 2? Oops, 2 is the same spot, so that won’t help. Let’s rethink.)

Better candidate: “MUMPH” is invalid (double M, and P is already in slot 4 again).

Another candidate: “BUMPH” – double M again, plus P still in slot 4.

Instead, let’s pick “GUMPH”:
- G is untested  
- U is now in position 2 (was in 3, then 3, now 2)  
- M is in position 3 (previously 4)  
- P is in position 4 (previously 5)  
- H is in position 5 (previously 2)

This shifts *all* four known letters out of their previous wrong positions, and adds the new letter G.

But “GUMPH” is valid only in British slang. We want a common English word.

Next choice: “PLUMB” – P is already ruled out.

Another valid word: “JUMPY”.
- J is new  
- U in position 2  
- M in position 3  
- P in position 4  
- Y is new  
But P again in 4 (was 5), so P is OK if we shift it left.

However, “JUMPY” would keep P in position 4, same as CHUMP. That’s not ideal.

Let’s try “WHUMP” again but realize H cannot be in position 2. We need H to move to 1,3,4 or 5.

A legal word: “PHUMY” – not valid.

Valid word: “PHUMY” no.

Valid word: “CHIUM” – C is ruled out.

Valid word: “BUMPH” – invalid.

Valid word: “THUMP” – T is ruled out.

Valid word: “WHUMP” – H is in position 2 again (forbidden).

Real valid word: “CHUMP” already used.

Valid word: “CRUMP” – C is out.

Valid word: “FRUMP” – F is untested, R is out.

Valid word: “GRUMP” – G untested, R out.

Valid word: “PLUMB” – P is in 1, L out.

Valid word: “FLUMP” – F untested, L out.

Valid word: “JUMPY” – we already mentioned.

Valid word: “MUHPY” – invalid.

Valid word: “HUMPY” – H in 1 (allowed), U in 2, M in 3, P in 4, Y in 5  
  All four known letters have moved to new positions, and Y is new.

So “HUMPY” seems perfect.

Double-check:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,humph,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us a good spread of consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.
- Because these five letters are all excluded, the secret word must be built entirely from the remaining 20 letters.

Common letters not yet tested include R, O, I, N, C, U, D, H, P, G, M, B, F, Y, K, V, W, Z, J, Q, X. We should pick another word that uses several of the most frequent of these to maximize information gain.

A good second guess should cover several of the remaining high-frequency consonants and vowels. “ROUND” uses:
- R (very frequent)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (very frequent)
- D (common)

None of these letters have been ruled out yet, so it’ll give us new information on five fresh letters.

Since U is somewhere in the word but not last, we should try to place it in a different spot while testing new high-frequency letters. A good third guess should:
1. Move the known U to a new position
2. Introduce several fresh common letters
3. Avoid all excluded letters

Candidate word: CHUMP
- C, H, M, P are all common and not yet tested
- Moves U to position 2 (previously at position 3)
