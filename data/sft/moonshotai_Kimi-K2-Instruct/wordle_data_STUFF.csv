Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. I want to include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Some good starting options include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels but lacks common consonants)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I think STARE is a particularly good first guess because:
1. It covers all five most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T) except O
2. It has both common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R)
3. It allows checking multiple positions for these common letters

Let me go with STARE as the first guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,STUFF,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I want to include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Some good starting options include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels but lacks common consonants)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I think STARE is a particularly good first guess because:
1. It covers all five most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T) except O
2. It has both common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R)
3. It allows checking multiple positions for these common letters

Let me go with STARE as the first guess.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S(✓) → S is correct and in first position
- T(✓) → T is correct and in second position
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word starts with ST
- The remaining letters (A, R, E) are not in the word at all
- We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, or E

We also know the remaining letters must be consonants or vowels (but A and E are ruled out). Common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Common vowels left are I, O, U. 

Let’s look for words that start with ST and avoid A, R, E. Some possibilities:
- STINK (uses I, N, K - none of which are A/R/E)
- STUMP (uses U, M, P - none of which are A/R/E)
- STICK (I, C, K)
- STONY (O, N, Y)
- STOCK (O, C, K)

STINK seems like a strong candidate because it uses common letters (I, N, K) and fits the pattern perfectly.

1. STARE → S(✓) T(✓) A(x) R(x) E(x)
2. STINK → S(✓) T(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)

What we know so far:
- The word definitely starts with “ST”.
- The letters A, R, E, I, N, K are **not** in the word anywhere.

Letters still available (excluding the ruled-out ones):
Consonants: B C D F G H J L M P Q U V W X Y Z  
Vowels: O U

We need three more letters to complete “ST _ _ _” using only letters from the available set.  
We should prioritize common English letters. Let’s consider:
- O and U are the only vowels left.
- Good consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:

- STUDY (U, D, Y) — all letters allowed
- STOIC (contains I, which is ruled out) ❌
- STUFF (U, F, F) — all letters allowed

Current confirmed information:
- Word starts with STU (first three letters fixed).
- Letters already excluded: A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P.

We now need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The letters that remain available (and common) are:
- Vowels: O
- Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (but Q, X, Z are rare, so focus on B, C, F, G, H, L, V, W).

Looking for 5-letter words that start with “STU” and end with any combination of these allowed letters.

Candidate endings:
- B, C, F, G, H, L, O, V, W

Possible words:
- STUBS → uses B and S, but S is already fixed in position 1, so invalid (no repeats).
- STUCK → uses C and K, but K is excluded.
- STUFF → uses F and F, but F is allowed. However, P was excluded, not directly tested for F.
- STUNG → uses N and G, but N is excluded.
- STUCC → invalid (not a word).
- STUBB → invalid.
- STUOH → invalid.
- STUVO → invalid.
- STUWL → invalid.

The most plausible remaining word that fits is STUCC (but that’s not a valid word) or STUFF. Wait, STUF is not 5 letters. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the only common English word starting with STU and avoiding all excluded letters seems to be:
- STOO_? No, O is the only remaining vowel, but we need two letters.

Wait, let me list valid English words starting with STU and check against exclusions:
- STUBS → B is allowed, S is already in position 1 (no issue), second S is new position 5. But B is allowed, S is allowed (not excluded). However, STUBS is 5 letters: S T U B S. All letters except excluded ones: B is allowed, S is allowed. But does it use any excluded letters? No. But we have S in position 1 already, and another S at position 5 is allowed (no restriction on repeats unless letter is excluded, and S is not excluded). But is STUBS a valid word? Yes. But let me check if we have any feedback suggesting S cannot appear again. No such restriction.

But let’s see if we can find a better one.

Another approach: remaining letters to test are fourth and fifth positions. Since M and P were excluded, and we have few vowels left, let’s think of common consonant pairs.

Possible endings:
- B (allowed) + any allowed consonant or O.
- C + K (K excluded), so not.
- F + F (STUFF).
- G + any (STUGS? No).
- H + any (STUHS? No).
- L + any (STULM? No).
- B + O (STUBO? Not a word).
- B + B (STUBB? No).
- L + O (STULO? No).
- B + S (STUBS) — STUBS is a valid word: the plural of stub.

Are there other words?
- STUCC (invalid).
- STUFF (F is allowed, but we haven’t tested F yet, but P was excluded, not directly related).
- STUYS (Y excluded).
- STUVW (invalid).
- STUBS seems the only valid 5-letter word left.

But let me verify STUBS:
- S T U B S.
- Letters: S, T, U, B, S.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- So STUBS is valid.

Is there any other? STUF_? No. STUGS? Not a word. STUWS? Not a word.

Thus, the only remaining plausible guess is STUBS.

But wait, let me think again: the word must be STU _ _. We have tried M and P, which are excluded. Next common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, L, V, W, and the only vowel left is O.

Possible valid words:
- STUBS (B, S) — S is allowed in position 5.
- STUFO — not a word.
- STUF_ — no.
- STUVO — no.
- STUWO — no.
- STUGO — no.
- STUHO — no.
- STULO — no.
- STUCO — uses C and O, both allowed. STUCO is a valid word (short for stucco).

STUCO:
- S T U C O.
- Letters: S, T, U, C, O.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- C and O are new and allowed.

STUCO is a valid English word (a construction material). This seems better than STUBS because it uses O (only remaining vowel) and C (a common consonant).

Thus, the next best guess is STUCO.

Another approach: remaining letters to test are fourth and fifth positions. Since M and P were excluded, and we have few vowels left, let’s think of common consonant pairs.

Possible endings:
- B (allowed) + any allowed consonant or O.
- C + K (K excluded), so not.
- F + F (STUFF).
- G + any (STUGS? No).
- H + any (STUHS? No).
- L + any (STULM? No).
- B + O (STUBO? Not a word).
- B + B (STUBB? No).
- L + O (STULO? No).
- B + S (STUBS) — STUBS is a valid word: the plural of stub.

Are there other words?
- STUCC (invalid).
- STUFF (F is allowed, but we haven’t tested F yet, but P was excluded, not directly related).
- STUYS (Y excluded).
- STUVW (invalid).
- STUBS seems the only valid 5-letter word left.

But let me verify STUBS:
- S T U B S.
- Letters: S, T, U, B, S.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- So STUBS is valid.

Is there any other? STUF_? No. STUGS? Not a word. STUWS? Not a word.

Thus, the only remaining plausible guess is STUBS.

But wait, let me think again: the word must be STU _ _. We have tried M and P, which are excluded. Next common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, L, V, W, and the only vowel left is O.

Possible valid words:
- STUBS (B, S) — S is allowed in position 5.
- STUFO — not a word.
- STUF_ — no.
- STUVO — no.
- STUWO — no.
- STUGO — no.
- STUHO — no.
- STULO — no.
- STUCO — uses C and O, both allowed. STUCO is a valid word (short for stucco).

STUCO:
- S T U C O.
- Letters: S, T, U, C, O.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- C and O are new and allowed.

STUCO is a valid English word (a construction material). This seems better than STUBS because it uses O (only remaining vowel) and C (a common consonant).

Thus, the next best guess is STUCO.",Guess 5: STUCO -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) U(✓) C(x) O(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,STUFF,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. I want to include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Some good starting options include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels but lacks common consonants)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I think STARE is a particularly good first guess because:
1. It covers all five most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T) except O
2. It has both common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R)
3. It allows checking multiple positions for these common letters

Let me go with STARE as the first guess.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S(✓) → S is correct and in first position
- T(✓) → T is correct and in second position
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- E(x) → E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word starts with ST
- The remaining letters (A, R, E) are not in the word at all
- We need three more letters, none of which are A, R, or E

We also know the remaining letters must be consonants or vowels (but A and E are ruled out). Common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Common vowels left are I, O, U. 

Let’s look for words that start with ST and avoid A, R, E. Some possibilities:
- STINK (uses I, N, K - none of which are A/R/E)
- STUMP (uses U, M, P - none of which are A/R/E)
- STICK (I, C, K)
- STONY (O, N, Y)
- STOCK (O, C, K)

STINK seems like a strong candidate because it uses common letters (I, N, K) and fits the pattern perfectly.

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have feedback from two guesses:

1. STARE → S(✓) T(✓) A(x) R(x) E(x)
2. STINK → S(✓) T(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)

What we know so far:
- The word definitely starts with “ST”.
- The letters A, R, E, I, N, K are **not** in the word anywhere.

Letters still available (excluding the ruled-out ones):
Consonants: B C D F G H J L M P Q U V W X Y Z  
Vowels: O U

We need three more letters to complete “ST _ _ _” using only letters from the available set.  
We should prioritize common English letters. Let’s consider:
- O and U are the only vowels left.
- Good consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STOMP (O, M, P) — all letters allowed
- STUDY (U, D, Y) — all letters allowed
- STOIC (contains I, which is ruled out) ❌
- STUFF (U, F, F) — all letters allowed
- STOCK (contains K, ruled out) ❌
- STOMP or STUDY both look good; STUDY uses U, D, Y — all allowed.

Let me go with STUDY because U is a vowel and D, Y are common consonants.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated knowledge:

1. The word starts with STU (positions 1-3 confirmed correct).
2. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y.
3. We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the above forbidden letters.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones in bold):
- Vowels left: O
- Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We look for common 5-letter words that begin with “STU” and use only allowed letters in positions 4-5.

Possible word stems: STU _ _

Likely candidates:
- STUMP (M, P) — both letters not yet ruled out.
- STUFF (F, F) — F allowed.
- STUMP uses very common letters and avoids all forbidden ones.

Let’s pick STUMP.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
- Word starts with STU (first three letters fixed).
- Letters already excluded: A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P.

We now need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The letters that remain available (and common) are:
- Vowels: O
- Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (but Q, X, Z are rare, so focus on B, C, F, G, H, L, V, W).

Looking for 5-letter words that start with “STU” and end with any combination of these allowed letters.

Candidate endings:
- B, C, F, G, H, L, O, V, W

Possible words:
- STUBS → uses B and S, but S is already fixed in position 1, so invalid (no repeats).
- STUCK → uses C and K, but K is excluded.
- STUFF → uses F and F, but F is allowed. However, P was excluded, not directly tested for F.
- STUNG → uses N and G, but N is excluded.
- STUCC → invalid (not a word).
- STUBB → invalid.
- STUOH → invalid.
- STUVO → invalid.
- STUWL → invalid.

The most plausible remaining word that fits is STUCC (but that’s not a valid word) or STUFF. Wait, STUF is not 5 letters. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the only common English word starting with STU and avoiding all excluded letters seems to be:
- STOO_? No, O is the only remaining vowel, but we need two letters.

Wait, let me list valid English words starting with STU and check against exclusions:
- STUBS → B is allowed, S is already in position 1 (no issue), second S is new position 5. But B is allowed, S is allowed (not excluded). However, STUBS is 5 letters: S T U B S. All letters except excluded ones: B is allowed, S is allowed. But does it use any excluded letters? No. But we have S in position 1 already, and another S at position 5 is allowed (no restriction on repeats unless letter is excluded, and S is not excluded). But is STUBS a valid word? Yes. But let me check if we have any feedback suggesting S cannot appear again. No such restriction.

But let’s see if we can find a better one.

Another approach: remaining letters to test are fourth and fifth positions. Since M and P were excluded, and we have few vowels left, let’s think of common consonant pairs.

Possible endings:
- B (allowed) + any allowed consonant or O.
- C + K (K excluded), so not.
- F + F (STUFF).
- G + any (STUGS? No).
- H + any (STUHS? No).
- L + any (STULM? No).
- B + O (STUBO? Not a word).
- B + B (STUBB? No).
- L + O (STULO? No).
- B + S (STUBS) — STUBS is a valid word: the plural of stub.

Are there other words?
- STUCC (invalid).
- STUFF (F is allowed, but we haven’t tested F yet, but P was excluded, not directly related).
- STUYS (Y excluded).
- STUVW (invalid).
- STUBS seems the only valid 5-letter word left.

But let me verify STUBS:
- S T U B S.
- Letters: S, T, U, B, S.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- So STUBS is valid.

Is there any other? STUF_? No. STUGS? Not a word. STUWS? Not a word.

Thus, the only remaining plausible guess is STUBS.

But wait, let me think again: the word must be STU _ _. We have tried M and P, which are excluded. Next common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, L, V, W, and the only vowel left is O.

Possible valid words:
- STUBS (B, S) — S is allowed in position 5.
- STUFO — not a word.
- STUF_ — no.
- STUVO — no.
- STUWO — no.
- STUGO — no.
- STUHO — no.
- STULO — no.
- STUCO — uses C and O, both allowed. STUCO is a valid word (short for stucco).

STUCO:
- S T U C O.
- Letters: S, T, U, C, O.
- Excluded letters: none of A, R, E, I, N, K, D, Y, M, P are used.
- C and O are new and allowed.

STUCO is a valid English word (a construction material). This seems better than STUBS because it uses O (only remaining vowel) and C (a common consonant).

Thus, the next best guess is STUCO.

We now know the word is STU _ _.

Letters that have been tried and rejected (so far they are NOT in the word anywhere):

That leaves the following available letters for positions 4–5:

- STU _ _ with G gives STUGS (not valid)  

STUFF is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters (F).  
STUBS is also valid, but STUFF is more likely.

B, F, G, H, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z  (plus any repeats of S, T, U which are allowed).  

Among these, the only common English endings that form a real 5-letter word beginning with STU are:  
- STUBS (B, S)  
- STUFF (F, F)  
- STUNG – but N is already excluded  
- STU _ _ with G gives STUGS (not valid)  

STUFF is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters (F).  
STUBS is also valid, but STUFF is more likely.  
I’ll choose STUFF.

(Notice: after STUFF, the remaining consonants would be very scarce, so this is the logical next step.)",Guess 6: STUFF -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) U(✓) F(✓) F(✓),SUCCESS
