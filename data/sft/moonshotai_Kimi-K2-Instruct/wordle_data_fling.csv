For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify possible matches. A good starting word should include vowels and frequently used consonants. A popular choice among Wordle enthusiasts is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (a very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of letters to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the word is of the form
_ L _ _ _
and does not contain the letters S, A, T, E.

I now need a 5-letter word that fits _ L _ _ _ and avoids S, A, T, E.  
Some consonants that remain available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, etc.  
A few vowels still possible: I, O, U, Y.

Good candidates:
- BLIMP
- CLINK
- FLING
- GLINT  (but T is excluded)
- PLING

I’ll pick “FLING” because it uses F, I, N, G – none of which have been ruled out yet – and keeps the L locked in the second spot.
