For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains frequently used letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good starting word should balance these letters to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often considered a strong first guess because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage across possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Includes E but NOT in position 5.
- Excludes A, R, O, S altogether.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E (and not in slot 5).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to gather more information. Good choices among consonants not yet eliminated: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, etc.

A balanced word should mix a few of these consonants with E in a different slot. ""TENTH"" comes to mind (T, E, N, T, H). It uses:
- T appears twice – will tell me if T is in the word.
- E in position 2 (new slot).
- N and H to test additional letters.

Let me check: no A, R, O, S, and E not in slot 5. Works.

From the new feedback on TENTH:

- T appears twice and each receives the “-” symbol: T is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- E also receives “-”: E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew it’s not in 5).
- N and H are marked with “x”: they’re NOT in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, H.

Letters we know ARE in the word: T, E (with unknown correct positions).

So the secret word must:
- contain T (and not in 1 or 4)
- contain E (and not in 2 or 5)
- avoid A, R, O, S, N, H.

That leaves consonants like D, L, C, M, Y, K, etc., and vowels I, U.

Let’s try “TILED”:
- T in position 1: but T cannot be in 1, so that’s wrong.
We need to place T somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5) and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4).

A word that satisfies: “UTILE” – but it uses I and U, but we already see U hasn’t been tested yet, and it places E in the forbidden position 4, so that’s bad.

Try “CITED”:
- T is in position 3 (allowed, not yet ruled out).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, not in 2 or 5).
- C, I, D haven’t been ruled out yet.
- It uses no forbidden letters.

From the new feedback on CITED:

- C, I, T, E, D are **all** in the word but **each is in the wrong position**.
- Letters we know are in the word: C, I, T, E, D (all five letters).
- Letters we know are **not** in the word: A, R, O, S, N, H.

Since every letter in CITED is confirmed to be in the word, the secret word must be a permutation of C, I, T, E, D that:
- Does **not** place C in position 1,
- Does **not** place I in position 2,
- Does **not** place T in position 3,
- Does **not** place E in position 4,
- Does **not** place D in position 5.

Let’s list the possible permutations of C, I, T, E, D and apply the positional constraints:

1. C I T E D – positions C1, I2, T3, E4, D5 → all invalid (matches original positions).
2. C I T D E – T3 invalid.
3. C I E T D – T3 invalid.
4. C I E D T – Valid positions: C1 (invalid), I2 (invalid), E3, D4, T5 → C1 and I2 invalid.
5. C I D T E – D3, T4, E5 → E5 invalid.
6. C I D E T – D3, E4 invalid.
7. C T I E D – T2, I3, E4 invalid.
8. C T I D E – T2, I3, E5 invalid.
9. C T E I D – T2, E3, I4, D5 invalid.
10. C T E D I – T2, E3, D4 invalid.
11. C T D I E – T2, D3, I4, E5 invalid.
12. C T D E I – T2, D3, E4 invalid.
13. C E I T D – E2, I3, T4, D5 invalid.
14. C E I D T – E2, I3, D4 invalid.
15. C E T I D – E2, T3, I4, D5 invalid.
16. C E T D I – E2, T3, D4 invalid.
17. C E D I T – E2, D3, I4 invalid.
18. C E D T I – E2, D3, T4 invalid.
19. C D I T E – D2, I3, T4, E5 invalid.
20. C D I E T – D2, I3, E4 invalid.
21. C D T I E – D2, T3, I4, E5 invalid.
22. C D T E I – D2, T3, E4 invalid.
23. C D E I T – D2, E3, I4 invalid.
24. C D E T I – D2, E3, T4 invalid.

Continuing this way is tedious, but we can look for valid permutations more systematically. The constraints are:
- C not in 1, I not in 2, T not in 3, E not in 4, D not in 5.

Let’s find a permutation where all letters are in different positions:

One valid permutation is E D I C T:
- E: not in 4 (position 1) – ok.
- D: not in 5 (position 2) – ok.
- I: not in 2 (position 3) – ok.
- C: not in 1 (position 4) – ok.
- T: not in 3 (position 5) – ok.

This satisfies all constraints.

Another valid permutation is I C E D T:
- I: not in 2 (position 1) – ok.
- C: not in 1 (position 2) – ok.
- E: not in 4 (position 3) – ok.
- D: not in 5 (position 4) – ok.
- T: not in 3 (position 5) – ok.

Both EDICT and ICDET are possibilities, but ICDET is not a valid English word. EDICT is a valid word.

Thus, the secret word is EDICT.
