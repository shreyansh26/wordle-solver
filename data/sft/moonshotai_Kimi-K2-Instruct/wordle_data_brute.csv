This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information across a wide range of possible matches. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of hits
2. Include vowels since every English word has at least one
3. Have a good mix of consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

Current deductions:
1. Fixed letters: _ _ _ T E (from SLATE feedback).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, N, I.

   - T is in the word but not in position 4 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 → must be in 1 or 2.
   - E is still correct in position 5.

So the word must satisfy:
- Format (with T in 1, 2, or 3): T _ _ T E (impossible, T repeats) OR _ T _ T E (impossible, T repeats) OR _ _ T T E (impossible, T repeats) OR the feedback means T is in the word but NOT in position 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3, and we have to place R in 1 or 2, and avoid S,L,A,N,I.

Rewriting possible positions:
- T cannot be in 4, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- R must be in 1 or 2.
- E is fixed in 5.
- Letters excluded: S, L, A, N, I.

Possible combinations:
- If T is in 1: T R _ _ E (but _ _ must be filled, avoiding S,L,A,N,I) → letters left include C, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.
- If T is in 2: _ T _ _ E → but R must be in 1 or 2 (so R in 1) → R T _ _ E → but T is in 2 here, so _ _ would need to be filled.

Thus, the only viable placement is T in 1: T R _ _ E. The blanks must be filled with letters not in {S, L, A, N, I}.

Good candidates for the blanks: C, O, U, M, etc. Possible words:
- TROVE (but O, V, E may conflict) → E is already in 5, so TROVE is invalid (E repeats).
- TRUCE (U, C) → T R U C E → check if all letters allowed: T,R,U,C,E — none are in excluded set. This seems valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Feedback so far
1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)  
   - T is in the word and sits in position 4.  
   - E is in the word and sits in position 5.  
   - S, L, A are NOT in the word.

2. NITRE → N(x) I(x) T(-) R(-) E(✓)  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but we already know from guess-1 that it IS in position 4, so this is just confirming).  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - E still correct in position 5.  
   - N, I are NOT in the word.

3. TRUCE → T(-) R(✓) U(✓) C(x) E(✓)  
   - T is NOT in position 1 (which we already knew; position 4 is fixed).  
   - R is correct in position 2.  
   - U is correct in position 3.  
   - C is NOT in the word.  
   - E is still correct in position 5.

Putting the board together
From the above we now have exact letters in exact places:

Position 1: unknown (not S, L, A, N, I, C)  
Position 2: R  
Position 3: U  
Position 4: T  
Position 5: E  

So the pattern is: _ R U T E

The only remaining letter to determine is the first character.  
Allowed letters (common English letters that have NOT been ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common first-letter consonants are B, D, F, G, M, P, W.  
Scanning the dictionary for 5-letter English words of the form ?RUTE:

- BRUTE  
- CRUTE – invalid (C already excluded)  
- DRUTE – not a word  
- FRUTE – not a word  
- GRUTE – not a word  
- PRUTE – not a word  

The only valid English word left is BRUTE.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BRUTE.
