1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, etc.).

The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening guess because:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Another common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel (and the most frequent letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test for presence and position.

From the feedback:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 2nd; now it must be 1st, 3rd, 4th or 5th).
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th; now it must be 1st–4th).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain C, A, or N.

1. Uses R in a new position (not 2nd).

From the new feedback on TIRED:
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 1st; must now be 2-5).
- I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 2nd; must now be 1, 3-5).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 4th; must now be 1-3, 5).
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Has R in the 3rd position.
- Contains T, I, E, but none in their previous positions.
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, D.

Let’s summarize knowns:
Letters in: R (fixed at 3), T, I, E
Letters out: C, A, N, D
Remaining letters to test/confirm: common consonants like S, M, L, H, K, P, B, G, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 3.
2. Puts T elsewhere (positions 2, 4, 5).
3. Puts I elsewhere (positions 1, 4, 5).
4. Puts E elsewhere (positions 1, 2, 5).
5. Introduces new useful letters.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T is in position 1 (but T was marked wrong in 1st, so invalid for TRIES).
Next candidate: “STORE” – but R must be 3rd, invalid.
Next candidate: “WRITE” – R is 2nd, must be 3rd, invalid.
Next candidate: “PIERT” – invalid, not a word.
Next candidate: “BRIEF” – R is 3rd, good. Check letters:
- B: new, possible
- R: fixed 3rd ✓
- I: 2nd (was 2nd before, must avoid)
So “BRIEF” is invalid because I is still 2nd.

Try “TRIES” again but move T. Invalid since T would be 1st again.

Try “TRIES” with T in 2nd: “RITSE” – not a word.

Try “STEIR” – not a word.

Re-evaluate: we need R as 3rd letter, and T, I, E in new positions.

Let’s try “LIEST” – no, T is 5th, but E was 4th and needs new position. E in 5th was not tried, so this could be okay, but let’s confirm:
- L: new
- I: 2nd (was 2nd before – invalid, cannot be 2nd again)

Try “ELITE”:
- E in 1st (new position for E, was 4th and 5th before)
- L: new
- I: 2nd (invalid, was 2nd before)

Try “MERIT”:
- M: new
- E: 2nd (was 4th and 5th, new)
- R: 3rd ✓
- I: 4th (was 2nd, new)

All constraints met:
- R is 3rd

- I is 4th (new)

No letters from excluded list (C, A, N, D)
All letters are valid.
