For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The vowels A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, N, L are very common. Some good starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose CRANE because it has:
1. C - common consonant
2. R - very common consonant
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common vowel in English

This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The vowels A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, N, L are very common. Some good starting words include:\n- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)\n- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)\n\nI'll choose CRANE because it has:\n1. C - common consonant\n2. R - very common consonant\n3. A - most common vowel\n4. N - common consonant\n5. E - most common vowel in English\n\nThis should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the feedback on CRANE:\n- C is not in the word (x)\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)\n- A is not in the word (x)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nSo the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _\n\nNow I need a word that:\n1.

Now we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   – R is confirmed in position 2.

2. BRISK → B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. FRUIT → F(✓) R(✓) U(x) I(-) T(x)  
   – F is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – R is still confirmed in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but wrong position (currently 4, so must be 1, 3, or 5; note 1 is already F, so 3 or 5).  
   – U and T are eliminated.

Current constraints:  
- Pattern: F R _ _ _  
- Must contain I (positions 3 or 5 allowed).  
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, B, S, K, U, T.

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y.

Look for 5-letter words starting FR and containing I in position 3 or 5.

Possible candidates:  
- FRIGID → too long (6 letters).  
- FRIZZ – I in position 3, but Z is uncommon and we may not need double Z.  
- FRIMP – not a real word.  
- FRIED – I in position 3, but T is eliminated already (no issue here). Check letters: F, R, I, E, D.  
   – E is already eliminated (from CRANE), so FRIED invalid.  
- FRILL – I in position 3, L twice. Letters: F, R, I, L, L. All allowed.  
- FRISK – S is eliminated.  
- FRIGS – G is allowed, S is eliminated.  
- FRIMP – not valid.  
- FRITH – H is allowed. Letters: F, R, I, T, H – T is eliminated.  
- FRIGG – G allowed, but double G.  
- FRIZZ – already mentioned.  

So the best valid choices appear to be FRILL (I in position 3) or FRIGS (but S is eliminated). Therefore, FRILL is the strongest candidate.

Check:  
- F(1) ✓, R(2) ✓, I(3) allowed (since I can’t be in 4), L(4), L(5).  
- Eliminated letters not used: C, A, N, E, B, S, K, U, T all absent.
