For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and the most common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess should use several of these letters to help narrow down possibilities.

Looking at the options, ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- R: very common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping us eliminate many possibilities quickly.

Feedback tells us:
- R is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- I is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (so it must be in 1, 4, or 5).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

- Position 2 = A
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E
- I is present but not in position 3.

A good strategy is to use new letters while respecting the constraints. Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, D. Common remaining vowels: O, U.

Let’s try a word that places A correctly, includes I elsewhere, and brings in new letters:
- T: very common consonant
- I: must be moved to 1, 4, or 5
- Possible positions for I: 1, 4, 5

A word like ""TAXIC"" comes to mind, but let’s keep it simple: ""TAXID"" uses D (common) and keeps I at 5 (new position). However, ""TAXID"" has repeating letters (T). Instead, ""PAINT"" uses P, N, T, and places I in 4th (not 3rd). But P is less common. 

Better: ""TAINT"" – T, N, T (but T repeats). Let’s try ""PAINT"" – P, A, I (4), N, T. P is acceptable here.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 2 = A (from both guesses)
2. I is in the word, but was in the wrong place in both prior guesses (position 3 in RAISE and position 3 in PAINT) ⇒ I cannot be in position 3.  
   Therefore I must be in 1, 4, or 5.
3. N is in the word and in position 4 (from PAINT feedback: N(✓)).
4. T is in the word and in position 5 (from PAINT feedback: T(✓)).
5. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, P.

So the current known pattern is:

 _  A  _  N  T

with I still to place somewhere, and it must occupy position 1 (since 3 is impossible and 4,5 are taken by N,T).

Thus the word must be I A _ N T.

The only common 5-letter word that fits is “IANT_”, but we need one more consonant. Checking English words, “IANTH” is not valid, but “IANTO” exists as a name—however, it’s not standard. The only standard word that fits is “IANTH” doesn’t exist. Re-evaluate: perhaps I is in position 4—but position 4 is N. So I must be in position 1. 

Actually, let me list possible consonants left that can fit in position 3: common remaining are C, D, G, L, M, B, etc.

Words fitting I A _ N T:
- I A C N T → “IACNT” – not valid.
- I A L N T → “IALNT” – not valid.
- I A G N T → “IAGNT” – not valid.
- I A M N T → “IAMNT” – not valid.
- I A D N T → “IADNT” – not valid.

Wait, the pattern is actually:

 _  A  _  N  T

with I somewhere. Since 2,4,5 are set, I must be in 1 or 3. But in prior guesses I was in 3 (RAISE, PAINT) and was marked ✓ for I but position 3 in both was wrong (because in feedback: I(✓) means letter is in word, but position mark shows if it’s correct or wrong). Looking back:

- RAISE: I(✓) – wait, no! In the feedback provided, in RAISE the feedback was R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x). That means I is in the word but NOT in position 3. In PAINT: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓) T(✓) – here I is in position 3 again, but marked ✓, which would contradict unless the ✓ means just “in word” and position info is separate. 

Ah, the feedback format is that each letter gets one of three symbols, and the symbol’s meaning is for the letter’s status in the word overall, not tied to its position in the guess. So:

- RAISE: R(x), A(✓), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → word has A and I, lacks R, S, E.
- PAINT: P(x), A(✓), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓) → word has A, I, N, T, lacks P.

So the secret word contains {A, I, N, T} and is 5 letters. We don’t know positions yet except that A is in position 2 from RAISE (since A(✓) in RAISE was in position 2, and if it were wrong position, it would be marked (-)). Similarly, in PAINT, N(✓) in position 4 and T(✓) in position 5 imply they are in correct positions.

Thus the word is: _ A _ N T

with I to place. The only remaining position for I is 1 or 3.

Possible words:
- I A _ N T → need consonant in 3. “IAINT” – not valid.
- _ A I N T → but 4 is N, 5 is T, so 3 is I: _ A I N T. Then first letter must be consonant. Common words: “CAINT” – no; “DAINT” – no; “FAINT” – yes, “faint” is a valid word.

Thus the most plausible next guess is “FAINT”.

2. I is in the word, but was in the wrong place in both prior guesses (position 3 in RAISE and position 3 in PAINT) ⇒ I cannot be in position 3.  
   Therefore I must be in 1, 4, or 5.

4. T is in the word and in position 5 (from PAINT feedback: T(✓)).
5. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, P.

So the current known pattern is:

Actually, let me list possible consonants left that can fit in position 3: common remaining are C, D, G, L, M, B, etc.

Words fitting I A _ N T:
- I A C N T → “IACNT” – not valid.
- I A L N T → “IALNT” – not valid.
- I A G N T → “IAGNT” – not valid.
- I A M N T → “IAMNT” – not valid.
- I A D N T → “IADNT” – not valid.

Wait, the pattern is actually:

 _  A  _  N  T

with I somewhere. Since 2,4,5 are set, I must be in 1 or 3. But in prior guesses I was in 3 (RAISE, PAINT) and was marked ✓ for I but position 3 in both was wrong (because in feedback: I(✓) means letter is in word, but position mark shows if it’s correct or wrong). Looking back:

- RAISE: I(✓) – wait, no! In the feedback provided, in RAISE the feedback was R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x). That means I is in the word but NOT in position 3. In PAINT: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓) T(✓) – here I is in position 3 again, but marked ✓, which would contradict unless the ✓ means just “in word” and position info is separate. 

Ah, the feedback format is that each letter gets one of three symbols, and the symbol’s meaning is for the letter’s status in the word overall, not tied to its position in the guess. So:

- RAISE: R(x), A(✓), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → word has A and I, lacks R, S, E.
- PAINT: P(x), A(✓), I(✓), N(✓), T(✓) → word has A, I, N, T, lacks P.

So the secret word contains {A, I, N, T} and is 5 letters. We don’t know positions yet except that A is in position 2 from RAISE (since A(✓) in RAISE was in position 2, and if it were wrong position, it would be marked (-)). Similarly, in PAINT, N(✓) in position 4 and T(✓) in position 5 imply they are in correct positions.

Thus the word is: _ A _ N T

with I to place. The only remaining position for I is 1 or 3.

Possible words:
- I A _ N T → need consonant in 3. “IAINT” – not valid.
- _ A I N T → but 4 is N, 5 is T, so 3 is I: _ A I N T. Then first letter must be consonant. Common words: “CAINT” – no; “DAINT” – no; “FAINT” – yes, “faint” is a valid word.

Thus the most plausible next guess is “FAINT”.",Guess 3: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
