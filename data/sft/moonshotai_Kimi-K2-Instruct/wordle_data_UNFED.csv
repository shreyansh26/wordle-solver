For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and covers three vowels and two common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the first-guess feedback (A x, R x, O x, S x, E -) we know:

- The letter E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
- The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Keeps E but moves it away from the 5th slot.  
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels (none of which are A, R, O, S).

Good remaining candidates for common letters: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, Y, etc.

A strong choice is “UNTIE”:
- It places E in the 3rd position (not 5th).  
- It introduces U, N, T, I — none of which have been ruled out.  
- It covers two new vowels (U, I) and two new consonants (N, T).

Therefore I’ll guess “UNTIE”.

  – N is in position 2 (✓).
  – T and I are NOT in the word.
  – E is confirmed still in the word but not in position 5 (and now also not in position 4).

So we know:
- Pos 1 = U, Pos 2 = N are fixed.
- Pos 5 is NOT E.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I.
- Letters still available: B, C, D, E (not in pos 5 or 4), F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form U N _ _ _ such that the remaining three letters come from the allowed set and E appears once (and not in pos 4 or 5).

Possible skeleton: UN _ _ E (but E can’t be last).

Next try: UN _ E _  (E in pos 4 is now allowed because the feedback was only “E(-)” meaning it’s not in the 5th spot; the 4th spot wasn’t ruled out).

So a candidate is UNBED:
- U(✓), N(✓), B, E (not at 5), D.

From all feedback so far:

- Positions 1 and 2 are U and N (✓).  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- D is in position 5 (✓).  
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I, B.  
- Therefore the only unknown is position 3, which must be a letter not yet used and not in the forbidden set.

Allowed letters for position 3: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word of the form  
U N _ E D  

Common dictionary word that fits:  
“UNCED” is not a real word.  
“UNKED” is rare.  
“UNFED” is a real, common word and the letter F is still allowed.

Hence the next logical guess is UNFED.
