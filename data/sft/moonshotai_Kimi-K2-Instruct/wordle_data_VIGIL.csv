For the first guess, I want a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeat letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word that combines these would be ideal. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant, often starts words)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant, often ends words)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about several key letters and positions.

From the feedback on RAISE we learned:
- R, A, S, E are NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so I appears somewhere other than position 3.

Next-guess strategy:
1. Keep the known letter I but move it to a new position.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters R, A, S, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common letters that haven’t been used yet (T, N, L, O, U, D, etc.).
4. Choose a pattern that maximizes new information.

A word that fits:

- Uses new consonants like T, N, L, D

1. Includes I, placed only in slots 1, 2, or 5.
2. Uses none of the banned letters above.
3. Introduces fresh common consonants and vowels (e.g., D, L, M, U, Y, C, K) to get maximal information.

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- L – in the word but not in position 4 (so L is in 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 2 is already taken by I)

So the pattern so far:

Remaining usable letters (common ones) include:

Let’s pick a common consonant and vowel to test further: we haven’t tried U yet.

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeat letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word that combines these would be ideal. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant, often starts words)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant, often ends words)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about several key letters and positions.

Next-guess strategy:
1. Keep the known letter I but move it to a new position.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters R, A, S, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common letters that haven’t been used yet (T, N, L, O, U, D, etc.).
4. Choose a pattern that maximizes new information.

A word that fits:
- Contains I but not in slot 3
- Uses new consonants like T, N, L, D
- Uses a new vowel like O or U

“POINT” is a good candidate:
- P, N, T are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.
- O and I are vowels; I is placed in position 2 instead of 3.
- No eliminated letters appear.

So I must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes I, placed only in slots 1, 2, or 5.
2. Uses none of the banned letters above.
3. Introduces fresh common consonants and vowels (e.g., D, L, M, U, Y, C, K) to get maximal information.

Candidate letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good strategy: pick a word with I in a new position plus high-frequency unused letters like L, U, M, D, etc.

Let’s choose a word like “BUILD”:
- Starts with B (new).  
- U (new vowel).  
- I placed in position 3 (but we know 3 is wrong), so skip that: wrong placement.  
Instead: “FLUID” has I in position 4 (also wrong).  
“I” needs to be in 1, 2, or 5.  

Option: “LIGHT” – I in position 2, uses L, G, H (all new).  
Check banned letters: L, I, G, H, T – T is banned, so skip.  

Option: “LIVID” – uses L, V, D (all new), I in position 2.  
Banned letters check: L, I, V, I, D – none are banned.  
This satisfies:  
- I in position 2 (allowed).  
- No banned letters appear.  
- Introduces L, V, D.

Another option: “DIMLY” – I in position 2, uses D, M, L, Y (all new).  
Both LIVID and DIMLY are good.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Letter positions: _ I _ _ L
2. Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z, plus the two I’s we already have and the final L.
3. Eliminated letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T, D, M, Y, C, V.
4. The word needs exactly two I’s and one L, with the pattern _ I _ I L.

Looking at the pattern _ I _ I L, we need to pick a vowel for the blank spot 3 that hasn’t been ruled out.  The available vowels from the remaining letters are:
- U (only remaining vowel not eliminated).

So the frame becomes _ I U I L.

Consonants still allowed to go in position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, W, X, Z.

We want a common English word.  Scanning, “FIUIL” is nonsense.  “BIUIL” likewise.  “GUIUL” too.  The only common word that fits _ I U I L is “QUIIL” – but that’s not a recognized English word.  Actually, “B” plus “I U I L” → “BIUIL” is also invalid.  The only real word that fits the pattern is “QUIIL” and it’s not standard.

Wait – let me double-check the dictionary.  The word ""QUIIL"" is not valid.  However, ""BUILD"" would have a U in position 3, but it has D (eliminated) and no double I, so that’s no good.

Re-examining the pattern: we have fixed _ I _ I L.  The only remaining vowel is U, and it must go in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are I).  So the word must be of the form [consonant] I U I L.

Looking at valid English 5-letter words with that exact pattern, the only one is:

B I U I L → “BIUIL” – but this is not a word.
F I U I L → “FIUIL” – no.
H I U I L → “HIUIL” – no.
K I U I L → “KIUIL” – no.
G I U I L → “GIUIL” – no.
W I U I L → “WIUIL” – no.

Actually, the only real word fitting _ I _ I L with the allowed letters is … none.  This indicates I must have missed something.

Let me re-express the pattern: the word ends in L and has I in positions 2 and 4.  The missing positions are 1 and 3.  We already have the two I’s and the L; no more I’s or L’s.  Therefore position 3 must be a consonant, not a vowel.  That was an oversight.

So the frame is _ I [consonant] I L, with the consonant in slot 3 from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, W, X, Z.

Now checking common 5-letter words fitting [consonant] I [consonant] I L:
- B I B I L → “BIBIL” – invalid.
- F I B I L → “FIBIL” – invalid.
- F I L I L → “FILIL” – invalid.
- H I K I L → “HIKIL” – invalid.
- B I L I L → “BILIL” – invalid.
- G I L I L → “GILIL” – invalid.
- F I G I L → “FIGIL” – no.
- B I G I L → “BIGIL” – no.
- Q U I L L – but Q and U together, and second I is missing.

Wait – the word “CIVIL” gave us two I’s and the L in 5.  Actually, the word has two I’s, one L, and needs one more consonant.  The pattern must therefore be _ I [consonant] I L.  The only common word matching this and using only allowed letters is:

“B I G I L” – again invalid.

But “W I C K L” – doesn’t have two I’s.

Let me list actual 5-letter dictionary words ending in “IIL” or “I I L”:

After checking, the only valid English 5-letter word that matches _ I _ I L with the allowed letters is “B I L I L” – but that is not a word.

Actually, the correct pattern is _ I _ I L and the only real word that fits is “FILIL” – again no.

Realizing the issue – I missed that the word might have the L in position 3, not 5.  Let me reconsider the feedback.

From CIVIL: C(x) I(✓) V(-) I(✓) L(✓)

This shows:
- Position 1: C is out.
- Position 2: I is correct (✓).
- Position 3: V is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  So V is somewhere else.
- Position 4: I is correct (✓).
- Position 5: L is correct (✓).

So the confirmed pattern is: _ I _ I L with V included somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (because 2,4,5 are fixed).  Therefore the word must contain V in either position 1 or 3.

Still allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 (excluding all eliminated letters): B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z, plus V.

We need a word of the form:
[consonant from allowed set] I [V or another allowed consonant] I L.

But we also have V as an in-word letter that must be placed in position 1 or 3.

So possible candidates:
- V I [consonant] I L → “V I _ I L” – but that would need a consonant in 3, leading to “V I B I L” (invalid), “V I G I L” → “VIGIL” – yes, that’s a word!
- B I V I L → “BIVIL” – invalid.

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “VIGIL”.

Let’s verify:
V I G I L
- V: allowed, not yet placed.
- I: correctly in 2 and 4.
- G: allowed.
- I: correct.
- L: correct.

No banned letters appear.  Feedback would be:
V(✓) I(✓) G(✓) I(✓) L(✓)

This must be the secret word.

<guess>VIGIL</guess>",VIGIL,"Current confirmed facts:
1. Letter positions: _ I _ _ L
2. Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z, plus the two I’s we already have and the final L.
3. Eliminated letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T, D, M, Y, C, V.
4. The word needs exactly two I’s and one L, with the pattern _ I _ I L.

Looking at the pattern _ I _ I L, we need to pick a vowel for the blank spot 3 that hasn’t been ruled out.  The available vowels from the remaining letters are:
- U (only remaining vowel not eliminated).

So the frame becomes _ I U I L.

Consonants still allowed to go in position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, W, X, Z.

We want a common English word.  Scanning, “FIUIL” is nonsense.  “BIUIL” likewise.  “GUIUL” too.  The only common word that fits _ I U I L is “QUIIL” – but that’s not a recognized English word.  Actually, “B” plus “I U I L” → “BIUIL” is also invalid.  The only real word that fits the pattern is “QUIIL” and it’s not standard.

Wait – let me double-check the dictionary.  The word ""QUIIL"" is not valid.  However, ""BUILD"" would have a U in position 3, but it has D (eliminated) and no double I, so that’s no good.

Re-examining the pattern: we have fixed _ I _ I L.  The only remaining vowel is U, and it must go in position 3 (since positions 2 and 4 are I).  So the word must be of the form [consonant] I U I L.

Looking at valid English 5-letter words with that exact pattern, the only one is:

B I U I L → “BIUIL” – but this is not a word.
F I U I L → “FIUIL” – no.
H I U I L → “HIUIL” – no.
K I U I L → “KIUIL” – no.
G I U I L → “GIUIL” – no.
W I U I L → “WIUIL” – no.

Actually, the only real word fitting _ I _ I L with the allowed letters is … none.  This indicates I must have missed something.

Let me re-express the pattern: the word ends in L and has I in positions 2 and 4.  The missing positions are 1 and 3.  We already have the two I’s and the L; no more I’s or L’s.  Therefore position 3 must be a consonant, not a vowel.  That was an oversight.

So the frame is _ I [consonant] I L, with the consonant in slot 3 from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, W, X, Z.

Now checking common 5-letter words fitting [consonant] I [consonant] I L:
- B I B I L → “BIBIL” – invalid.
- F I B I L → “FIBIL” – invalid.
- F I L I L → “FILIL” – invalid.
- H I K I L → “HIKIL” – invalid.
- B I L I L → “BILIL” – invalid.
- G I L I L → “GILIL” – invalid.
- F I G I L → “FIGIL” – no.
- B I G I L → “BIGIL” – no.
- Q U I L L – but Q and U together, and second I is missing.

Wait – the word “CIVIL” gave us two I’s and the L in 5.  Actually, the word has two I’s, one L, and needs one more consonant.  The pattern must therefore be _ I [consonant] I L.  The only common word matching this and using only allowed letters is:

“B I G I L” – again invalid.

But “W I C K L” – doesn’t have two I’s.

Let me list actual 5-letter dictionary words ending in “IIL” or “I I L”:

After checking, the only valid English 5-letter word that matches _ I _ I L with the allowed letters is “B I L I L” – but that is not a word.

Actually, the correct pattern is _ I _ I L and the only real word that fits is “FILIL” – again no.

Realizing the issue – I missed that the word might have the L in position 3, not 5.  Let me reconsider the feedback.

From CIVIL: C(x) I(✓) V(-) I(✓) L(✓)

This shows:
- Position 1: C is out.
- Position 2: I is correct (✓).
- Position 3: V is in the word but in the wrong place (-).  So V is somewhere else.
- Position 4: I is correct (✓).
- Position 5: L is correct (✓).

So the confirmed pattern is: _ I _ I L with V included somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (because 2,4,5 are fixed).  Therefore the word must contain V in either position 1 or 3.

Still allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 (excluding all eliminated letters): B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z, plus V.

We need a word of the form:
[consonant from allowed set] I [V or another allowed consonant] I L.

But we also have V as an in-word letter that must be placed in position 1 or 3.

So possible candidates:
- V I [consonant] I L → “V I _ I L” – but that would need a consonant in 3, leading to “V I B I L” (invalid), “V I G I L” → “VIGIL” – yes, that’s a word!
- B I V I L → “BIVIL” – invalid.

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “VIGIL”.

Let’s verify:
V I G I L
- V: allowed, not yet placed.
- I: correctly in 2 and 4.
- G: allowed.
- I: correct.
- L: correct.

No banned letters appear.  Feedback would be:
V(✓) I(✓) G(✓) I(✓) L(✓)

This must be the secret word.",Guess 5: VIGIL -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) G(✓) I(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
