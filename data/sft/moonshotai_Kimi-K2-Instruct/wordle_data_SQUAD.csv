For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can quickly help me identify which letters are present or not in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common consonants and vowels. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A: Very common vowel
- R: Common consonant
- O: Common vowel
- S: Very common consonant
- E: The most common letter in English

This gives me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → the word contains A but not in position 1.
- R(x) → the word contains no R at all.
- O(x) → the word contains no O at all.
- S(-) → the word contains S but not in position 4.
- E(x) → the word contains no E at all.

So the secret word:
- Has A and S somewhere (but not in spots 1 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT have R, O, or E.

To maximize information, my next word should use letters we haven’t tested yet (to cover new ground) while still including the confirmed letters A and S in new positions. A good set of remaining common letters is L, N, T, I, P, U, D, C, etc.

An efficient follow-up word that includes A and S, avoids R/O/E, and introduces new consonants is “PLANT”. However, PLANT has no S. The word “STAIN” has S but repeats A in spot 3, which is currently unknown. The word “SLANT” has both S and A and new letters L, N, T.

So I’ll choose SLANT:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- A moves to position 2 (was position 1).
- Introduces L, N, T (all new letters).

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   - S exists but not in position 4.

   - S is in position 1 (confirmed).
   - L, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - A exists but is NOT in position 3 (because it was marked “-”).

Confirmed letters & positions so far:
- Position 1: S
Confirmed letters (somewhere):
- A, S (but S is already locked at position 1).

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T.

We still need to place A somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in 1 or 3 based on feedback).

Next guess should:
- Fix S at position 1.
- Try A in position 2 (since it’s a common vowel and hasn’t been tested in that spot).
- Include new common letters not eliminated yet: C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.
- Avoid the eliminated letters.

- A in position 2 (new placement for A).
- C, I, D are all new letters.
- No eliminated letters are used.

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common consonants and vowels. \n\nThe word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:\n- A: Very common vowel\n- R: Common consonant\n- O: Common vowel\n- S: Very common consonant\n- E: The most common letter in English\n\nThis gives me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) → the word contains A but not in position 1.\n- R(x) → the word contains no R at all.\n- O(x) → the word contains no O at all.\n- S(-) → the word contains S but not in position 4.\n- E(x) → the word contains no E at all.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Has A and S somewhere (but not in spots 1 and 4 respectively).\n- Does NOT have R, O, or E.\n\nTo maximize information, my next word should use letters we haven’t tested yet (to cover new ground) while still including the confirmed letters A and S in new positions.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A exists but not in position 1.  
   - S exists but not in position 4.  
   - R, O, E are NOT in the word.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   - S is locked in position 1.  
   - A exists but not in position 3.  
   - L, N, T are NOT in the word.

3. SACID → S(✓) A(-) C(x) I(x) D(✓)  
   - S confirmed at position 1.  
   - A exists but not in position 2.  
   - D confirmed at position 5.  
   - C, I are NOT in the word.

Current state of the secret word:
- Position 1: S (locked)
- Position 5: D (locked)
- Letters still to place: A (must be in 3 or 4), plus two more letters.
- Eliminated letters so far: R, O, E, L, N, T, C, I.

Remaining alphabet letters not yet eliminated or used:
B, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need common consonants to fill positions 2 and 4. The 5-letter word must be:
S _ A _ D  or  S _ _ A D, since A can only be in 3 or 4.

Let’s test the pattern S _ A _ D first (A in 3):
- S _ A _ D → S ? A ? D
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 4 from the remaining pool. The most common pairs are K, P, M, H, G.

Try “SPAMD” – but M is ok, P is ok, but we don’t have feedback on M yet. Actually, let’s go with a more common word.

After checking, the only valid 5-letter words in standard dictionaries that fit S _ A _ D are very rare. Let’s try S _ _ A D instead (A in position 4).

Pattern: S _ _ A D
We need consonants for positions 2 and 3. The most common remaining consonants are K, M, P, H, G.

A valid word: “SHAKY” – but Y is at position 5, which is taken by D. “SHARD” – but D is locked at 5. “SKAMP” – but that ends with P. “SMOKY” – again Y conflicts. Wait, we need S _ _ A D.

Looking at valid English words: “SHRAD” (no), “SQUAD” (Q, U are still allowed, and it fits). Let’s check SQUAD:

- S Q U A D
- Letters: S (✓), Q (new), U (new), A (must be in 4), D (✓)
- No eliminated letters are used.

This tests positions 2 (Q) and 3 (U), gives us feedback on A in position 4, and introduces Q and U.

Thus, the next guess is SQUAD.
