- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that will give me as much information as possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. I'll use a word that contains several vowels and common consonants.

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- ROAST (R,O,A,S,T)
- CRISP (C,R,I,S,P)
- PLANT (P,L,A,N,T)

I'm going to go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C: Very common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel after A

This should give me good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R must be the 2nd letter
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A must be the 3rd letter
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N appears somewhere other than the 4th position
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we have: _ R A _ _

N appears somewhere, but not at position 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A, N must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible structures:
1. N R A _ _ 
2. _ R A _ N

We still need to find the 1st and 5th letters (or 4th in case 2). Since we know C and E are out, good remaining consonants to try include S, T, L, M, P, D, etc.

Let's consider common 5-letter words with R in 2nd and A in 3rd:
- GRASP: But G hasn't been tested yet
- DRAIN: But I hasn't been tested yet
- BRAIN: B hasn't been tested yet, but N could be 5th
- FRANK: F and K not tested
- TRAIN: T not tested, N at 5th

I'll try TRAIN because:
- T hasn't been ruled out
- R is confirmed at 2nd
- A is confirmed at 3rd
- I is new and common
- N fits at 5th position since it can't be 4th
