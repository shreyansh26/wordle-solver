Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback to work with, I'll choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Statistically, certain letters appear more frequently in 5-letter English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 different common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
3. It has 2 consonants (R, S) which are also very common
4. It forms a valid English word

Other good alternatives would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems optimal given its letter frequency.

The feedback shows:
- A is in the correct first position (A✓).
- E is in the correct fifth position (E✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-R).
- O and S are not in the word at all (Ox, Sx).

So we need a word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Ends with E
3. Contains the letter R somewhere other than position 2
4. Does not contain O or S
5. Uses valid English letters

Possible positions for R are 3, 4, or 5. However, position 5 is already taken by E, so R must be in position 3 or 4.

Let's brainstorm 5-letter words starting with A and ending with E with R in position 3 or 4, avoiding O and S.

Some candidates:
- AIDER (R in position 4)
- AIMER (R in position 4)
- AIRER (R in position 3 and 4, but double R might be allowed)
- ANGER (R in position 4)
- AFIRE (R in position 3)

""ANGER"" seems like a strong choice:
- A(✓) _ N G E R, but position 5 must be E, so this would be A N G E R which ends with R, not E - invalid.
Wait, let's correct: the word must be A _ _ _ E with R in position 3 or 4.

Correct candidates:
- A R _ _ E (but R can't be position 2)
- A _ R _ E
- A _ _ R E

- A F I R E - AFIRE: A F I R E

Another: A D I R E - ADIRE isn't common.
