Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the word. A good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and covers different vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are commonly recommended. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial information about the presence or absence of these letters.

Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are commonly recommended. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial information about the presence or absence of these letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (✓) – correct in position 1  
- O (✓) – correct in position 3  
- E (✓) – correct in position 5  
- R (x) – not in the word at all  
- S (x) – not in the word at all  

So we need a word that:
- starts with A, has O in the 3rd spot, and ends with E  
- does NOT contain R or S  

We still have to determine the 2nd and 4th letters.  
The remaining common consonants to try are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.  
Let’s pick a common consonant for the 2nd slot and a common consonant for the 4th slot that don’t duplicate any letter already used (A, O, E) or ruled out (R, S).  
A good next probe is A L O N E — it fits the pattern A _ O _ E and uses new consonants L and N, neither of which have been tested yet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Known pattern: A _ O _ E

Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, S, L, N

So positions 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not in {R, S, L, N}.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, T, W, …

Let’s test a pair that hasn’t been tried yet:  
G for position 2 and M for position 4 → A G O M E.

This uses two new consonants (G, M) and fits the required pattern, so it should give maximal new information.

Let’s pick B for position 2 and D for position 4 (two fresh consonants).  
This yields the word A B O D E.

From all feedback so far:

- Fixed positions: A _ O _ E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, L, N, G, M
- From Guess 4 (ABODE): B and D are in the word but are in wrong positions. So B and D still need to be placed, but they can’t go where they just were (B can’t be 2nd, D can’t be 4th).

The only places left for B and D are the 2nd and 4th spots, but we now know:
- B can’t be 2nd, so B must be 4th.
- D can’t be 4th, so D must be 2nd.

Therefore, the only possible arrangement is A D O B E.

We have deduced the only remaining valid placement of the known letters: D must be 2nd and B must be 4th.
