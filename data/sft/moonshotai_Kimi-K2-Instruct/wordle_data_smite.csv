This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a strategic starting word that:
1. Uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of matching letters in the secret word.
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z, etc., to avoid wasting guesses.
3. Includes a good mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Common strategic first guesses in Wordle include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". These words cover frequently used letters. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant, often at the start or end of words.
- A: Most common vowel.
- I: Another common vowel.
- S: Extremely common letter, often pluralizes words.
- E: The most common letter in English.

This should give good coverage of possible letters and positions.

Possible positions for S and T (without repetition):

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of matching letters in the secret word.
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z, etc., to avoid wasting guesses.
3. Includes a good mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Common strategic first guesses in Wordle include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". These words cover frequently used letters. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant, often at the start or end of words.
- A: Most common vowel.
- I: Another common vowel.
- S: Extremely common letter, often pluralizes words.
- E: The most common letter in English.

This should give good coverage of possible letters and positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- I(✓): I is in the word and is in the correct position (4th letter).
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- E(✓): E is in the word and is in the correct position (5th letter).

So we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ I E
- Letters present: I and E are fixed. S exists somewhere in the first three positions.
- Letters eliminated: R and A are out.

Next guess should:
1. Keep I and E fixed in positions 4 and 5.
2. Include S but not in position 3.
3. Avoid R and A.
4. Use common letters for the remaining positions.

Possible words fitting _ _ _ I E with S:
- STILE: S T I L E → S is first (allowed), L and T are common.
- SPIKE: S P I K E → S is first, P and K are possible.
- SMILE: S M I L E → S is first, M and L are possible.
- SLICE: S L I C E → S is first, L and C are possible.

I'll choose ""STILE"" as it uses very common letters (S, T, L) and fits all constraints.

<guess>STILE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two rounds of feedback.

From RAISE:  
R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)  
→ Word ends in **IE**, contains **S**, and **R, A** are absent.

From STILE:  
S(✓) T(-) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)  
→ **S** is correctly in the 1st position.  
→ **T** is present but not in 2nd position.  
→ **L** is not in the word at all.  
→ **I** and **E** are confirmed in positions 3 and 4.

So the pattern now is:  
S _ T I E   (but T not in 2nd)  
Wait: actually the pattern is S _ _ I E, and T must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but not 2, from STILE feedback).  
Hence T must be in position 2:  
S T _ I E

But we must check that this forms a valid 5-letter word.  
The only common English word fitting **S T _ I E** is **STRIE**, but that is obscure.  
Another possibility: **STXIE** – invalid.  
Actually there is **STOIE** – but not a word.  
Looking again: **STRIE** is valid (variant spelling or dialect for ""stray""), but rare.  
A more common word with S T _ I E is **STRIE** (past of stree, Scots).  
However, let's verify: **STRIE** is 5 letters, fits.

But if we want something more common, the only other possibility is **STRIE** itself, as other combinations like STNIE, STGIE, etc., are invalid.  

Thus, the next logical guess is **STRIE**.
