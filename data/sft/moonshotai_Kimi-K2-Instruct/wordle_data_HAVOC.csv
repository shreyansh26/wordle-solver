For the first guess in Wordle, it's ideal to choose a word that:
1. Contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to quickly identify which vowels are in the secret word
2. Uses frequently occurring consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to maximize information gain
3. Avoids repeating letters to cover more unique letters

A widely recognized optimal starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) that appear in many English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that also appear frequently

This gives us maximum coverage of common letters in 5 positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we have:
- A (in word, not in positions 1, 3, 4)
- O (in word, not in positions 2, 3)
- C (in word, not in position 1)
- I (NOT in word)
- T (NOT in word)
- R, S, E (NOT in word)

So the word must contain A, O, C and must NOT contain R, S, E, T, I.

Positions ruled out so far for each letter:
A: cannot be 1, 3, 4 → only possible at 2 or 5
O: cannot be 2, 3 → only possible at 1, 4, 5
C: cannot be 1 → possible at 2,3,4,5

We still need to test common consonants like N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, etc.

Since A can only be at 2 or 5 and O can be at 1,4,5 (but not both at 5), we can try a word that places A in 2 and O in 4 or 5, and introduces new consonants.

A good next guess is ""ACORN"":
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- C in position 1 (but C is not allowed in 1 – wait, C was only ruled out of position 1 by COATI feedback, so C is allowed in positions 2,3,4,5, not 1)
Actually, C was in position 1 in COATI and was marked (-), meaning C is in word but not in 1. So C is allowed anywhere except 1.

So ""ACORN"" has C in 1 – that would be invalid because we know C is not in 1. Let me reconsider.

Let me try ""COMBO"":
- C in 1 – again invalid (C not in 1)
Wait, same issue. Let me think differently.

Better to place A and O in remaining allowed positions and test new consonants.

Positions left:
A: 2 or 5
O: 1, 4, or 5 (but can't be same as A)
C: 2,3,4,5

Let's try ""ONCAB"":
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- C (in word, position 3 - allowed)
- A (in word, position 4 - but A can't be in 4 from COATI feedback)
Wait, COATI had A in 4 marked (-), meaning A is in word but not 4. So A can be in 2 or 5.

Let's try ""CANON"":
- C (in word, position 1 - but C can't be 1)
No.

Let's try ""CAYON"":
- C (position 1 - invalid)
No.

Let me try ""CLOAK"":

No.

No.

Let me systematically:
A must be in 2 or 5
O must be in 1,4,5 (not overlapping with A)

Let me think of valid English words that fit:
Known: contains A, O, C; excludes R,S,E,T,I
Possible consonants left: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,Y,Z

Let me try ""COBRA"" - but R excluded
""COMMA"" - but M repeated
""COCOA"" - repeats C and O
""CONGA"" - T not allowed, but this has N,G
Check CONGA:
C(-) in COATI - C is in word but not 1
CONGA has C in 1 - invalid

""COBIA"" - I excluded
""CORAL"" - R excluded
""COBAL"" - L new, but C in 1 invalid

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's ideal to choose a word that:
1. Contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to quickly identify which vowels are in the secret word
2. Uses frequently occurring consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to maximize information gain
3. Avoids repeating letters to cover more unique letters

A widely recognized optimal starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) that appear in many English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) that also appear frequently

This gives us maximum coverage of common letters in 5 positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(-): A is in the word but in wrong position (not 1st)
- R(x): R is NOT in the word
- O(-): O is in the word but in wrong position (not 3rd)
- S(x): S is NOT in the word
- E(x): E is NOT in the word

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O (and they’re not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
2. It does NOT contain R, S, E
3. We still need to test consonants and find the correct positions for A and O

Good next guess should:
- Keep A and O but move them to new positions
- Introduce new high-frequency consonants to test
- Avoid R, S, E

A strong candidate is ""COATI"":
- Tests common consonants C and T
- Moves O to 2nd position and A to 3rd
- Introduces new consonants C, T, I

<guess>COATI</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COATI -> FEEDBACK: C(-) O(-) A(-) T(x) I(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we have:
- A (in word, not in positions 1, 3, 4)
- O (in word, not in positions 2, 3)
- C (in word, not in position 1)
- I (NOT in word)
- T (NOT in word)
- R, S, E (NOT in word)

So the word must contain A, O, C and must NOT contain R, S, E, T, I.

Positions ruled out so far for each letter:
A: cannot be 1, 3, 4 → only possible at 2 or 5
O: cannot be 2, 3 → only possible at 1, 4, 5
C: cannot be 1 → possible at 2,3,4,5

We still need to test common consonants like N, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, etc.

Since A can only be at 2 or 5 and O can be at 1,4,5 (but not both at 5), we can try a word that places A in 2 and O in 4 or 5, and introduces new consonants.

A good next guess is ""ACORN"":
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- C in position 1 (but C is not allowed in 1 – wait, C was only ruled out of position 1 by COATI feedback, so C is allowed in positions 2,3,4,5, not 1)
Actually, C was in position 1 in COATI and was marked (-), meaning C is in word but not in 1. So C is allowed anywhere except 1.

So ""ACORN"" has C in 1 – that would be invalid because we know C is not in 1. Let me reconsider.

Let me try ""COMBO"":
- C in 1 – again invalid (C not in 1)
Wait, same issue. Let me think differently.

Better to place A and O in remaining allowed positions and test new consonants.

Positions left:
A: 2 or 5
O: 1, 4, or 5 (but can't be same as A)
C: 2,3,4,5

Let's try ""ONCAB"":
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- C (in word, position 3 - allowed)
- A (in word, position 4 - but A can't be in 4 from COATI feedback)
Wait, COATI had A in 4 marked (-), meaning A is in word but not 4. So A can be in 2 or 5.

Let's try ""CANON"":
- C (in word, position 1 - but C can't be 1)
No.

Let's try ""CAYON"":
- C (position 1 - invalid)
No.

Let me try ""CLOAK"":
- C in 1 - invalid
No.

Let me try ""CACAO"":
But this repeats C and A, and we don't know if letters can repeat yet.

Better to spread out. Let's try ""CLOWN"":
But O is in word, must be present.

Let's try ""COYPU"":
- C in 1 - invalid
No.

Let me systematically:
A must be in 2 or 5
O must be in 1,4,5 (not overlapping with A)
C must be in 2,3,4,5

Let's try placing A in 2 and O in 4:
_ A _ O _

Then C must go in 3 or 5.
If C in 3: _ A C O _ → need two new consonants
Possible: N and D → NACOD (but must be valid word)
Or M and N → MANCO (not valid)

Let's try A in 5 and O in 4:
_ _ _ O A
Then C must be in 2 or 3:
C in 2: _ C _ O A → F, G, H, etc. → FOCOA (invalid)
C in 3: _ _ C O A → need consonants for 1 and 2
B and L → B L C O A → ""blcoa"" - invalid

Let's try O in 1 and A in 2:
O A _ _ _
C must be in 3,4,5
Let's try O A C _ _ → need two new consonants
N and D → OACND → ""oacnd"" - invalid
M and P → OACMP - invalid

Let's try O in 1, A in 5:
O _ _ _ A
C must be in 2,3,4
Let's try O C _ _ A → need two consonants
N and D → OCN DA → ""ocnda"" - invalid

Let me think of valid English words that fit:
Known: contains A, O, C; excludes R,S,E,T,I
Possible consonants left: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,Y,Z

Let me try ""COBRA"" - but R excluded
""COMMA"" - but M repeated
""COCOA"" - repeats C and O
""CONGA"" - T not allowed, but this has N,G
Check CONGA:
C(-) in COATI - C is in word but not 1
CONGA has C in 1 - invalid

""COBIA"" - I excluded
""CORAL"" - R excluded
""COBAL"" - L new, but C in 1 invalid

Let me try ""CANON"":
C in 1 - invalid

""BACON"":
B new consonant, A in 2, C in 3, O in 4, N new consonant
Check positions:
A: allowed in 2
O: allowed in 4
C: allowed in 3
B and N new consonants
This seems valid.

<guess>BACON</guess>Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A, O, C must appear (from A(-), O(-), C(-))
- Cannot be: R, S, E, T, I
- Position exclusions: A not in 1,3,4; O not in 2,3; C not in 1

A valid word covering these constraints is ""BACON"":
- B and N are new consonants to test
- A in position 2, O in 4, C in 3 all within allowed positions

Current confirmed information:

Letters in the word and their exact positions:

Letters in the word but not yet placed:
- C (from COATI: C(-) and BACON: C(-))

Letters NOT in the word:

And we know C must appear somewhere among the remaining slots (1, 3, or 5).

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:

- Contains C in 1, 3, or 5
- Uses only allowed letters for the other two positions

Possible patterns:
C A _ O _
_ A C O _

- CLOMP means to tread heavily, fits all constraints:
  C at 1, A at 2, _ at 3, O at 4, M at 5 – but wait, we need C somewhere, not necessarily at 1.

Wait, we have:
A at 2, O at 4, and C must appear in 1, 3, or 5.

CLOMP has:
C at 1, L at 2 – but A must be at 2 – conflict.

Let me re-express the valid pattern:
Positions:
1: any allowed except A(2), O(4), C must appear once
2: A
3: any allowed or C
4: O
5: any allowed or C

So we need words like:
_ A _ O _
with C in 1, 3, or 5

Looking for such words:
- C A _ O _ : CABOT – B out, T out
- C A L O _ : CALOR – R out
- C A M O _ : CAMOS – S out
- C A P O _ : CAPON – N out
- C A D O _ : CADOS – S out

- _ A _ O C : HAMOC – not standard
- _ A _ O C : LAMIC – not standard
- _ A _ O C : DAMOC – not standard

Hmm, struggling to find standard words. Let me try C in position 5:
_ A _ O C

Possible combinations:
- L A B O C – B out
- L A D O C – D okay

- LAPOC – not a word
- LAVOC – not a word
- MADOC – not a word

- MAPOC – not a word
- HADOC – not a word
- HAGOC – not a word

- LACOS – S out
- MACOS – S out
- HACOS – S out
- DACOS – S out
- FACOS – S out
- GACOS – S out
- LACOS – S out
- MACOS – S out

S is ruled out, so no.

Going back to C in position 1:
C A _ O _

Words:
- CABOT – B out, T out
- CADOT – T out
- CAFOD – not a word
- CAGOT – G okay, but T out (CAGOT is archaic, not standard)
- CAHOY – H, Y okay (CAHOY is obscure)
- CALOT – not standard
- CAMPO – M, P okay – CAMPO is valid
  CAMPO: C(1), A(2), M(3), P(4), O(5) – but O must be at 4, here O is at 5 – conflict.

Wait, pattern is:
C A _ O _
So CAMPO doesn't fit (O is 5, needs to be 4).

- CAVOK – not standard
- CAWED – not fitting
- CAYOS – S out

This is tough. Let me try C in position 5 again with different starting consonants.

Pattern: _ A _ O C
Looking for real words:
- HAVOC – H, V, O, C – fits! H, A, V, O, C
  Check constraints:
  - A at 2 (matches)
  - O at 4 (matches)
  - C at 5 (allowed)
  - Letters used: H, V – not previously excluded
  - No excluded letters (R,S,E,T,I,B,N)

HAVOC is a valid English word.

- O is fixed at position 4 (✓ from BACON)
- C is in the word but not yet positioned (from COATI and BACON)
- Excluded letters: R, S, E, T, I, B, N

We need a word with the pattern _ A _ O _ that also contains C in positions 1, 3, or 5. A valid English word fitting this is ""HAVOC"":

A at 2, O at 4, and C must appear in 1, 3, or 5.

CLOMP has:
C at 1, L at 2 – but A must be at 2 – conflict.

Let me re-express the valid pattern:
Positions:
1: any allowed except A(2), O(4), C must appear once
2: A
3: any allowed or C
4: O
5: any allowed or C

So we need words like:
_ A _ O _
with C in 1, 3, or 5

Looking for such words:
- C A _ O _ : CABOT – B out, T out
- C A L O _ : CALOR – R out
- C A M O _ : CAMOS – S out
- C A P O _ : CAPON – N out
- C A D O _ : CADOS – S out
- _ A C O _ : LACOS – S out
- _ A C O _ : MACON – N out
- _ A C O _ : PACOS – S out
- _ A _ O C : PACOC – not a word
- _ A _ O C : LADOC – not a word
- _ A M O C : AMOK – too short
- _ A C O _ : DACOS – S out
- _ A C O _ : GACOS – S out
- _ A C O _ : HACOS – S out
- _ A C O _ : LACOS – S out
- _ A _ O C : HAMOC – not standard
- _ A _ O C : LAMIC – not standard
- _ A _ O C : DAMOC – not standard

Hmm, struggling to find standard words. Let me try C in position 5:
_ A _ O C

Possible combinations:
- L A B O C – B out
- L A D O C – D okay
- L A G O C – G okay
- L A H O C – H okay
- L A M O C – M okay
- L A P O C – P okay
- L A V O C – V okay
- L A W O C – W okay
- L A Y O C – Y okay
- M A _ O C – M, A, O, C
- P A _ O C – P, A, O, C
- D A _ O C – D, A, O, C
- G A _ O C – G, A, O, C
- H A _ O C – H, A, O, C
- F A _ O C – F, A, O, C

Looking for real words fitting _ A _ O C:
- LADOC – not a word
- GADOC – not a word
- LAGOC – not a word
- LAMOC – not a word
- LAPOC – not a word
- LAVOC – not a word
- MADOC – not a word
- MAGOC – not a word
- MAPOC – not a word
- HADOC – not a word
- HAGOC – not a word
- HAMOC – not a word

This isn't productive. Let me try C in position 3:
_ A C O _

Looking for real words:
- LACOS – S out
- MACOS – S out
- HACOS – S out
- DACOS – S out
- FACOS – S out
- GACOS – S out
- LACOS – S out
- MACOS – S out

S is ruled out, so no.

Going back to C in position 1:
C A _ O _

Words:
- CABOT – B out, T out
- CADOT – T out
- CAFOD – not a word
- CAGOT – G okay, but T out (CAGOT is archaic, not standard)
- CAHOY – H, Y okay (CAHOY is obscure)
- CALOT – not standard
- CAMPO – M, P okay – CAMPO is valid
  CAMPO: C(1), A(2), M(3), P(4), O(5) – but O must be at 4, here O is at 5 – conflict.

Wait, pattern is:
C A _ O _
So CAMPO doesn't fit (O is 5, needs to be 4).

- CAVOK – not standard
- CAWED – not fitting
- CAYOS – S out

This is tough. Let me try C in position 5 again with different starting consonants.

Pattern: _ A _ O C
Looking for real words:
- HAVOC – H, V, O, C – fits! H, A, V, O, C
  Check constraints:
  - A at 2 (matches)
  - O at 4 (matches)
  - C at 5 (allowed)
  - Letters used: H, V – not previously excluded
  - No excluded letters (R,S,E,T,I,B,N)

HAVOC is a valid English word.From the feedback:
- A is fixed at position 2 (✓ from BACON)
- O is fixed at position 4 (✓ from BACON)
- C is in the word but not yet positioned (from COATI and BACON)
- Excluded letters: R, S, E, T, I, B, N

We need a word with the pattern _ A _ O _ that also contains C in positions 1, 3, or 5. A valid English word fitting this is ""HAVOC"":

- H A V O C
- C appears at position 5
- All letters are allowed and word is valid",Guess 4: HAVOC -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
