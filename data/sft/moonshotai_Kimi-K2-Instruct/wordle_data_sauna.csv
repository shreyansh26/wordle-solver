For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering many possibilities. However, I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better because it includes the letter I (another vowel) and the common letter E, along with R, S which are also very common. 

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""RAISE"" for this first guess as it hits several high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second spot) (✓).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Second letter is A.
- S is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position (and not in the 5th because it wasn’t marked ✓ there either).
- The letters R, I, E are eliminated.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A in the correct spot (position 2).
2. Uses S in a new position (positions 1, 3, or 5; position 4 is already excluded).
3. Avoids R, I, E.
4. Introduces other common consonants or vowels to test more letters.

Good candidate letters to add: O, U, T, N, L, D, B, C, G, M, etc.

Let’s try a word that keeps A in the second position and moves S: for instance, S in position 1. Possible words: S A _ _ _. A common 5-letter word starting with SA and avoiding R, I, E is S A L S A, but that repeats S. Another word: S A B L E – but E is excluded. S A U C E – E excluded. S A N D Y – Y is OK, but Y is less common; S A N D S – repeats S. S A M B A – B and M are good to test. That seems decent.

Alternatively, keep S in position 3: _ _ S _ _. A in 2nd: _ A S _ _. Possible words: C A S T S – but S at 5th might be a repeat, and T and C are good. C A S T S is not valid. C A S T S is actually 5 letters but not a word. C A S T _ – C A S T S is not right. C A S T E – E excluded. C A S T S is invalid. Let me think of a valid word: M A S T S – no. C A S T S – no. Maybe C A S T S is not valid. Perhaps better to try another word.

Another option: S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S. A in 2nd: _ A _ _ S. Possible words: B A N K S – B, N, K, S; S is already confirmed in word but position 5 is new. This tests B, N, K. Seems good.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (since in RAISE it was in 4 and got “-” and in BANKS it was in 5 and again got “-”). So S must be in position 1 or 3.

2. BANKS → B(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x) S(-)  
   - B and K are not in the word at all.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - A stays correct in position 2.  
   - S again moves (now from 5) and still is “-”, confirming it must be in position 1 or 3.

So far:
- Known pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, N  
- S must be in 1 or 3  
- N must be anywhere except 3  
- Eliminated letters so far: R, I, E, B, K

   - S A N D Y (Y never tested, but D is okay) – but we prefer to test more common letters.  
   - S A N D S – S repeats, not ideal.  
   - S A N T A – T and A already okay.  
   - S A N T A – valid word.

Case 2: S in position 3 → _ A S _ _
   Need N somewhere else, not 3.  
   Words: C A S T N – not valid.  
   L A S S O – S repeats.  
   M A S O N – uses M, O, N; N in 5 is allowed.  
   T A S T E – E eliminated.  
   M A S O N is valid and covers new letters M, O.

Between SANTA (Case 1) and MASON (Case 2), both are legal, but MASON tests three new letters (M, O, N) while keeping S and A, and it puts N in position 5 which is allowed. So MASON seems the better next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering many possibilities. However, I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better because it includes the letter I (another vowel) and the common letter E, along with R, S which are also very common. 

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""RAISE"" for this first guess as it hits several high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second spot) (✓).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Second letter is A.
- S is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position (and not in the 5th because it wasn’t marked ✓ there either).
- The letters R, I, E are eliminated.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A in the correct spot (position 2).
2. Uses S in a new position (positions 1, 3, or 5; position 4 is already excluded).
3. Avoids R, I, E.
4. Introduces other common consonants or vowels to test more letters.

Good candidate letters to add: O, U, T, N, L, D, B, C, G, M, etc.

Let’s try a word that keeps A in the second position and moves S: for instance, S in position 1. Possible words: S A _ _ _. A common 5-letter word starting with SA and avoiding R, I, E is S A L S A, but that repeats S. Another word: S A B L E – but E is excluded. S A U C E – E excluded. S A N D Y – Y is OK, but Y is less common; S A N D S – repeats S. S A M B A – B and M are good to test. That seems decent.

Alternatively, keep S in position 3: _ _ S _ _. A in 2nd: _ A S _ _. Possible words: C A S T S – but S at 5th might be a repeat, and T and C are good. C A S T S is not valid. C A S T S is actually 5 letters but not a word. C A S T _ – C A S T S is not right. C A S T E – E excluded. C A S T S is invalid. Let me think of a valid word: M A S T S – no. C A S T S – no. Maybe C A S T S is not valid. Perhaps better to try another word.

Another option: S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S. A in 2nd: _ A _ _ S. Possible words: B A N K S – B, N, K, S; S is already confirmed in word but position 5 is new. This tests B, N, K. Seems good.

Let me choose B A N K S as the next guess. It keeps A in 2nd, places S in 5th (new spot), and tests B, N, K.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: BANKS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - A is fixed in position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (since in RAISE it was in 4 and got “-” and in BANKS it was in 5 and again got “-”). So S must be in position 1 or 3.

2. BANKS → B(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x) S(-)  
   - B and K are not in the word at all.  
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - A stays correct in position 2.  
   - S again moves (now from 5) and still is “-”, confirming it must be in position 1 or 3.

So far:
- Known pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters that must appear: S, N  
- S must be in 1 or 3  
- N must be anywhere except 3  
- Eliminated letters so far: R, I, E, B, K  

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ _, contain both S and N, with S in 1 or 3, and N not in 3.

Case 1: S in position 1 → S A _ _ _
   Need N somewhere in 3,4,5 and no B,K,R,I,E.
   Possible words:  
   - S A N _ _  →  SANER (but R is out)  
   - S A N D Y (Y never tested, but D is okay) – but we prefer to test more common letters.  
   - S A N D S – S repeats, not ideal.  
   - S A N T A – T and A already okay.  
   - S A N T A – valid word.

Case 2: S in position 3 → _ A S _ _
   Need N somewhere else, not 3.  
   Words: C A S T N – not valid.  
   L A S S O – S repeats.  
   M A S O N – uses M, O, N; N in 5 is allowed.  
   T A S T E – E eliminated.  
   M A S O N is valid and covers new letters M, O.

Between SANTA (Case 1) and MASON (Case 2), both are legal, but MASON tests three new letters (M, O, N) while keeping S and A, and it puts N in position 5 which is allowed. So MASON seems the better next guess.

Let me consolidate what we know so far:

1. Position 2 is locked to A: _ A _ _ _
2. S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from MASON it was in 3 and got ""-"" again).  
   That leaves only two places S can be:
   - Position 1 (but in BANKS position 1 was B, so if S were there we’d have seen ""✓"" or ""-"" for that B, and we didn’t even have S tested at 1 yet)  
   - Actually, let’s double-check:  
     – RAISE had S in 4 → ""-""  
     – BANKS had S in 5 → ""-""  
     – MASON had S in 3 → ""-""  
   So S is not allowed in 3, 4, or 5. The only remaining place for S is position 1.

   Therefore: S A _ _ _ (and S must be at 1).

3. N is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from BANKS and MASON feedback).  
   So N must be in position 4.  
   Current pattern: S A _ N _

4. Eliminated letters so far: R, I, E, B, K, M, O.  
   We still need one more letter for position 3. Possible candidates from unused common letters: D, T, L, C, G, F, H, U, Y, etc.

5. We want a valid 5-letter English word that starts with SA, has N at 4, and avoids all eliminated letters.

Looking at that pattern (S A _ N _), valid words:
- S A N D S – D is OK, but S repeats at 5 which we already have in 1; not ideal.
- S A N T A – T is OK, but we already know N is at 4, so S A N T A has N at 3 (disallowed) – invalid.
- S A I N T – I is eliminated.
- S A P N E – E eliminated.
- S A L N _ – no common word.
- S A L N Y – not a word.
- S A L N T – not a word.
- S A D N Y – not a word.
Wait, let’s list actual dictionary entries:

- S A L N T – none.
- S A L T Y – T is OK, but N is missing.
- S A L S A – S repeats and N missing.
- S A N G A – G OK, but N at 3 disallowed.
- S A L M S – M eliminated, S repeats.
- S A L T Y – again N missing.
Wait, let’s step back.

Actually, S A _ N _ must be filled with an unused letter in the 3rd place. Common letters left: T, D, L, C, G, F, H, U, Y.

Possible words:
- S A L T Y – no N.
- S A D D Y – no N.
- S A C N E – not a word.
- S A G N A – not a word.
- S A T N _ – not a word.
- S A U N A – yes! S A U N A is a valid word: S(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5).  
  – A is already confirmed at 2; repeating A at 5 is allowed.  
  – U is new and untested.  
  – No eliminated letters used (no R, I, E, B, K, M, O).

So SAUNA fits perfectly and tests the new letter U.
