For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best first guesses in Wordle typically include common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Common letters in English (especially in 5-letter words) include: A, E, T, O, N, I, S, H, R, D, L, C.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Include multiple vowels
3. Avoid repeating letters (to maximize information)

Popular and effective first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, etc.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters
- Covers many common letters efficiently

The feedback from ARISE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(-) : R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x) : I is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, E
2. Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: A (not in spot 1), R (not in spot 2)
3. We need a word that contains A and R, does NOT contain I, S, or E, and moves A and R to new positions.

Possible letters to use: A, R plus consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. and the remaining vowels O, U.

Good second-guess principles:
- Try to place the known letters (A, R) in new positions.
- Include new common letters to test.
- Avoid using letters we know aren't in the word (I, S, E).

A good candidate is ""TROAD"" but that's not a common word. ""CART"" is too short. ""RADIO"" has I which we know is out. ""RATIO"" same issue. ""ROUND"" doesn't have A. 

Looking for 5-letter words with A and R, avoiding I, S, E:
- TRAMP? No S but has M,P
- TRAIN? Has I (invalid)
- CRANK? Has N,K but no A
- DRANK? Has A and R, but E is out so K is okay
Wait, ""DRANK"" has D,R,A,N,K - but we need to check if it uses all constraints:
- Has A and R ✔
- No I, S, E ✔
- Moves A from position 1 to 4, R from position 2 to 2 (same position - bad, R must move)

Better: ""DARN"" is too short. ""DARN"" is 4 letters.

Looking at 5-letter words with A and R moved:
- PLACR? Not a word
- BORAL? Not common
- MORAL - has A and R, positions: M(1),O(2),R(3),A(4),L(5)
  - A moves from 1→4 (good)
  - R moves from 2→3 (good)

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Known letters:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from CAROL feedback).

Known positions:
- A is somewhere other than position 2 (from ARISE and CAROL both showing A in but wrong spot).
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from CAROL feedback).

Letters NOT in the word:
- I, S, E (from ARISE)
- C, L (from CAROL)

So the mystery word:
- Has R in position 3.
- Contains A and O somewhere.
- Does NOT contain C, L, I, S, E.

Possible remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven’t ruled out (only A and O confirmed; U is still possible, Y sometimes acts as a vowel).

A good candidate must:
1. Place R in position 3.
2. Move A to a new spot (cannot be 2).
3. Include O in a spot other than 4.
4. Use only allowed letters.

Let’s build a valid pattern: _ _ R _ _

We need to place A and O. Possible locations:
- A could be 1, 3 (but 3 is R), 4, or 5. 2 is out.
- O could be 1, 2, 3 (taken by R), or 5. 4 is out.

So valid placements:
Option 1: A at 1, O at 2 or 5.
Option 2: A at 4 or 5, O at 1 or 2.

Let’s test Option 1:
A _ R _ _ with O at 2 gives A O R _ _
Available letters for 4,5 (excluding banned): D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A five-letter word AOR?? Not obvious. Let’s think of real words:
- AORTA? Contains T and A again (duplicate A not helpful), but does it fit constraints?
   - A(1),O(2),R(3),T(4),A(5) -> duplicate A isn’t forbidden, but let’s check:
   - R is in 3 (good)
   - A is in 1 (moved from 2, good)
   - O is in 2 (moved from 4, good)
   - Uses T which is allowed.
   - No banned letters.
AORTA seems valid, but T is new info.

Option 2: A at 4, O at 2:
_ O R A _
Need first and last letters from remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,Y,Z.

Common five-letter words fitting _ O R A _:
- BORAX? X allowed.
- FORAY? Y allowed.
- MORAL? Already tried, L banned.
- PORAL? Not a word.
- TORAH? H allowed.

TORAH is a word:
- T(1),O(2),R(3),A(4),H(5)
- R is in 3 ✓
- A is in 4 (moved from 2) ✓
- O is in 2 (moved from 4) ✓
- Uses new letters T,H
- No banned letters.

Between AORTA and TORAH, TORAH tests more new letters (T,H) and is more likely in Wordle dictionary. So I’ll go with TORAH.

A _ R _ _ with O at 2 gives A O R _ _
Available letters for 4,5 (excluding banned): D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A five-letter word AOR?? Not obvious. Let’s think of real words:
- AORTA? Contains T and A again (duplicate A not helpful), but does it fit constraints?
   - A(1),O(2),R(3),T(4),A(5) -> duplicate A isn’t forbidden, but let’s check:
   - R is in 3 (good)
   - A is in 1 (moved from 2, good)
   - O is in 2 (moved from 4, good)
   - Uses T which is allowed.
   - No banned letters.
AORTA seems valid, but T is new info.

Option 2: A at 4, O at 2:
_ O R A _
Need first and last letters from remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,Y,Z.

Common five-letter words fitting _ O R A _:
- BORAX? X allowed.
- FORAY? Y allowed.
- MORAL? Already tried, L banned.
- PORAL? Not a word.
- TORAH? H allowed.

TORAH is a word:
- T(1),O(2),R(3),A(4),H(5)
- R is in 3 ✓
- A is in 4 (moved from 2) ✓
- O is in 2 (moved from 4) ✓
- Uses new letters T,H
- No banned letters.

Between AORTA and TORAH, TORAH tests more new letters (T,H) and is more likely in Wordle dictionary. So I’ll go with TORAH.",Guess 3: TORAH -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) H(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,borax,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best first guesses in Wordle typically include common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Common letters in English (especially in 5-letter words) include: A, E, T, O, N, I, S, H, R, D, L, C.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Include multiple vowels
3. Avoid repeating letters (to maximize information)

Popular and effective first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, etc.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters
- Covers many common letters efficiently

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from ARISE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(-) : R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x) : I is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, E
2. Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: A (not in spot 1), R (not in spot 2)
3. We need a word that contains A and R, does NOT contain I, S, or E, and moves A and R to new positions.

Possible letters to use: A, R plus consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. and the remaining vowels O, U.

Good second-guess principles:
- Try to place the known letters (A, R) in new positions.
- Include new common letters to test.
- Avoid using letters we know aren't in the word (I, S, E).

A good candidate is ""TROAD"" but that's not a common word. ""CART"" is too short. ""RADIO"" has I which we know is out. ""RATIO"" same issue. ""ROUND"" doesn't have A. 

Looking for 5-letter words with A and R, avoiding I, S, E:
- TRAMP? No S but has M,P
- TRAIN? Has I (invalid)
- CRANK? Has N,K but no A
- DRANK? Has A and R, but E is out so K is okay
Wait, ""DRANK"" has D,R,A,N,K - but we need to check if it uses all constraints:
- Has A and R ✔
- No I, S, E ✔
- Moves A from position 1 to 4, R from position 2 to 2 (same position - bad, R must move)

Better: ""DARN"" is too short. ""DARN"" is 4 letters.

Looking at 5-letter words with A and R moved:
- PLACR? Not a word
- BORAL? Not common
- MORAL - has A and R, positions: M(1),O(2),R(3),A(4),L(5)
  - A moves from 1→4 (good)
  - R moves from 2→3 (good)
  - Contains no I,S,E
  - Uses new letters M,O,L

""MORAL"" seems like a solid choice.

Alternative: ""CAROL"" - has C,A,R,O,L
  - A: 1→3
  - R: 2→4
  - No I,S,E
  - Tests C,O,L

Between MORAL and CAROL, both are good. I'll go with CAROL as C is slightly more common than M in first position.

<guess>CAROL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CAROL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(✓) O(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Known letters:
- R is in the word and is in position 3 (from CAROL feedback).

Known positions:
- A is somewhere other than position 2 (from ARISE and CAROL both showing A in but wrong spot).
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from CAROL feedback).

Letters NOT in the word:
- I, S, E (from ARISE)
- C, L (from CAROL)

So the mystery word:
- Has R in position 3.
- Contains A and O somewhere.
- Does NOT contain C, L, I, S, E.

Possible remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven’t ruled out (only A and O confirmed; U is still possible, Y sometimes acts as a vowel).

A good candidate must:
1. Place R in position 3.
2. Move A to a new spot (cannot be 2).
3. Include O in a spot other than 4.
4. Use only allowed letters.

Let’s build a valid pattern: _ _ R _ _

We need to place A and O. Possible locations:
- A could be 1, 3 (but 3 is R), 4, or 5. 2 is out.
- O could be 1, 2, 3 (taken by R), or 5. 4 is out.

So valid placements:
Option 1: A at 1, O at 2 or 5.
Option 2: A at 4 or 5, O at 1 or 2.

Let’s test Option 1:
A _ R _ _ with O at 2 gives A O R _ _
Available letters for 4,5 (excluding banned): D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A five-letter word AOR?? Not obvious. Let’s think of real words:
- AORTA? Contains T and A again (duplicate A not helpful), but does it fit constraints?
   - A(1),O(2),R(3),T(4),A(5) -> duplicate A isn’t forbidden, but let’s check:
   - R is in 3 (good)
   - A is in 1 (moved from 2, good)
   - O is in 2 (moved from 4, good)
   - Uses T which is allowed.
   - No banned letters.
AORTA seems valid, but T is new info.

Option 2: A at 4, O at 2:
_ O R A _
Need first and last letters from remaining: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,Y,Z.

Common five-letter words fitting _ O R A _:
- BORAX? X allowed.
- FORAY? Y allowed.
- MORAL? Already tried, L banned.
- PORAL? Not a word.
- TORAH? H allowed.

TORAH is a word:
- T(1),O(2),R(3),A(4),H(5)
- R is in 3 ✓
- A is in 4 (moved from 2) ✓
- O is in 2 (moved from 4) ✓
- Uses new letters T,H
- No banned letters.

Between AORTA and TORAH, TORAH tests more new letters (T,H) and is more likely in Wordle dictionary. So I’ll go with TORAH.
