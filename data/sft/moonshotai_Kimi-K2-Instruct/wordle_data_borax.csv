For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) which we can then use to inform our next guesses.

We just learned:

- Letters A, R, and O are all in the secret word but in wrong positions.
- Letters S and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- A (not in spot 1)
- R (not in spot 2)
- O (not in spot 3)
- Definitely no S or E anywhere.

To make a fresh guess, I want to reuse A, R, and O while introducing new common consonants that weren’t in AROSE (e.g., T, N, L, etc.) and keeping them out of their previous disallowed positions.

One convenient word that satisfies these constraints is “RATIO”:
- It uses R, A, T, I, O.
- R is moved from position 2 to position 1 (allowed).
- A is moved from position 1 to position 2 (allowed).
- O is moved from position 3 to position 5 (allowed).
- T and I are new letters that were not in AROSE.
- No S or E appears.

This will let us test new letters while also repositioning the confirmed letters A, R, and O.

2. Avoids placing A in spot 1, R in spot 2, O in spot 3 (from the first guess) and also R in spot 1, A in spot 2, O in spot 5 (from the second guess).
3. Contains no S, E, T, or I.

- Uses C, A, R, O, M — none of the forbidden letters.
- A is in spot 2, which was forbidden in Guess 1 but allowed here.

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _ with A and O somewhere in the remaining four slots (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).

Valid remaining letters (unused so far, and not ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3  
- Uses A and O in any of positions 1, 4, or 5 (since A≠2, O≠4)  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set above  
- Is a common English word

A convenient word is BORAL:
- B is new and allowed  
- O is in position 2 (but this is only position 2, and we only know O is not in position 3 or 4 — position 2 is fine)  
- R is correctly in position 3  
- A is in position 4 (but we know from Guess 3 that A is not in position 2, but position 4 is fine)  
- L is new and allowed  

Wait, actually from Guess 3 feedback we have O(-) meaning O is in the word but not in position 4. So position 2 for O is allowed. And A is in the word but not in position 2, so position 4 for A is fine.

So BORAL fits these constraints.

Let's check:
- Position 1: B (new, allowed)
- Position 2: O (allowed, since O is not excluded from position 2)
- Position 3: R (correct position per feedback)
- Position 4: A (allowed, since only excluded from position 2)
- Position 5: L (new, allowed)

BORAL is a valid word meaning a type of soil layer, so it's acceptable.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives us a good chance of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) which we can then use to inform our next guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We just learned:

- Letters A, R, and O are all in the secret word but in wrong positions.
- Letters S and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- A (not in spot 1)
- R (not in spot 2)
- O (not in spot 3)
- Definitely no S or E anywhere.

To make a fresh guess, I want to reuse A, R, and O while introducing new common consonants that weren’t in AROSE (e.g., T, N, L, etc.) and keeping them out of their previous disallowed positions.

One convenient word that satisfies these constraints is “RATIO”:
- It uses R, A, T, I, O.
- R is moved from position 2 to position 1 (allowed).
- A is moved from position 1 to position 2 (allowed).
- O is moved from position 3 to position 5 (allowed).
- T and I are new letters that were not in AROSE.
- No S or E appears.

This will let us test new letters while also repositioning the confirmed letters A, R, and O.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only the letters {A, R, O} plus any of the unused consonants above.
2. Avoids placing A in spot 1, R in spot 2, O in spot 3 (from the first guess) and also R in spot 1, A in spot 2, O in spot 5 (from the second guess).
3. Contains no S, E, T, or I.

- A is in spot 2, which was forbidden in Guess 1 but allowed here.
- R is in spot 3, which was not forbidden before.

- BOARD → uses D, and is a common word matching B O R A _  
- BORAX → uses X (but X hasn’t been ruled out either)  
- BORAM → uses M (M is ruled out)  
- BORAN → uses N (N is allowed)  

Between BOARD and BORAN, “BOARD” is the more common word and D hasn’t been tried yet, so it’s the safest next guess.

From guess 4 we know the first four letters are correct and in the right places:  
B(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) _   → so the word is B O R A _  

Guess 5 (BOARD) gave:  
B(✓) O(✓) A(-) R(-) D(x)

– This shows A and R are correct letters but are in the wrong positions in BOARD.  
But we already knew from guess 4 that B, O, R, A are the first four letters in that order.  
Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the fifth letter must be different from D and must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters ruled out so far (across all guesses):  
S, E, T, I, C, M, L, D  

Still-available letters that have not appeared anywhere:  
F, G, H, N, P, U, V, W, Y  

Among these, the most common 5-letter word starting with B O R A is BORAN (a proper noun used in English dictionaries). Other possibilities like BORAX, BORAH, etc., either repeat ruled-out letters or are less common. BORAN is valid and uses N, which has not been tested.

Hence the only remaining logical word is BORAN.
