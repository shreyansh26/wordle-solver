Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It has 2 common vowels (A, E)
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
- The combination allows us to test multiple common letters at once

From the feedback for SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.  
- E is in the word but not in the last position (it was in position 5).  
- L, A, T are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
Position 1: S (fixed)
Positions 2–5: cannot contain L, A, T; position 5 cannot contain E.

I want to test a new set of common consonants and a new vowel placement, while keeping S in place. Using common letters not yet ruled out (like N, R, I, O) and moving E to a different position seems wise.

A word like “SNORE” would:
- keep S fixed,
- try N, R, O (none ruled out yet),
- place E in position 4 (eliminating position 5 as a location for E),
- and give us the vowel O to test.

So far we know:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain: L, A, T, N, O.
3. The letters R and E are in the word but are in the wrong positions (both appeared as “-” in Guess 2).  
   – In SNORE, R was in position 4 and E in position 5, so R ≠ 4 and E ≠ 5.
4. Still-valid letters include (among others): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s find a word that starts with S and places R and E in new positions while using fresh consonants.

A good candidate is “SPERM”:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- P, M were never tried.
- E is moved to position 2 (allowed because E ≠ 5).
- R is moved to position 3 (allowed because R ≠ 4).
- No forbidden letters (L, A, T, N, O) are used.

This tests new positions for R and E and adds two fresh consonants.

After three guesses we have:

1. S _ _ _ _ is fixed.
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, N, O, M  
   (from SLATE, SNORE, SPERM feedback).
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   P, E, R (each showed “-” in SPERM, so none are in the positions we just tried).

From SPERM:  
- P was in position 2 → P ≠ 2  
- E was in position 3 → E ≠ 3  
- R was in position 4 → R ≠ 4  

We also know:  
- E ≠ 5 (from SLATE)  
- R ≠ 4 (from SPERM)  
- E ≠ 3 (from SPERM)  

So possible new placements for E: positions 2 or 4.  
Possible new placements for R: positions 2, 3, 5.

We need a 5-letter word:
- starts with S  
- contains E and R exactly once each  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out  
- places E and R in NEW positions

Valid letters left include (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to put E in position 2 and R in position 5 (both are newly allowed positions).  
We then need a consonant for positions 3 and 4.

A very common pattern: S E _ _ R

To maximize information, choose unused common consonants.  
Try “SEWER”:
- S fixed at 1 ✓  
- E at 2 (new position for E) ✓  
- W at 3 (never tried) ✓  
- E again at 4 (but we already have E in 2, and E can only appear once) ❌  
So “SEWER” is invalid (double E).

Instead, “SEVER”:
- S, E, V, E, R → double E again ❌

“SEDER” (if “SEDER” is a valid word) → double E again ❌

How about “SHEER” → again double E ❌

We need a word with only ONE E and ONE R.

Let’s choose “SPEAR”:
- but A is ruled out ❌

“SPIRE”:
- S P I R E → uses I, P, R, E  
- P at 2 (new for P) ✓  
- I at 3 (new letter) ✓  
- R at 4 (but we know from SPERM that R ≠ 4) ❌

“SPRIE” is not a word.

“SIREN” → N is ruled out ❌

“SIZER” → Z is allowed, but R at 4 again ❌

“SUGAR” → A is ruled out ❌

“SUPER”:
- S U P E R  
- P at 3 (new for P) ✓  
- E at 4 (new for E) ✓  
- R at 5 (new for R) ✓  
- U at 2 (new letter) ✓  
- No ruled-out letters.  
This satisfies all constraints.

<guess>SUPER</guess>",SUPER,"After three guesses we have:

1. S _ _ _ _ is fixed.
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, N, O, M  
   (from SLATE, SNORE, SPERM feedback).
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   P, E, R (each showed “-” in SPERM, so none are in the positions we just tried).

From SPERM:  
- P was in position 2 → P ≠ 2  
- E was in position 3 → E ≠ 3  
- R was in position 4 → R ≠ 4  

We also know:  
- E ≠ 5 (from SLATE)  
- R ≠ 4 (from SPERM)  
- E ≠ 3 (from SPERM)  

So possible new placements for E: positions 2 or 4.  
Possible new placements for R: positions 2, 3, 5.

We need a 5-letter word:
- starts with S  
- contains E and R exactly once each  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out  
- places E and R in NEW positions

Valid letters left include (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to put E in position 2 and R in position 5 (both are newly allowed positions).  
We then need a consonant for positions 3 and 4.

A very common pattern: S E _ _ R

To maximize information, choose unused common consonants.  
Try “SEWER”:
- S fixed at 1 ✓  
- E at 2 (new position for E) ✓  
- W at 3 (never tried) ✓  
- E again at 4 (but we already have E in 2, and E can only appear once) ❌  
So “SEWER” is invalid (double E).
