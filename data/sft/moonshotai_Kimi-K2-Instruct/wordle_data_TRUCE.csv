For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should have no repeating letters and include a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S) without repeating any letters.

The feedback from AROSE (A x, R ✓, O x, S x, E ✓) tells us:

- R is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- E is in the word and in the 5th position.
- A, O, and S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern looks like: _ R _ _ E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Does not contain A, O, S.

Letters we can still use (excluding A, O, S): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- B R I D E
- C R I M E
- D R I V E
- F R I E D
- G R I P E
- H O R S E (but O and S are excluded)
- I R O N E (but O is excluded)
- K N I V E (but E is 5th, so K N I V E is invalid)
- P R I C E
- T R I P E

From these, ""PRICE"" seems like a good candidate because:
- P, R, I, C, E are all allowed.

Current constraints:

   - Remaining usable letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus E and R already placed.
3. Third and fourth positions need new letters; C is already found to be in the word but position unknown.  

From Guess 1 & 2 we know:
- C is in the word but not in 4th position ⇒ C must be in 3rd or 4th.  
- However, PRICE had C in 4th with feedback “C(✓)” meaning C is actually in the word and IN THE 4TH POSITION.
