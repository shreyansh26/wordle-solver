This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in strategic positions. A good starting word should:
1. Use frequently occurring letters in English (vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Avoid rare letters to increase the chance of hitting correct letters
3. Ideally contain 2-3 vowels to test vowel positions

Popular starter words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
- S is a very common starting letter
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants, giving good coverage
- The letter positions provide good discrimination potential

- MIDGE – uses I and D, G, but G is mid-frequency.  
- HUMID – uses H, U, M, I, but repeats no letters.  
- DUMPY – uses D, U, M, P, but Y is unlikely.  
- MOUND – uses M, O (but O already eliminated).

Current information:
- E is locked in position 5.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 1.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from Guess 3 feedback) → possible positions 1, 3, 4.
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, H, D, U.

From this we deduce:
1. Word starts with N (since N must be in position 1).
2. Word ends with E.
3. I must appear in position 2, 3, or 4, but NOT 2 (from Guess 3), so positions 3 or 4.
4. We need two more distinct letters from remaining pool: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Best approach is to test common remaining consonants. Good candidates:
- N I _ _ E → positions 3 & 4 to fill
- Common remaining letters: G, K, M, P, V

Let's choose ""N I K _ E"" or ""N I M _ E"". The word ""NIMBE"" uses M and B which are both common. However, let's check if ""NIMBE"" is valid - yes, it's a valid word (archaic past tense of ""nim"").

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We know:
- N appears somewhere, but not in position 4.

Popular remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P

I want to test several new letters at once while placing N in a fresh spot.  
Candidate words:  
- PRUNE – P and U are still untested, but P is less common.

But N must appear once, and we have to include it.  

Let’s rework: After eliminating C, R, O, S, L, A, T, the next most common letters are D, G, H, I, K, M, N, U.  

A good 5-letter word that uses N in a new position and introduces fresh letters:  
“UNDUE” – but repeats U, not ideal.  
“HINDU” – H, I, N, D, U; places N in position 3 (new for N) and tests four new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. The last letter is E (position 5) and is fixed.
2. N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (all shown “-” so far) → impossible, because the word only has five positions and position 5 is already E.  
   This contradiction tells us our earlier assumption was wrong: the feedback symbol “-” only means “letter is in the word but NOT in this exact spot”; it does NOT forbid every other position simultaneously.  
   Therefore N must be in exactly one of positions 1-4, and we simply haven’t placed it correctly yet.

3. I is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 3) and not in position 3 (from Guess 4).  
   So I must be in position 1 or 4.

4. Letters already eliminated:  
   S, L, A, T, C, R, O, H, D, U, M, B  
   (plus the earlier S, L, A, T).  
   Remaining common consonants: F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: none, since A, O, U are out and E is fixed; we only have I left.

5. Structure so far:  
   _ _ _ _ E  
   with N and I somewhere in the first four positions, and two other distinct letters from the remaining pool.

6. Try to construct a valid word:
   - Case 1: I in position 1 → I _ N _ E     → “IN _ _ E” → “INVOKE” too long, “INGLE” uses G and L but L is eliminated.  
   - Case 2: I in position 4 → _ _ _ I E  
     We need N somewhere in positions 1-3.  
     Candidate: F I N I E – repeats I, invalid.  
     Candidate: K I N I E – same.  
     Candidate: P I N E ?  – “PINE” is four letters; add one more consonant.  
     Real word: “PINK E” – no.  
     Real word: “W I N G E” – W, I, N, G, E → “WINGE” (valid).

The word “WINGE” uses only allowed letters (W, I, N, G, E), places I in position 2 (but we now know I cannot be in position 2). Wait – that violates point 3! So discard.

Another candidate: “F I N G E” → “FINGE” – valid word (archaic “finge”).  
But again I is in position 2; not allowed.

Next candidate: N I _ _ E is out because N can’t be in position 1 (Guess 4 showed N(-) there).  
So N must be in position 2, 3 or 4, and I must be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try “V I N E” – too short.  

Best remaining simple word that fits: “K I N G E” → no, G in position 3 needs to be tested.

Actually, the simplest valid word left is “P I N G E” – no, that’s “PINGE”.

Real, common word that fits: “N I K E” – too short.

Wait, let’s step back systematically:

Letters still allowed:  
Vowels: I  
Consonants: F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both N and I exactly once each, and two other distinct consonants from the allowed list.

List every possible pattern with E fixed at 5:

Pattern 1: N  I  _  _  E  – impossible because N can’t be in position 1 (Guess 4 showed N(-) there).  
Pattern 2: I  N  _  _  E  – I in 1 (allowed), N in 2 (new).  
   Candidate: I N F _ E – “INFUSE” too long.  
   Candidate: I N G E – too short.  
   Candidate: I N K E – too short.  
   Candidate: I N V E – too short.  
   Real word: “INKLE” – L is eliminated.  
   Real word: “INURE” – U eliminated.  
   Real word: “INNER” – R eliminated.  

Pattern 3: I  _  N  _  E  – I in 1, N in 3.  
   Candidate: I _ N _ E → consonants needed at 2 and 4.  
   Real word: “INANE” – A eliminated.  
   Real word: “INGNE” – invalid.  
   Real word: “INKNE” – invalid.  

Pattern 4: _  I  N  _  E  – I in 2, N in 3.  
   Candidate: _ I N _ E → consonants at 1 and 4.  
   Real word: “P I N K E” – “PINKE” (valid variant spelling).  
   Real word: “V I N G E” – “VINGE” (valid).  

Pattern 5: _  _  I  N  E  – I in 3, N in 4.  
   Candidate: _ _ I N E → consonants at 1 and 2.  
   Real word: “F I N E” – too short.  
   Real word: “W I N E” – too short.  
   Real word: “P I N E” – too short.  
   Real word: “K I N E” – too short.  

Pattern 6: _  _  _  I  E  – I in 4, N somewhere 1-3.  
   Candidate: N _ _ I E – N in 1 (invalid).  
   Candidate: _ N _ I E – N in 2.  
      Real word: “K N I F E” – K, N, I, F, E → “KNIFE”.  
      Letters used: K, N, I, F, E – all allowed.  
   Candidate: _ _ N I E – N in 3.  
      Real word: “P O N I E” – O eliminated.  
      Real word: “F U N I E” – U eliminated.  

The only fully valid candidate that survives all constraints is “KNIFE”.

It satisfies:
- Ends in E.
- Contains N (position 2) and I (position 4) exactly once.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: K, N, I, F, E.
- No eliminated letters appear.

Therefore the next guess is “KNIFE”.

<guess>KNIFE</guess>",KNIFE,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. The last letter is E (position 5) and is fixed.
2. N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (all shown “-” so far) → impossible, because the word only has five positions and position 5 is already E.  
   This contradiction tells us our earlier assumption was wrong: the feedback symbol “-” only means “letter is in the word but NOT in this exact spot”; it does NOT forbid every other position simultaneously.  
   Therefore N must be in exactly one of positions 1-4, and we simply haven’t placed it correctly yet.

3. I is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 3) and not in position 3 (from Guess 4).  
   So I must be in position 1 or 4.

4. Letters already eliminated:  
   S, L, A, T, C, R, O, H, D, U, M, B  
   (plus the earlier S, L, A, T).  
   Remaining common consonants: F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: none, since A, O, U are out and E is fixed; we only have I left.

5. Structure so far:  
   _ _ _ _ E  
   with N and I somewhere in the first four positions, and two other distinct letters from the remaining pool.

6. Try to construct a valid word:
   - Case 1: I in position 1 → I _ N _ E     → “IN _ _ E” → “INVOKE” too long, “INGLE” uses G and L but L is eliminated.  
   - Case 2: I in position 4 → _ _ _ I E  
     We need N somewhere in positions 1-3.  
     Candidate: F I N I E – repeats I, invalid.  
     Candidate: K I N I E – same.  
     Candidate: P I N E ?  – “PINE” is four letters; add one more consonant.  
     Real word: “PINK E” – no.  
     Real word: “W I N G E” – W, I, N, G, E → “WINGE” (valid).

The word “WINGE” uses only allowed letters (W, I, N, G, E), places I in position 2 (but we now know I cannot be in position 2). Wait – that violates point 3! So discard.

Another candidate: “F I N G E” → “FINGE” – valid word (archaic “finge”).  
But again I is in position 2; not allowed.

Next candidate: N I _ _ E is out because N can’t be in position 1 (Guess 4 showed N(-) there).  
So N must be in position 2, 3 or 4, and I must be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try “V I N E” – too short.  

Best remaining simple word that fits: “K I N G E” → no, G in position 3 needs to be tested.

Actually, the simplest valid word left is “P I N G E” – no, that’s “PINGE”.

Real, common word that fits: “N I K E” – too short.

Wait, let’s step back systematically:

Letters still allowed:  
Vowels: I  
Consonants: F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.
