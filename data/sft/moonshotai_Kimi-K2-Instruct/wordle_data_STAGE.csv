For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good first word should have:
1. Common vowels like A, E, I
2. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's particularly strong - it covers R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters in English words. This gives good coverage across vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓)

So we know:
1. Word ends with E
2. Contains A and S, but A is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4
3. Does NOT contain R or I

Good letters to try next: A, S, E (known), plus common consonants not yet used like T, N, L, C, D. We should avoid R and I.

Possible positions:
- A can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E)
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E)

Let's try a word that shifts A and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""STANE"" would move S to position 1 and A to position 3 while adding T and N. But ""STANE"" isn't a common word. ""CHASE"" would be better - C, H, A, S, E. This moves A to position 3, S to position 4 (but S was in 4 before and got ""-"", so that's bad). 

Better: ""PEANS"" - but feedback says E is at position 5. ""PEASE"" - but that repeats E. 

Let's try ""LANCE"" - L, A, N, C, E. This puts A in position 2 (but A was in 2 and got ""-""), so that's bad. 

Good option: ""LEASE"" - but that repeats E and S. 

Another: ""SALVE"" - S, A, L, V, E. This puts S in 1, A in 2 (but A was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""CANES"" - but E must be last. 

""NAMES"" - N, A, M, E, S. This puts A in 2 (was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""CASTE"" - C, A, S, T, E. This moves A to 2 (was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""PANES"" - P, A, N, E, S. A in 2 is bad. 

""WASTE"" - W, A, S, T, E. A in 2 is bad. 

Alternative approach: try a word that maximizes new letters while respecting known constraints. We know E is last, and have A and S somewhere else. Try ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. This introduces P, L, T while keeping A but moving it to position 3, and E at 5. This seems good.

But we know S is in the word, so we must include S. 

Let's try ""SALVE"" - but A was in 2 and got ""-"" so this puts A back in 2. 

Best seems ""PEASE"" but repeats E. 

Actually, ""PEASE"" is invalid as 5-letter word (it's 4). 

""STALE"" - S, T, A, L, E. This positions S at 1, A at 3, keeps E at 5. This respects all constraints.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

   - E is confirmed again in position 5.
   - L is not in the word.

So the current confirmed pattern is:
S T A _ E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with STA and ends with E. The missing letter is the 4th position. Common letters that fit this pattern include:

- STAGE
- STAKE
- STALE (already tried, L is out)
- STANE

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,STAGE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good first word should have:
1. Common vowels like A, E, I
2. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's particularly strong - it covers R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters in English words. This gives good coverage across vowels and consonants.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓)

So we know:
1. Word ends with E
2. Contains A and S, but A is not in position 2 and S is not in position 4
3. Does NOT contain R or I

Good letters to try next: A, S, E (known), plus common consonants not yet used like T, N, L, C, D. We should avoid R and I.

Possible positions:
- A can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E)
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by E)

Let's try a word that shifts A and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""STANE"" would move S to position 1 and A to position 3 while adding T and N. But ""STANE"" isn't a common word. ""CHASE"" would be better - C, H, A, S, E. This moves A to position 3, S to position 4 (but S was in 4 before and got ""-"", so that's bad). 

Better: ""PEANS"" - but feedback says E is at position 5. ""PEASE"" - but that repeats E. 

Let's try ""LANCE"" - L, A, N, C, E. This puts A in position 2 (but A was in 2 and got ""-""), so that's bad. 

Good option: ""LEASE"" - but that repeats E and S. 

Another: ""SALVE"" - S, A, L, V, E. This puts S in 1, A in 2 (but A was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""CANES"" - but E must be last. 

""NAMES"" - N, A, M, E, S. This puts A in 2 (was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""CASTE"" - C, A, S, T, E. This moves A to 2 (was in 2 and got ""-""), so bad. 

""PANES"" - P, A, N, E, S. A in 2 is bad. 

""WASTE"" - W, A, S, T, E. A in 2 is bad. 

Alternative approach: try a word that maximizes new letters while respecting known constraints. We know E is last, and have A and S somewhere else. Try ""PLATE"" - P, L, A, T, E. This introduces P, L, T while keeping A but moving it to position 3, and E at 5. This seems good.

But we know S is in the word, so we must include S. 

Let's try ""SALVE"" - but A was in 2 and got ""-"" so this puts A back in 2. 

Best seems ""PEASE"" but repeats E. 

Actually, ""PEASE"" is invalid as 5-letter word (it's 4). 

""STALE"" - S, T, A, L, E. This positions S at 1, A at 3, keeps E at 5. This respects all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- E is correctly placed at the end (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- R and I are not in the word (x)

I'll try ""STALE"" which:
- Has E in position 5 (correct)
- Moves A to position 3 (was in 2)
- Moves S to position 1 (was in 4)
- Adds new letters T and L

So the current confirmed pattern is:
