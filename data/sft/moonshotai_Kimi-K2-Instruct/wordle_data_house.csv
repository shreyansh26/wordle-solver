For a first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. Some good strategies for the first word include:
1. Using common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Using common consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
3. Avoiding repeated letters to maximize information gain

Looking at letter frequency in English, some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- ROATE
- ARISE

Among these, ""ARISE"" stands out because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which occur frequently
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are relatively common in 5-letter words

This should give me good coverage across the alphabet and help identify which vowels and consonants are in the target word.

The first guess ARISE gave us:
- A: not in the word  
- R: not in the word  
- I: not in the word  
- S: correct, in position 4  
- E: correct, in position 5  

Therefore the secret word ends in “SE” and contains neither A, R, nor I.  
We still need to find the first three letters. Good letters to test next are common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P and vowels like O, U.  
A word that fits “_ _ _ S E” and avoids A, R, I while using fresh common letters is “HOUSE”.  
H is common, O and U are vowels we haven’t tested yet, and the S E are already locked in place.
