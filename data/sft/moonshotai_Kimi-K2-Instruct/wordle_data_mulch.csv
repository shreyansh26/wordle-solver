For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes the very common letters S, T, and E, along with A and L. It covers several high-frequency letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Now we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G
- Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 (from SLATE) or 3 (from FLING). So possible positions for L are 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L (but not in positions 2 or 3)
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G

From the remaining common English letters, good candidates are: R, O, U, Y, H, B, C, D, K, M, P, V, W, Z.

Let's try to place L in position 4 or 5 and use other common consonants/vowels. A strong candidate is ""BLOCK"":
- Contains L in position 3 (but we know L can't be in position 3 from FLING feedback - so invalid)
Wait, FLING had L in position 2, feedback was (-) meaning wrong position. SLATE had L in position 2, also (-). So L cannot be in position 2.

Let me correct: L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE position 2 and FLING position 2). So possible positions for L: 1, 4, or 5.

Better candidate: ""WORLD"" - but D is allowed (not eliminated), but let's check letters: W, O, R, L, D. None of the eliminated letters appear. L is in position 4 here - possible.

Another check: ""DROLL"" - but has two L's, and D is allowed, but this might not be optimal.

""WORLD"" seems better for testing multiple new letters.

However, testing common vowels is good. Let's try ""LOUSY"":
- L, O, U, S, Y. S is eliminated, so no.

""LOWLY"":
- L, O, W, L, Y. L is in positions 1 and 4. Both positions are allowed. Letters used: L, O, W, Y - none eliminated.

This seems good as it tests L in positions 1 and 4, and checks O, W, Y which are new.

Let’s re-examine the feedback we have so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   - Contains NO: S, A, T, E  
   - Contains L somewhere (but NOT in position 2)

2. FLING → F(x) L(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   - Contains NO: F, I, N, G  
   - Still contains L somewhere (but NOT in position 2)

What we know:
- The secret word MUST contain the letter L (but it’s not in position 2).  
- The secret word MUST NOT contain S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G.  
- Letters not yet ruled out (besides L) are: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- Uses L exactly once.  
- Uses none of the forbidden letters above.  
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that meet these constraints gives us:
- BLOWY  
- BUMPY  
- CURLY  
- LOWLY

- “CURLY” uses C, U, R, L, Y – none of these letters have been ruled out yet, and L is in position 4 (which is allowed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes the very common letters S, T, and E, along with A and L. It covers several high-frequency letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

- A(x) – the letter A is not in the word.
- T(x) – the letter T is not in the word.

A good candidate word that satisfies these constraints is “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G – none of S, A, T, or E appear.
- The L is in position 2 in this word, so it will test if L can be elsewhere (since feedback said L is in wrong position in SLATE).

3. CURLY → C(-) U(✓) R(x) L(-) Y(x)  
   - U is correct in position 2  
   - C is in the word but not in position 1  
   - L is in the word but not in position 4  
   - Cannot contain R, Y

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ _  (second letter is U)  
- Letters that must appear somewhere: C, L  
- Letters that must NOT appear: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, R, Y  
- L cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from SLATE and CURLY).  
  So L must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Letters still allowed (besides C, L, U): B, D, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- C U L _ _ or C U _ L _ or C U _ _ L  
- _ U C _ L or _ U _ C L or _ U _ L C … (but C must appear and isn’t fixed yet)

Also keep in mind that L must appear once and only in allowed positions.

Let’s list possibilities:

- C U L _ _ : need a third letter not ruled out and a fifth.  
  CU LO? – but O is allowed.  
  CULM_ ?  CULMS?  (5-letter word CULMS exists) – but we’d need to check:  
  CULMS: letters C, U, L, M, S – S is forbidden.  
  CULMX? not a word.  
  CULPA – contains P, A; A is forbidden.

- C U _ L _  
  CU _ L _ : looking for CU?L?.  
  CUBLY – not real.  
  CUCKL – not real.  
  CUDLY – contains D, Y; Y is forbidden.  
  CUHLL – invalid.  
  CUMLY – not real.  
  CUPOL – not real.  
  CUR is out (R).  

- C U _ _ L  
  CU? ? L :  
  CUMUL – contains U twice, but U is already placed once; allowed?  
  CUMUL is a 5-letter word meaning a heap or pile (plural of cumulus in meteorology). Letters: C, U, M, U, L.  
  However U is already confirmed in position 2, so a second U is possible.  
  Does CUMUL use only allowed letters?  
  C, U, M, L – all allowed; no forbidden letters.  
  L is in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore CUMUL is valid under our constraints.

Another candidate:  
C U B _ L – need a 4-letter word ending L, but none come to mind with allowed letters.

Thus the best next guess is CUMUL.

- C U L _ _ or C U _ L _ or C U _ _ L  
- _ U C _ L or _ U _ C L or _ U _ L C … (but C must appear and isn’t fixed yet)

Also keep in mind that L must appear once and only in allowed positions.

Let’s list possibilities:

- C U L _ _ : need a third letter not ruled out and a fifth.  
  CU LO? – but O is allowed.  
  CULM_ ?  CULMS?  (5-letter word CULMS exists) – but we’d need to check:  
  CULMS: letters C, U, L, M, S – S is forbidden.  
  CULMX? not a word.  
  CULPA – contains P, A; A is forbidden.

- C U _ L _  
  CU _ L _ : looking for CU?L?.  
  CUBLY – not real.  
  CUCKL – not real.  
  CUDLY – contains D, Y; Y is forbidden.  
  CUHLL – invalid.  
  CUMLY – not real.  
  CUPOL – not real.  
  CUR is out (R).  

- C U _ _ L  
  CU? ? L :  
  CUMUL – contains U twice, but U is already placed once; allowed?  
  CUMUL is a 5-letter word meaning a heap or pile (plural of cumulus in meteorology). Letters: C, U, M, U, L.  
  However U is already confirmed in position 2, so a second U is possible.  
  Does CUMUL use only allowed letters?  
  C, U, M, L – all allowed; no forbidden letters.  
  L is in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore CUMUL is valid under our constraints.

Another candidate:  
C U B _ L – need a 4-letter word ending L, but none come to mind with allowed letters.

Thus the best next guess is CUMUL.

Let's consolidate all constraints so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)

   - L is in the word, but **not** in position 5.

Current known pattern: _ U _ _ _
Letters confirmed to appear: C, L, M
Letters forbidden: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, R, Y, U (except in position 2)

Positions for letters:
- C must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).
- L must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (can't be 2, 4, or 5 from feedback).
- M must be in positions 1, 2 (already U), 4, or 5 (can't be 3).

Possible positions for L:
- Position 1: L U _ _ _
- Position 3: _ U L _ _
- Position 5: _ U _ _ L

But:
- C must be somewhere (positions 3,4,5) and not in 1.
- M must be somewhere (positions 1,4,5) and not in 3.

Let's explore possible words:

1. L U _ _ _:
   - Need C and M in positions 3,4,5.
   - Possible combinations: L U C M _ or L U _ C M or L U M C _ etc.
   - LUCCM – invalid (not a word).
   - LUMPC – contains P (allowed), but P isn't confirmed.
   - LUMEN – contains E (forbidden).
   - LUMPY – contains Y (forbidden).
   - LUNCH – contains N (forbidden).
   - LUMBO – contains O (allowed), but B isn't confirmed.
   - LUMPS – contains S (forbidden).
   - No valid words here.

2. _ U L _ _:
   - C must be in 4 or 5.
   - M must be in 1, 4, or 5 (can't be 3 as it's L).
   - Possible:
     - M U L C _ – need 5th letter. M U L C H – contains H (allowed), but H isn't confirmed.
     - B U L C M – contains B (allowed), but C must appear (it does here), and positions:
       - B in 1 (allowed), U in 2 (fixed), L in 3 (allowed), C in 4 (allowed), M in 5 (allowed).
       - Check letters: B, U, L, C, M – none forbidden.
       - Check positions: C not in 1 (ok), L not in 2,4,5 (ok), M not in 3 (ok).
       - ""BULCM"" is not a valid English word.
     - P U L C _ – P U L C H – not valid.
     - No valid words.

3. _ U _ _ L:
   - C must be in 3 or 4.
   - M must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is L, so 1 or 4).
   - Possible:
     - M U _ C L – M U D C L – not valid.
     - M U _ _ L – need C in 4: M U _ C L – same as above.
     - _ U M C L – C must be in word (it is), positions:
       - 1st letter: must be allowed (not S,A,T,E,F,I,N,G,R,Y).
       - Possible: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
       - C cannot be in 1 (must be in 3,4,5), so 1st letter must be another allowed letter.

     - No valid words here.

Wait, let's try ""DUMPL"" – but it's not a valid 5-letter word.

Another approach: list valid 5-letter words fitting _ U _ _ L with allowed letters:
- B U _ _ L: BULKY – contains Y (forbidden).
- H U _ _ L: HULLO – contains O (allowed), but missing C and M.
- P U _ _ L: PULPY – contains Y (forbidden).
- M U _ _ L: MULCH – contains C and H, but H isn't confirmed.
  - MULCH: M, U, L, C, H.
    - Letters: M, U, L, C, H – none forbidden.
    - Positions: C not in 1 (ok), L not in 2,4,5 (it's in 3 – ok), M not in 3 (it's in 1 – ok).
    - H is allowed (not forbidden).
    - This seems possible.

Check if MULCH fits all constraints:
- Contains L (in 3), C (in 4), M (in 1), U (in 2).
- No forbidden letters.
- Positions:
  - U is in 2 (matches).
  - C is not in 1 (it's in 4 – ok).
  - L is not in 2,4,5 (it's in 3 – ok).
  - M is not in 3 (it's in 1 – ok).
  - No second U (from CUMUL feedback) – ok.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints appears to be MULCH.
