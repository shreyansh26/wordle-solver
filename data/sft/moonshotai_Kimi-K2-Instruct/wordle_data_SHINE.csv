For the first guess, we want a word that is a valid 5-letter English word and contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include words with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L). 

A good choice would be ""SLATE"" because:
- It uses common letters: S, L, A, T, E
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will give us useful information about possible positions or exclusions

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions (positions 1 and 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
  
We now know the word has the pattern:
S _ _ _ E

We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Ends with E
3. Does not contain L, A, T
4. Uses the remaining letters (and possibly others) in positions 2-4.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: I, O, U

Good next guesses might use common remaining letters. Some possibilities: SINCE (but C is not ruled out), SMILE (but L is ruled out), or SPARE (but A is ruled out). 

A good candidate is ""SINCE"":
- Starts with S, ends with E
- Uses I, N, C (none of which have been ruled out)
- Common word and letters

Another candidate is ""SHINE"":
- Starts with S, ends with E  
- Uses H, I, N (none ruled out)

Current knowledge:

- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: L A T C
- Letters IN the word but not yet placed: I, N

So the word has:
1. S (fixed in position 1)
2. Not L, A, T, C
3. One of I or N must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 2 if I is only in wrong position, since I shows ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2)
4. Ends with E (position 5)

From SINCE feedback:
- I is in the word but not in position 2
- N is in the word but not in position 3

So possible positions:
- I can be in 3 or 4
- N can be in 2 or 4

Possible combinations:
- If I is in 3: N must be in 2 or 4
- If I is in 4: N must be in 2

Let's list possible words:
- S N I _ E → SNIDE (but D not ruled out, but let's check if valid)
- S _ N I E → not common
- S _ I N E → SPINE (but P not ruled out)
- S N _ I E → not common

Looking at valid words:
- SNIDE: S N I D E → uses D (not ruled out), positions: 1=S, 5=E, I in 3 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed)
- SPINE: S P I N E → P not ruled out, N in 4 (allowed), I in 3 (allowed)
- SHINE: S H I N E → H not ruled out, N in 4 (allowed), I in 3 (allowed)

Between these, SHINE is a common word and covers new letter H.

But let's pick one that maximizes information. SPINE introduces P (new letter), SHINE introduces H (new letter), SNIDE introduces D (new letter).

Let's choose SHINE.

Wait, checking:
SHINE:
S(✓) H() I(- but in 3, which is allowed since it was in wrong position in 2) N() E(✓)
This fits all constraints.

But looking back, SNIDE also fits well. Let's go with SNIDE to test D.

Actually, SHINE seems more common and introduces H, which is a common consonant.

Let's pick SHINE.
