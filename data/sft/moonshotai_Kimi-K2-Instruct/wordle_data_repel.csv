For a first guess, it's generally good to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it includes the common letters C, R, A, N, E - covering several vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This gives us a good baseline to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback received.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- The word does NOT contain C, A, or N

A good next guess would use new letters and place R and E in positions they weren't in before. The word ""DRIER"" is tempting but repeats R three times and might not give new information. Instead, let's try ""ROGER"" - it has R in position 1 (not position 2), E in position 4 (not position 5), and introduces new letters O, G while keeping R and E in new positions.

Wait, let's reconsider - we need to avoid letters we've learned are not in the word (C, A, N). ""ROGER"" uses G and O which we haven't tested yet, but let's see if there's a better option.

""THREW"" would be good - it has R in position 3 (not position 2), E in position 4 (not position 5), and introduces T, H, W. But we haven't tested O yet which is common.

""OLDER"" - actually contains N which we know isn't in the word (from CRANE feedback).

""BROKE"" - contains R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), and B, K, O new.

Let's try ""PROVE"" - P,R,O,V,E:
- R in position 2 is known wrong, so this is bad.

From all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, S, T, O, I, F  
Letters that ARE in the word and their confirmed positions so far:
- R is in position 1 (✓ in RIFLE)
- E is in the word (but never in positions 3 or 5) and must appear somewhere else.

Letters still unknown: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Forbidden positions:
- R is locked at position 1
- E cannot be at positions 3 or 5, so possible positions: 2 or 4

Word template: R _ _ _ _ with E in either slot 2 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. R E _ _ _  (E in 2)
2. R _ E _ _  (E in 3 – forbidden, skip)
3. R _ _ E _  (E in 4)
4. R _ _ _ E  (E in 5 – forbidden, skip)

So we have only two viable patterns:
- R E _ _ _
- R _ _ E _

We need to fill the remaining three slots with untested letters.

Looking for common words:
- R E _ _ _: ""REBEL"" uses B and L (L was marked - so possible), but B new.
- R _ _ E _: ""RUGBY"" but B and Y new, G and U new – but let's see if we can narrow better.

Let's choose ""RUGBY"" for the second pattern (R _ _ E _):
- R fixed at 1
- U in 2
- G in 3
- B in 4
- Y in 5

But wait, E must be in 4 (pattern R _ _ E _), so ""RUGBE"" isn't a valid word. Need real words.

Better candidate for R _ _ E _ : ""RIDGE"" – but D and G new, I already ruled out.  
Another: ""RANGE"" – A and N already ruled out.

For R E _ _ _ : ""REBEL"" – B and L new, E in 2, L in 4 was marked - but L could still be in other positions.

Let's try ""REBEL"":
- R in 1 ✓
- E in 2 (new position, allowed)
- B, L new letters
- E in 5 forbidden but here it's in 2 and 5 – double E, but 5 is E which is forbidden. So invalid.

Next: ""REPLY"" – P, L, Y new, E in 2, L in 4 (was marked - for L), but still possible.

Going with ""REPLY"" as it tests new letters efficiently.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This gives us a good baseline to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- The word does NOT contain C, A, or N

A good next guess would use new letters and place R and E in positions they weren't in before. The word ""DRIER"" is tempting but repeats R three times and might not give new information. Instead, let's try ""ROGER"" - it has R in position 1 (not position 2), E in position 4 (not position 5), and introduces new letters O, G while keeping R and E in new positions.

Wait, let's reconsider - we need to avoid letters we've learned are not in the word (C, A, N). ""ROGER"" uses G and O which we haven't tested yet, but let's see if there's a better option.

""THREW"" would be good - it has R in position 3 (not position 2), E in position 4 (not position 5), and introduces T, H, W. But we haven't tested O yet which is common.

""OLDER"" - actually contains N which we know isn't in the word (from CRANE feedback).

""BROKE"" - contains R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), and B, K, O new.

Let's try ""PROVE"" - P,R,O,V,E:
- R in position 2 is known wrong, so this is bad.

""STORE"" - S,T,O,R,E:
- R in new position (3)
- E in new position (4)
- Introduces S,T,O

This seems good - all new letters except R and E which we're testing in new positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, S, T, O  
Letters that ARE in the word: R and E, but
- R must NOT be in positions 2 or 4
- E must NOT be in positions 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids the six letters above, and respects the forbidden positions for R and E.

Some positions R can appear: 1, 3, 5 (but not 2 or 4)  
Some positions E can appear: 1, 2, 4 (but not 3 or 5)

Looking for common valid patterns:

- If R is in position 1, E could be 2 or 4 → e.g., R _ E _ _ or R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 3, E could be 1, 2, 4 → e.g., _ _ R E _, E _ R _ _, _ E R _ _
- If R is in position 5, E could be 1, 2, 4 → e.g., E _ _ _ R, _ E _ _ R, _ _ _ E R

Trying one: R _ E _ _ → ""RULER"" – uses U, L which we haven't tested yet, and keeps R in 1, E in 3 (but E is forbidden in 3) – bad.

Next: R _ _ E _ → ""RIFLE"" – F and I new, R in 1, E in 4 ✔

Another candidate: _ _ R E _ → ""PRIME"" – but P, I, M new. Wait, M not tested yet. But R in 3, E in 4 ✔

Between ""RIFLE"" and ""PRIME"", both are valid. ""RIFLE"" has R in 1, E in 4; ""PRIME"" has R in 3, E in 4. Both are good choices. I'll go with ""RIFLE"".

Need real words.\n\nBetter candidate for R _ _ E _ : ""RIDGE"" – but D and G new, I already ruled out.  \nAnother: ""RANGE"" – A and N already ruled out.\n\nFor R E _ _ _ : ""REBEL"" – B and L new, E in 2, L in 4 was marked - but L could still be in other positions.\n\nLet\'s try ""REBEL"":\n- R in 1 ✓\n- E in 2 (new position, allowed)\n- B, L new letters\n- E in 5 forbidden but here it\'s in 2 and 5 – double E, but 5 is E which is forbidden. So invalid.\n\nNext: ""REPLY"" – P, L, Y new, E in 2, L in 4 (was marked - for L), but still possible.\n\nGoing with ""REPLY"" as it tests new letters efficiently.Based on all feedback:\n- R is locked in position 1\n- E must appear (not in 3 or 5), so likely position 2 or 4\n- Eliminated letters: C,A,N,S,T,O,I,F\n- Testing new letters P,L,Y with pattern R E _ _ _\n\n<guess>REPLY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)\nGuess 3: RIFLE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) F(x) L(-) E(-)\nGuess 4: REPLY -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) P(✓) L(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback:

- R is fixed at position 1 (✓)
- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)
- P is fixed at position 3 (✓)
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Y is not in the word (x)

So far the pattern is: R E P _ _  
Known letters remaining to place: L (must go in 5, since 4 is excluded)

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with R E P _ _ and ending with L.

The only common word that fits is REPEL.

Check letters:
- R, E, P already confirmed in positions 1,2,3
- L must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4)
- E is already used in 2, so position 4 must be a new letter that is allowed
- But we already have R E P _ L, and L must be placed somewhere. The only remaining letter to test for position 4 is from untested letters that fit.

Looking at the word ""REPEL"":
- R E P E L
- E is already in position 2, so position 4 could be E (double E is allowed)
- L is in position 5 which is allowed (since L can't be in 4)
- All other letters (R,E,P) are confirmed in correct positions.

This seems to be the only logical fit.

Given the pattern R E P _ _ and that L must appear (but not in position 4), the only valid word is:
