For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should try to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word. A good candidate is ""ARISE"" because it contains A, R, I, S, E - five of the most common letters.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x): A is NOT in the secret word.
- R(x): R is NOT in the secret word.
- I(x): I is NOT in the secret word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the secret word.
- E(-): E is IN the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not at the end.
2. The letters A, R, I, S are not present at all.

Next guesses should exclude A, R, I, S and should place E somewhere other than the last position. Good consonants left to try are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels we still have are O and U.

A word that uses common letters, includes E (not at the end), and avoids A, R, I, S is ""OCEAN"". However, A is excluded. Another choice: ""TOWER"" – but R is excluded. ""UNMET"" is a possibility, but U is less common. 

Looking for a word without A, R, I, S, with E not at the end: ""PLENT"" is invalid (not a word). ""OCEAN"" is invalid (A). ""ELTON"" is invalid (R isn't there, but T and N are good). ""ELBOW"" – B and W are less common. 

Another good candidate is ""OCEAN"" but A is excluded. ""TULIP"" – I is excluded. ""CLOVE"" has L, O, V, E – avoids excluded letters and has E in position 4. ""CLOVE"" seems strong.

Wait, ""CLOVE"":
- C: not yet tested.
- L: not yet tested.
- O: not yet tested.
- V: not yet tested.
- E: known to be in word, now in position 4 (allowed since E can't be at 5).

""CLOVE"" is a valid word and incorporates new letters while respecting constraints.

However, ""CLOVE"" has V which is less common. Maybe ""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

Alternative: ""ELTON"" is invalid (no R needed). ""ELBOW"" has B and W. 

""ELDON"" – not a word. 

""ELMOT"" – not a word.

""ELMOS"" – S is excluded.

""ELMOC"" – not a word.

""ELDON"" – not a word.

""ELBOW"" – B and W are low frequency.

""ELFIN"" – I is excluded.

""ELBOW"" seems the best among these, but let's see other options.

""ENJOY"" – J and Y are low frequency.

""ENTRY"" – R is excluded.

""ELBOW"" seems acceptable despite B and W.

But maybe there's a better word: ""OCEAN"" is invalid (A). ""OLIVE"" has I and V – I is excluded.

""OLIVE"" – I is excluded.

""EPOCH"" – H is low frequency.

""ELOPE"" – P and L are new, E is in 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid for E. So ELOPE has E at 5 – bad.

""ELBOW"" has E in 1 – allowed. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. B and W are uncommon but acceptable for first guess.

Another candidate: ""ETON"" – too short.

""ELUTE"" – E at 1 and 5 – bad.

""EXCEL"" – X, C – C is okay, X is low.

""EXUDE"" – X, U, D, E – E at 5 is bad.

From the two previous guesses:

arise → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
elude → E(-) L(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

Summary of what we now know  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, U, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: E, L  
  – From arise: E is somewhere other than position 5.  
  – From elude: E is somewhere other than position 1 or 5.  
  – From elude: L is somewhere other than position 2.  

We need a fresh 5-letter word that  
1. contains both E and L,  
2. places E somewhere other than positions 1 or 5,  
3. places L somewhere other than position 2,  
4. does NOT use A, R, I, S, U, D.

Common consonants still available: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.  
Vowels still available besides E: only O.

A simple pattern that satisfies the constraints:  
- Put E in position 2 or 3.  
- Put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  

One candidate satisfying all rules: “BLEEP”  
- B, L, E, E, P.  
- E appears in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).  
- L appears in position 2 → wait, elude showed L is NOT in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2.  
“BLEEP” has L in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “ELBOW”  
- E, L, B, O, W.  
- E in 1 → invalid (from elude).  

Next: “LEMON”  
- L, E, M, O, N.  
- L in 1 (allowed).  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- Does not use any forbidden letters: A,R,I,S,U,D are absent.  
So “LEMON” looks good.

Double-check:  
- Letters: L, E, M, O, N — none are in the forbidden set.  
- E is in 2 (not 1 or 5) → ok.  
- L is in 1 (not 2) → ok.

Therefore, the next guess is “LEMON”.

4. does NOT use A, R, I, S, U, D.

Common consonants still available: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.  
Vowels still available besides E: only O.

A simple pattern that satisfies the constraints:  
- Put E in position 2 or 3.  
- Put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  

One candidate satisfying all rules: “BLEEP”  
- B, L, E, E, P.  
- E appears in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).  
- L appears in position 2 → wait, elude showed L is NOT in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2.  
“BLEEP” has L in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “ELBOW”  
- E, L, B, O, W.  
- E in 1 → invalid (from elude).  

Next: “LEMON”  
- L, E, M, O, N.  
- L in 1 (allowed).  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- Does not use any forbidden letters: A,R,I,S,U,D are absent.  
So “LEMON” looks good.

Double-check:  
- Letters: L, E, M, O, N — none are in the forbidden set.  
- E is in 2 (not 1 or 5) → ok.  
- L is in 1 (not 2) → ok.

Therefore, the next guess is “LEMON”.",Guess 3: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) M(-) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,MELON,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I should try to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word. A good candidate is ""ARISE"" because it contains A, R, I, S, E - five of the most common letters.

<guess>arise</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(x): A is NOT in the secret word.
- R(x): R is NOT in the secret word.
- I(x): I is NOT in the secret word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the secret word.
- E(-): E is IN the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but not at the end.
2. The letters A, R, I, S are not present at all.

Next guesses should exclude A, R, I, S and should place E somewhere other than the last position. Good consonants left to try are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Vowels we still have are O and U.

A word that uses common letters, includes E (not at the end), and avoids A, R, I, S is ""OCEAN"". However, A is excluded. Another choice: ""TOWER"" – but R is excluded. ""UNMET"" is a possibility, but U is less common. 

Looking for a word without A, R, I, S, with E not at the end: ""PLENT"" is invalid (not a word). ""OCEAN"" is invalid (A). ""ELTON"" is invalid (R isn't there, but T and N are good). ""ELBOW"" – B and W are less common. 

Another good candidate is ""OCEAN"" but A is excluded. ""TULIP"" – I is excluded. ""CLOVE"" has L, O, V, E – avoids excluded letters and has E in position 4. ""CLOVE"" seems strong.

Wait, ""CLOVE"":
- C: not yet tested.
- L: not yet tested.
- O: not yet tested.
- V: not yet tested.
- E: known to be in word, now in position 4 (allowed since E can't be at 5).

""CLOVE"" is a valid word and incorporates new letters while respecting constraints.

However, ""CLOVE"" has V which is less common. Maybe ""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. 

Alternative: ""ELTON"" is invalid (no R needed). ""ELBOW"" has B and W. 

""ELDON"" – not a word. 

""ELMOT"" – not a word.

""ELMOS"" – S is excluded.

""ELMOC"" – not a word.

""ELDON"" – not a word.

""ELBOW"" – B and W are low frequency.

""ELFIN"" – I is excluded.

""ELBOW"" seems the best among these, but let's see other options.

""ENJOY"" – J and Y are low frequency.

""ENTRY"" – R is excluded.

""ELBOW"" seems acceptable despite B and W.

But maybe there's a better word: ""OCEAN"" is invalid (A). ""OLIVE"" has I and V – I is excluded.

""OLIVE"" – I is excluded.

""EPOCH"" – H is low frequency.

""ELOPE"" – P and L are new, E is in 1 and 5, but 5 is invalid for E. So ELOPE has E at 5 – bad.

""ELBOW"" has E in 1 – allowed. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. B and W are uncommon but acceptable for first guess.

Another candidate: ""ETON"" – too short.

""ELUTE"" – E at 1 and 5 – bad.

""EXCEL"" – X, C – C is okay, X is low.

""EXUDE"" – X, U, D, E – E at 5 is bad.

""ELUDE"" – E in 1, L, U, D – okay.

Between ""ELBOW"" and ""ELUDE"", ""ELUDE"" has U, D which are more common than B, W.

Thus, ""ELUDE"" is a better choice: E in 1 (allowed), L, U, D new, E not in 5.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: elude -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

arise → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
elude → E(-) L(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

Summary of what we now know  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, U, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: E, L  
  – From arise: E is somewhere other than position 5.  
  – From elude: E is somewhere other than position 1 or 5.  
  – From elude: L is somewhere other than position 2.  

We need a fresh 5-letter word that  
1. contains both E and L,  
2. places E somewhere other than positions 1 or 5,  
3. places L somewhere other than position 2,  
4. does NOT use A, R, I, S, U, D.

Common consonants still available: T, N, C, M, P, B, G, etc.  
Vowels still available besides E: only O.

A simple pattern that satisfies the constraints:  
- Put E in position 2 or 3.  
- Put L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  

One candidate satisfying all rules: “BLEEP”  
- B, L, E, E, P.  
- E appears in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed).  
- L appears in position 2 → wait, elude showed L is NOT in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2.  
“BLEEP” has L in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “ELBOW”  
- E, L, B, O, W.  
- E in 1 → invalid (from elude).  

Next: “LEMON”  
- L, E, M, O, N.  
- L in 1 (allowed).  
- E in 2 (allowed).  
- Does not use any forbidden letters: A,R,I,S,U,D are absent.  
So “LEMON” looks good.

Double-check:  
- Letters: L, E, M, O, N — none are in the forbidden set.  
- E is in 2 (not 1 or 5) → ok.  
- L is in 1 (not 2) → ok.

Therefore, the next guess is “LEMON”.

- M is in the word but not position 3 - but since positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by E,L,O,N respectively, M must be in position 1

This gives us the word pattern: M E L O N

Let me verify:
- M at 1 (not forbidden)
- E at 2 (matches feedback)
- L at 3 (matches L must be in word and not at 1)
- O at 4 (matches feedback)
