Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a word that maximizes the chance of getting useful information. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some optimal starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with CRANE because it contains several common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in word: C, R, N, E
   - A is in the word but not at position 3.

2. SALTY → S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
   - Letters not in word: S, L, Y (in addition to C, R, N, E)
   - A is now known to be in position 2 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not at position 4.

So the secret word:
- Has A as the second letter (position 2).
- Contains T but not at position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

Remaining unused common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

T must appear in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s test T in position 1: T A _ _ _
Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A plausible pattern is T A _ _ T. Let’s try T A P I T (T, A, P, I, T). But we don't have info on P or I yet. 

Actually, since we know T is not at position 4, and we want to test new letters efficiently, let’s try:
- T in position 1: T A _ _ _
- Next letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A good next guess that tests new letters and fits the pattern is T A M I D (T, A, M, I, D). But let me check if this is a valid word – yes, ""TAMID"" is valid (though rare). However, ""TABID"" is also valid but less common. A more common word is ""TAPIR"" but we don't know about I or R (and R is already excluded).

Wait, R is excluded, so ""TAPIR"" is invalid. Let me think of another valid word: ""TAPID"" is not a word. ""TAHIT"" is not a word. ""TAWNY"" has Y (excluded). ""TAMBO"" has O and B, but B is okay. However, ""TAMBO"" uses O and B, but we want to test T in position 1, A in 2, and T must appear again elsewhere (but we've only confirmed T is in the word, not necessarily twice).

Actually, we only know T is in the word but not at position 4. So T could be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try T A _ T _ pattern. Valid word: ""TAUNT"" – but U and N. N is excluded. ""TAFTS"" – S excluded. ""TACTS"" – C excluded. ""TAITI"" – not a word.

Alternative: T _ A _ T. But A is at position 2, so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ A T _ _. T is not at 4, so could be at 3. Let’s try B A T H E – but E is excluded. G A T O R – R excluded. M A T I N – N excluded. P A T I O – I and O are new, P and T and O are okay. ""PATIO"" – let’s check:
- P, A, T, I, O.
- A is at position 2 (matches ✓).
- T is at position 3 (not at 4, so okay).

Let's aggregate all the information we have after three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters excluded: C, R, N, E
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SALTY → S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
   - Letters newly excluded: S, L, Y
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 4.

3. PATIO → P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(✓)
   - Letters newly excluded: P, I
   - A remains confirmed in position 2.
   - T is still in the word but not in position 3 (now we know it's not in 4 or 3).
   - O is in the word but not in position 5.

So, updating:
- Known pattern: _ A _ _ _
- A is fixed at position 2.
- Letters in the word: A, T, O
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, P, I
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from PATIO and SALTY feedback). Possible positions for T: 1 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 5. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's determine possible positions for T and O.

Possible positions:
- T must be in 1 or 5.
- O must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: T is in position 1 (TA _ _ _)
   - O must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be in 5 due to PATIO feedback).
   - Possible words:
     - T A O _ _ (but need to place O in 3 or 4)
     - T A _ O _ (O in 4)
     - T A _ _ O (invalid, O can't be in 5)
   - So patterns:
     - T A O _ _
     - T A _ O _

Case 2: T is in position 5 (_ A _ _ T)
   - O must be in 1, 3, or 4.
   - Possible words:
     - O A _ _ T (O in 1)
     - _ A O _ T (O in 3)
     - _ A _ O T (O in 4)

Now, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining allowed letters. Allowed letters so far: A, T, O, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at Case 1:
- T A O _ _: e.g., TAONG (but NG is unlikely), TAONS (not a word), TAOUT (not a word)
- T A _ O _: e.g., TABOR (R excluded), TAFOD (not a word), TAKOT (not a word)

Looking at Case 2:
- O A _ _ T: e.g., OAKOT (not a word), OAFOT (not a word)
- _ A O _ T: e.g., B A O _ T – BAOLT (not a word), BAOBT (not a word)
- _ A _ O T: e.g., B A _ O T – BA GOT (not a word), B A V O T (not a word)

Hmm, not many obvious words. Let me think more carefully about valid words.

A better approach is to list possible words that fit _ A _ _ _ with T and O included, avoiding all excluded letters.

From remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and known positions.

Let's look for words with:
- A in position 2
- T and O somewhere, with T not in 3 or 4, and O not in 5.

Possible words:
- W A T O _ (but O can't be in 5, so WATOG? not a word)
- H A T O _ (HATOK? no)
- F A T O _ (FATOW? not a word)
- T A M O _ (TAMOK? no)
- T A B O _ (TABOR – but R is excluded)
- T A D O _ (TADOK? no)
- T A G O _ (TAGOT? no)
- T A H O _ (TAHOT? no)
- T A K O _ (TAKOR – R excluded)
- T A V O _ (TAVOT? no)
- T A W O _ (TAWOT? no)

Not finding valid words in T A _ O _ pattern. Let me try _ A _ O T:
- B A _ O T: BAVOT (no), BADOT (no)
- G A _ O T: GAVOT (valid word! GAVOT is a term for a dance)
- D A _ O T: DAVOT (no)
- H A _ O T: HAVOT (no)
- M A _ O T: MAVOT (no)
- V A _ O T: VAVOT (no)

""GAVOT"" seems to fit:
- G, A, V, O, T
- A in position 2 (matches)
- T not in positions 3 or 4 (it's in 5 – allowed)
- O not in position 5 (it's in 4 – allowed)
- No excluded letters used.

Let me check if this is a valid 5-letter word: yes, ""gavot"" is an alternate spelling of ""gavotte"".

Therefore, the next guess is GAVOT.

- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from PATIO and SALTY feedback). Possible positions for T: 1 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 5. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's determine possible positions for T and O.

Possible positions:
- T must be in 1 or 5.
- O must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: T is in position 1 (TA _ _ _)

     - T A _ _ O (invalid, O can't be in 5)
   - So patterns:
     - T A O _ _
     - T A _ O _

Case 2: T is in position 5 (_ A _ _ T)
   - O must be in 1, 3, or 4.
   - Possible words:
     - O A _ _ T (O in 1)
     - _ A O _ T (O in 3)
     - _ A _ O T (O in 4)

Now, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining allowed letters. Allowed letters so far: A, T, O, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I need a 5-letter word that has A (but not in the 3rd spot) and avoids C, R, N, E. Good consonants left to try are S, T, L, M, etc. I'll pick a word that places A in a different position and tests new common letters.

2. SALTY → S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
   - Letters not in word: S, L, Y (in addition to C, R, N, E)
   - A is now known to be in position 2 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not at position 4.

So the secret word:
- Has A as the second letter (position 2).
- Contains T but not at position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E, S, L, Y.

Remaining unused common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

T must appear in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s test T in position 1: T A _ _ _
Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A plausible pattern is T A _ _ T. Let’s try T A P I T (T, A, P, I, T). But we don't have info on P or I yet. 

Actually, since we know T is not at position 4, and we want to test new letters efficiently, let’s try:
- T in position 1: T A _ _ _
- Next letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A good next guess that tests new letters and fits the pattern is T A M I D (T, A, M, I, D). But let me check if this is a valid word – yes, ""TAMID"" is valid (though rare). However, ""TABID"" is also valid but less common. A more common word is ""TAPIR"" but we don't know about I or R (and R is already excluded).

Wait, R is excluded, so ""TAPIR"" is invalid. Let me think of another valid word: ""TAPID"" is not a word. ""TAHIT"" is not a word. ""TAWNY"" has Y (excluded). ""TAMBO"" has O and B, but B is okay. However, ""TAMBO"" uses O and B, but we want to test T in position 1, A in 2, and T must appear again elsewhere (but we've only confirmed T is in the word, not necessarily twice).

Actually, we only know T is in the word but not at position 4. So T could be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try T A _ T _ pattern. Valid word: ""TAUNT"" – but U and N. N is excluded. ""TAFTS"" – S excluded. ""TACTS"" – C excluded. ""TAITI"" – not a word.

Alternative: T _ A _ T. But A is at position 2, so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ A T _ _. T is not at 4, so could be at 3. Let’s try B A T H E – but E is excluded. G A T O R – R excluded. M A T I N – N excluded. P A T I O – I and O are new, P and T and O are okay. ""PATIO"" – let’s check:
- P, A, T, I, O.
- A is at position 2 (matches ✓).
- T is at position 3 (not at 4, so okay).
- Letters not used yet: P, I, O (all new).

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

2. SALTY → S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(-) Y(x)

   - A remains confirmed in position 2.
   - T is still in the word but not in position 3 (now we know it's not in 4 or 3).
   - O is in the word but not in position 5.

So, updating:
- Known pattern: _ A _ _ _
- A is fixed at position 2.
- Letters in the word: A, T, O
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, P, I
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from PATIO and SALTY feedback). Possible positions for T: 1 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 5. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's determine possible positions for T and O.

Possible positions:
- T must be in 1 or 5.
- O must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: T is in position 1 (TA _ _ _)
   - O must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be in 5 due to PATIO feedback).
   - Possible words:
     - T A O _ _ (but need to place O in 3 or 4)
     - T A _ O _ (O in 4)
     - T A _ _ O (invalid, O can't be in 5)
   - So patterns:
     - T A O _ _
     - T A _ O _

Case 2: T is in position 5 (_ A _ _ T)
   - O must be in 1, 3, or 4.
   - Possible words:
     - O A _ _ T (O in 1)
     - _ A O _ T (O in 3)
     - _ A _ O T (O in 4)

Now, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining allowed letters. Allowed letters so far: A, T, O, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at Case 1:
- T A O _ _: e.g., TAONG (but NG is unlikely), TAONS (not a word), TAOUT (not a word)
- T A _ O _: e.g., TABOR (R excluded), TAFOD (not a word), TAKOT (not a word)

Looking at Case 2:
- O A _ _ T: e.g., OAKOT (not a word), OAFOT (not a word)
- _ A O _ T: e.g., B A O _ T – BAOLT (not a word), BAOBT (not a word)
- _ A _ O T: e.g., B A _ O T – BA GOT (not a word), B A V O T (not a word)

Hmm, not many obvious words. Let me think more carefully about valid words.

A better approach is to list possible words that fit _ A _ _ _ with T and O included, avoiding all excluded letters.

From remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and known positions.

Let's look for words with:

- T and O somewhere, with T not in 3 or 4, and O not in 5.

Possible words:

- T A H O _ (TAHOT? no)
- T A K O _ (TAKOR – R excluded)
- T A V O _ (TAVOT? no)
- T A W O _ (TAWOT? no)

Not finding valid words in T A _ O _ pattern. Let me try _ A _ O T:
- B A _ O T: BAVOT (no), BADOT (no)
- G A _ O T: GAVOT (valid word! GAVOT is a term for a dance)
- D A _ O T: DAVOT (no)
- H A _ O T: HAVOT (no)
- M A _ O T: MAVOT (no)
- V A _ O T: VAVOT (no)

""GAVOT"" seems to fit:
- G, A, V, O, T
- A in position 2 (matches)
- T not in positions 3 or 4 (it's in 5 – allowed)
- O not in position 5 (it's in 4 – allowed)
- No excluded letters used.

Let me check if this is a valid 5-letter word: yes, ""gavot"" is an alternate spelling of ""gavotte"".

Therefore, the next guess is GAVOT.

From the four guesses we now know:

Knowns
- A is fixed at position 2.
- O is fixed at position 4 (because “O is in the word but not in position 5” and in GAVOT it appeared in position 4 and got ✓).
- T is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from PATIO and GAVOT feedback).  
  ⇒ T must therefore be in position 1.

Excluded letters so far

Pattern revealed

Remaining unused letters that are still allowed
B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z

Fill the blank (position 3) with one of the remaining letters and check that the whole word is valid.

The only common letter that makes a valid word is M:
T A M O _

That forms the word TAMOX (not valid).  
T A M O N – N excluded.  
T A M O D – no.  
T A M O B – no.  
T A M O K – no.  
T A M O G – G excluded.

In fact, the only recognizable English word that fits T A _ O _ and uses allowed letters is “TANGO”, but N and G are already excluded.

Going to the next most common consonant after M: F.

T A F O _ – no dictionary word.

K gives T A K O _ – no.

H gives T A H O _ – no.

B gives T A B O _ – no.

That leaves D: T A D O _ – no standard word.

Wait, let me double-check the dictionary for T A _ O _ with allowed letters.

- TACHO – C excluded
- TALON – N excluded
- TANGO – N & G excluded
- TAPHO – P excluded

- TATOU – U is allowed, but T at 3 is excluded
- TAUON – N excluded
- TAWED – E excluded
- TAXON – N excluded
- TAZOO – Z & O twice, but O already placed once

None of these work.  
The only remaining possibility is that the missing letter is M, and the word is in fact TAMBO (a valid if uncommon word meaning a type of drum or a place in Peru), and the feedback would mark the B as new information.

T A M B O – fits the pattern and uses only new allowed letters B and M.

Hence, the next logical guess is TAMBO.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Remaining unused common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W, etc.

Pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

T must appear in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s test T in position 1: T A _ _ _
Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A plausible pattern is T A _ _ T. Let’s try T A P I T (T, A, P, I, T). But we don't have info on P or I yet. 

Actually, since we know T is not at position 4, and we want to test new letters efficiently, let’s try:
- T in position 1: T A _ _ _
- Next letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

A good next guess that tests new letters and fits the pattern is T A M I D (T, A, M, I, D). But let me check if this is a valid word – yes, ""TAMID"" is valid (though rare). However, ""TABID"" is also valid but less common. A more common word is ""TAPIR"" but we don't know about I or R (and R is already excluded).

Wait, R is excluded, so ""TAPIR"" is invalid. Let me think of another valid word: ""TAPID"" is not a word. ""TAHIT"" is not a word. ""TAWNY"" has Y (excluded). ""TAMBO"" has O and B, but B is okay. However, ""TAMBO"" uses O and B, but we want to test T in position 1, A in 2, and T must appear again elsewhere (but we've only confirmed T is in the word, not necessarily twice).

Actually, we only know T is in the word but not at position 4. So T could be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try T A _ T _ pattern. Valid word: ""TAUNT"" – but U and N. N is excluded. ""TAFTS"" – S excluded. ""TACTS"" – C excluded. ""TAITI"" – not a word.

Alternative: T _ A _ T. But A is at position 2, so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ A T _ _. T is not at 4, so could be at 3. Let’s try B A T H E – but E is excluded. G A T O R – R excluded. M A T I N – N excluded. P A T I O – I and O are new, P and T and O are okay. ""PATIO"" – let’s check:
- P, A, T, I, O.
- A is at position 2 (matches ✓).
- T is at position 3 (not at 4, so okay).
- Letters not used yet: P, I, O (all new).
- Excluded letters not used.

""PATIO"" seems valid and tests new letters efficiently.

Guess 3: PATIO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's aggregate all the information we have after three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters excluded: C, R, N, E
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SALTY → S(x) A(✓) L(x) T(-) Y(x)
   - Letters newly excluded: S, L, Y
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 4.

3. PATIO → P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(✓)
   - Letters newly excluded: P, I
   - A remains confirmed in position 2.
   - T is still in the word but not in position 3 (now we know it's not in 4 or 3).
   - O is in the word but not in position 5.

So, updating:
- Known pattern: _ A _ _ _
- A is fixed at position 2.
- Letters in the word: A, T, O
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, P, I
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from PATIO and SALTY feedback). Possible positions for T: 1 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 5. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, or 4.

Now let's determine possible positions for T and O.

Possible positions:
- T must be in 1 or 5.
- O must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Case 1: T is in position 1 (TA _ _ _)
   - O must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be in 5 due to PATIO feedback).
   - Possible words:
     - T A O _ _ (but need to place O in 3 or 4)
     - T A _ O _ (O in 4)
     - T A _ _ O (invalid, O can't be in 5)
   - So patterns:
     - T A O _ _
     - T A _ O _

Case 2: T is in position 5 (_ A _ _ T)
   - O must be in 1, 3, or 4.
   - Possible words:
     - O A _ _ T (O in 1)
     - _ A O _ T (O in 3)
     - _ A _ O T (O in 4)

Now, let's list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining allowed letters. Allowed letters so far: A, T, O, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at Case 1:
- T A O _ _: e.g., TAONG (but NG is unlikely), TAONS (not a word), TAOUT (not a word)
- T A _ O _: e.g., TABOR (R excluded), TAFOD (not a word), TAKOT (not a word)

Looking at Case 2:
- O A _ _ T: e.g., OAKOT (not a word), OAFOT (not a word)
- _ A O _ T: e.g., B A O _ T – BAOLT (not a word), BAOBT (not a word)
- _ A _ O T: e.g., B A _ O T – BA GOT (not a word), B A V O T (not a word)

Hmm, not many obvious words. Let me think more carefully about valid words.

A better approach is to list possible words that fit _ A _ _ _ with T and O included, avoiding all excluded letters.

From remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and known positions.

Let's look for words with:
- A in position 2
- T and O somewhere, with T not in 3 or 4, and O not in 5.

Possible words:
- W A T O _ (but O can't be in 5, so WATOG? not a word)
- H A T O _ (HATOK? no)
- F A T O _ (FATOW? not a word)
- T A M O _ (TAMOK? no)
- T A B O _ (TABOR – but R is excluded)
- T A D O _ (TADOK? no)
- T A G O _ (TAGOT? no)
- T A H O _ (TAHOT? no)
- T A K O _ (TAKOR – R excluded)
- T A V O _ (TAVOT? no)
- T A W O _ (TAWOT? no)

Not finding valid words in T A _ O _ pattern. Let me try _ A _ O T:
- B A _ O T: BAVOT (no), BADOT (no)
- G A _ O T: GAVOT (valid word! GAVOT is a term for a dance)
- D A _ O T: DAVOT (no)
- H A _ O T: HAVOT (no)
- M A _ O T: MAVOT (no)
- V A _ O T: VAVOT (no)

""GAVOT"" seems to fit:
- G, A, V, O, T
- A in position 2 (matches)
- T not in positions 3 or 4 (it's in 5 – allowed)
- O not in position 5 (it's in 4 – allowed)
- No excluded letters used.

Let me check if this is a valid 5-letter word: yes, ""gavot"" is an alternate spelling of ""gavotte"".

Therefore, the next guess is GAVOT.

Knowns
- A is fixed at position 2.
- O is fixed at position 4 (because “O is in the word but not in position 5” and in GAVOT it appeared in position 4 and got ✓).
- T is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from PATIO and GAVOT feedback).  
  ⇒ T must therefore be in position 1.

Excluded letters so far
C, R, N, E, S, L, Y, P, I, G, V

Pattern revealed
T A _ O _

Remaining unused letters that are still allowed
B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Z

Fill the blank (position 3) with one of the remaining letters and check that the whole word is valid.

The only common letter that makes a valid word is M:
T A M O _

That forms the word TAMOX (not valid).  
T A M O N – N excluded.  
T A M O D – no.  
T A M O B – no.  
T A M O K – no.  
T A M O G – G excluded.

In fact, the only recognizable English word that fits T A _ O _ and uses allowed letters is “TANGO”, but N and G are already excluded.

Going to the next most common consonant after M: F.

T A F O _ – no dictionary word.

K gives T A K O _ – no.

H gives T A H O _ – no.

B gives T A B O _ – no.

That leaves D: T A D O _ – no standard word.

Wait, let me double-check the dictionary for T A _ O _ with allowed letters.

- TABOR – R excluded
- TACHO – C excluded
- TALON – N excluded
- TANGO – N & G excluded
- TAPHO – P excluded
- TARDO – R excluded
- TASOO – S excluded
- TATOU – U is allowed, but T at 3 is excluded
- TAUON – N excluded
- TAWED – E excluded
- TAXON – N excluded
- TAZOO – Z & O twice, but O already placed once

None of these work.  
The only remaining possibility is that the missing letter is M, and the word is in fact TAMBO (a valid if uncommon word meaning a type of drum or a place in Peru), and the feedback would mark the B as new information.

T A M B O – fits the pattern and uses only new allowed letters B and M.

Hence, the next logical guess is TAMBO.
