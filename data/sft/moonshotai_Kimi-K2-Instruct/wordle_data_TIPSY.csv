For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains A, O, S, R, E - all very common letters. However, I think ""SLATE"" might be even better as it has S, L, A, T, E which are also very common letters in English words. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is another solid choice. After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives me a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has an S (but not first) and a T (but not fourth).
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Good consonants left to try include common ones like R, N, H, C, M, D, etc. Vowels left are I, O, U, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with no A, L, or E, but with S and T somewhere (not in positions 1 and 4 respectively). A good next guess might be ""STORY"" - it uses S (but not in position 1), T (but not in position 4), and introduces O and R to test new letters. However, T would be in position 3 which is allowed. 

Another option is ""ROUST"" - but T is in position 5 which might be too late. 

""TORUS"" has T in position 1 which is invalid (from feedback T is not in position 4, but position 1 is allowed unless we know otherwise - actually feedback just says T is in word but not position 4, so position 1 is possible).

""STRIP"" has S in position 1 which is invalid.

""TRIOS"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, T in position 1 which is allowed (since we only know T isn't in position 4), and tests I and O.

I think ""TRIOS"" is a good choice.

   - R, O are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word starts with T.
- The word contains S (not in 1 or 5) and I (not in 3).
- The word does not contain L, A, E, R, O.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the pattern T _ _ _ _.

- S cannot be in 1 or 5.
- I cannot be in 3.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4.
Possible positions for I: 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).

Option 5: I in 4, S in 3 → T _ S I _
Option 6: I in 5, S in 3 → T _ S _ I
Option 7: I in 5, S in 4 → T _ _ S I

We need to pick one of these patterns and fill in the blanks with remaining letters (avoiding L, A, E, R, O).

TINTS:

- Has S in 5 (but feedback says S is not in 5). So TINTS is invalid.
