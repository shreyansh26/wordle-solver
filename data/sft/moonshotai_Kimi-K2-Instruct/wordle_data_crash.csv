For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather information about which letters are present in the secret word. A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE."" I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced choice.

From the feedback on SLATE:
1. S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
2. L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
3. A(✓) → A is in the word and in the 3rd position.
4. T(x) → T is not in the word.
5. E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- 3rd letter is A.
- The word contains S somewhere other than 1st.
- It does not contain L, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with A in the 3rd spot and S somewhere else (positions 2,3,4,5, but 3 is already A, so 2,4,5). We also want to test new letters that haven’t been guessed yet.

Good next letters to try: R, I, N, O, C, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CRASH: C, R, A (✓), S, H → keeps A in 3rd, S in 4th, tests C, R, H.
- GRASP: G, R, A (✓), S, P → tests G, R, P.
- CHASM: C, H, A (✓), S, M → tests C, H, M, S in 4th.

""CRASH"" seems good: it places S in 4th, keeps A in 3rd, and introduces C, R, H which are common and haven’t been tested.
