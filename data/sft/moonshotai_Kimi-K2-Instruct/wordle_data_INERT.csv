- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some excellent options include:
- ""AROSE"" - covers A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - covers C, R, A, N, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five of the most common letters and is a valid English word.

From the first feedback:
- A, O, S are **not** in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but in the **wrong positions** (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains **R and E** somewhere (positions unknown).
- Does **not** contain A, O, S.

Letters left to test: T, N, I, L, C, D, P, U, M, etc.

We know:
- R is **not** in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in ""AROSE"" and marked wrong position).
- E is **not** in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""AROSE"" and marked wrong position).

A good next guess should:
1. Include R and E.
2. Avoid A, O, S.
3. Test new common letters (like T, N, I, L).

Candidate words:
- ""TREND"" - includes R, E, plus T, N, D.
- ""INNER"" - but repeats N and R, and E is in position 4 (allowed since we don't know E's correct spot yet).
- ""ENTRY"" - includes R, E, plus N, T, Y.

""ENTRY"" is good because it places R in a new position (4) and E in a new position (2), while testing N, T, Y as new letters.

But let's refine: since R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5, ""TREND"" might be better:
- R is in position 2 (but R was in position 2 in AROSE and marked wrong, so this is invalid).
Wait, in ""AROSE"", R was in position 2 and marked ""-"" (wrong position), so R is **not** in position 2.

So ""TREND"" has R in position 2 - which we know is wrong. So ""TREND"" is invalid.

Instead, ""INERT"":
- I, N, E, R, T
- R is in position 4 (new position)
- E is in position 3 (new position)
- All letters are new except R, E

Another good one: ""RENTY"" - but Y is less common.

""INERT"" seems better.

Or ""UTTER"" - but repeats T.

""INERT"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Let's go with ""INERT"".
