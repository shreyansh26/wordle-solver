For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and helps maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A popular choice among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, E, I, O, U represented here as A, O, E)
- Common consonants like R and S
This increases the chances of hitting at least a few correct letters or their positions early on.

From the feedback so far:

What we now know:
- Pattern: _ R I S _
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, E, P
- Letters still possible in remaining positions (1 and 5):
  – Position 1: T was marked “-” (present but wrong place) → T is in the word, but not in first position. Therefore T must be in the 5th position.
  – The only unused common consonants/vowels left to test position 1 now are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

But since we already deduced T must go in position 5, the word must be: ? R I S T

Any 5-letter English word fitting _ R I S T is worth trying. The most common such word is “CRIST” (archaic spelling of Christ, but more importantly, a valid 5-letter entry in Scrabble/Wordle). However, “FRIST” (dialectal past of “freeze”) and “GRIST” (grain for grinding) are also possibilities. Among these, “GRIST” is the most familiar English word.

Thus the next logical guess is GRIST.

Deduced so far:
- Pattern: _ R I S T
- Letters known to be absent: A, O, E, P, G
- T must be in position 5 (from GRIST feedback confirming T is correct there).

Remaining consonants for position 1 (must be a valid 5-letter word ending in RIST):
- Common options: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y

Valid English 5-letter words ending in RIST:
- BRIST (dialectal variant of brisk/bristle) – valid in Scrabble lists
- CRIST (variant of Christ) – valid
- DRIST (obsolete word for thirst) – valid
- FRIST (Scots past of freeze) – valid
- WRIST – valid
- TRIST (archaic word) – valid

Among these, BRIST and WRIST are the most familiar. Since GRIST was just tried and G is absent, BRIST is the next best guess to avoid repeating consonants already ruled out.

Next guess: BRIST

<guess>BRIST</guess>",BRIST,"From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   Positions: _ R _ S _

2. TRIPS → T(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)  
   Positions: _ R I S _  (T is in the word but not 1st or 4th)

3. GRIST → G(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓)  
   Confirms: _ R I S T (but G is not in the word)

Deduced so far:
- Pattern: _ R I S T
- Letters known to be absent: A, O, E, P, G
- T must be in position 5 (from GRIST feedback confirming T is correct there).

Remaining consonants for position 1 (must be a valid 5-letter word ending in RIST):
- Common options: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y

Valid English 5-letter words ending in RIST:
- BRIST (dialectal variant of brisk/bristle) – valid in Scrabble lists
- CRIST (variant of Christ) – valid
- DRIST (obsolete word for thirst) – valid
- FRIST (Scots past of freeze) – valid
- WRIST – valid
- TRIST (archaic word) – valid

Among these, BRIST and WRIST are the most familiar. Since GRIST was just tried and G is absent, BRIST is the next best guess to avoid repeating consonants already ruled out.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,WRIST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and helps maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A popular choice among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, E, I, O, U represented here as A, O, E)
- Common consonants like R and S
This increases the chances of hitting at least a few correct letters or their positions early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the second position (✓)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the fourth position (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know the target word has the pattern: _ R _ S _

Known absent letters: A, O, E  
Known present letters (and their exact positions): R (pos 2), S (pos 4)

Next we want to test new common consonants and the remaining vowels (I and U) while preserving the positions of R and S. A good candidate is “TRIPS” because:
- T is a common consonant not yet tested
- I is an untested vowel
- P is another common consonant
All other letters are new (T, I, P) except R and S which we already know are correct in their spots.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: TRIPS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
TRIPS → T(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)

What we now know:
- Pattern: _ R I S _
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, E, P
- Letters still possible in remaining positions (1 and 5):
  – Position 1: T was marked “-” (present but wrong place) → T is in the word, but not in first position. Therefore T must be in the 5th position.
  – The only unused common consonants/vowels left to test position 1 now are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, U, Y, etc.

But since we already deduced T must go in position 5, the word must be: ? R I S T

Any 5-letter English word fitting _ R I S T is worth trying. The most common such word is “CRIST” (archaic spelling of Christ, but more importantly, a valid 5-letter entry in Scrabble/Wordle). However, “FRIST” (dialectal past of “freeze”) and “GRIST” (grain for grinding) are also possibilities. Among these, “GRIST” is the most familiar English word.

Thus the next logical guess is GRIST.
