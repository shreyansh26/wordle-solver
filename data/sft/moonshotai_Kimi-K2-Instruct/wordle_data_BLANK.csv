For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Research shows that words with common vowels and consonants are good starting points. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers many frequently used letters and can provide valuable information about their presence or position in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- A is in the word but is in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S, T, and E are NOT in the word.

So we need:
- A 5-letter word with L in the 2nd spot.
- A must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5).
- No S, T, or E anywhere.

Good candidate structure: _ L _ _ _ or _ _ L _ _ or _ _ _ L _ (but L is fixed at 2)  
Thus: _ L A _ _ or _ L _ A _ or _ L _ _ A

Possible patterns:
- CLAMP (but has P and M which are okay, but maybe not optimal)
- PLANK (but K is okay, P and N are okay)
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K – all allowed and common)

FLANK fits perfectly: L in 2nd, A in 3rd (but A must move, so let’s adjust). Wait, A cannot stay in 3rd – must move to 1st, 4th, or 5th.

Better candidate: PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – L in 2nd, A in 3rd (but A must move). Not good.

Alternative approach: try A in 1st position:
ALOOF – but has two O's, and F.

ALARM – but R is okay, but M is okay.

Actually, let me list the constraints again:
- L is fixed at 2nd.
- A must appear once, not at 3rd.
- No S, T, E.

Good candidate: CLAMP – C, L, A, M, P – but A is 3rd, which is forbidden.
FLAIR – F, L, A, I, R – A is 3rd, forbidden.

Try A at 1st: A _ L _ _ – but L must be 2nd, so impossible.
A at 4th: _ L _ A _ – e.g., BLANK – B, L, A, N, K – but L is 2nd, A is 4th. No S, T, E. Looks good!

BLANK fits:
- B (ok)
- L (✓ at 2nd)
- A in 4th (allowed, not 3rd)
- N, K (ok)

But let me check if there’s a better word to test more letters. Another option is ""FLANK"":
- F, L (✓ 2nd), A, N, K – but A is 3rd, which is forbidden (must move from 3rd).

Thus, ""BLANK"" is a valid next guess.
