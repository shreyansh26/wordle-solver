For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that can help me effectively narrow down possibilities by testing common letters. Many successful starting words contain frequently used vowels and consonants. A popular and effective choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes the common vowels A and E, and common consonants S, L, and T. This gives a good chance of hitting several letters that might be in the secret word. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word that tests multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any.

Summary of feedback from Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S – not in the word  
- L – not in the word  
- A – in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)  
- T – in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)  
- E – in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)  

So the pattern we must satisfy is: _ _ A T E

We know S and L are completely absent, so we can eliminate all words containing either of those letters.  
We also know the 3rd, 4th, 5th letters are A T E, so we only need to choose the first and second letters, neither of which can be S or L.

Common consonants that haven’t been tested yet include C, R, M, B, D, G, N.  
Common vowels not yet tested include I, O, U (A and E are already locked in).  
A balanced second guess would test new high-frequency letters in those first two slots while respecting the constraints.

Candidate words:  
- CRATE – but C, R, and the locked A T E fit; C and R are new untested letters.  
- GRATE – G and R are new.  
- BRATE – B and R are new.  
- PRATE – P and R are new.  
Among these, CRATE uses two very common consonants that often appear early in words.

Therefore, CRATE seems like the best next guess.

Current known facts:
- Word ends in “_ A T E” (positions 3-5 are locked as A T E)
- Letter R is present and is NOT in position 2 (from CRATE feedback: R only shows “-” – wrong position)
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, C
- So far we have pattern: ? R ? A T E, but R can’t be in slot 2. Since slot 2 is already fixed as A, the R must appear somewhere in slot 1 or slot 3, but slot 3 is already A, so R must be in slot 1.

Hence the word is R _ A T E.

There is only one common 5-letter word fitting R _ A T E: “GRATE”, but we already tried CRATE and know from that feedback that G has not been ruled out. However, we must use letters we haven’t tried yet for the second slot. The tried consonants so far that are ruled out are S, L, C, and we know R is in slot 1. The remaining consonants for slot 2 (between R and A) are limited because word must be valid. But we have only one slot left to test.

Actually, looking again, pattern is R _ A T E, and we need a valid 5-letter English word: common ones are GRATE (but G hasn’t been ruled out), BRATE (invalid), PRATE (valid). We haven’t tested P or G yet. To maximize new information, I’ll test a new consonant: P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Many successful starting words contain frequently used vowels and consonants. A popular and effective choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes the common vowels A and E, and common consonants S, L, and T. This gives a good chance of hitting several letters that might be in the secret word. Another strong option is ""CRANE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word that tests multiple high-frequency letters without repeating any.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of feedback from Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S – not in the word  
- L – not in the word  
- A – in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)  
- T – in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)  
- E – in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)  

So the pattern we must satisfy is: _ _ A T E

We know S and L are completely absent, so we can eliminate all words containing either of those letters.  
We also know the 3rd, 4th, 5th letters are A T E, so we only need to choose the first and second letters, neither of which can be S or L.

Common consonants that haven’t been tested yet include C, R, M, B, D, G, N.  
Common vowels not yet tested include I, O, U (A and E are already locked in).  
A balanced second guess would test new high-frequency letters in those first two slots while respecting the constraints.

Candidate words:  
- CRATE – but C, R, and the locked A T E fit; C and R are new untested letters.  
- GRATE – G and R are new.  
- BRATE – B and R are new.  
- PRATE – P and R are new.  
Among these, CRATE uses two very common consonants that often appear early in words.

Therefore, CRATE seems like the best next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
- Word ends in “_ A T E” (positions 3-5 are locked as A T E)
- Letter R is present and is NOT in position 2 (from CRATE feedback: R only shows “-” – wrong position)
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, C
- So far we have pattern: ? R ? A T E, but R can’t be in slot 2. Since slot 2 is already fixed as A, the R must appear somewhere in slot 1 or slot 3, but slot 3 is already A, so R must be in slot 1.

Hence the word is R _ A T E.

There is only one common 5-letter word fitting R _ A T E: “GRATE”, but we already tried CRATE and know from that feedback that G has not been ruled out. However, we must use letters we haven’t tried yet for the second slot. The tried consonants so far that are ruled out are S, L, C, and we know R is in slot 1. The remaining consonants for slot 2 (between R and A) are limited because word must be valid. But we have only one slot left to test.

Actually, looking again, pattern is R _ A T E, and we need a valid 5-letter English word: common ones are GRATE (but G hasn’t been ruled out), BRATE (invalid), PRATE (valid). We haven’t tested P or G yet. To maximize new information, I’ll test a new consonant: P.

So next guess: PRATE. This keeps R in slot 1 and tests P in slot 2. This also ensures all letters except P (and E A T R) are either already confirmed or ruled out.

From every prior guess, we know:

- The last four letters must be **R A T E**
- The first letter (position 1) is NOT: S, L, C, P, G
- R is definitely in the word (✓ feedback) but **must be in position 2** because:
  – In CRATE, PRATE, GRATE it was shown “-” (wrong position) when placed at position 1.
  – Positions 3, 4, 5 are locked as A, T, E respectively.
  – Therefore **R has to be in position 2**.

Hence the true pattern is: **? R A T E** where “?” is the first letter.

Valid 5-letter English words conforming to “? R A T E”:
- BRATE  – not a recognized word
- CRATE  – tried, ruled out
- DRATE  – not a word
- FRATE  – archaic/obsolete, unlikely
- GRATE  – tried, ruled out
- PRATE  – tried, ruled out
- TRATE  – not a word
- WRATE  – not a word

Only remaining common word: **BRATE** is invalid, but **FRATE** exists as an archaic variant of “freight”, yet is rarely used. The only widely accepted word left is **BRATE** which is not valid. Looking back, we missed **DRATE** and **TRATE** which are not words.  

Rechecking, there is **one actual valid word**: **irate** – but it starts with I, which hasn’t been tried. However, that would place R in position 2 (i**R**ate), satisfying all constraints.

Therefore the only remaining valid guess is **IRATE**.
