Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that can help me narrow down the possibilities efficiently. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some popular choices include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU.""

Looking at these options:
- ""CRANE"" uses very common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E)
- ""SLATE"" covers common letters including S, L
- ""AROSE"" hits most common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's considered one of the most effective starting words in Wordle-type games, containing three of the five most common letters (C, R, N) plus two common vowels.

Summary of what we know so far:

- C, R, A → NOT in the word (x)
- N, E → in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (-)

Therefore the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain C, R, A
2. DOES contain both N and E, but N is NOT in position 4 and E is NOT in position 5
3. The remaining letters (positions 1,2,3,5) must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, A.

A good second-guess should:
- Re-use N and E in new positions
- Pick other very common letters that weren’t eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, U)
- Avoid C, R, A

A common “second-guess” pattern is to test S, T, L, I, O, U and still move N and E around.  
“STONE” keeps E and N while adding S, T, O.  
“UNTIE” keeps N and E while adding U, T, I.  
“UNTIE” looks slightly better because it places N in position 2 (not 4) and E in position 5 (but we learned E is NOT in 5). So E must go somewhere else.

Let’s try “STONE”:
- N is now in position 3 (allowed)  
- E is now in position 5 (but feedback said E is NOT in 5) → bad.

Try “UNSET”:
- N is in position 2  
- E is in position 4  
Both of those new positions are allowed.

“UNSET” looks solid.

Or “UNTIE”:
- N(2), E(5) → again E in 5 is bad.

So “UNSET” it is.

From the three rounds of feedback we can now lock down:

- Position 1: U ✓ (fixed)
- Position 2: N ✓ (fixed)
- Position 4: E ✓ (fixed)
- Position 3: D is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- Position 5: E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)  (already satisfied because E is in position 4)
- Letters completely ruled out so far: C, R, A, S, T, I

So the pattern we must fill is:
U N _ E _

The blank spots are positions 3 and 5.  
Allowed letters (not yet used or eliminated): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, plus the vowels O (A and I are already out).

We already know D exists somewhere in the word, but it cannot be in position 3, so D must be in position 5.

That fixes position 5 as D, giving:

U N _ E D

Now position 3 can be any remaining letter except the eliminated ones.  
Looking for a common 5-letter word fitting UN_ED, the obvious candidate is “UNWED.”

Check:
- U, N, E, D all allowed by feedback  
- W has not been tested and is allowed  
- Forms a valid English word

So the next (and likely final) guess is UNWED.
