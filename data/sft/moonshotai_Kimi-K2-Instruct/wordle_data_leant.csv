3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. I'll use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good starting words in Wordle are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in 1st position  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all  
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in 5th position  

So the secret word:
- Contains both A and E, but in positions 2, 3, or 4 for A and 1, 2, 3, or 4 for E  
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S  
- Still unknown: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z  

I want a second guess that keeps A and E, while introducing other common consonants and avoiding R, O, S. Good letters to test next: T, N, L, I, D, C, H, M, etc. A balanced word using some of these is “EARTH”, but E must avoid 5th place, so swap places. Another balanced option is “LEANT”:  
- Uses L, E, A, N, T  
- E is in 2nd position (allowed, since feedback only said “not 5th”)  
- A is in 3rd position (allowed)  
- Introduces L, N, T which haven’t been tested yet and are common  

I’ll go with LEANT.
