Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common letters that appear in many English words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common consonants and vowels.

Possible good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels A and E. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word regardless of what the actual secret word is.

Letters NOT in the word (x):

- T (from SLATE – not in 4th position)
- O (from NORTH – not in 2nd position)
- R (from NORTH – not in 3rd position)
- T (from NORTH – not in 4th position, confirming earlier info)

So the word must contain T, O, R, and must NOT contain S, L, A, E, N, H.

Positions we have confirmed are wrong for these letters:
- T is NOT in position 4
- O is NOT in position 2
- R is NOT in position 3

Remaining common letters we haven’t ruled out: I, C, U, D, G, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, M, Q, J, X, Z.

Let’s build a word that uses T, O, R plus two more unused letters, while respecting the position constraints.

We can try to place T, O, R in valid spots.

Possible placements for T (not 4): positions 1, 2, 3, 5
Possible placements for O (not 2): positions 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible placements for R (not 3): positions 1, 2, 4, 5

A good candidate is ""INTRO"" but I is allowed and N is not (N is x). So not INTRO.

Next idea: ""FRUIT"" – but F, R, U, I, T. This has T (position 5 – OK), R (position 2 – OK), and O is missing. Doesn't have O.

""TORUS"" – but has S and U. S is not allowed.

""TRIUM"" – T, R, I, U, M. Missing O.

""INTRO"" – N is out.

""OUTRO"" – O, U, T, R, O. Has O twice. Letters: O, U, T, R. All allowed, but double O is OK. Let's check positions: O not in 2, but here O is in 1 (OK), U in 2, T in 3 (OK), R in 4 (OK), O in 5. This uses O, U, T, R. 

But we don't know about U yet, but it's not ruled out. So OUTRO is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: ""TROOP"" – T, R, O, O, P. Has O twice, P is allowed. Positions: T in 1 (OK), R in 2 (OK), O not in 2 but here O is in 3 (OK), O in 4 (OK), P in 5. So TROOP is also valid.

Between OUTRO and TROOP, both are plausible. I'll choose TROOP because it places T in position 1 (which we haven't tested), R in 2, O in 3 and 4.

- O (from NORTH – not in 2nd position)
- R (from NORTH – not in 3rd position)
- T (from NORTH – not in 4th position, confirming earlier info)

So the word must contain T, O, R, and must NOT contain S, L, A, E, N, H.

Positions we have confirmed are wrong for these letters:
- T is NOT in position 4
- O is NOT in position 2
- R is NOT in position 3

Remaining common letters we haven’t ruled out: I, C, U, D, G, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, M, Q, J, X, Z.

Let’s build a word that uses T, O, R plus two more unused letters, while respecting the position constraints.

We can try to place T, O, R in valid spots.

Possible placements for T (not 4): positions 1, 2, 3, 5
Possible placements for O (not 2): positions 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible placements for R (not 3): positions 1, 2, 4, 5

A good candidate is ""INTRO"" but I is allowed and N is not (N is x). So not INTRO.

Next idea: ""FRUIT"" – but F, R, U, I, T. This has T (position 5 – OK), R (position 2 – OK), and O is missing. Doesn't have O.

""TORUS"" – but has S and U. S is not allowed.

""TRIUM"" – T, R, I, U, M. Missing O.

""INTRO"" – N is out.

""OUTRO"" – O, U, T, R, O. Has O twice. Letters: O, U, T, R. All allowed, but double O is OK. Let's check positions: O not in 2, but here O is in 1 (OK), U in 2, T in 3 (OK), R in 4 (OK), O in 5. This uses O, U, T, R. 

But we don't know about U yet, but it's not ruled out. So OUTRO is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: ""TROOP"" – T, R, O, O, P. Has O twice, P is allowed. Positions: T in 1 (OK), R in 2 (OK), O not in 2 but here O is in 3 (OK), O in 4 (OK), P in 5. So TROOP is also valid.

Between OUTRO and TROOP, both are plausible. I'll choose TROOP because it places T in position 1 (which we haven't tested), R in 2, O in 3 and 4.

Let's go with TROOP.

From the latest feedback:

1. T is in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is T.
2. R is in the word but wrong position (-) → R is not in position 2.
3. O is in the word but wrong position (-) → O is not in position 3.
4. Second O is in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is O.
5. P is not in the word (x).

So far we know:

Word structure: T _ _ O _

Letters known to be in the word:
- T (confirmed at position 1)
- R (somewhere except position 2)
- O (somewhere except position 3, and we know it's at position 4)
- O is already at position 4, so the other O must be in position 2 or 3 or 5.

But O is confirmed at position 4, and the feedback says the first O in TROOP (position 3) is wrong, meaning O can't be at position 3. So the remaining O must be at position 2 or 5.

However, position 4 is O, so the word could have:
- T O _ O _ (if the other O is at position 2)
- T _ _ O O (if the other O is at position 5)

But R must be in the word (not at position 2). Let's explore possibilities.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, L, A, E (from SLATE)
- N, H (from NORTH)
- P (from TROOP)

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider the two possible patterns:

1. T O _ O _ : The missing letter (position 3) could be R (but R can't be at position 2, which is already O, so position 3 is fine for R).
   Possible word: T O R O _ → but we need a 5-letter word. ""TOROS"" has S which is out. ""TORON"" has N which is out. ""TOROT"" has T which is already used. Not valid.

2. T _ _ O O : The missing letters are positions 2 and 3. R must be in one of these (not at position 2), so R must be at position 3.
   So word structure: T _ R O O

Now, position 2 must be a letter not yet ruled out. From remaining common letters, possible candidates:
- C: T C R O O → ""TCROO"" – not a valid word.
- U: T U R O O → ""TUROO"" – not a valid word.
- I: T I R O O → ""TIROO"" – not a valid word.
- M: T M R O O – not valid.
  
This path seems problematic. Maybe the word has only one O (at position 4), and the ""O(-)"" in TROOP refers to the first O being wrong, meaning O is in the word but not at position 3 (which aligns with O being at position 4). Then the word has only one O at position 4.

Revised structure: T _ _ O _ with R somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 2 from earlier feedback? Wait, feedback from NORTH: R(-) means R is not at position 3. From TROOP: R(-) means R is not at position 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

But from TROOP: R is at position 2 (feedback R(-)), so R is not at position 2. From NORTH: R is at position 3 (feedback R(-)), so R is not at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 5.

So word structure: T _ _ O R

Now positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining letters: I, C, U, D, F, G, K, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- T I C O R – not a word.
- T I G O R – not a word.
- T U B O R – not a word.
- T U C O R – not a word.
- T U M O R – ""TUMOR"" is a valid word.

Let's check if ""TUMOR"" fits:
- T at 1: ✓
- U at 2: new, not ruled out.
- M at 3: new, not ruled out.
- O at 4: ✓
- R at 5: fits all constraints (R is not at 2 or 3, and is at 5).

Also, letters in TUMOR: T, U, M, O, R – none of S, L, A, E, N, H, P are present, which is consistent with previous feedback.

</think>

Based on the updated constraints, the word must be T _ _ O R, with R at position 5. The letters at positions 2 and 3 must be from the remaining unused letters (not S, L, A, E, N, H, P). A valid word fitting this pattern is TUMOR.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common consonants and vowels.

Possible good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters and both common vowels A and E. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word regardless of what the actual secret word is.

- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains T but T is not in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, E at all.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains T (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain S, L, A, E

Remaining common letters to use: R, N, I, O, C, U, D, H, M, G, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J

I'll aim for commonly occurring letters. Let's think of 5-letter words with T (but not in 4th position) and without S/L/A/E.

Possible candidates:
- TRICK (contains T, R, I, C, K - no S/L/A/E)
- CHORD (but no T)
- NIGHT (T in position 5 - allowed)
- FRONT (T in position 5 - allowed)
- DRIFT (T in position 5 - allowed)

""NORTH"" has T at position 5 (allowed) and uses common letters N, O, R, T, H - none of which are the excluded letters.

Let's go with NORTH.

Letters NOT in the word (x):
- S, L, A, E (from SLATE)

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are wrong (-):
- T (from SLATE – not in 4th position)
- O (from NORTH – not in 2nd position)
- R (from NORTH – not in 3rd position)
- T (from NORTH – not in 4th position, confirming earlier info)

So the word must contain T, O, R, and must NOT contain S, L, A, E, N, H.

Positions we have confirmed are wrong for these letters:
- T is NOT in position 4
- O is NOT in position 2
- R is NOT in position 3

Remaining common letters we haven’t ruled out: I, C, U, D, G, P, B, F, Y, W, K, V, M, Q, J, X, Z.

Let’s build a word that uses T, O, R plus two more unused letters, while respecting the position constraints.

We can try to place T, O, R in valid spots.

Possible placements for T (not 4): positions 1, 2, 3, 5
Possible placements for O (not 2): positions 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible placements for R (not 3): positions 1, 2, 4, 5

A good candidate is ""INTRO"" but I is allowed and N is not (N is x). So not INTRO.

Next idea: ""FRUIT"" – but F, R, U, I, T. This has T (position 5 – OK), R (position 2 – OK), and O is missing. Doesn't have O.

""TORUS"" – but has S and U. S is not allowed.

""TRIUM"" – T, R, I, U, M. Missing O.

""INTRO"" – N is out.

""OUTRO"" – O, U, T, R, O. Has O twice. Letters: O, U, T, R. All allowed, but double O is OK. Let's check positions: O not in 2, but here O is in 1 (OK), U in 2, T in 3 (OK), R in 4 (OK), O in 5. This uses O, U, T, R. 

But we don't know about U yet, but it's not ruled out. So OUTRO is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: ""TROOP"" – T, R, O, O, P. Has O twice, P is allowed. Positions: T in 1 (OK), R in 2 (OK), O not in 2 but here O is in 3 (OK), O in 4 (OK), P in 5. So TROOP is also valid.

Between OUTRO and TROOP, both are plausible. I'll choose TROOP because it places T in position 1 (which we haven't tested), R in 2, O in 3 and 4.

5. P is not in the word (x).

So far we know:

Word structure: T _ _ O _

Letters known to be in the word:
- T (confirmed at position 1)
- R (somewhere except position 2)
- O (somewhere except position 3, and we know it's at position 4)
- O is already at position 4, so the other O must be in position 2 or 3 or 5.

But O is confirmed at position 4, and the feedback says the first O in TROOP (position 3) is wrong, meaning O can't be at position 3. So the remaining O must be at position 2 or 5.

However, position 4 is O, so the word could have:
- T O _ O _ (if the other O is at position 2)
- T _ _ O O (if the other O is at position 5)

But R must be in the word (not at position 2). Let's explore possibilities.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, L, A, E (from SLATE)
- N, H (from NORTH)
- P (from TROOP)

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider the two possible patterns:

1. T O _ O _ : The missing letter (position 3) could be R (but R can't be at position 2, which is already O, so position 3 is fine for R).
   Possible word: T O R O _ → but we need a 5-letter word. ""TOROS"" has S which is out. ""TORON"" has N which is out. ""TOROT"" has T which is already used. Not valid.

2. T _ _ O O : The missing letters are positions 2 and 3. R must be in one of these (not at position 2), so R must be at position 3.
   So word structure: T _ R O O

Now, position 2 must be a letter not yet ruled out. From remaining common letters, possible candidates:
- C: T C R O O → ""TCROO"" – not a valid word.
- U: T U R O O → ""TUROO"" – not a valid word.
- I: T I R O O → ""TIROO"" – not a valid word.

This path seems problematic. Maybe the word has only one O (at position 4), and the ""O(-)"" in TROOP refers to the first O being wrong, meaning O is in the word but not at position 3 (which aligns with O being at position 4). Then the word has only one O at position 4.

Revised structure: T _ _ O _ with R somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 2 from earlier feedback? Wait, feedback from NORTH: R(-) means R is not at position 3. From TROOP: R(-) means R is not at position 2. So R must be at position 3 or 5.

But from TROOP: R is at position 2 (feedback R(-)), so R is not at position 2. From NORTH: R is at position 3 (feedback R(-)), so R is not at position 3. Therefore, R must be at position 5.

So word structure: T _ _ O R

Now positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining letters: I, C, U, D, F, G, K, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- T I C O R – not a word.
- T I G O R – not a word.
- T U B O R – not a word.
- T U C O R – not a word.
- T U M O R – ""TUMOR"" is a valid word.

Let's check if ""TUMOR"" fits:
- T at 1: ✓
- U at 2: new, not ruled out.
- M at 3: new, not ruled out.
- O at 4: ✓
- R at 5: fits all constraints (R is not at 2 or 3, and is at 5).

Also, letters in TUMOR: T, U, M, O, R – none of S, L, A, E, N, H, P are present, which is consistent with previous feedback.Based on the updated constraints, the word must be T _ _ O R, with R at position 5. The letters at positions 2 and 3 must be from the remaining unused letters (not S, L, A, E, N, H, P). A valid word fitting this pattern is TUMOR.
