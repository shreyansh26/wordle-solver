For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers different positions to maximize information gain. A good starting strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because:
- S, L, T are very common consonants in English words
- A and E are the most common vowels
- The letters are arranged to test different positions

This gives us a broad coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓)

So we know:
- Word ends in E
- L is somewhere in the first four positions
- S, A, T are not in the word at all
- Need to test new letters in positions 1-4 while keeping E fixed at position 5

To maximize new information, I’ll try a word with:
- L in a new position (not 2nd)
- Common consonants/vowels not yet tried
- E locked as the last letter

""FLUME"" is a good candidate:
- F, U, M are untested letters
- L moves from position 2 to position 2 (but since L was marked wrong-position in 2, this might not be ideal—need to avoid position 2 for L)

Better choice: ""OLIVE"":
- O, I, V are untested
- L is in position 2 (but L was wrong-position at 2 in SLATE, so this is bad—should avoid 2 for L)

Revised: ""PLUME"":
- P, U, M are untested
- L is in position 1 (new position for L)
- E is fixed at position 5
- Letters S,A,T are avoided

This seems optimal to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

From both guesses we now know:

  So L must be in position 1 or 4.
- S, A, T, P, M are NOT in the word at all.
- U is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing L and U, with L in 1 or 4, and U not in 3, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate letters remaining (excluding S,A,T,P,M):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

A simple high-frequency pattern to test is:
- L in position 1 (to test that slot)
- U not in position 3, so let’s try U in position 2
- Fill positions 3 and 4 with new common consonants

That gives the form: L U _ _ E  
Two common consonants we haven’t used yet are N and R.  
So “LUNRE” is invalid (not a word), but “LURNE” is also invalid.  
Switching the consonants: “LUNGE” is a valid word, fits the pattern, and uses new letters G and N.

Let's summarize the new information from LUNGE:

- L is still marked “-”, so it is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
  Previous placements: L was “-” in positions 2 and 3.  
  Therefore L must be in position 4 (only remaining slot for L).

- U is now marked ✓, so U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

- E is still ✓ in position 5.

- G is marked “-”, so G is in the word but NOT in position 4.

- N is NOT in the word (x).

Confirmed letters and positions so far:
- _ U _ _ E
- L is somewhere in positions 1–4, but must be in 4 → _ U _ L E

We now know the pattern of the secret word is: _ U _ L E

Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, P, M, N  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, O, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Plus we still need to place G somewhere (it’s in the word but we don’t know where).

Since we have _ U _ L E, position 1 and 3 are open.  
G must be in one of those two (because it cannot be in position 4).

A common consonant to try for position 1 is R, and common vowel/consonant for 3 is I.  
So we can test a word like “RUGLE” (invalid), “RUBEL” (invalid), “HUGLE” (invalid), etc.  
Instead, let’s pick a valid word that fits _ U _ L E, includes G in position 3, and uses a fresh consonant in position 1.

The word “BUGLE” is valid:
- B (new letter) in 1
- U ✓ in 2
- G (must be in 3, since it can’t be in 4 and 2 is taken by U)
- L ✓ in 4
- E ✓ in 5

This respects all constraints.
