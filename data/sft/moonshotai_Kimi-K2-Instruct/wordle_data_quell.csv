For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. I want to avoid repeating letters and include a mix of vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common consonants like R, S, T, and vowels like A, E, I.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has common consonants R and S
- All letters are distinct
- It tests many frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Now we know:
- The word does not contain A, R, O, S.
- It does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses E (since we know it's present) but NOT in the last position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters we haven't tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like:
- UNTIE (but has T and I, both untested)
- LINED (but has D, untested)
- ENEMY (but M and N are good, Y is okay)
- TENET (but T and N are good, but repeats E)

""UNTIE"" seems strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE)
- Introduces U, N, T, I - all new letters
- Avoids all forbidden letters (A,R,O,S)

- Word does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, D, V
- Word contains L (because L was marked ""-"" in DELVE)
- L cannot be in position 3.

So E must be in position 1 or 3.
L must be somewhere except position 3.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, and possibly others (but we've eliminated many).

We need:
- E in position 1 or 3
- L somewhere (not position 3)
- Use only allowed letters

Possible positions:
If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ _
If E is in position 3: _ _ E _ _

Let's think of words:
- EMBED: E in 1, M, B are new, but has second E in position 4 which we know is invalid
- EPOCH: has O (banned)
- EXCEL: has X (not tested but probably not common), C is new, but has two Es

- GLEEK: E in 3, but has G, L, K, and we know L is present, but we need to check positions
- PEWEE: multiple Es, W is new

Looking at possible combinations:

E _ L _ _ : EMBLY (not a word), EARLY (A banned)
_ _ E _ L : but E can't be in 4, and L must be somewhere
_ E _ _ L : E in 2 invalid

Better approach: E must be in 1 or 3, L must be present but not 3.

Let's try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
Possible word: GLEEK

FLECK: F, L, E, C, K - E in 3, L in 2, all letters new except E and L
This seems valid.

FLECK:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. I want to avoid repeating letters and include a mix of vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common consonants like R, S, T, and vowels like A, E, I.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has common consonants R and S
- All letters are distinct
- It tests many frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Now we know:
- The word does not contain A, R, O, S.
- It does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses E (since we know it's present) but NOT in the last position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters we haven't tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like:
- UNTIE (but has T and I, both untested)
- LINED (but has D, untested)
- ENEMY (but M and N are good, Y is okay)
- TENET (but T and N are good, but repeats E)

""UNTIE"" seems strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE)
- Introduces U, N, T, I - all new letters
- Avoids all forbidden letters (A,R,O,S)

Let's go with UNTIE.

- The word contains E (because both guesses had E marked “-” meaning the letter is present but in the wrong place).
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, T, I.
- The word does NOT have E in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and UNTIE feedback).
- The letters U, N, T, I are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- So far we have ruled out 9 letters.

We still need to test:
– common consonants like L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, F
– vowels: Y is sometimes used as a vowel; we’ve only confirmed E so far.

Let’s build a word that:
1. Uses E (guaranteed to be present) but avoids positions 4 or 5.
2. Uses only untested letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I).
3. Introduces several new letters at once.

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus E.

A good word would place E in positions 1, 2, or 3 and surround it with new consonants. Examples:
- BLEED (but repeats E and uses B, L, D … but E is repeated and may still be misplaced)
- FLECK (no E in right spot)
- DELVE (E in position 2)

Allowed letters left to test (alphabetically): B, G, H, J, M, P, W, Y, and maybe X, Z (but those are rare).

Structure so far: _ _ E _ _
L must appear somewhere in the remaining 4 positions, but cannot be in position 2 (from DELVE) or position 1 (from FLECK). So L must be in position 4 or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has E in position 3.
2. Has an L in position 4 or 5.
3. Uses only the remaining untested letters B, G, H, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list patterns:
- _ _ E L _ : need two new consonants for positions 1 & 2.
- _ _ E _ L : same.

Common words matching:
- GLEAM – invalid (A banned, plus L is in position 2 here, which is banned)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. I want to avoid repeating letters and include a mix of vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common consonants like R, S, T, and vowels like A, E, I.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It has common consonants R and S
- All letters are distinct
- It tests many frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Now we know:
- The word does not contain A, R, O, S.
- It does contain E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses E (since we know it's present) but NOT in the last position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters we haven't tested yet (like T, N, L, I, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates are words like:
- UNTIE (but has T and I, both untested)
- LINED (but has D, untested)
- ENEMY (but M and N are good, Y is okay)
- TENET (but T and N are good, but repeats E)

""UNTIE"" seems strong because:
- Uses E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE)
- Introduces U, N, T, I - all new letters
- Avoids all forbidden letters (A,R,O,S)

Let's go with UNTIE.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have tried:
1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. UNTIE → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)

What we now know:
- The word contains E (because both guesses had E marked “-” meaning the letter is present but in the wrong place).
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, T, I.
- The word does NOT have E in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and UNTIE feedback).
- The letters U, N, T, I are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- So far we have ruled out 9 letters.

We still need to test:
– common consonants like L, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, F
– vowels: Y is sometimes used as a vowel; we’ve only confirmed E so far.

Let’s build a word that:
1. Uses E (guaranteed to be present) but avoids positions 4 or 5.
2. Uses only untested letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I).
3. Introduces several new letters at once.

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus E.

A good word would place E in positions 1, 2, or 3 and surround it with new consonants. Examples:
- BLEED (but repeats E and uses B, L, D … but E is repeated and may still be misplaced)
- FLECK (no E in right spot)
- DELVE (E in position 2)

Let’s pick DELVE:
- Contains E (position 2 – new position)
- Uses D, L, V (all untested)
- Uses no letters that have been ruled out

<guess>DELVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: DELVE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) L(-) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:
1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. UNTIE → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
3. DELVE → D(x) E(-) L(-) V(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Word contains E (but E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Word does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, D, V
- Word contains L (because L was marked ""-"" in DELVE)
- L cannot be in position 3.

So E must be in position 1 or 3.
L must be somewhere except position 3.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, and possibly others (but we've eliminated many).

We need:
- E in position 1 or 3
- L somewhere (not position 3)
- Use only allowed letters

Possible positions:
If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ _
If E is in position 3: _ _ E _ _

Let's think of words:
- EMBED: E in 1, M, B are new, but has second E in position 4 which we know is invalid
- EPOCH: has O (banned)
- EXCEL: has X (not tested but probably not common), C is new, but has two Es
- ELBOW: E in 1, L in 2, B, O, W - but O is banned
- EAGER: has A (banned)
- GLEEK: E in 3, but has G, L, K, and we know L is present, but we need to check positions
- PEWEE: multiple Es, W is new
- HELLO: has O (banned), two Ls

Looking at possible combinations:
E L _ _ _ : ELBOW (invalid - O banned)
E _ L _ _ : EMBLY (not a word), EARLY (A banned)
_ _ E _ L : but E can't be in 4, and L must be somewhere
_ E _ _ L : E in 2 invalid
_ _ _ E L : E in 4 invalid

Better approach: E must be in 1 or 3, L must be present but not 3.

Let's try E in position 3: _ _ E _ _
Possible word: GLEEK
- G, L, E, K - E in 3, L in 2, new letters G and K
But we need to verify this is a valid word.

Another option: MELEE
- M, E, L, E - but E is repeated and in position 2 and 4 which are invalid positions

Another: PELEE - not a standard word
BELEE - not valid
FLECK - E in 3, F, L, C, K - but L is in 2, which is okay
But we need L somewhere, and this has L in 2, which is allowed

Wait, let's list valid words that fit:
- E must be in 1 or 3
- L must be present but not in 3
- No banned letters: no A,R,O,S,U,N,T,I,D,V

Possible candidates:
E _ _ _ _: EMBED (invalid - second E), EMBER (R banned), EMCEE (invalid)
E L _ _ _: ELBOW (O banned), ELFIN (I banned), ELBID (D banned)
E _ L _ _: ELDER (D banned), ELVER (R, V banned)
_ _ E _ _: CLEEK (C, L, E, E, K - but E in 4 invalid), FLEX (X not tested)
FLECK: F, L, E, C, K - E in 3, L in 2, all letters new except E and L
This seems valid.

FLECK:
- F (new)
- L (must be in word, in position 2)
- E (must be in word, in position 3)
- C (new)
- K (new)

This uses all new letters except E and L, places E in valid position 3, and L in position 2 (which is allowed since L just can't be in 3).

We now have the following solid information:

1. Letters confirmed present and correctly placed:
   - E in position 3.

2. Letters confirmed present but whose exact positions we still need to determine:
   - L (was in position 4 in WHELP and got ✓, so L is now confirmed in position 4).

3. Letters confirmed absent from the word (x-marked in any position):
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, V, F, C, K, W, H, P.

So the word must look like: _ _ E L _

We now need to pick from the letters that have never been guessed (and thus never ruled out):
B, G, J, M, Q, X, Y, Z (plus repeats of E or L, but they are already placed).

We also need a valid 5-letter English word that fits that pattern.

Let’s list possibilities:

- G _ E L _ : the only common word is GLEEK (but K is already excluded).
- B _ E L _ : B + vowel + E + L + consonant.  The only common word is BEVEL (V is excluded).
- M _ E L _ : the only word that comes to mind is MELD__ but that doesn’t fit.
- J _ E L _ : JEELY (invalid spelling).
- Y _ E L _ : nothing common.

Wait – the only remaining consonant that hasn’t been eliminated and can legally appear in either position 1 or 2 without violating any feedback is B, G, M, Y, (J is rare).

The word “BEGEL” is valid (a type of yeast cake) but G is allowed, E is fixed, L is fixed, and the second E is allowed because we only know E is in position 3; it may also appear elsewhere.

But let’s be sure: the feedback never said “only one E,” it only told us that an E is in position 3.

However, we need two more unique letters for positions 1 and 2.

Let’s try:

- B + Y + E + L + ?
- B + M + E + L + ?

But 5-letter words ending in EL are quite limited once we exclude banned letters.

The only remaining possibility that jumps out and is a standard word is “BEMEL” – but that’s uncommon.

Another candidate: “GEMEL” – archaic, not standard.

The simplest, most common word left that fits the pattern _ _ E L _ with the remaining letters is:

“B E G E L” – but that’s actually “BAGEL” with wrong vowels.

Wait – the pattern is _ _ E L _.

The only valid word left, using only the still-allowed letters, is:

“B Y E L?” – nothing.

“G Y E L?” – nothing.

“M Y E L?” – MYEL?  No.

“M E G E L” – no.

Actually, let’s list every 5-letter English word with pattern ? ? E L ? and see which uses only the still-allowed consonants:

- BEVEL  – V is banned.
- BEGEL  – valid (a yeast cake); uses B, E, G, E, L.
- GEMEL  – archaic.
- JEWEL  – J, E, W, E, L → W is banned.
- LEGER  – R is banned.
- MELON  – N is banned, O is banned.

Only “BEGEL” survives.

So the fifth letter must be G.

Therefore the word is

B E G E L.

Let me double-check:
- Positions: 1-B, 2-E, 3-G, 4-E, 5-L – but we already know L must be in position 4, E in 3. Oops, wait.

No: we know:
- Position 3 is E.
- Position 4 is L.
- So the word must be _ _ E L _.

The only valid word left using allowed letters is:

B E G E L – but that places E in position 2, which is okay (we only know for sure E is in 3).

But we have not yet tested G, B.

B E G E L is 5 letters: B, E, G, E, L.

Yes, that’s valid.

So the final guess is:

BEGEL.
