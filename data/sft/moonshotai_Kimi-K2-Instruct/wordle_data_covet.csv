For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common and distinct letters to test as many positions as possible. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowels (A, E). This should give me good coverage of frequently occurring letters in 5-letter words.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,covet,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common and distinct letters to test as many positions as possible. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowels (A, E). This should give me good coverage of frequently occurring letters in 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is correct in the first position (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- A is not in the word at all (x)
- N is not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with C
2. It contains E but E is not in the 5th position
3. It does NOT contain R, A, or N

Next I need a word that starts with C, uses E in positions 2-4, and avoids R, A, N. Let me think of possibilities:

- CHOSE (C, H, O, S, E) - E in 5th, but feedback says E is not in 5th - invalid
- CHEST (C, H, E, S, T) - E in 3rd - this could work
- CEDER (but R is forbidden)
- CELLO (no E, but we need E)
- CLEFT (C, L, E, F, T) - E in 3rd - this looks good

I'll go with CHEST as the next guess.

<guess>CHEST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CHEST -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) E(-) S(x) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Breakdown of what we know so far:

1. C(✓) is correct and in position 1.
2. T(✓) is correct and in position 5.
3. E(-) is in the word but in the wrong place (cannot be in position 4).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, A, N, H, S.

So we need a five-letter word with the pattern:
C _ _ _ T
and the remaining letters must include E somewhere in positions 2-3-4, and must NOT include R, A, N, H, S.

Available letters (avoiding the forbidden ones): B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus E is required somewhere in 2-3-4).

Possible combinations:
- C _ E _ T
- C _ _ E T

Let’s list some candidate words that fit:

1. CLEFT  – uses E in position 3 → C L E F T
   Letters: C, L, E, F, T → all allowed, E is in position 3 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

2. CLEET – but “CLEET” is not a valid English word (it’s a proper noun or slang).

3. CREST – uses S, already forbidden (x).

4. COVET – C O V E T
   Letters: C, O, V, E, T → all allowed, E in position 4 (allowed).

5. COMET – C O M E T
   Letters: C, O, M, E, T → all allowed, E in position 4.

6. CUBET – not a valid word.

7. CIVET – C I V E T
   Letters: C, I, V, E, T → all allowed, E in position 4.

Among these, CLEFT, COVET, COMET, CIVET are all valid English words.

Let’s pick CLEFT as the next logical guess since it places E in position 3 (a position we haven’t tried yet) and uses common letters.

<guess>COVET</guess>",COVET,"We now have:

Pattern so far:
C O _ E T  (positions 1,2,4,5 confirmed)

Letters NOT in the word (from any “x” feedback):
R, A, N, H, S, L, F, M

The missing letter (position 3) must therefore be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding those eight letters.  
Available consonants/vowels: B, D, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need the resulting word to be a real 5-letter English word of the form
C O ? E T.

Real English words fitting C O _ E T:
- COVET – V is still allowed
- COSET – S is forbidden
- COMET – already tried, M is forbidden
- COBET – not a word
- CODET – not a word
- COGENT – too long
- COVERT – R is forbidden
- COPIET – not a word
- COVET – valid, and V is not yet excluded.

Only COVET is both valid and uses an allowed letter (V). Therefore the secret word must be COVET.",Guess 5: COVET -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
