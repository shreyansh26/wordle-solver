For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. ""AUDIO"" is a popular first guess because it uses four different vowels, but it might be better to include more consonants. Instead, I'll choose a word like ""AROSE"" which has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, since I have no prior information, any of the top starting words (like CRANE, SLATE, or RAISE) would be equally good. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers common letters and provides good vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but is not in the first position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So:
- The secret word contains A somewhere (not in position 1).
- The letters R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Does not contain R, O, S, E.
2. Contains A but not in the first position.
3. Could contain other unused letters.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. Good candidates would use consonants not yet eliminated and place A in positions 2-5. 

""PLAID"" comes to mind:
- P, L, I, D are all still possible.
- A is in position 2 (which would satisfy the feedback that A is in the word but not in position 1).

This seems like a good second guess.

From the feedback so far:

- The first four letters are locked: P L A I _  
  (P, L, A, I are all in the exact correct positions.)

- The final letter is NOT:  
  – D (from PLAID)  
  – N (from PLAIN)  
  – R, O, S, E (from AROSE)

The secret word therefore has the pattern “PLAI_” and its last letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Looking at the alphabet, the single-letter possibilities that remain for position 5 and have not been eliminated are:  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Quick scan of common 5-letter English words that start with “PLAI”:

PLAID  – D is out  
PLAIN  – N is out  
PLAIT  – T is still possible  
PLAIE  – not a valid word  
PLAIC  – not a valid word  
PLAIM  – not valid  
PLAIG  – not valid  

The only common, valid word left is “PLAIT”.

Since T has not been ruled out, this must be the hidden word.
