2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, while avoiding rare letters like Q, X, Z, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common consonants and vowels. Some excellent options include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains some of the most common letters in English (E is the most common, followed by A, R, S, T), giving me good coverage to identify which of these letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- R and E are not in the word at all.

Current known facts:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ _
- A exists somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- We know T, R, E are absent.

Next thought process:
1. Since E is absent, we can eliminate many common endings.
2. We need to test new letters while keeping S in position 1 and placing A somewhere else.
3. Good candidates should use common consonants we haven't tried yet (like L, N, M, etc.) and possibly vowels like I, O, U.

Possible structure: S A _ _ _ or S _ A _ _ or S _ _ A _ or S _ _ _ A
But since A is already confirmed in the word, let's try placing it in position 2 first to maximize information.

Considering common 5-letter words starting with SA:
- SALTY (but T and E are eliminated)
- SALON (L and N are new, good candidates)
- SAMBA (M and B are new)
- SAPPY (P and Y are new)

I'll choose SALON because:
- S (confirmed position 1)
- A (confirmed in word, placed in position 2)
- L, O, N are all new letters we haven't tested
- It's a common word structure

From the two clues:

1) STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(x)
   - Word is S _ _ _ _
   - A is somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5
   - R, E, T are absent.

2) SALON → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) O(-) N(x)
   - A is in position 2 (✓) → A is now locked in position 2
   - L is in position 3 (✓) → L is locked in position 3
   - O is in the word but not in position 4
   - N is absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S A L _ _
- O is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 5.
- Letters already excluded: T, R, E, N

List of possible last letters: among common consonants we haven’t used (D, G, K, M, P, etc.) and vowel combinations.

Since O is in position 5, the word must be S A L _ O with exactly one letter to determine.

Possible final letters (must not be T, R, E, N):
- D → SALDO (not common)
- G → SALGO (not valid)
- K → SALKO (not valid)
- M → SALMO (not common)
- P → SALPO (not valid)
- B → SALBO (not valid)

But “SAL” + “O” leaves only one common English word: SALVO.

Let’s verify:
- SALVO uses only letters we haven’t ruled out.
- Fits pattern S A L _ O.
- O must be in position 5 (✓).

Therefore, the next logical guess is SALVO.
