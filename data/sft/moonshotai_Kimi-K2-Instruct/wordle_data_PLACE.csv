Starting with the first guess in Wordle is all about maximizing information. I need a word that uses common letters and ideally includes both vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. The classic starting words are often like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. I want to cover as many of these as possible. 

""SLATE"" is a good choice because:
- S is very common
- L is common
- A is a top vowel
- T is very common
- E is the most common letter

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also highly regarded. Between these, ""SLATE"" gives slightly better coverage of top letters. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess to get maximum feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct second position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct third position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct fifth position.

So the pattern we have is:

- _ L A _ E

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ L A _ E, has no S or T, and whose fourth letter we don’t yet know.

Possible letters for the first and fourth spots (excluding S, T, and letters already placed as L, A, E):

Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, Y
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but A and E are already used in fixed positions)

Let’s look at possible words that fit _ L A _ E and don’t contain S or T.

Some candidates:
- B L A C E – but C is in the fourth spot, and ""BLACE"" is not a recognized English word.
- B L A D E – ""BLADE"" – this is a valid word, contains no S or T, and fits the pattern.
- F L A M E – ""FLAME"" – valid, no S or T, fits the pattern.
- G L A R E – ""GLARE"" – valid, no S or T, fits the pattern.
- P L A N E – ""PLANE"" – but E is already in the fifth spot, and this would place N in the fourth, which hasn't been excluded.

""FLAME"" and ""GLARE"" are both strong contenders. Between these, ""FLAME"" uses F and M which are moderately common, while ""GLARE"" uses G and R which are also common. 

I’ll choose ""FLAME"" as the next guess because it introduces two new letters (F and M) that could help narrow things down further.

- CLAVE – but “CLAVE” is less common / not in some dictionaries
- GLARE – G and R, both allowed
- PLANE – P and N, both allowed
- CRANE – C and R, but pattern is _ L A _ E, so CRANE doesn’t fit L in 2nd spot
- BRACE – doesn’t fit pattern

Among these, “BLADE”, “GLARE”, and “PLANE” are solid.  
Let’s pick “GLARE” because G and R are high-frequency consonants and we haven’t tested them yet.

We have:

- Pattern locked in: _ L A _ E  
- Letters already confirmed: L (position 2), A (position 3), E (position 5)  
- Letters that have been ruled out: S, T, F, M, G, R  

Remaining consonants to test that are common and still allowed:  
B, C, D, H, K, N, P, V, W, Y  

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ L A _ E, using none of the forbidden letters and introducing new consonants for the 1st and 4th spots.

Quick scan of common words:

- BLADE – uses B and D (both allowed)  
- CLADE – uses C and D (but “CLADE” is less common; still valid)  
- PLANE – uses P and N (but N is 4th, which is fine)  
- BLAME – uses B and M (but M already ruled out)  
- CLAVE – uses C and V (valid)  
- PLACE – uses P and C (but pattern is _ L A _ E; would need 4th letter C → “PLACE” → P L A C E → matches)  

Among these, “BLADE”, “PLACE”, and “PLANE” are the strongest.  
- “PLACE” uses P and C, both high-frequency and untested.  
- “BLADE” uses B and D, also good.  

Between them, “PLACE” tests P and C together and keeps the vowel set minimal, so I’ll choose “PLACE”.
