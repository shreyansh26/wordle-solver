For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A good starting word should contain several of these common consonants and vowels. ""AROSE"" is often considered a strong starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. Similarly, ""STARE"" is another good option. 

After considering options, I think ""STARE"" is a solid first choice because:
1. S is the most common starting letter in English words
2. Contains T, A, R, E - all very frequent letters
3. Has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, T, R)

The feedback from STARE tells us that:
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position (it was in position 1, so we now know it must be in positions 2-5)
- T, A, R, E are all NOT in the word at all (marked x)

Because S is the only confirmed letter and it must appear somewhere after the first position, we want a word that:
1. Contains S in positions 2-5

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: STARE → S(-) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LOINS → L(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) S(-)

What we have learned:
- S is in the word, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STARE and LOINS). So S must be in position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word, but not in position 3 (from LOINS). So I must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- T, A, R, E, L, O, N are NOT in the word.

Letters still unknown: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We now know:
- One of the letters is S (in pos 2 or 3)
- One of the letters is I (not in pos 3)

Let’s build a word with:
- S in position 2 (let’s test that)
- I somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- Use other common remaining letters (like C, D, H, M, P, U, etc.)

A good candidate is “DISHY”:
- D is common
- I in position 2 is excluded (since S is there), so try I in position 1
- S in position 2 (testing position 2)
- H and Y are common letters not yet tested

But “DISHY” keeps I in position 1, S in 2, H in 3, Y in 4. This seems okay, but let’s check if we can get more info.

Another candidate is “PUCKS”:
- P, U, C, K are new letters
- S is in position 5, but we know S cannot be in 5 (from LOINS feedback). So this is invalid.

Alternative candidate: “SICKO” – but O is excluded, so invalid.

Better candidate: “CHIPS”:
- C, H, P are new
- S is in position 5 – but S cannot be in 5 (from LOINS), so invalid.

Next candidate: “SPICY”:
- S in position 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STARE), so invalid.

Next: “MISCH” – not a valid word.

Next: “WHISK”:
- W, H, K are new
- S in position 4 – but S cannot be in 4 (from LOINS), so invalid.

Next: “FISHY”:
- F, H, Y are new
- S in position 3 (valid, since S could be in 2 or 3)
- I in position 2 (valid, since I could be in 1,2,4,5 and isn’t excluded from 2)
- H and Y are new letters

This seems good: FISHY
- S in 3, I in 2
- New letters F, H, Y

Let’s confirm:
- S not in 1,4,5 → position 3 is valid
- I not in 3 → position 2 is valid
- F, H, Y never tested
- No excluded letters (T,A,R,E,L,O,N)
