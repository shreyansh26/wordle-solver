For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with high-frequency letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I should also avoid repeating letters in the first guess to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some strong starting options include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- ALERT (A, L, E, R, T)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes the 5 most common English letters in positions that might be correct, while covering vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so S appears somewhere other than position 4
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so E is in position 5

Now we know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. It contains S somewhere but not in position 4.
3. It does not contain A, R, O.

Next guess should incorporate new common letters while respecting these constraints. Good unused common letters include T, L, N, I, D. Since S is confirmed and must be somewhere else, let’s try a word that places S in a new spot while testing other common letters.

A strong candidate is ""TENSE"":
- T (new, common)
- E (confirmed position 5)
- N (new, common)
- S (known to be in word, but we’ll place it in position 4 where feedback said it wasn’t) — wait, no, feedback said S is wrong in position 4, so we should avoid position 4 for S. Thus TENSE is bad because S would be in position 4.

Better word: ""INSET""
- I (new)
- N (new)
- S (position 3, which hasn’t been tested yet)
- E (confirmed position 5)
- T (new)

But we need a 5-letter word and INSET is valid. However, position 4 is T here, not S, so this avoids the S-in-position-4 issue.

Another option is ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (new for S)
- T, E, I, N (new letters except E in correct spot)

But STEIN has E in position 3, but we know E must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Correct approach: E must be last, S must be in 1,2,3, or 5 (but E is in 5), so S in 1,2, or 3.

Let’s try ""SENTE"" — but E is in 5, so SENTE has E in 4 and 5, which is invalid (double E). 

Better: ""NITES"":
- N, I, T, E (but E in 4, must be 5), so invalid.

Re-evaluate: must end in E, contain S not in 4, and avoid A,R,O.

Best word: ""LENSE"" — but this has E in 4 and 5, invalid.

""LITES"" — ends in S and E, but E must be last, so invalid.

""WASTE"" — has A and R is not in it, but A is invalid (x).

""DENSE"" — S is in 4, which was marked wrong for S.

""SEINE"" — ends in E, S in 1, E in 5, but has A? No A here. Letters: S,E,I,N,E — valid, ends in E.

""SEINE"" is valid: S in 1, E in 5, no A/R/O.

But I and N are new letters. This seems good.

Alternative: ""SPITE"" — S in 1, P,I,T,E. No A/R/O, S not in 4, ends in E.
