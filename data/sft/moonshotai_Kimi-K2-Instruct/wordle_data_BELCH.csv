For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters in different positions, to quickly narrow down possibilities. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I.

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions. This gives us good coverage to potentially hit several letters in the secret word right away.

The feedback from “arose” tells me:

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (×).
- E is in the word but NOT in the last position (-).

That means every remaining candidate must:

2. Not contain A, R, O, S at all.

So far we have:

1. arose → A×, R×, O×, S×, E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
2. untie → U×, N×, T×, I×, E(-)   → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Combining the two pieces of feedback:

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I
- E must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5, so it can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

I need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter E in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I).
- Other common letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me look for a word that fits:

- Position 1: E → need 4 more letters from the allowed set.
  Possible pattern: E _ _ _ _
  Example: ELDER (but D and L are allowed) – actually let’s check a common word.

A common word that starts with E and avoids all forbidden letters is “EMBED”:
- E is in position 1.
- M, B, D are allowed consonants.

Let me verify:
- Letters in EMBED: E, M, B, E, D – none are forbidden except E, which must appear anyway.

This word also contains M, B, D to test new letters quickly.

So, next guess: EMBED.

From the latest feedback on “embed”:

E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
M(x)  → M is NOT in the word  
B(-)  → B is in the word but NOT in position 3  
E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (again)  
D(x)  → D is NOT in the word  

Summary so far  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D  
Allowed but unplaced letters: E must appear somewhere, B must appear somewhere  
Positions E is excluded from: 1, 4, 5 (from earlier)  
Positions B is excluded from: 3  

So E can only be in position 2 or 3.  
B can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).  

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and B exactly once each (no duplicates of either)
- Uses none of the forbidden letters
- Places E in position 2 or 3
- Places B anywhere except position 3

A quick scan of common words fitting these constraints:
- “BEB” will double a letter, which is okay if the target word allows repeats, but usually we assume no repeats until proven otherwise.
- “WEB” is only 3 letters.
- Looking for 5-letter words with E, B and three other allowed consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate: “BELLY” – but it has a double L and Y, and L is allowed, but let me check letters: B, E, L, L, Y → L appears twice, which might not be necessary.
Another candidate: “FLECK” – but C is allowed, K is allowed, and it does not contain B or E in the right positions. Not helpful.

Wait, I need both E and B. Let me focus on words that have both letters once.

Consider patterns:
- E _ B _ _  → E in 1? No, E excluded from 1. So _ E B _ _ or _ _ E B _ or _ _ _ E B

Try “PEBBY” – but P is allowed, E, B, B, Y → double B, P is okay, but double B might not be necessary.
Try “BELIE” – but I is forbidden.
“BLEAK” – has A and K, but A is forbidden.
“BLEED” – D is forbidden.
“BENCH” – N is forbidden.
“BERET” – R and T are forbidden.

Need a word with no forbidden letters, contains E and B once each.

Let me think of “BECKY” – but K and Y are allowed, C is allowed, but that’s 5 letters: B, E, C, K, Y. Check constraints:
- B is in position 1 (allowed, since B can be anywhere except 3)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E can be in 2 or 3)
- No forbidden letters used (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D are all absent)
- All other letters (C, K, Y) are still possible.

So “BECKY” fits all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BELCH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters in different positions, to quickly narrow down possibilities. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I.

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions. This gives us good coverage to potentially hit several letters in the secret word right away.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from “arose” tells me:

- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (×).
- E is in the word but NOT in the last position (-).

That means every remaining candidate must:
1. Contain the letter E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Not contain A, R, O, S at all.

I now want a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses E in a different spot (positions 1–4).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.
- Uses other still-possible common consonants and vowels (e.g., T, N, I, L, U, D) to maximize information.

A good choice is “UNTIE”:
- It places E in position 4.
- It avoids A, R, O, S.
- It includes other common letters (U, N, T, I) to test quickly.

<guess>untie</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

1. arose → A×, R×, O×, S×, E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
2. untie → U×, N×, T×, I×, E(-)   → E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Combining the two pieces of feedback:

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I
- E must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5, so it can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

I need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter E in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I).
- Other common letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me look for a word that fits:

- Position 1: E → need 4 more letters from the allowed set.
  Possible pattern: E _ _ _ _
  Example: ELDER (but D and L are allowed) – actually let’s check a common word.

A common word that starts with E and avoids all forbidden letters is “EMBED”:
- E is in position 1.
- M, B, D are allowed consonants.

Let me verify:
- Letters in EMBED: E, M, B, E, D – none are forbidden except E, which must appear anyway.

This word also contains M, B, D to test new letters quickly.

So, next guess: EMBED.

Summary so far  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D  
Allowed but unplaced letters: E must appear somewhere, B must appear somewhere  
Positions E is excluded from: 1, 4, 5 (from earlier)

Another candidate: “FLECK” – but C is allowed, K is allowed, and it does not contain B or E in the right positions. Not helpful.

Wait, I need both E and B. Let me focus on words that have both letters once.

Consider patterns:
- E _ B _ _  → E in 1? No, E excluded from 1. So _ E B _ _ or _ _ E B _ or _ _ _ E B

Try “PEBBY” – but P is allowed, E, B, B, Y → double B, P is okay, but double B might not be necessary.
Try “BELIE” – but I is forbidden.
“BLEAK” – has A and K, but A is forbidden.
“BLEED” – D is forbidden.
“BENCH” – N is forbidden.
“BERET” – R and T are forbidden.

Need a word with no forbidden letters, contains E and B once each.

Let me think of “BECKY” – but K and Y are allowed, C is allowed, but that’s 5 letters: B, E, C, K, Y. Check constraints:
- B is in position 1 (allowed, since B can be anywhere except 3)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E can be in 2 or 3)
- No forbidden letters used (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D are all absent)
- All other letters (C, K, Y) are still possible.

So “BECKY” fits all constraints.

From Guess 4 (bechy):
- B(✓) E(✓) → B and E are both in the correct positions (1 and 2).
- C(-) H(-) → C and H are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

So the target word looks like:
B E _ _ _
Positions 3 and 4 must be filled by C and H (order unknown), and position 5 must be a new letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D, Y.
Allowed letters (not yet tested): F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with BE, contains both C and H somewhere, and ends with one of the allowed letters.

Possible permutations for positions 3-5:
- C and H in positions 3 and 4, then an allowed 5th letter (e.g., BECH?)
- C and H in positions 3 and 5 (e.g., BEC?H)
- C and H in positions 4 and 5 (e.g., BE?CH)

Looking at common words:
- BEACH → invalid (A is forbidden)
- BECH? → need a 5-letter word starting with BECH (none common)
- BE?CH → possible candidates: BELCH, BENCH (N is forbidden), BETCH (invalid), BEWCH (invalid)
- BELCH → uses L (allowed), C and H in positions 3 and 5? No, BELCH is B E L C H → C in 4, H in 5. This fits:
  - B(1) E(2) correct.
  - C(-) was feedback from position 3 in bechy, so C is allowed but not in position 3 (here it's in 4, allowed).
  - H(-) was feedback from position 4 in bechy, so H is allowed but not in position 4 (here it's in 5, allowed).
  - New letter L in position 3 is allowed.

Thus, BELCH seems to be the logical next guess.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D, Y.
Allowed letters (not yet tested): F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with BE, contains both C and H somewhere, and ends with one of the allowed letters.

Possible permutations for positions 3-5:
- C and H in positions 3 and 4, then an allowed 5th letter (e.g., BECH?)
- C and H in positions 3 and 5 (e.g., BEC?H)
- C and H in positions 4 and 5 (e.g., BE?CH)

Looking at common words:
- BEACH → invalid (A is forbidden)
- BECH? → need a 5-letter word starting with BECH (none common)
- BE?CH → possible candidates: BELCH, BENCH (N is forbidden), BETCH (invalid), BEWCH (invalid)
- BELCH → uses L (allowed), C and H in positions 3 and 5? No, BELCH is B E L C H → C in 4, H in 5. This fits:
  - B(1) E(2) correct.
  - C(-) was feedback from position 3 in bechy, so C is allowed but not in position 3 (here it's in 4, allowed).
  - H(-) was feedback from position 4 in bechy, so H is allowed but not in position 4 (here it's in 5, allowed).
  - New letter L in position 3 is allowed.

Thus, BELCH seems to be the logical next guess.",Guess 5: belch -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) L(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
