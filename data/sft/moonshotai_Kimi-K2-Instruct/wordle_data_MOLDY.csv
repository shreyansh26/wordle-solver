For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good candidates:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""STARE"" - uses S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not present
- R: x → not present
- O: – → present somewhere, but not in the 3rd slot
- S: x → not present
- E: x → not present

So the secret word:
- contains an O, but not in the 3rd position
- definitely lacks A, R, S, E

Likely consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since O is already confirmed, A and E are ruled out).

Good next guess should:
- keep the O but move it away from the 3rd slot
- introduce new letters that have high frequency, especially consonants like T, N, L, C
- avoid any of the already-eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)

Candidate words:
- POINT – uses P, I, N, T plus O. Only O is confirmed present but position unknown.
- CLOUD – uses C, L, U, D plus O.
- TONIC – uses T, N, I, C plus O.

I'll choose POINT: it reuses O (moving it to slot 2), and brings in P, I, N, T which are all common and untested.

We now have three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is confirmed in position 2.

3. DOUGH → D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)  
   – O stays in position 2 (✓).  
   – D appears somewhere else in the word (but not in position 1).  
   – U, G, H are not in the word at all.

So the current state of the secret word is:  
- _ O _ _ _  
- Contains the letter D (not in position 1).  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, G, H.

Letters still available (high-frequency first):  
Vowels: Y (only remaining single-letter vowel)  
Consonants: L, C, M, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Uses D in one of positions 3-5.  
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, G, H).

Possible patterns:  
- _ O _ _ D (D in position 5)  
- _ O _ D _ (D in position 4)  
- _ O D _ _ (D in position 3)

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ _ with D elsewhere and only allowed letters.  
The most common qualifying word that jumps to mind is “COULD,” but U, L are allowed?  
Wait: L is allowed (not yet ruled out), but U is ruled out (from DOUGH feedback: U(x)).  
So “COULD” is invalid because of U.

Next best common words:
- COWED – but E is ruled out.  
- BOWED – same.  
- MOLDY – but we don’t have a Y yet, and L, D, M are allowed.  
  Pattern _ O L D _? No, that would need L in 3, D in 4.  
  Actually, let’s try MOLDY: M O L D Y.  
  – Uses M, O, L, D, Y.  
  – All letters are allowed so far.  
  – D is in position 4 (not position 1), which satisfies D(-).

Another candidate: COYLY – uses C, O, Y, L, but lacks D, which we know must appear. So discard.

Next: BOLDY – B, O, L, D, Y.  
This has D in position 4, O in position 2, and only uses allowed letters.  

Between MOLDY and BOLDY, both fit, but let’s pick BOLDY because B is slightly more common first letter.

So final choice: BOLDY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good candidates:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""STARE"" - uses S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not present
- R: x → not present
- O: – → present somewhere, but not in the 3rd slot
- S: x → not present
- E: x → not present

So the secret word:
- contains an O, but not in the 3rd position
- definitely lacks A, R, S, E

Likely consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since O is already confirmed, A and E are ruled out).

Good next guess should:
- keep the O but move it away from the 3rd slot
- introduce new letters that have high frequency, especially consonants like T, N, L, C
- avoid any of the already-eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)

Candidate words:
- POINT – uses P, I, N, T plus O. Only O is confirmed present but position unknown.
- CLOUD – uses C, L, U, D plus O.
- TONIC – uses T, N, I, C plus O.

I'll choose POINT: it reuses O (moving it to slot 2), and brings in P, I, N, T which are all common and untested.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- The word contains the letter O.
- O is in position 2 (because in POINT, O got ✓).
- It definitely does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Letters still available (roughly in order of usefulness):
- Consonants: L, C, D, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
- Vowels: U, Y (since A, E, I already ruled out and O is fixed in position 2)

So the pattern so far is _ O _ _ _

Good candidates should:
- Keep O in position 2.
- Use new consonants and the remaining vowel U.
- Avoid any letters that have already been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- DOUGH (D, U, G, H) – but it has 5 unique letters and fits _ O _ _ _
- BOUGH (B, U, G, H) – same as above with B
- MOULD (M, U, L, D) – uses M, U, L, D

I’ll choose DOUGH because D, U, G, H are all common, high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet.

   – O stays in position 2 (✓).  
   – D appears somewhere else in the word (but not in position 1).  
   – U, G, H are not in the word at all.

So the current state of the secret word is:  
- _ O _ _ _

Next best common words:
- COWED – but E is ruled out.  
- BOWED – same.  
- MOLDY – but we don’t have a Y yet, and L, D, M are allowed.  
  Pattern _ O L D _? No, that would need L in 3, D in 4.  
  Actually, let’s try MOLDY: M O L D Y.  
  – Uses M, O, L, D, Y.  
  – All letters are allowed so far.  
  – D is in position 4 (not position 1), which satisfies D(-).

Another candidate: COYLY – uses C, O, Y, L, but lacks D, which we know must appear. So discard.

Next: BOLDY – B, O, L, D, Y.  
This has D in position 4, O in position 2, and only uses allowed letters.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates. 

Some good candidates:
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""STARE"" - uses S, T, A, R, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and has no duplicates.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not present
- R: x → not present
- O: – → present somewhere, but not in the 3rd slot
- S: x → not present
- E: x → not present

So the secret word:
- contains an O, but not in the 3rd position
- definitely lacks A, R, S, E

Likely consonants left to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since O is already confirmed, A and E are ruled out).

Good next guess should:
- keep the O but move it away from the 3rd slot
- introduce new letters that have high frequency, especially consonants like T, N, L, C
- avoid any of the already-eliminated letters (A, R, S, E)

Candidate words:
- POINT – uses P, I, N, T plus O. Only O is confirmed present but position unknown.
- CLOUD – uses C, L, U, D plus O.
- TONIC – uses T, N, I, C plus O.

I'll choose POINT: it reuses O (moving it to slot 2), and brings in P, I, N, T which are all common and untested.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- The word contains the letter O.
- O is in position 2 (because in POINT, O got ✓).
- It definitely does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Letters still available (roughly in order of usefulness):
- Consonants: L, C, D, M, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
- Vowels: U, Y (since A, E, I already ruled out and O is fixed in position 2)

So the pattern so far is _ O _ _ _

Good candidates should:
- Keep O in position 2.
- Use new consonants and the remaining vowel U.
- Avoid any letters that have already been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- DOUGH (D, U, G, H) – but it has 5 unique letters and fits _ O _ _ _
- BOUGH (B, U, G, H) – same as above with B
- MOULD (M, U, L, D) – uses M, U, L, D

I’ll choose DOUGH because D, U, G, H are all common, high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet.

<guess>DOUGH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is confirmed in position 2.

3. DOUGH → D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)  
   – O stays in position 2 (✓).  
   – D appears somewhere else in the word (but not in position 1).  
   – U, G, H are not in the word at all.

So the current state of the secret word is:  
- _ O _ _ _  
- Contains the letter D (not in position 1).  
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, G, H.

Letters still available (high-frequency first):  
Vowels: Y (only remaining single-letter vowel)  
Consonants: L, C, M, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Uses D in one of positions 3-5.  
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, G, H).

Possible patterns:  
- _ O _ _ D (D in position 5)  
- _ O _ D _ (D in position 4)  
- _ O D _ _ (D in position 3)

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ O _ _ _ with D elsewhere and only allowed letters.  
The most common qualifying word that jumps to mind is “COULD,” but U, L are allowed?  
Wait: L is allowed (not yet ruled out), but U is ruled out (from DOUGH feedback: U(x)).  
So “COULD” is invalid because of U.

Next best common words:
- COWED – but E is ruled out.  
- BOWED – same.  
- MOLDY – but we don’t have a Y yet, and L, D, M are allowed.  
  Pattern _ O L D _? No, that would need L in 3, D in 4.  
  Actually, let’s try MOLDY: M O L D Y.  
  – Uses M, O, L, D, Y.  
  – All letters are allowed so far.  
  – D is in position 4 (not position 1), which satisfies D(-).

Another candidate: COYLY – uses C, O, Y, L, but lacks D, which we know must appear. So discard.

Next: BOLDY – B, O, L, D, Y.  
This has D in position 4, O in position 2, and only uses allowed letters.  

Between MOLDY and BOLDY, both fit, but let’s pick BOLDY because B is slightly more common first letter.

So final choice: BOLDY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
Guess 4: BOLDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) L(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on BOLDY:

- B(x), O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- L(✓) – L is in position 3.
- D(✓) – D is in position 4.
- Y(✓) – Y is in position 5.

So the secret word is exactly BOLDY (all letters matched correctly).

Therefore, the next guess should just be BOLDY again to confirm it’s the correct word.

The last two guesses (both BOLDY) show every letter in the wrong position except O, L, D, Y.  
That feedback pattern tells us the secret word is NOT BOLDY.

Re-examine the constraints we actually know after each guess:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is present, but not in slot 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is fixed in slot 2.

Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

3. DOUGH → D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)  
   – D exists somewhere, just not in slot 1.  
   – U, G, H are absent.

4. BOLDY → B(x) O(✓) L(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)  
   – B is absent.  
   – O, L, D, Y are present and in the correct positions.

That last piece of feedback is definitive: every letter in BOLDY is either ✓ or x, which means the secret word has exactly the letters O, L, D, Y in slots 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively, and any letter in slot 1 that is NOT B must be used.

So the secret word is **? O L D Y** where ? is any letter except:  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, U, G, H, B.

Allowed first letters (still unused, roughly descending frequency): C, M, F, K, V, W, etc.

The only common 5-letter English word matching C O L D Y or M O L D Y is **MOLDY**.

Check: M is not yet ruled out (hasn’t been tested), and MOLDY hasn’t been played.

Thus the correct word must be MOLDY.
