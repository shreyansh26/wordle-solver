For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies involve using words with high-frequency letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 unique letters to maximize information
2. Include common consonants and vowels
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z for first guess

Some popular choices are:
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""AUDIO"" - uses many vowels

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage and should provide useful feedback for the next guess.

2. Doesn’t use R, A, S, E
3. Uses some new common consonants to test

Looking at common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, K, B, G, F

Good candidates:
- ""POINT"" – uses P, O, I, N, T. But we know A is not in the word, O is still possible. I is in position 3 here, which we know is wrong.
- ""BUILD"" – uses B, U, I, L, D. I is in position 3 here, wrong.
- ""LIMIT"" – has I in positions 2 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 2 or 4 could be correct.
- ""GHOST"" – no I, so bad.
- ""NITRO"" – has R and O, but R is bad.
- ""BUILT"" – I in position 3, bad.
- ""DOING"" – I in position 4, G is new, O is new, D is new, N is new.

""DOING"" looks good: uses common letters, tests new vowels and consonants, and places I in position 4 (which is allowed since only position 3 is ruled out for I).

Let me pick ""DOING"".

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)

2. DOING → D(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - Confirmed out: D, O, N, G
   - I is still only confirmed as “in the word somewhere, not pos-3”.

Letters we have not tested at all yet: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Letters we know are IN the word: I
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G

Therefore the secret word must:
- Contain the letter I but not in position 3.
- Not contain any of R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G.

We have not tried T, L, C, F, H, M, P, B, U, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that satisfies:
1. Uses I exactly once, not in position 3.
2. Uses only letters from the currently-allowed set.

Some candidate words:
- BUILT – but U, L, T are all still possible, and I appears in position 3 (forbidden). Discard.
- FILTH – F, I, L, T, H: I is in position 2 (allowed). All letters untested so far. Looks good.
- CIVIL – has two I’s (unknown if duplicates allowed, but safer to avoid) and V not yet tested, but duplicate I might be risky.
- MILKY – M, I, L, K, Y: all letters allowed, I in position 2 (allowed). Good.
- PIVOT – O is already out, so discard.
- TYPIC – C at end, but Y, P, T are new, I in position 4 (allowed). Good.

Between FILTH, MILKY, TYPIC, I’ll pick FILTH because it tests five new letters (F, I, L, T, H), places I in a valid slot (position 2), and satisfies all constraints.

From FILTH → F(x) I(✓) L(x) T(-) H(✓)
- Position 2 is I and is correct (✓).
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (-) → H must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-) → T must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- F and L are not in the word at all (x).

Letters already ruled out:
R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G, F, L.

Letters confirmed in the word:
- I (locked in position 2)
- H (somewhere not position 5)
- T (somewhere not position 4)

So the word pattern so far is:  
? I ? ? ?  
with at least one H and one T placed somewhere else (and I already fixed at 2).

Possible positions for H: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 5 (and T ≠ 4)

Letters still allowed (never ruled out):  
B, C, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H and T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has I in position 2,
- contains H somewhere in 1/3/4,
- contains T somewhere in 1/3/5,
- uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s look for a word that fits _ I _ _ _ and simultaneously places H and T in valid spots.

Some valid placements:

Case 1: H in 1, T in 3  
H I T _ _

Case 2: H in 1, T in 5  
H I _ _ T

Case 3: H in 3, T in 1

- _ I T H _  →  C I T H ? Not a word.
- _ I _ H T  →  W I C H T? No. M I G H T? G is out. P I T H Y? Doesn’t fit.

The best candidate that appears is HITCH:

Check constraints:
- I is in position 2 – ✓

The goal is to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies involve using words with high-frequency letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 unique letters to maximize information
2. Include common consonants and vowels
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z for first guess

Some popular choices are:
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""AUDIO"" - uses many vowels

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage and should provide useful feedback for the next guess.

- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains an I but not in position 3
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, or E
- The remaining letters we haven’t tested are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want a word that:
1. Uses I but not in position 3
2. Doesn’t use R, A, S, E
3. Uses some new common consonants to test

Looking at common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, K, B, G, F

Good candidates:
- ""POINT"" – uses P, O, I, N, T. But we know A is not in the word, O is still possible. I is in position 3 here, which we know is wrong.
- ""BUILD"" – uses B, U, I, L, D. I is in position 3 here, wrong.
- ""LIMIT"" – has I in positions 2 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 2 or 4 could be correct.
- ""GHOST"" – no I, so bad.
- ""NITRO"" – has R and O, but R is bad.
- ""BUILT"" – I in position 3, bad.
- ""DOING"" – I in position 4, G is new, O is new, D is new, N is new.

""DOING"" looks good: uses common letters, tests new vowels and consonants, and places I in position 4 (which is allowed since only position 3 is ruled out for I).

Let’s collect everything we now know.

1. Positions  
   - Position 2 is definitely **I** (from FILTH and PITHY).  
   So the pattern is: _ I _ _ _

2. Letters already ruled out (x-feedback)  
   R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G, F, L, P, Y

3. Letters confirmed in the word  
   - **I** (locked at pos 2)  
   - **T** – now known to be in **position 3** (✓ in PITHY)  
   So the pattern is: _ I T _ _

4. **H** is also in the word (✓ from FILTH) but NOT in position 5 (it was “-” in FILTH) and NOT in position 4 (it was “-” in PITHY).  
   Therefore **H must be in position 1**.

   Pattern so far: **H I T _ _**

5. The last position (5) must be a letter that has never appeared and is not yet ruled out.  
   Available, never-used letters: B, C, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that starts **H I T _ _** and ends with one of the allowed letters.  
Common English words:  
- HITCH → but C is allowed and not yet tested.  
- HIT… nothing else common ends with another allowed letter except HITCH (which uses C).

HITCH fits all constraints.  
- H in position 1: ✓  
- I in position 2: ✓  
- T in position 3: ✓  
- C in position 4: never ruled out  
- H in position 5: wait – our earlier deduction said H can’t be in position 5 (from FILTH feedback).  
But HITCH would place H in both 1 and 5, and we know H can’t be in 5. So it’s invalid.

Next candidate: check if any other **H I T _ _** words exist.  
HIT UP? not 5 letters.  
HITED? not a word.  
HITEK? not a word.  
Only common one is HITCH, which fails H at 5.

Wait – let’s re-examine H placement.  
FILTH: H was in position 5 → **H(x) at 5**? No, in FILTH the feedback was H(✓) – meaning H is somewhere in the word, and the symbol in position 5 was H(✓) – indicating **H is in the word and is correctly in position 5**.  

I misread the earlier feedback.  
Going back:

- FILTH → position 5: H(✓) – **H is in position 5 and is correct**.  
- PITHY → position 4: H(-) – H is in word but not in 4. This is consistent with H being in 5.

Therefore the pattern is **H I T _ H**.  
Only missing letter is position 4.

Allowed letters for position 4 (not yet ruled out and not already placed):  
From earlier, NOT used yet: B, C, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word **H I T _ H**.

Common word: **HITCH**  
H I T C H – uses C in position 4. C has never been tested, so it is allowed.

Therefore the only remaining reasonable guess is **HITCH**.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies involve using words with high-frequency letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I.

A good first guess should:
1. Use 5 unique letters to maximize information
2. Include common consonants and vowels
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z for first guess

Some popular choices are:
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" - uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""AUDIO"" - uses many vowels

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage and should provide useful feedback for the next guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains an I but not in position 3
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, or E
- The remaining letters we haven’t tested are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want a word that:
1. Uses I but not in position 3
2. Doesn’t use R, A, S, E
3. Uses some new common consonants to test

Looking at common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, K, B, G, F

Good candidates:
- ""POINT"" – uses P, O, I, N, T. But we know A is not in the word, O is still possible. I is in position 3 here, which we know is wrong.
- ""BUILD"" – uses B, U, I, L, D. I is in position 3 here, wrong.
- ""LIMIT"" – has I in positions 2 and 4. Position 3 is wrong, but position 2 or 4 could be correct.
- ""GHOST"" – no I, so bad.
- ""NITRO"" – has R and O, but R is bad.
- ""BUILT"" – I in position 3, bad.
- ""DOING"" – I in position 4, G is new, O is new, D is new, N is new.

""DOING"" looks good: uses common letters, tests new vowels and consonants, and places I in position 4 (which is allowed since only position 3 is ruled out for I).

Let me pick ""DOING"".

<guess>DOING</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Confirmed out: R, A, S, E
   - I is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. DOING → D(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - Confirmed out: D, O, N, G
   - I is still only confirmed as “in the word somewhere, not pos-3”.

Letters we have not tested at all yet: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Letters we know are IN the word: I
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G

Therefore the secret word must:
- Contain the letter I but not in position 3.
- Not contain any of R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G.

We have not tried T, L, C, F, H, M, P, B, U, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that satisfies:
1. Uses I exactly once, not in position 3.
2. Uses only letters from the currently-allowed set.

Some candidate words:
- BUILT – but U, L, T are all still possible, and I appears in position 3 (forbidden). Discard.
- FILTH – F, I, L, T, H: I is in position 2 (allowed). All letters untested so far. Looks good.
- CIVIL – has two I’s (unknown if duplicates allowed, but safer to avoid) and V not yet tested, but duplicate I might be risky.
- MILKY – M, I, L, K, Y: all letters allowed, I in position 2 (allowed). Good.
- PIVOT – O is already out, so discard.
- TYPIC – C at end, but Y, P, T are new, I in position 4 (allowed). Good.

Between FILTH, MILKY, TYPIC, I’ll pick FILTH because it tests five new letters (F, I, L, T, H), places I in a valid slot (position 2), and satisfies all constraints.

- Position 2 is I and is correct (✓).
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (-) → H must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-) → T must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- F and L are not in the word at all (x).

Letters already ruled out:
R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G, F, L.

Letters confirmed in the word:
- I (locked in position 2)
- H (somewhere not position 5)
- T (somewhere not position 4)

So the word pattern so far is:  
? I ? ? ?  
with at least one H and one T placed somewhere else (and I already fixed at 2).

Possible positions for H: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, 5 (and T ≠ 4)

Letters still allowed (never ruled out):  
B, C, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus H and T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has I in position 2,
- contains H somewhere in 1/3/4,
- contains T somewhere in 1/3/5,
- uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s look for a word that fits _ I _ _ _ and simultaneously places H and T in valid spots.

Some valid placements:

Case 1: H in 1, T in 3  
H I T _ _

Case 2: H in 1, T in 5  
H I _ _ T

Case 3: H in 3, T in 1  
T I H _ _

Case 4: H in 3, T in 5  
_ I H _ T

Case 5: H in 4, T in 1  
T I _ H _

Case 6: H in 4, T in 3  
_ I T H _

Case 7: H in 4, T in 5  
_ I _ H T

Quick dictionary scan for common English words fitting any of these templates:

- H I T _ _  →  HITCH  (but C is allowed and we haven’t tested C yet)
- H I _ _ T  →  HILT? but L is out. HINT? but N is out. HIKUT isn’t a word.
- T I H _ _  →  TIH… nothing common.
- _ I H _ T  →  PITHY? Y allowed, P not ruled out. P I T H Y? No, T already in wrong place (needs to be in 5). Wait, we need T in 5, so _ I H _ T → B I H T ?  Not a word.

- _ I T H _  →  C I T H ? Not a word.
- _ I _ H T  →  W I C H T? No. M I G H T? G is out. P I T H Y? Doesn’t fit.

The best candidate that appears is HITCH:
H I T C H

Check constraints:
- I is in position 2 – ✓
- H appears twice: once in position 1 (allowed) and once in position 5 (but we know H can’t be in 5 from FILTH feedback).  
Oops, HITCH fails because H would be in position 5, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: PITHY
P I T H Y
- I is in position 2 – ✓
- H is in position 4 – allowed (1/3/4)
- T is in position 3 – allowed (1/3/5)
- Letters P, Y are still allowed
- Word is valid

Let’s use PITHY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s collect everything we now know.

1. Positions  
   - Position 2 is definitely **I** (from FILTH and PITHY).  
   So the pattern is: _ I _ _ _

2. Letters already ruled out (x-feedback)  
   R, A, S, E, D, O, N, G, F, L, P, Y

3. Letters confirmed in the word  
   - **I** (locked at pos 2)  
   - **T** – now known to be in **position 3** (✓ in PITHY)  
   So the pattern is: _ I T _ _

4. **H** is also in the word (✓ from FILTH) but NOT in position 5 (it was “-” in FILTH) and NOT in position 4 (it was “-” in PITHY).  
   Therefore **H must be in position 1**.

   Pattern so far: **H I T _ _**

5. The last position (5) must be a letter that has never appeared and is not yet ruled out.  
   Available, never-used letters: B, C, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that starts **H I T _ _** and ends with one of the allowed letters.  
Common English words:  
- HITCH → but C is allowed and not yet tested.  
- HIT… nothing else common ends with another allowed letter except HITCH (which uses C).

HITCH fits all constraints.  
- H in position 1: ✓  
- I in position 2: ✓  
- T in position 3: ✓  
- C in position 4: never ruled out  
- H in position 5: wait – our earlier deduction said H can’t be in position 5 (from FILTH feedback).  
But HITCH would place H in both 1 and 5, and we know H can’t be in 5. So it’s invalid.

Next candidate: check if any other **H I T _ _** words exist.  
HIT UP? not 5 letters.  
HITED? not a word.  
HITEK? not a word.  
Only common one is HITCH, which fails H at 5.

Wait – let’s re-examine H placement.  
FILTH: H was in position 5 → **H(x) at 5**? No, in FILTH the feedback was H(✓) – meaning H is somewhere in the word, and the symbol in position 5 was H(✓) – indicating **H is in the word and is correctly in position 5**.  

I misread the earlier feedback.  
Going back:

- FILTH → position 5: H(✓) – **H is in position 5 and is correct**.  
- PITHY → position 4: H(-) – H is in word but not in 4. This is consistent with H being in 5.

Therefore the pattern is **H I T _ H**.  
Only missing letter is position 4.

Allowed letters for position 4 (not yet ruled out and not already placed):  
From earlier, NOT used yet: B, C, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word **H I T _ H**.

Common word: **HITCH**  
H I T C H – uses C in position 4. C has never been tested, so it is allowed.

Therefore the only remaining reasonable guess is **HITCH**.
