- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) spread across different positions. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

We know so far:
- Position 3 must be T (from until and might).
- Position 2 must be I (it is ✓ in might).
- H is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked – in might, so it must be in 1 or 5).
- M and G are not in the word (x).
- All letters A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, M, G are banned.

So the pattern is: _ I T _ _  
with an H still to place in either position 1 or 5.

A good idea is to test a word that:
- keeps I in position 2 and T in position 3,
- places H in position 1 (the only untested position for H),
- adds fresh, common consonants that haven’t been tried yet.

Letters left to work with include D, P, C, K, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.

The word “HIT” covers positions 1–3 as H I T.  
We need two more letters.  Adding P and Y gives “HITPY” (invalid), so let’s rearrange two new consonants at the end.  The combination “HITCH” would reuse H, so instead use “WITCH”: W and C are both new and common, and H is in position 1.

Wait: H I T _ _  
If we pick H in position 1, we need two more consonants.  Let’s try “PITHY”: P, Y are common unused letters, and H is in position 1.

So the new guess is PITHY.

Check: P, I, T, H, Y – none of the banned letters appear, and we’re testing H in position 1 and fresh letters P and Y in positions 4-5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) spread across different positions. This should give us good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in arose (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them is in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word containing any of A, R, O, S, or E.

Next, pick a completely fresh set of common letters. The next-most-frequent letters in English include T, N, I, L, U, C, D, P, M, H, Y, K, etc.  
A good starter that uses five new common letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L); none of those letters overlap with the banned set {A, R, O, S, E}, so it maximizes new information.

(Any other high-frequency, no-overlap word like “UNITY”, “UNCLE”, “INPUT”, etc. would also work, but I’ll go with UNTIL.)

with an I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Using remaining common letters that haven’t been tested yet: D, G, H, M, P, C, Y, K, W, B, F, V, etc.

I’ll pick a word that:
- Fixes T in position 3
- Puts I in a new spot (position 2 is a good choice)
- Adds a few fresh common consonants

“MIGHT” satisfies:
- M, G, H haven’t been tested

- All letters A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, M, G are banned.

So the pattern is: _ I T _ _

A good idea is to test a word that:

- Pattern so far:  
  – Position 2 = I  
  – Position 3 = T  
  – H is present but not in positions 4 or 5 (was “-” in both might and pithy), therefore H must be in position 1.

So the word must look like: H I T _ _

Good candidate endings are consonant pairs that form common words, e.g. “HITCH”, “HITCW”, “HITBV”, etc.  Among these, “HITCH” is the only well-known English word, and it uses only letters that remain available (H, I, T, C, H).  The letter C has not been tried yet and is very common; repeating H is allowed.

Hence the next logical guess is HITCH.

From the feedback on hitch we now know:

- Position 2 = I  (✓)
- Position 3 = T  (✓)
- Position 4 = C  (✓)
- Position 5 = H  (✓)
- Position 1 letter (H) shows “-”, meaning it is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Hence the secret word is
C I T C H → “CITCH” (invalid, double-C clash)  
or  
W I T C H → “WITCH” (valid word; W hasn’t been used yet and satisfies H somewhere in word and all positions 2-5 locked).

No other common 5-letter words match the pattern _ITCH with H required inside.

So the only remaining possibility is WITCH.
