For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices among word game players.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

""CRANE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It has three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (R, N)
2. C is a moderately common starting consonant
3. It covers 5 distinct letters without repeats

This should give us good information about the presence and positions of several key letters in the secret word.

All five letters in ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) were marked with an X, meaning none of them are in the target word at all.  
That’s extremely useful information: we can now eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.

Next, I want a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include C, R, A, N, or E.  
Good candidates that are still common in English and avoid those letters:  
- S, T, I, O, U, L, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A balanced word that uses five new common letters and no repeats is “STOUT” (S, T, O, U, T).  
It gives us two different vowels (O, U) and three new consonants (S, T) to test.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, T, O
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S and U

Thus every candidate word must:
1. Contain both S and U (and only once each, since both appeared once in STOUT).
2. Not contain C, R, A, N, E, T, O.

I want a new guess that keeps S and U, places them in different spots, and fills the remaining three slots with fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Available letters (still unchecked and not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

A balanced choice is ""SLUMP"":
- S in position 1 (was position 1 in STOUT, so move it to start).
- L, U, M, P are all still legal.
- U is in position 3 (was 4 in STOUT, so new spot).
- All letters are distinct and none have been marked x.

This gives us a good spread of consonants (S, L, M, P) plus the known-legal vowel U, and shifts S and U to new positions.

Current known facts:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, L, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S and U
- So far S has appeared at positions 1 and 1 → must be in the word, but not at position 1.
- U has appeared at positions 4 and 3 → must be in the word, but not at positions 3 or 4.
- Therefore U must be at position 1, 2, or 5; S must be at positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (and both letters must appear exactly once).

We need a five-letter word that contains both S and U, each exactly once, and uses none of the excluded letters. Remaining valid letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, Q, V, W, Y, Z (and any others not yet excluded).

We want to test positions for S and U and gather info on the remaining three slots with fresh, legal letters.

Possible placements:
- U _ _ _ S
- _ U _ S _
- _ U _ _ S
- _ _ U _ S
- U _ S _ _
- etc.

A simple, common word that fits these constraints and uses fresh letters is ""BUILD"":
- Contains B, U, I, L, D
- However, L has already been excluded (marked X in SLUMP), so L is invalid.

Next candidate: ""DUSKY""
- D, U, S, K, Y
- All letters are still legal and not yet excluded.
- Positions: D-U-S-K-Y
  - U is in position 2 (legal, since U was not at 2 before)
  - S is in position 3 (legal, since S was not at 3 before)

This seems valid and provides new info for positions of U and S and tests three new letters (D, K, Y).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gained from the feedback. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices among word game players.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

""CRANE"" seems particularly good because:
1. It has three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (R, N)
2. C is a moderately common starting consonant
3. It covers 5 distinct letters without repeats

This should give us good information about the presence and positions of several key letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) were marked with an X, meaning none of them are in the target word at all.  
That’s extremely useful information: we can now eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.

Next, I want a fresh set of high-frequency letters that do not include C, R, A, N, or E.  
Good candidates that are still common in English and avoid those letters:  
- S, T, I, O, U, L, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A balanced word that uses five new common letters and no repeats is “STOUT” (S, T, O, U, T).  
It gives us two different vowels (O, U) and three new consonants (S, T) to test.

<guess>STOUT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, T, O
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S and U

Thus every candidate word must:
1. Contain both S and U (and only once each, since both appeared once in STOUT).
2. Not contain C, R, A, N, E, T, O.

I want a new guess that keeps S and U, places them in different spots, and fills the remaining three slots with fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Available letters (still unchecked and not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

A balanced choice is ""SLUMP"":
- S in position 1 (was position 1 in STOUT, so move it to start).
- L, U, M, P are all still legal.
- U is in position 3 (was 4 in STOUT, so new spot).
- All letters are distinct and none have been marked x.

This gives us a good spread of consonants (S, L, M, P) plus the known-legal vowel U, and shifts S and U to new positions.
