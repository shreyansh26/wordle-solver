For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words cover many frequently used letters and vowels. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Very common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

Using ""SLATE"" gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. This will provide a strong foundation for the second guess.

From the feedback on SLATE we know:  
- E is in the correct final position.  
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain S, L, A, T.  
We want a new 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids those four letters.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, G, B, K, P, F, V, W.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A balanced second guess that uses several of these fresh letters and keeps the final E is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N have not been tested yet.  
- Ends in E, satisfying the known constraint.  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T) are used.

- A vowel in position 4 (but not A, already ruled out – so maybe I or U or another O or E, but E is already fixed at 5)

- Forbidden letters (nowhere in the word): S, L, A, T, C, R, N, V.  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: O, I, D, E (but E is already locked at pos 5).  
  – O cannot be in position 3 (from CRONE).  
  – D cannot be in position 3 (from VIDEO).  
  – I cannot be in position 2 (from VIDEO).  
  – O cannot be in position 5 (E is there), and from VIDEO we see it is not in 4 either (because E is 4 in VIDEO and feedback for O is “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 4).  
  – Thus O must be in position 1 or 2.  
  – I must be in 1, 3 or 4.  
  – D must be in 1, 2, 4.

Step 2 – choose a word that satisfies all these constraints  
We still need to test fresh consonants to avoid repeats of already-eliminated letters.  
Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s try a word that puts:
- O in position 1 (locking it down and freeing up other spots),  
- places I somewhere legal,  
- places D somewhere legal,  
- adds one new consonant,  
- ends in E.

A candidate that meets all these requirements is “OPIED”:
- O at 1 (allowed).  
- P is a fresh consonant never tried.  
- I at 3 (legal; not position 2, and 3 hasn’t been ruled out for I).  
- E at 5 (fixed).  
- D at 4 (legal; D wasn’t ruled out of 4).  

No forbidden letters appear, and we satisfy all known positional restrictions.

So “OPIED” is the next logical guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words cover many frequently used letters and vowels. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Very common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

Using ""SLATE"" gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. This will provide a strong foundation for the second guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE we know:  
- E is in the correct final position.  
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain S, L, A, T.  
We want a new 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids those four letters.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, G, B, K, P, F, V, W.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A balanced second guess that uses several of these fresh letters and keeps the final E is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N have not been tested yet.  
- Ends in E, satisfying the known constraint.  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T) are used.

So we need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O but not in the third position, and avoiding S, L, A, T, C, R, N.

Possible vowels left to try: I, U  
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z

We still need to place O somewhere other than position 3. Let’s try a word with O in position 2 (since position 1 is usually good for heavy consonants, and position 4 is right before the fixed E).

Let’s pick a word with:
- O in position 2
- Two new consonants in positions 1 and 3
- A vowel in position 4 (but not A, already ruled out – so maybe I or U or another O or E, but E is already fixed at 5)
- Ends with E

A good candidate is ""VIDEO"":
- V, I, D are new letters
- O in position 2
- Ends with E
- No forbidden letters

From all four guesses we now have:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, V, P.
3. Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 1 (✓ from OPIED).
   - I is in position 3 (✓ from OPIED).
4. Letters confirmed to be in the word but NOT in these positions:
   - D is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E (already fixed at 5) but the feedback shows E is not in position 4 (from VIDEO), which we already knew.

So the word looks like: O _ I _ E

We need two more letters:
- Position 2: Must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden.
- Position 4: Must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden.

Letters not used yet and not forbidden: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y, Z, U.

Also, from the feedback:
- D is in the word but not in positions 3,4,5. Since positions 1,2,3 are O, ?, I respectively, D must be in position 2 or 4.
- From VIDEO, D was marked ""-"" for position 4, meaning D is not in position 4.
- Therefore, D must be in position 2.

So the word is: O D I _ E

Now we need a letter for position 4 that's not forbidden and not used yet. Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y, Z, U.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E with ""ODI__E"", the most common is ""ODIUM"" but that ends in M, not E. Wait, we need to think of any valid word that fits O D I _ E.

Possible options:
- ODIME (but M is possible)
- ODIBE (but B is possible)
- ODIGE (but G is possible)
- ODIKE (but K is possible)
- ODIVE (but V is forbidden)
- ODIZE (but Z is possible)

Looking for common English words, ""ODIZE"" isn't a word, ""ODIUM"" isn't correct ending. The most plausible seems ""ODIUM"" but that's not 5 letters ending in E. Actually, let me think differently - we need to find any word that fits the pattern O D I _ E.

Looking at the letters left: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y, Z, U.

Possible valid English words:
- O D I U E (but is ODIUE a word? No)
- O D I M E (ODIME - not a recognized word)
- O D I G E (ODIGE - no)
- O D I B E (ODIBE - no)
- O D I K E (ODIKE - no)
- O D I F E (ODIFE - no)
- O D I H E (ODIHE - no)
- O D I W E (ODIWE - no)
- O D I Y E (ODIYE - no)
- O D I Z E (ODIZE - no)

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Did I make a mistake? Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from OPIED shows:
- O(✓) - correct in position 1
- P(x) - P not in word
- I(✓) - correct in position 3
- E(-) - E is in word but not in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5, so this is consistent)
- D(-) - D is in word but not in position 5 (which we already knew)

So the word is O _ I _ E with D somewhere in positions 2 or 4, but from VIDEO we saw D(-) at position 3, and from OPIED D(-) at position 5, so D could be 2 or 4.

But in VIDEO, D was at position 3 and got ""-"", so D is not at 3.
In OPIED, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", so D is not at 5.
Thus D must be at 2 or 4.

But in OPIED, I was at position 3 (correct), and D was at position 5 (incorrect position), so D could still be at 2 or 4.

Similarly, E is at 5, so position 4 must be another letter.

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with O, I at 3, E at 5: O _ I _ E.

Possible words:
- O B I D E (OBIDE - no)
- O D I U E (ODIUE - no)
- O F I N E (but N is forbidden)
- O G I V E (V is forbidden)
- O H I K E (K is possible, but OHIKE - no)
- O K I L E (L is forbidden)
- O M I N E (N is forbidden)
- O W I N E (N is forbidden)
- O X I D E (X is possible, OXIDE - yes!)

""OXIDE"" fits perfectly:
- O is in position 1 (confirmed)
- X is new (not forbidden)
- I is in position 3 (confirmed)
- D is in position 4 (not forbidden, and from VIDEO D(-) at 3, from OPIED D(-) at 5, so 4 is allowed)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed)

Forbidden letters check: S,L,A,T,C,R,N,V,P - none of these are in OXIDE.

Therefore, ""OXIDE"" is a valid guess that fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on all the feedback, the word must be O _ I _ E with D in position 4. The only common English word fitting this pattern is OXIDE.

<guess>OXIDE</guess>",OXIDE,"From all four guesses we now have:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, V, P.
3. Letters confirmed to be in the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 1 (✓ from OPIED).
   - I is in position 3 (✓ from OPIED).
4. Letters confirmed to be in the word but NOT in these positions:
   - D is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - E (already fixed at 5) but the feedback shows E is not in position 4 (from VIDEO), which we already knew.

So the word looks like: O _ I _ E

We need two more letters:
- Position 2: Must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden.
- Position 4: Must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden.

Letters not used yet and not forbidden: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y, Z, U.

Also, from the feedback:
- D is in the word but not in positions 3,4,5. Since positions 1,2,3 are O, ?, I respectively, D must be in position 2 or 4.
- From VIDEO, D was marked ""-"" for position 4, meaning D is not in position 4.
- Therefore, D must be in position 2.

So the word is: O D I _ E

Now we need a letter for position 4 that's not forbidden and not used yet. Possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y, Z, U.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E with ""ODI__E"", the most common is ""ODIUM"" but that ends in M, not E. Wait, we need to think of any valid word that fits O D I _ E.

Possible options:
- ODIME (but M is possible)
- ODIBE (but B is possible)
- ODIGE (but G is possible)
- ODIKE (but K is possible)

- O D I G E (ODIGE - no)
- O D I B E (ODIBE - no)
- O D I K E (ODIKE - no)
- O D I F E (ODIFE - no)
- O D I H E (ODIHE - no)
- O D I W E (ODIWE - no)
- O D I Y E (ODIYE - no)
- O D I Z E (ODIZE - no)

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Did I make a mistake? Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the feedback from OPIED shows:
- O(✓) - correct in position 1
- P(x) - P not in word
- I(✓) - correct in position 3
- E(-) - E is in word but not in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5, so this is consistent)
- D(-) - D is in word but not in position 5 (which we already knew)

So the word is O _ I _ E with D somewhere in positions 2 or 4, but from VIDEO we saw D(-) at position 3, and from OPIED D(-) at position 5, so D could be 2 or 4.

But in VIDEO, D was at position 3 and got ""-"", so D is not at 3.
In OPIED, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", so D is not at 5.
Thus D must be at 2 or 4.

But in OPIED, I was at position 3 (correct), and D was at position 5 (incorrect position), so D could still be at 2 or 4.

Similarly, E is at 5, so position 4 must be another letter.

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with O, I at 3, E at 5: O _ I _ E.

Possible words:
- O B I D E (OBIDE - no)
- O D I U E (ODIUE - no)
- O F I N E (but N is forbidden)
- O G I V E (V is forbidden)
- O H I K E (K is possible, but OHIKE - no)
- O K I L E (L is forbidden)
- O M I N E (N is forbidden)
- O W I N E (N is forbidden)
- O X I D E (X is possible, OXIDE - yes!)

""OXIDE"" fits perfectly:
- O is in position 1 (confirmed)
- X is new (not forbidden)
- I is in position 3 (confirmed)
- D is in position 4 (not forbidden, and from VIDEO D(-) at 3, from OPIED D(-) at 5, so 4 is allowed)
