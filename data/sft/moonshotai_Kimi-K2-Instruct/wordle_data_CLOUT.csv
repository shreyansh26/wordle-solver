3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- RAISE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word or rule out many possibilities early.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word AND in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. Pattern: _ L _ _ _
2. The word contains T somewhere except position 4.
3. The word does NOT contain S, A, or E.

Good consonants still available (since S is out): R, N, C, M, P, D, B, G, F, V, etc.
Good vowels still available (since A and E are out): I, O, U.

We also know T must appear in 1, 3, or 5. Let’s try placing T in position 3 to maximize information.

A word that fits _ L T _ _ and uses fresh common letters:  
“FLINT” (F, L, I, N, T) – uses I for vowel, N common consonant, and reuses L and T.

Updated constraints after two guesses:

1. Pattern so far: _ L _ _ T  (T is now confirmed in position 5)
2. Letters known to be in the word: L (position 2), T (position 5)
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, E, F, I, N

Vowels remaining: O, U (since A, E, I are out)
Consonants still usable: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y (etc.)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ L _ _ T where positions 1, 3, and 4 use the remaining pool of letters and no disallowed letters appear.

Quick ideas:
- BLOAT → has A (out)
- CLOUT → C,L,O,U,T – all still allowed
- CLOOT → double O allowed, but CLOUT is more common
- GLOUT → archaic, not common
- BLOUT → not a valid word

“CLOUT” fits the pattern, uses fresh vowel O and consonant C/U, and is a common word.

Check: C (✓), L (✓ already fixed), O (✓), U (✓), T (✓ already fixed).
None of F, I, N, S, A, E appear.
Positions: C (1), L (2), O (3), U (4), T (5) – this satisfies _ L _ _ T.
