- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good first guess would use several of these letters to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Common starter words include:
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- RAISE (same letters as ARISE)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses all vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
2. It includes S and R which are also common consonants
3. It has no repeating letters, giving us information about 5 different letters

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good first guess would use several of these letters to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Common starter words include:
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- RAISE (same letters as ARISE)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses all vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
2. It includes S and R which are also common consonants
3. It has no repeating letters, giving us information about 5 different letters

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:  
A(x) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)

- R is the only letter we know is in the word **and** is in the correct position (second position).  
- A, I, S, and E are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _

Next, I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position.
2. Does **not** contain A, I, S, or E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down the possibilities.

Good remaining common letters to try: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A word that fits well is “FRONT”:
- F is a common consonant not yet tested.
- R is correctly placed in the 2nd position.
- O is a common vowel not yet tested.
- N and T are common consonants not yet tested.

No forbidden letters (A, I, S, E) are used.

Thus, “FRONT” is a strong second guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

Combining with the earlier feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, I, S, E, F, O, N
3. T is in the word but **not** in the fifth position (so T must be in position 1, 3, or 4).

Good remaining common letters to try next: U, D, L, C, G, Y, M, K, H, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Contains T somewhere other than position 5.
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (A, I, S, E, F, O, N).
- Uses other still-possible letters.

Possible candidates:
- TRULY → T in position 1, R in position 2, uses U, L, Y. No forbidden letters.
- CRUDS → C, R, U, D, S – but S is forbidden.
- DRUMK → K isn’t in the dictionary; invalid.
- TRUCK → O is forbidden.
- TRULY is still valid.

Therefore, “TRULY” is a good third guess.
