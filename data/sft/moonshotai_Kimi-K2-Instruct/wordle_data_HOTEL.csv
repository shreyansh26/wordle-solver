Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.)
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain

Good strategic first guesses include words like SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO. I'll go with SLATE as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: not in the word at all (x)
- T: in the word, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: in the word, but not in position 5 (-)

So the hidden word contains L, T, and E, but not in positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively. It does NOT contain S or A.

Letters to include: L, T, E  
Letters to exclude: S, A  
Positions to avoid: L≠2, T≠4, E≠5

Possible placements:
- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- T could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Also, we need two more letters (since we excluded S and A) that are not yet tested. Good candidates are common letters like R, N, O, I, C, etc.

Let’s try a word that rearranges L, T, E and adds fresh common letters. One candidate is ""RENTL"" but that’s invalid. Another is ""LITER"" – but E is in position 4, which is allowed (E≠5). Let’s check:
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- I (new letter)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R (new letter)

""LITER"" seems valid and uses new common letters (I, R).

From the two previous guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LITER → L(-) I(x) T(✓) E(✓) R(x)

What we now know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: S, A, I, R
2. Letters IN the word:
   - T is in the word and is in position 3
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (so L must be in 4 or 5)
3. Therefore, positions so far:
   - Position 3 = T
   - Position 4 or 5 = L
   - E is somewhere except positions 4 and 5 (but positions 1,2,3 are possible; but T is in 3, so E must be in 1 or 2)

So the word structure so far:
- If E is in position 1: E _ T _ L
- If E is in position 2: _ E T _ L

We need two more letters (from remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y). We want to test new letters that are common, and avoid repeats of S, A, I, R.

Let’s test the pattern E _ T _ L first. Possible fillers for positions 2 and 4 (from remaining letters).

Good common letters to test next: N, O, H, M, C, D.

Try the word ""ENTRY"" – but R is excluded. Not good.

Try ""ETHYL"" – but Y is possible and H is possible. Structure: E T T _ L – but T is already in position 3, and can't repeat. So invalid.

Try ""EXTOL"" – but O and X. X is less common, but let's see: E X T O L  
Check constraints:
- T in 3: ✓
- E in 1: allowed (not excluded from 1)
- L in 5: allowed (L must be in 4 or 5)
- X and O are new, allowed.

""EXTOL"" seems valid.

Alternatively, ""METOL"" – but R is excluded, M and O are new. But E would be in 2, T in 3, O in 4, L in 5. Structure: _ E T O L  
Check:
- E in 2: allowed (E not in 4 is already satisfied)
- T in 3: ✓
- L in 5: allowed
- M and O are new.

""METOL"" is also valid. Between the two, ""EXTOL"" uses X which is less common, so ""METOL"" is slightly better.

But ""METOL"" is not a valid English word (""METOL"" is a chemical compound but might not be in the dictionary). A better valid word is ""BETEL"" – but A is excluded, E in 2, T in 3, E in 4 (but E can't be in 4 from earlier feedback). So invalid.

Another option: ""HOTEL"" – H, O, T, E, L  
Check:
- T in 3: ✓
- E in 2: allowed
- L in 5: allowed
- H and O are new.

""HOTEL"" fits all constraints:
- Letters: H, O, T, E, L
- No S, A, I, R
- T is correctly in position 3
- E is not in position 4
- L is not in positions 1 or 2, so position 5 is allowed

Therefore, ""HOTEL"" is a strong next guess.
