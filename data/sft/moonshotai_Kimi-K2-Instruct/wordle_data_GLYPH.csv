For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about the secret word. The best first guesses in Wordle typically include common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Popular opening words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but fewer consonants)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's highly regarded for providing good information about both vowels and common consonants. This should help eliminate many possibilities early.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- L is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- S, A, T, E are not in the word at all.
So the secret word looks like _ L _ _ _. 

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word: L (position 2)

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 2nd position, avoiding S, A, T, E.  
Good strategy: pick a word full of new, common consonants and a vowel we haven’t tested yet (only vowels left to test are I, O, U).  
Examples:  
- BLIMP (uses B, M, P, I)  
- CLOUD (uses C, O, U, D – but has O and U which is okay)  
- FLING (uses F, N, G, I)

We now know:
1. Pattern: _ L _ _ _
2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  ⇒ P must be in position 3.  
   Therefore the pattern is _ L P _ _
3. Eliminated letters so far:  
   S A T E B I M U N K

Remaining common consonants still to test: C, D, F, G, H, J, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels still to test: O, (no A E I U left)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has L in position 2
- has P in position 3
- only uses letters not yet eliminated
- uses at least one of the remaining vowels (only O is available)

Possible candidates:
- F L O P ?  – but the last letter must be an unused consonant and still form a valid word.
- G L O P ?  
- C L O P ?

Valid 5-letter words under these constraints:
- GLOPS – plural of “glop”, valid in most dictionaries.
- FLOPS – plural of “flop”, but S has already been eliminated.
- CLOPS – plural of “clop”, but S is eliminated.

GLOPS would test G, O, S. However S is already ruled out, so it would be invalid.  
Another approach: use O and two new consonants in the 4th and 5th positions.

Try: F L O P ? – no 5-letter word ends with “flop” plus a letter.  
Next: C L O P ? – same issue.

Actually, with P locked in position 3, the word is _ L P _ _.  
We have only O left for a vowel.  
The 4th and 5th letters must be two consonants from the remaining set and still form a word.

Looking at 5-letter words fitting _ L P _ _:
- CLYPE – uses C, Y, E. E is eliminated.
- GLYPH – uses G, Y, H. No O; but we have no requirement to include O, we just can’t use eliminated letters. GLYPH has G, L, Y, P, H. All unused so far.

Therefore GLYPH satisfies:
- L in position 2, P in position 3
- No eliminated letters (S A T E B I M U N K all absent)
- Tests new letters G, Y, H, P (with P confirmed already, but positions now locked).

So GLYPH is the best next guess.
