For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me a high chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, while also covering many possible letters that might be in the word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with AROSE as it's a classic opening guess that has proven effective.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the remaining letters we have clues for:
- R and E must appear somewhere in the word.
- A, O, S are ruled out.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. R is not in position 2.
3. E is not in position 5.
4. Does NOT use A, O, S.

Popular letters not yet tested include T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, etc. Since we’ve eliminated A, O, S, I’ll try to incorporate some of these new letters.

A good candidate is “RENT” but it’s only 4 letters. “TREND” is 5 letters and fits:
- T, R, E, N, D – none are ruled out except for R and E placement.

Check positions:
- R is in position 2 in “TREND” – but feedback said R is NOT in position 2. So “TREND” is invalid.

Next candidate: “ENTRY”
- E, N, T, R, Y
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since E is not in position 5)
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R is not restricted here)
- No A, O, S are used.

This looks good. Let’s go with ENTRY.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word:
A, O, S, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):
R (but not in positions 2 or 4)
E (but not in positions 1 or 5)

Letters whose positions are confirmed:
Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ Y

Available letters (common ones we haven’t ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We must place:
- R somewhere in positions 1, 3 (since 2 and 4 are excluded for R)
- E somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded for E)

Let’s try to build a word with these constraints.

A possible structure:
- R in position 1 or 3
- E in position 2, 3, or 4
- Y in position 5

Let’s try R _ E _ Y → but position 4 is not allowed for R anyway, so R I E D Y? No, D is fine but ""RIEDY"" isn’t a word.

How about C R E E Y – but that’s not valid.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words ending in Y that include R and E but exclude A, O, S, N, T.

Some candidates:
- FERRY – but T is excluded (not in FERRY, so ok), but R is in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed). So far:
  - Letters: F, E, R, R, Y – but we don’t know if R can appear twice. Original rules didn’t forbid double letters, so possible.
  - However, FERRY uses R twice – we don’t have info against that.

But let’s avoid double letters for now to maximize info.

Another: PERKY – P, E, R, K, Y
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- No banned letters.
- This is valid.

Another: REPAY – but A is banned.
DERRY – but R is repeated.
BERRY – same issue with double R.
MERRY – same.

PERKY seems cleanest.
