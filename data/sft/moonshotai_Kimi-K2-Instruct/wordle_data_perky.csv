For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N and vowels A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word uses a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants R and S
- This maximizes the chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word
- It's a valid English word

O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.

Next, we need a word that:

2. Tests new common consonants (T, N, L, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, U).
3. Places R somewhere other than the 2nd position and E somewhere other than 5th.

A good candidate is “INERT”:

- Tests I and N and T, which are high-frequency letters we haven’t checked yet.
- Avoids A, O, S.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are OUT: A, O, S, I, N, T, C, D  
Letters that must be in the word: R and E (each appears at least once).

Position constraints so far:

R  
- not in 2 (from AROSE)  
- not in 4 (from INERT)  
- not in 1 (from CREED)  
Thus R can only be in 3rd or 5th position.

E  
- not in 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, INERT, CREED)  
Thus E must be in 4th position.

So we know:
- 4th letter = E
- R must appear exactly once, in 3rd or 5th spot
- Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, (and maybe U, etc.)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in 4th position
2. Contains R once, either in 3rd or 5th position
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters

Candidate words:
- If R is in 3rd: _ _ R E _  → e.g. “PUREE” (but U is ok, P ok)
- If R is in 5th: _ _ _ E R → e.g. “LUGER” (L, U, G ok)

Let’s test one of these that is common and uses only fresh letters:
“LUGER”  
- Letters: L, U, G, E, R  
- All letters are still allowed  
- Places E in 4th (required) and R in 5th (allowed)  
- Will pinpoint whether R is in 3rd or 5th.

If LUGER gives R(✓) then R is in 5th; if it gives R(x) then R must be in 3rd (and we’ll try _ _ R E _ next).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N and vowels A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word uses a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All five vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants R and S
- This maximizes the chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word
- It's a valid English word

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely not in the answer: A, O, S.
- Letters definitely in the answer: R and E, but their positions are still unknown (R ≠ 2, E ≠ 5).

Next, we need a word that:
1. Uses R and E, but avoids A, O, S.
2. Tests new common consonants (T, N, L, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, U).
3. Places R somewhere other than the 2nd position and E somewhere other than 5th.

A good candidate is “INERT”:
- Contains both R and E where R is in 3rd position (not 2nd) and E is in 2nd position (not 5th).
- Tests I and N and T, which are high-frequency letters we haven’t checked yet.
- Avoids A, O, S.

2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
   - Eliminates I, N, T
   - Confirms R and E are still somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 for R and NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 for E.

So far we’ve ruled out:
Letters: A, O, S, I, N, T
Positions: R ≠ 2,4,5  → R must be in 1 or 3
           E ≠ 2,3,5  → E must be in 1 or 4

Also, the secret word uses only letters we haven’t eliminated (R, E, plus any of C, D, L, U, etc.).

Let’s try a word that places R in slot 1 and E in slot 4, and introduces new common consonants. A promising candidate is “CREED”:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are OUT: A, O, S, I, N, T, C, D  
Letters that must be in the word: R and E (each appears at least once).

Position constraints so far:

R  
- not in 2 (from AROSE)  
- not in 4 (from INERT)  
- not in 1 (from CREED)  
Thus R can only be in 3rd or 5th position.

E  
- not in 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, INERT, CREED)  
Thus E must be in 4th position.

So we know:
- 4th letter = E
- R must appear exactly once, in 3rd or 5th spot
- Allowed letters left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, (and maybe U, etc.)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in 4th position
2. Contains R once, either in 3rd or 5th position
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters

Candidate words:
- If R is in 3rd: _ _ R E _  → e.g. “PUREE” (but U is ok, P ok)
- If R is in 5th: _ _ _ E R → e.g. “LUGER” (L, U, G ok)

Let’s test one of these that is common and uses only fresh letters:
“LUGER”  
- Letters: L, U, G, E, R  
- All letters are still allowed  
- Places E in 4th (required) and R in 5th (allowed)  
- Will pinpoint whether R is in 3rd or 5th.

If LUGER gives R(✓) then R is in 5th; if it gives R(x) then R must be in 3rd (and we’ll try _ _ R E _ next).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step deduction after four guesses:

1. Eliminated letters: A, O, S, I, N, T, C, D, L, U, G  
   (from feedback on all four guesses)

2. Confirmed letters still in play:  
   - E must appear (feedback always shows “-”)  
   - R must appear (feedback always shows “-”)  

3. Updated position rules:  
   - R is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → R must be 3rd letter.  
   - E is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → E must be 4th letter.  

4. Word skeleton so far: _ _ R E _  
   Remaining allowed consonants: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
   Remaining allowed vowels (other than E): none (A, I, O, U already ruled out)

5. Need a 5-letter word whose pattern is **? ? R E ?**, using only the still-allowed letters.  
   Examples that fit: “MERRY”, “FERRE”, “PERKY”, “HERBY”, “VERVE”.

6. Among these, “HERBY” uses fresh (H, B, Y) and is common.

Therefore, the next guess is HERBY.
