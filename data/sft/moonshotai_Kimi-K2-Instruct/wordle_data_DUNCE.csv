1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, there's no feedback to work with yet. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters frequently found in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (especially S and E) and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word (all marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So the mystery word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that ends with E and avoids those four letters entirely. To maximize information, I should pick a word with new, common letters. Good candidates are:
- BORNE (B, O, R, N, E)
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E)

So far we know:
- The word ends in E (✓ in both guesses).

- The letter C appears in the word but is NOT in position 1.

The remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (since position 5 is already E). I need a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does not include S, L, A, T, H, O, R.
- Includes C somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Common letters left to try: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words (must have C in positions 2-4 and end with E):
- BICNE – invalid (no such word).
- CYCLE – invalid (contains Y and C in wrong place for C).
- FICHE – valid word (microphotograph), ends in E, no forbidden letters, C in position 3.
- MIDGE – invalid (no C).
- NIECE – invalid (no C).

A valid word that fits is ""FICHE"". It satisfies:

- Contains C in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters: F, I, C, H, E. But wait, H is excluded. Oops!

Current knowledge:
1. Position 5 is definitely E (from all three guesses).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, H, O, R, M, I.
3. Letters in the word and in their exact positions:
   - Position 4: C (from MINCE).
   - Position 3: N (from MINCE).
   - Position 5: E (from all guesses).

So the word has the pattern: _ _ N C E

Letters still available (excluding the forbidden ones and the already placed N, C, E):
Allowed so far: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats if needed.

Need a 5-letter word ending in NCE:
- Common examples: DUNCE, PENCE (invalid: P is allowed, but both have I/E/A excluded or repeat E)
- FENCE – F is allowed, but E is already fixed.
- DUNCE – D, U, N, C, E – all allowed letters, ends in NCE.

DUNCE fits perfectly:
- D U N C E
- No forbidden letters.
- Matches the confirmed N, C, E positions.

So the word is DUNCE.
