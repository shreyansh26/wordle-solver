For the first guess, it's optimal to use a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains a mix of these common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

None of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.

I need a fresh set of consonants and vowels. Common English letters that haven’t been tried yet include:  
- Vowels: I, U

A balanced second guess should include several of these unused common letters to maximize new information. A good candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because it uses three new consonants plus two new vowels without repeating any of the ruled-out letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are NOT in the word.  
2. Letters I and L are in the word but in the wrong positions (second guess “UNTIL” → I is at position 4, L is at position 5).

Therefore, the hidden word:
- Contains I and L.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out) include: D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and L correctly.  
I was in position 4 (wrong), so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
L was in position 5 (wrong), so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should:
- Include I and L in new positions.  
- Introduce several unused common consonants to test those letters.

Candidate word: “PLUMB”  
- Uses P, L, U, M, B.  
But U was already ruled out (x), so eliminate that.

Candidate word: “FILMY”  
- Uses F, I, L, M, Y.  
- No disallowed letters.  
- Places I in position 2 and L in position 3 (new placements).  
- Introduces F, M, Y (all still possible).

   Therefore:
   - I must be at position 1, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already M, so I must be at 1 or 3.  
   - L must be at position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

6. Possible patterns (with M fixed at 5):
   - Pattern 1: I _ _ _ M  
   - Pattern 2: _ I _ _ M (but I can’t be at 2, so this is invalid)  
   - Pattern 3: _ _ I _ M  

   So viable patterns are:
   (1) I _ _ _ M  
   (2) _ _ I _ M  

7. We need to place L and two more distinct consonants from the still-possible set.

   For pattern (1) I _ _ _ M:
   - L must go to 2 or 3 or 4.  
   - Let’s try L in 2: I L _ _ M  
     Remaining letters: choose from B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z.  
     Need two more letters. Common choice: C, K → I L C K M (invalid, 5 letters total).  
     Actually, we already have I, L, M; need two more letters in positions 3 and 4.  
     Example: I L D K M → “ILDKM” not a valid word.  
     Try I L D G M → “ILDGM” not valid.  
     Try I L P C M → “ILPCM” not valid.  

   For pattern (2) _ _ I _ M:
   - L must go to 1, 2, or 4.  
   - Try L in 1: L _ I _ M  
     Need a letter for position 2 and 4.  
     Possible word: L I _ _ M – but that repeats I.  
     Try L B I D M → “LBIDM” – not valid.  
     Try L I D K M – invalid.  
     Try L I C K M – invalid.  

   Try L in 4: _ _ I L M  
   - Need letters for positions 1 and 2.  
   - Possible word: B I C K M – but I is at 2, which is invalid (I can’t be 2).  
   - Possible word: P I C K M – same issue with I at 2.  

   Actually, pattern (2) is _ _ I _ M, so positions 1 and 2 are open.  
   Try: D I C K M – but I is at 2 (invalid).  

   Try pattern (1) with L in 4: I _ _ L M  
   - Need letters for 2 and 3.  
   - Possible word: I C K L M – “ICKLM” not valid.  

   Let’s list actual 5-letter words that fit:
   - Ends with M, contains I and L, no forbidden letters.

   Possible words:
   - “CLIMB” – contains C, L, I, M, B.  
     Check: M at 5 ✓.  
     I is at 3 (allowed), L is at 2 (allowed).  
     Letters C, L, I, M, B are all allowed.  
     This seems valid.

Let’s confirm:
- C: not yet ruled out.  
- L: must be in word (from earlier).  
- I: must be in word.  
- M: confirmed at 5.  
- B: not yet ruled out.  

Thus, “CLIMB” is a valid guess that fits all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,blimp,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's optimal to use a word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains a mix of these common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a lot of common starter words and vowels.  
I need a fresh set of consonants and vowels. Common English letters that haven’t been tried yet include:  
- Vowels: I, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced second guess should include several of these unused common letters to maximize new information. A good candidate is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L) because it uses three new consonants plus two new vowels without repeating any of the ruled-out letters.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are NOT in the word.  
2. Letters I and L are in the word but in the wrong positions (second guess “UNTIL” → I is at position 4, L is at position 5).

Therefore, the hidden word:
- Contains I and L.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out) include: D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and L correctly.  
I was in position 4 (wrong), so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
L was in position 5 (wrong), so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A good next guess should:
- Include I and L in new positions.  
- Introduce several unused common consonants to test those letters.

Candidate word: “PLUMB”  
- Uses P, L, U, M, B.  
But U was already ruled out (x), so eliminate that.

Candidate word: “FILMY”  
- Uses F, I, L, M, Y.  
- No disallowed letters.  
- Places I in position 2 and L in position 3 (new placements).  
- Introduces F, M, Y (all still possible).

This seems like a strong next guess.

  – L is at position 2 (from CLIMB feedback: L(✓))
  – I is at position 3 (from CLIMB feedback: I(✓))
  – M is at position 5 (from CLIMB feedback: M(✓))

- Letters confirmed in the word but in the wrong positions:
  – B is in the word but not at position 4 (from CLIMB feedback: B(-))

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedbacks so far):
  – A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, Y, C

- Still possible letters (not yet ruled out and not yet placed):
  – B (must be in the word, but not at position 4)
  – D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z (none of these have been used yet)

Current known structure:
- _ L I _ M
- The fourth letter must be B (since B is in the word but not at position 4, and positions 1 and 4 are the only remaining spots; position 4 is the only place left for B because position 1 is open)
Wait, no: B cannot be at position 4 (from CLIMB feedback), so B must be at position 1.

Thus the word must be: B L I _ M
The only remaining spot is position 4, which must be a letter not yet ruled out. From earlier, possible letters are D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word with the pattern B L I _ M. Checking common English words:
- BLIMP: fits (B, L, I, M, P) – but M is already at position 5, so this would be B L I P M, which is not a valid word.
- BLITZ: B L I T Z – but T is ruled out.
- BLIND: B L I N D – N is ruled out.
- BLINK: B L I N K – N is ruled out.
- BLISS: S is ruled out.
- BLIGH: B L I G H – but this is 5 letters, valid word? Actually ""BLIGH"" is a surname, not common.
- BLIMP was invalid as above.
- BLIPM is not a word.
- BLIVM is not a word.
Wait, let me think differently: the pattern is _ L I _ M with B in position 1.
So B L I _ M. The only possible word is ""BLIMP"" but that has P at 4 and M at 5, which is correct (M is at 5), so ""BLIMP"" would be B L I P M. However, ""BLIMP"" is a valid word. Let's check if P has been ruled out – no, P hasn't appeared in any guess yet. So P is allowed.

But wait, does BLIMP fit all constraints?
- Letters: B, L, I, P, M
  – B: must be in word, not at 4 (it's at 1) – ok
  – L: at 2 – ok
  – I: at 3 – ok
  – M: at 5 – ok
  – P: new letter, allowed
  – All disallowed letters are absent.

Thus the word must be ""BLIMP"".

Based on the feedback, we have:
- Positions confirmed: _ L I _ M
- Letters confirmed: B (must be in word, not at 4), L (at 2), I (at 3), M (at 5)
- Thus the word must be B L I _ M with B at position 1 and P completing the word at position 4.
