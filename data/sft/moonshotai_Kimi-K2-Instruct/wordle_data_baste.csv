For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A classic strategy is to use a word like ""SLATE"" or ""AROSE"" because they include common vowels and consonants. 

I'm going with ""AROSE"" because:
- A is a very common vowel.
- R is a common consonant.
- O is another common vowel.
- S is very common in 5-letter words.
- E is the most common vowel in English.

This gives a broad coverage of common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth).

So the target word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A (but not in position 1) and S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain R or O.

Possible placement of A: positions 2,3,4,5. Position 5 is already E, so A could be 2,3, or 4.
Possible placement of S: positions 1,2,3,5. Position 5 is E, so S could be 1,2, or 3.

Let's pick a word that tries different positions for A and S while avoiding R and O, and ending in E.
A good candidate is ""SLATE""—but we've already used AROSE, and SLATE repeats S and E but moves S to position 1 and A to position 2. Let's check:
- S in position 1: allowed, since original S was in position 4.
- A in position 2: allowed, since original A was in position 1.
- L, T: new letters to test.
- Ends with E: matches.

But another approach is to try a word that keeps E at the end and tests new common letters while placing A and S in new positions. ""STAGE"" uses S in position 1 and A in position 3, with T, G as new consonants. However, ""STAGE"" ends with E but has A in position 3 and S in position 1, both valid.

Another strong option is ""STAKE"":
- S in position 1 (valid, since original S was in position 4).
- T: new consonant.
- A in position 3 (valid, since original A was in position 1).
- K: new consonant.
- E in position 5 (correct).

This seems like a balanced next guess.

Let's re-express the constraints we now have:

1. E is in position 5 (✓ from both guesses).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3 (from AROSE and STAKE it appeared in positions 1 and 3 with “-”).  
   So A can only be in position 2 or 4.
3. S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 (from AROSE) and NOT in 1 (from STAKE).  
   So S must be in position 2 or 3.
4. T is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from STAKE).  
5. R and O are NOT in the word at all (from AROSE).
6. K is NOT in the word (from STAKE).

We still need to place:  
- A (positions 2 or 4)  
- S (positions 2 or 3)  
- T (positions 1, 3, 4, 5? but E is fixed at 5)  
- plus two more consonants.

A helpful way is to test A and S in the remaining valid positions while introducing new consonants.

Possible patterns:
- If A is in 2, then S must be in 3: _ A S _ E  
- If A is in 4, then S can be in 2 or 3:

   – _ S _ A E  
   – _ _ S A E  

We also know T must appear somewhere.  
Let’s pick the pattern _ A S _ E first; this fixes A=2, S=3, E=5.  
We now need a consonant in position 1 and a consonant in position 4, both unused so far.  
We have not used letters like C, L, M, N, P, D, etc.  
A common word fitting this is “MASEL” — but L is plausible, and M is unused.  
Actually “MASEL” is not a common English word, so let’s try “BASEL” – again, B and L are unused.  
But “BASEL” is a proper noun. A more common word is “BASSE” but that has double S.  
How about “PASSE”? Uses P, S, A, E – but E is already fixed in 5, and P is unused. Wait, that’s five letters: P A S S E – two S’s. That’s not ideal.

Let’s instead try the _ _ S A E pattern, which puts A in 4 and S in 3. Then positions 1,2,5 are set except 5 is E.  
So we have _ _ S A E.  
We need T somewhere, and it can’t be in position 2. So T could be in 1. That gives T _ S A E.  
What consonant fits in position 2? We have unused letters like N, M, L, etc.  
“TNSAE” is not a word. Let’s try L: T L S A E – “TLSAE”? Not valid.  
N: T N S A E – “TNSAE” – not valid either.

Let’s try _ S _ A E pattern: positions 2=S, 4=A, 5=E.  
We need a consonant in 1 and 3, and T must appear.  
If we put T in 1 we get T S _ A E – needs 3rd letter. Common word? “TSADE” – no.  
Put T in 3: _ S T A E – we need a consonant in 1. Some valid words:  
“C” – C S T A E – “CSTAE”? No.  
“D” – D S T A E – “DSTAE”? No.  
“H” – H S T A E – “HSTAE”? No.  

Actually, a real word that fits _ A S _ E and avoids all our exclusions is “BASTE”:  
B (unused), A (position 2), S (position 3), T (position 4), E (position 5).  
Check constraints:  
- B is new, allowed.  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in 3 (allowed).  
- T is in 4 (allowed).  
- E in 5.
