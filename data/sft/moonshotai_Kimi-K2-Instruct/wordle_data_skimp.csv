- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information. The best starting words typically contain common letters and vowels. Common strategies suggest words like:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- SOARE (S, O, A, R, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). This gives good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

All five letters in CRANE were marked “x”, so none of C, R, A, N, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must rely on the remaining 21 letters.  
To maximize information, I want a fresh set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.  
A strong second-guess candidate is “SOUTH”: it uses the very common letters S, O, U, T, H, none of which overlap with the eliminated set.  
This gives coverage of two more vowels (O, U) plus three common consonants (S, T, H).

Now we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, U, T, H.
- The letter S is in the word and it is in the first position (because S got ✓ in the first position).

So the secret word pattern is: S _ _ _ _

We still need to use the remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out:
- Vowels left: I
- Consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

To make an informative guess, we want to test several new letters at once. A good candidate should use S at the start and combine it with common remaining letters. ""SPLIT"" fits: S (position 1 confirmed), P, L, I, T. However, T was already ruled out (x in SOUTH). So we need another word.

Let's try ""SKIMP"":
- S (position 1 confirmed ✓ from previous feedback)
- K, I, M, P are all new letters not previously tested.
This gives us four new letters to evaluate while keeping S fixed in the first position.

Alternative words could be ""SKILL"" (but L is repeated), ""SWING"" (W and G are new), but ""SKIMP"" seems to give a good spread.
