For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters, and it has no repeated letters. This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Known facts so far:
- The word contains an A somewhere other than position 2.
- It definitely does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
- (Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are still open for A, and we have no info yet about letters B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, O, T, U, etc.)

We want a second guess that:
1. Uses the known presence of A but in a different spot (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Introduces several new high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tested yet, such as T, N, L, C, O, M, etc.
3. Avoids any letters already ruled out (R, I, S, E).

A strong candidate is “FLOAT”:
- F, L, O, A, T are all still possible letters.
- Places the A in position 4 (new spot).
- Uses T and O, which are common and untested.
- Uses F and L, also common.
- Contains no ruled-out letters.

Alternative words like “PLANT” or “COAST” would also fit, but “FLOAT” keeps the vowel count low (only A and O) while covering five fresh consonants/vowels efficiently.
