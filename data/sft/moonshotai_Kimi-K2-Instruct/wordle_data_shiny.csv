For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize information gained. This is a strategic approach since I have no prior information about the secret word. Some good starter words include:

- STARE (uses common letters S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but less consonant info)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common initial letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in multiple positions.

So far we know:

- S is correct in the first position.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

We now have:
- Fixed first letter: S
- Remaining letters to discover: positions 2, 3, 4, 5
- Letters we can still use: all except L, A, T, E

Good next vowels to test: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out)
Good consonants to test: R, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

A balanced second guess would keep the S fixed and introduce new common letters. I’ll try a word with S as the first letter and common unused letters elsewhere.

A strong candidate: “SOUND”
- S is already correct in first position.
- O and U cover the remaining common vowels.
- N and D are common consonants not yet tested.

Other options considered:
- “SPICE” – but uses E which we know is invalid.
- “SHORN” – but uses R and N which might be good, but “SOUND” covers more new vowels.

I’ll go with “SOUND” for maximum new information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize information gained. This is a strategic approach since I have no prior information about the secret word. Some good starter words include:

- STARE (uses common letters S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels, but less consonant info)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, ""SLATE"" seems particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common initial letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in multiple positions.

We now have:

- Letters we can still use: all except L, A, T, E

Good next vowels to test: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out)
Good consonants to test: R, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

A balanced second guess would keep the S fixed and introduce new common letters. I’ll try a word with S as the first letter and common unused letters elsewhere.

A strong candidate: “SOUND”
- S is already correct in first position.
- O and U cover the remaining common vowels.
- N and D are common consonants not yet tested.

- “SPICE” – but uses E which we know is invalid.

2. N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
3. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, O, U, D.

Remaining usable letters (common ones first): R, I, C, H, M, P, K, Y, B, G, F, V, W, etc.

Need:
- positions 2,3,4,5
- position 4 cannot be N
- must use N somewhere in positions 2,3,5 (since it’s in the word but not in position 4)

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps S at the start,
- places N in position 2 or 3 (to test its correct spot),
- uses common remaining consonants and vowels I (since A,E,O,U are out).

Candidate: “SINCH”
- S (fixed)
- I (only remaining common vowel)
- N (moves to position 3)
- C, H (common unused consonants)

Another candidate: “SNIPE” – but E is invalid.
“SNIRK” – uses K, but N is in position 2, which is plausible.

I’ll go with “SINCH” to test N in position 3 and introduce I, C, H.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(x) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: SINCH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(-) N(-) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (from Guess 2 and 3 feedback). Therefore N must be in position 2 or 5.
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (from Guess 3 feedback).
- C and H are not in the word.
- L, A, T, E, O, U, D are already ruled out.

So we need:
- S _ _ _ _ (position 1 is S)
- N must appear in position 2 or 5.
- I must appear somewhere (position 3,4,5) but not position 2.
- Other letters can be from remaining pool: R, K, Y, B, G, F, V, W, M, P, etc.

Let's try placing N in position 2, since it's a strong possibility:
- S N _ _ _
Now we need three more letters. We know I must be in the word somewhere, and the remaining positions are 3,4,5.

Good candidates:
- S N I _ _ (I in position 3)
- S N _ I _ (I in position 4)
- S N _ _ I (I in position 5)

Possible words:
- SNIPY (but Y is less common)
- SNIPE (E is invalid)
- SNIRT (T is invalid)
- SNIRK (K is unused)

""SNIRK"" seems good because:
- Uses N in position 2 (testing this placement)
- Uses I in position 3
- Uses R and K which are unused common letters
- R and K are both plausible

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- S is locked in position 1.
- N is confirmed to be in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). Therefore N must be in position 5.
- I is confirmed to be in the word and is now locked in position 3 (from Guess 4 feedback).
- R and K are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now:
S _ I _ N

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc. (excluding L,A,T,E,O,U,D,C,H,R,K).

We need consonants for positions 2 and 4 that fit this pattern.

Looking for common consonants that haven’t been used yet:
- Position 2: B, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 4: B, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- SWIMN – not a valid word
- SMITH – T is invalid
- SPINN – not valid
- SWIGN – not valid
- SPINY – valid word
- SWINE – E is invalid
- SVING – not valid
- SWIMN – not valid

The only valid word that fits is ""SPINY"":
- S P I N Y
- S (✓) at position 1
- P at position 2 (unused letter)
- I (✓) at position 3
- N (✓) at position 5
- Y at position 4 (unused letter)

Let's verify:
- P and Y haven’t been ruled out.
- All constraints are satisfied.

Current confirmed facts:

2. Position 3 = I
3. Position 4 = N
4. Position 5 = Y

Thus the pattern is: S _ I N Y

Common words:
- SBINY – not valid
- SFINY – not valid
- SGINY – not valid
- SMINY – not valid
- SVINY – not valid
- SWINY – valid word (archaic plural of swine, but acceptable in word lists)

Another valid option:
- S I N Y requires a consonant in position 2 that forms a valid word. The only common valid word fitting this pattern is ""SWINY"".

Double-checking:
