Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a starting word that will give me maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Good starting words contain letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N.

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S - very common consonant
- L - common consonant
- A - very common vowel
- T - common consonant
- E - very common vowel

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters, which will help eliminate or confirm many possible letters in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E

We need a second word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Uses none of L, A, T, E
3. Brings in new common letters to narrow down the remaining four positions.

Good remaining frequent consonants: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A, E are out)

A strong next guess would be “SOUND”:
- Starts with S
- Contains O and U (new vowels)
- Contains N and D (new consonants)
- Uses no banned letters (L, A, T, E)

This gives us four new letters to test while keeping S locked in place.

Current constraints:
- Word starts with S and has N in position 4: S _ _ N _
- Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, O, U, D
- Letters still allowed: any other consonants and the remaining vowels (I, Y) except those already ruled out.

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters not in the banned set and keeping the known pattern.

Frequent remaining consonants: R, C, M, P, B, G, F, H, K 
Remaining vowels: I (Y is rarer mid-word)

Good candidate letters for those three blanks: I, R, C, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

A strong third guess should test several fresh high-frequency letters.  
“SPRING” is 6 letters and invalid. A 5-letter word that fits: S, then P, R, I, and place the N in position 4. That forms “SPRIN” – but that’s not a common English word.  

Instead, try “SPINE”:
- S ✓ first letter  
- P, I, N (N ✓ in 4th spot), E is already banned – so invalid.

“SCRIM” – uses C, R, I, M but N is missing.

“SWINK” – uses W (low frequency) and K.

“SHRINK” – 6 letters.

Best 5-letter option that uses fresh common letters and keeps N in position 4: “SPRING” invalid length.

Actually, a valid common word: “SWINE” – but E is banned.

“SKIMP” – no N.

“STING” – T is banned.

“STINK” – T banned.

“SPANK” – A banned.

“SMIRK” – doesn’t put N in 4th.

Realize we must keep N in 4th spot and avoid banned letters. Possible common 5-letter words starting with S, ending with anything, N at position 4, and no banned letters:

- S _ I N _  → “SIN” pattern  
  - “SIN” + 2 letters – e.g., “SING” (4 letters)  
  - “S” + “I” + “N” + need another consonant: “S” + “P” + “I” + “N” + “K” = “SPINK” (not common).  

Another approach: S + C + R + I + N in correct order → “SCRIN” – not valid.

Wait, valid common word: “SCION” – N is last letter, not 4th.

Valid word pattern: S _ _ N _  → “S” + “W” + “I” + “N” + “G” = “SWING” – let’s check:
- S ✓  
- W – new letter  
- I – new vowel  
- N ✓ at 4th  
- G – new letter

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ I N _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, I, N
- Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, O, U, D, W, G
- Allowed letters (frequent ones): B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, V, Y (plus any others not yet excluded)

We need a letter for the second and fifth positions that:
1. Has not appeared in any of the three guesses (except to confirm its presence).
2. Does not violate the current pattern S _ I N _.

Let’s list possible second-position consonants (since vowels would be rare after S-):
B, C, F, H, K, M, P, R, V, Y

Likewise, for the fifth position.

A good guess should test a batch of fresh common consonants. A word like “SPIN?” works, but we need the fifth letter. 

Candidate: “SPINY” – but Y in the last position is plausible.
Check letters: S (✓), P (new), I (✓), N (✓), Y (new). None are in the banned list.

Another candidate: “SKINK” – repeats K, and K is new but word is uncommon.

“SCRIN” – invalid.

“SWINK” – W banned.

“SHINY” – H new, Y new.

“SHINY” uses:
- S (✓), H (new), I (✓), N (✓), Y (new)

Both “SPINY” and “SHINY” fit, but “SHINY” is more common and tests H and Y.

Therefore, the best next guess is “SHINY”.
