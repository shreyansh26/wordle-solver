Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I'll use a strategic starting word that contains common letters in English 5-letter words. The word should ideally have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

A strong first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) in common positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good positional coverage for vowels

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the target word must:
- Contain the letters R, O, E (each exactly once, since no duplicates were indicated).
- Exclude A and S.
- R cannot be in spot 2.
- O cannot be in spot 3.
- E cannot be in spot 5.

Need a 5-letter word that uses only the letters R, O, E plus two other letters (not A or S). Common consonants that haven’t been used yet are D, L, N, T, etc.

Let’s test “ROUTE”:
- R is in the word and could be in position 1.
- O is in the word and could be in position 2 or 4.
- U and T are new letters (not A or S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the target word must:
- Contain the letters R, O, E (each exactly once, since no duplicates were indicated).
- Exclude A and S.
- R cannot be in spot 2.
- O cannot be in spot 3.
- E cannot be in spot 5.

Need a 5-letter word that uses only the letters R, O, E plus two other letters (not A or S). Common consonants that haven’t been used yet are D, L, N, T, etc.

Let’s test “ROUTE”:
- R is in the word and could be in position 1.
- O is in the word and could be in position 2 or 4.
- U and T are new letters (not A or S).
- E is in the word, not in spot 5 (in spot 4 here).

This gives maximum new information while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- R (-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- O (✓): O is in the word and in position 2.
- U (x): U is not in the word.
- T (x): T is not in the word.
- E (-): E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so it must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).

We already knew:
- A, S, U, T are excluded.
- Required letters present: R, O, E (with O fixed at position 2).
- R cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) and now also cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 2). So R must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- E must be in 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is O and 5 is excluded).

Let’s deduce:
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _
- R must fit in positions 3,4,5.
- E must fit in positions 1,3,4 (but not 2 or 5).

So possible placements:
- E could be in 1 or 3 or 4.
- R could be in 3,4,5.

Let’s try placing E in position 1 and R in position 3 or 4. We’ll avoid letters A,S,U,T.
A good candidate is ""E R O D E"" but that repeats E. Next, ""F O R E X"" but X is uncommon.

How about ""FOREG""? No, G is uncommon and not ideal.

Instead, let’s use common letters D, L, N, etc.
Try ""B O R E D"":
- B is new and common.
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed: R can be in 3,4,5).
- E is in position 4 (allowed: E can be in 1,3,4).
- D is new and common.

This fits all constraints.

Guess 3: BORED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters in the word and their status  
- O: must be in position 2 (from Guess 2 and 3).  
- E: must be in position 4 (from Guess 3).  
- R: is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from Guess 1, 2, 3). That leaves only positions 4 or 5. However, position 4 is already occupied by E, so R must be in position 5.

Therefore the fixed pattern is:  
_ O _ E R

Forbidden letters so far: A, B, S, U, T, D.

We need a single letter for position 1 and position 3. They must be common English letters not yet ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  
Common remaining vowel: I

We want the most ordinary English word fitting _ O _ E R. Scanning possibilities:

C O V E R – but V is allowed, yet is “COVER” valid? Yes, and C, V are not yet excluded.

L O V E R – V is fine, L is fine.

M O V E R – same.

But simpler and more common: C O D E R? – D is already out.

H O P E R – P is fine.

F O C E R – not a common word.

G O N E R – “GONER” is valid.

C O M E R – “COMER” is valid.

N O V E R – not a word.

L O C E R – not a word.

Among these, “COVER” and “GONER” are both words. “COVER” is extremely common and uses C and V, neither of which has been tried yet.

So let’s choose:
C O V E R

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Known fixed positions:
- O in position 2
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

So the pattern is: _ O _ E R

Letters already ruled out: A, B, C, D, S, T, U, V

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3. Remaining common consonants: F, G, H, L, M, N, P, W, Y.  
Remaining vowel: I.

The two missing letters must be among these and must make a valid English word.

Let’s list the most common English words that fit _ O _ E R:

- F O L E R (not a word)
- G O N E R (G and N are allowed)
- H O P E R (H and P are allowed)
- L O V E R (V is ruled out)
- M O V E R (V is ruled out)
- P O K E R (K is allowed, but “P” can’t be in position 1 because P is allowed)
- W O R E R (not a word)
- Y O K E R (Y and K are allowed, but “YOKER” is uncommon)

The best choices are: GONER, HOPER, POKER.

Among these, GONER and HOPER are both good, but let’s pick HOPER because H and P are still unused and quite common.

So the guess is: H O P E R
