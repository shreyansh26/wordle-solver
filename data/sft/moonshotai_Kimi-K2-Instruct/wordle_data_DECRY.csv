For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. The word should ideally include frequently used letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common choices for such strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" etc. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. I'll choose a word that combines several of these. 

Good options would be:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters and provides good coverage for consonants and vowels.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is not in the word
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, N
- Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E
- Their positions are still unknown (except that E is not last, C is not first, R is not second)

To maximize information with the second guess, I want to place C, R, and E in new positions and surround them with fresh high-frequency letters. The remaining high-frequency consonants are S, T, L, D, and vowels I, O, U.

A good next word would place E not last, C not first, R not second, and avoid A/N. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S (new)
- T (new)
- O (new)
- R (known in word, new position 4 instead of 2)
- E (known in word, new position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5 - oops, conflict!)

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so ""STORE"" is invalid because we know E is not last. A better word is ""TRIES"":
- T
- R (allowed in position 2 because feedback only said R is not in position 2, so this is bad too - same position)

Another approach: place E not last, C not first, R not second. A good word could be ""TOWER"":
- T
- O
- W
- E (allowed in position 4)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But wait, feedback said R is not in position 2, so R could be in 3,4, or 5. Similarly, E could be in 1-4, and C could be in 2-5.

Alternative word: ""PRICE"":
- P (new)
- R (allowed in position 2? No, feedback said R is not in position 2)
  
Let's try ""CREST"":
- C (allowed in position 1? No, feedback said C is not in position 1)
  
Next try ""STEER"":
- S
- T
- E (allowed in position 3)
- E (but we don't know if letters repeat)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But repeating E might not be optimal. A better word is ""STOIC"":
- S
- T
- O
- I
- C (allowed in position 5)

But this excludes R and E which we know are in the word. Need to include all known letters.

Re-evaluate: must include C, R, E in positions they haven't been in yet. C has only been in position 1 (ruled out), so C can be positions 2-5. R has only been in position 2 (ruled out), so R can be positions 1,3,4,5. E has been in position 5 (ruled out), so E can be positions 1-4.

So far we know:

Letters that are in the word (but position unknown):

- C (in the word, but not position 1 or 5)
- R (in the word, but not positions 2 or 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, N, T, I

That leaves these letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions:
- Position 2 is now fixed as E.

We still need to place C and R somewhere, and fill the other three spots using only the allowed letters.

C can be in positions 2,3,4 but position 2 is already E, so C must be in position 3 or 4.
R can be in positions 1,4,5 (since it can't be 2 or 3).

A good next move is to test several consonants with C and R in new positions.

Let's try placing C in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ C _ _

We need two more letters from the allowed set. Common letters left: S, L, O, U, etc.

A good candidate: ""RECKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (confirmed)
- C in position 3 (allowed)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,DECRY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. The word should ideally include frequently used letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common choices for such strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" etc. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. I'll choose a word that combines several of these. 

Good options would be:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters and provides good coverage for consonants and vowels.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is not in the word
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, N
- Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E
- Their positions are still unknown (except that E is not last, C is not first, R is not second)

To maximize information with the second guess, I want to place C, R, and E in new positions and surround them with fresh high-frequency letters. The remaining high-frequency consonants are S, T, L, D, and vowels I, O, U.

A good next word would place E not last, C not first, R not second, and avoid A/N. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S (new)
- T (new)
- O (new)
- R (known in word, new position 4 instead of 2)
- E (known in word, new position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5 - oops, conflict!)

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so ""STORE"" is invalid because we know E is not last. A better word is ""TRIES"":
- T
- R (allowed in position 2 because feedback only said R is not in position 2, so this is bad too - same position)

Another approach: place E not last, C not first, R not second. A good word could be ""TOWER"":
- T
- O
- W
- E (allowed in position 4)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But wait, feedback said R is not in position 2, so R could be in 3,4, or 5. Similarly, E could be in 1-4, and C could be in 2-5.

Alternative word: ""PRICE"":
- P (new)
- R (allowed in position 2? No, feedback said R is not in position 2)
  
Let's try ""CREST"":
- C (allowed in position 1? No, feedback said C is not in position 1)
  
Next try ""STEER"":
- S
- T
- E (allowed in position 3)
- E (but we don't know if letters repeat)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But repeating E might not be optimal. A better word is ""STOIC"":
- S
- T
- O
- I
- C (allowed in position 5)

But this excludes R and E which we know are in the word. Need to include all known letters.

Re-evaluate: must include C, R, E in positions they haven't been in yet. C has only been in position 1 (ruled out), so C can be positions 2-5. R has only been in position 2 (ruled out), so R can be positions 1,3,4,5. E has been in position 5 (ruled out), so E can be positions 1-4.

A good word satisfying these would be ""TERIC"":
- T
- E (allowed in position 2)
- R (allowed in position 3)
- I
- C (allowed in position 5)

This places all known letters in new positions and adds fresh letters T and I.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters that are in the word (but position unknown):
- E (now known to be in position 2)
- C (in the word, but not position 1 or 5)
- R (in the word, but not positions 2 or 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, N, T, I

That leaves these letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions:
- Position 2 is now fixed as E.

We still need to place C and R somewhere, and fill the other three spots using only the allowed letters.

C can be in positions 2,3,4 but position 2 is already E, so C must be in position 3 or 4.
R can be in positions 1,4,5 (since it can't be 2 or 3).

A good next move is to test several consonants with C and R in new positions.

Let's try placing C in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ C _ _

We need two more letters from the allowed set. Common letters left: S, L, O, U, etc.

A good candidate: ""RECKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (confirmed)
- C in position 3 (allowed)
- K (new)
- S (new)

This places all known letters in new positions and adds two fresh consonants K and S.

We now have:

Positions confirmed:
- Position 1 = D
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = C

Letters confirmed in the word:
- D, E, C, R

Letters known NOT in the word:
- A, N, T, I, K, S, O

Letters that must appear at least once more:
- R (it is in the word but we have not yet placed it: the only open positions are 3 and 5, and feedback from Guess 4 shows R(-), meaning R is NOT in position 5, so R must be in position 3)

So the word so far is:
D E R C _

Only position 5 is still open.

Available letters (not yet used and not ruled out):
From the remaining alphabet, exclude the known-absent (A, N, T, I, K, S, O) and letters already placed (D, E, R, C).

Valid remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We could test any of these, but since we have only one blank left and we want a valid English word, let’s pick the most common last-letter consonants.

Common final letters in 5-letter words: E (already used), D (already used), T (ruled out), S (ruled out), R (already placed), etc. 

Looking at our remaining list, frequent endings are F, L, M, P, Y.

A word that fits perfectly is:
D E R C Y

Check:
- D(✓) in pos 1
- E(✓) in pos 2
- R(✓) in pos 3
- C(✓) in pos 4
- Y is from the allowed set (not excluded).

""DERCY"" is not a valid English word. Next most common ending consonant is ""L"".

That gives us:
D E R C L

Check dictionary: ""DERCL"" is not valid. Next, ""DERCF"" is invalid. ""DERCM"" invalid.

Actually, let’s look for real words ending in a consonant with the pattern D E R C _.

A real word that matches is ""DERBY"" – but B and Y are allowed and not excluded. However, we know O is out, but Y is still available.

Let’s test: D E R B Y
Wait, we have pattern D E R C _. We can’t change C at position 4.

So we must have D E R C _ and need a valid English word.

Looking it up, the only common one is ""DERCH"" – but that’s uncommon and H is allowed.

Actually, let me re-examine remaining letters.

Valid English word that fits: ""DERCH"" is rare. ""DERCL"" – no.

Wait, are we missing something? Let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with D E R C.

That leaves only ""DERCL"" and ""DERCH"" – neither is standard.

This implies we might have missed earlier that the word has no 5th-letter consonant, or we might have miscounted. But position 5 must be a letter.

Upon reflection, the only valid word I can find fitting D E R C _ is ""DERCH"" (though uncommon), but let me double-check.

Actually, among standard Scrabble words, ""DERCL"" and ""DERCH"" are invalid. This suggests the only possibility is the word must be ""DERBY"", but that would require C to be B, which conflicts with confirmed C in position 4.

Re-examine constraints:

We have:
Positions:
1: D (✓)
2: E (✓)
3: must be R (because R must appear and cannot be in 5)
4: C (✓)
5: ?

Thus the word must be D E R C _ and the blank must be one of the remaining allowed letters, and must form a valid English word. The only valid word matching this pattern is ""DERCH"" – but this is very uncommon. 

However, note in Wordle-like games, uncommon words are sometimes answers. Given constraints, the possible letters left are B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try ""DERCH"" – but since it’s unclear, maybe we missed letter reuse. The word could potentially repeat a letter. If so, another consonant might be used again.

But since C, R, D, E are already used once, and remaining letters are limited, the only valid word appears to be ""DERCH"".

However, realizing this may be too obscure, let’s re-examine: is it possible C is not in position 4? No – from Guess 4, C(✓) in position 4.

Thus, the only remaining valid English word fitting D E R C _ is ""DERCH"".

But this seems unlikely. Let me re-check constraints:

From Guess 4: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) O(x) R(-)

This gives:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: C
- O is NOT in the word
- R is NOT in position 5

We already deduced R must be in position 3.

Thus the word is D E R C _. The only valid English word ending with D E R C _ is ""DERCH"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The word should ideally include frequently used letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common choices for such strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" etc. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, the top ones are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, etc. I'll choose a word that combines several of these. 

Good options would be:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters and provides good coverage for consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- A is not in the word
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, N
- Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E
- Their positions are still unknown (except that E is not last, C is not first, R is not second)

To maximize information with the second guess, I want to place C, R, and E in new positions and surround them with fresh high-frequency letters. The remaining high-frequency consonants are S, T, L, D, and vowels I, O, U.

A good next word would place E not last, C not first, R not second, and avoid A/N. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S (new)
- T (new)
- O (new)
- R (known in word, new position 4 instead of 2)
- E (known in word, new position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5 - oops, conflict!)

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so ""STORE"" is invalid because we know E is not last. A better word is ""TRIES"":
- T
- R (allowed in position 2 because feedback only said R is not in position 2, so this is bad too - same position)

Another approach: place E not last, C not first, R not second. A good word could be ""TOWER"":
- T
- O
- W
- E (allowed in position 4)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But wait, feedback said R is not in position 2, so R could be in 3,4, or 5. Similarly, E could be in 1-4, and C could be in 2-5.

Alternative word: ""PRICE"":
- P (new)
- R (allowed in position 2? No, feedback said R is not in position 2)
  
Let's try ""CREST"":
- C (allowed in position 1? No, feedback said C is not in position 1)
  
Next try ""STEER"":
- S
- T
- E (allowed in position 3)
- E (but we don't know if letters repeat)
- R (allowed in position 5)

But repeating E might not be optimal. A better word is ""STOIC"":
- S
- T
- O
- I
- C (allowed in position 5)

But this excludes R and E which we know are in the word. Need to include all known letters.

Re-evaluate: must include C, R, E in positions they haven't been in yet. C has only been in position 1 (ruled out), so C can be positions 2-5. R has only been in position 2 (ruled out), so R can be positions 1,3,4,5. E has been in position 5 (ruled out), so E can be positions 1-4.

A good word satisfying these would be ""TERIC"":
- T
- E (allowed in position 2)
- R (allowed in position 3)
- I
- C (allowed in position 5)

This places all known letters in new positions and adds fresh letters T and I.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

Letters that are in the word (but position unknown):

- C (in the word, but not position 1 or 5)
- R (in the word, but not positions 2 or 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, N, T, I

That leaves these letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions:
- Position 2 is now fixed as E.

We still need to place C and R somewhere, and fill the other three spots using only the allowed letters.

C can be in positions 2,3,4 but position 2 is already E, so C must be in position 3 or 4.
R can be in positions 1,4,5 (since it can't be 2 or 3).

A good next move is to test several consonants with C and R in new positions.

Let's try placing C in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ C _ _

We need two more letters from the allowed set. Common letters left: S, L, O, U, etc.

A good candidate: ""RECKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (confirmed)
- C in position 3 (allowed)
- K (new)
- S (new)

This places all known letters in new positions and adds two fresh consonants K and S.

Letters known NOT in the word:
A, N, T, I, K, S

Positions quickly filled:

Possible positions for the remaining letters:
- C can only be in position 4 (positions 1, 3, 5 have been ruled out).
- R cannot be in 1, 2, 3, so R must be in position 4 or 5.  
But position 4 is already taken by C, so R must be in position 5.

So far we have:
_ E _ C R

The only missing position is #1.  
Available letters (not yet used and not ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common first-letter consonants are B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S (but S is out), etc.

A high-frequency choice for position 1 is ""D"".  
That gives the word: D E _ C R → ""DECOR"".

- Position 4 = C

Letters confirmed in the word:
- D, E, C, R

Letters known NOT in the word:
- A, N, T, I, K, S, O

Letters that must appear at least once more:
- R (it is in the word but we have not yet placed it: the only open positions are 3 and 5, and feedback from Guess 4 shows R(-), meaning R is NOT in position 5, so R must be in position 3)

So the word so far is:
D E R C _

Only position 5 is still open.

Available letters (not yet used and not ruled out):
From the remaining alphabet, exclude the known-absent (A, N, T, I, K, S, O) and letters already placed (D, E, R, C).

Valid remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We could test any of these, but since we have only one blank left and we want a valid English word, let’s pick the most common last-letter consonants.

Common final letters in 5-letter words: E (already used), D (already used), T (ruled out), S (ruled out), R (already placed), etc. 

Looking at our remaining list, frequent endings are F, L, M, P, Y.

A word that fits perfectly is:
D E R C Y

Check:
- D(✓) in pos 1
- E(✓) in pos 2
- R(✓) in pos 3
- C(✓) in pos 4
- Y is from the allowed set (not excluded).

""DERCY"" is not a valid English word. Next most common ending consonant is ""L"".

That gives us:
D E R C L

Check dictionary: ""DERCL"" is not valid. Next, ""DERCF"" is invalid. ""DERCM"" invalid.

Actually, let’s look for real words ending in a consonant with the pattern D E R C _.

A real word that matches is ""DERBY"" – but B and Y are allowed and not excluded. However, we know O is out, but Y is still available.

Let’s test: D E R B Y
Wait, we have pattern D E R C _. We can’t change C at position 4.

So we must have D E R C _ and need a valid English word.

Looking it up, the only common one is ""DERCH"" – but that’s uncommon and H is allowed.

Actually, let me re-examine remaining letters.

Valid English word that fits: ""DERCH"" is rare. ""DERCL"" – no.

Wait, are we missing something? Let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with D E R C.

That leaves only ""DERCL"" and ""DERCH"" – neither is standard.

This implies we might have missed earlier that the word has no 5th-letter consonant, or we might have miscounted. But position 5 must be a letter.

Upon reflection, the only valid word I can find fitting D E R C _ is ""DERCH"" (though uncommon), but let me double-check.

Actually, among standard Scrabble words, ""DERCL"" and ""DERCH"" are invalid. This suggests the only possibility is the word must be ""DERBY"", but that would require C to be B, which conflicts with confirmed C in position 4.

Re-examine constraints:

We have:
Positions:
1: D (✓)
2: E (✓)
3: must be R (because R must appear and cannot be in 5)
4: C (✓)
5: ?

Thus the word must be D E R C _ and the blank must be one of the remaining allowed letters, and must form a valid English word. The only valid word matching this pattern is ""DERCH"" – but this is very uncommon. 

However, note in Wordle-like games, uncommon words are sometimes answers. Given constraints, the possible letters left are B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try ""DERCH"" – but since it’s unclear, maybe we missed letter reuse. The word could potentially repeat a letter. If so, another consonant might be used again.

But since C, R, D, E are already used once, and remaining letters are limited, the only valid word appears to be ""DERCH"".

However, realizing this may be too obscure, let’s re-examine: is it possible C is not in position 4? No – from Guess 4, C(✓) in position 4.

Thus, the only remaining valid English word fitting D E R C _ is ""DERCH"".

But this seems unlikely. Let me re-check constraints:

From Guess 4: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) O(x) R(-)

This gives:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: C
- O is NOT in the word
- R is NOT in position 5

We already deduced R must be in position 3.

Thus the word is D E R C _. The only valid English word ending with D E R C _ is ""DERCH"".

Let's consolidate what we know after the five guesses.

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions so far:
1. E – confirmed in position 2 (from guesses 2-5)
2. D – confirmed in position 1 (from guesses 4-5)
3. C – we know it is in the word but not yet fixed to a single slot.  
   Past placements tried: positions 1, 3, 4, 5 have all been marked “-” or “x”, so the ONLY position C has **not** been tried is position 2.  
   But position 2 is already E, so **C must appear only once and it must be in position 4** (because it was marked ✓ there in guess 4).

Therefore:
- Position 1 = D
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = C

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact locations are still open:
- R (never yet been ✓ in any position, but we know it is present)

Letters known **not** to be in the word:
A, N, T, I, K, S, O, H

That leaves these letters still eligible: B, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the letter R which must appear exactly once.

Positions still open: 3 and 5 (since 1,2,4 are fixed).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form:
D E _ C _

and it must contain the letter R exactly once (because R has not yet been placed and must appear).  
The only way to satisfy this is:

- R must go into position 3 (because position 5 is still open, but if R were in 5 we’d have DER C _ and the last letter would have to be a new letter, yet R must appear and hasn’t been placed).  
Wait, no: R could be in 5, or 3.

Let’s check R placement:

Option 1: R in position 3 → word form D E R C _
Option 2: R in position 5 → word form D E _ C R

From past feedback:
- Guess 3: RECKS had R in position 1 (marked –) — so R is **not** in 1
- Guess 2: TERIC had R in position 3 (marked –) — so R is **not** in 3
- Guess 4: DECOR had R in position 5 (marked –) — so R is **not** in 5
- Guess 5: DERCH had R in position 3 again (marked –)

Thus every single position for R has been ruled out:
1,2,3,4,5 — all have been tested and R failed to be placed in any of them.

This appears impossible; we must have made an error.

Let’s re-examine the feedback step by step:

- Guess 4: DECOR → D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) O(x) R(-)  
  Here we see:
  - C in position 4 is ✓ (so C is indeed fixed at 4)
  - R in position 5 is – (so R is NOT in position 5)

- Guess 5: DERCH → D(✓) E(✓) R(-) C(-) H(x)  
  Here we see:
  - R in position 3 is – (so R is NOT in position 3)

Therefore R **cannot** be in positions 1,2,3,5 (positions 1 and 2 are already D and E).  
The only remaining position for R is position 4, but C is already fixed there.

This contradiction tells us we’ve mis-read an earlier feedback.

Let me re-inspect carefully:

Guess 4: DECOR → D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) O(x) R(-)

The feedback symbols are **per letter in the guess**, not positions necessarily.  
Let’s map them explicitly:

Guess 4: D  E  C  O  R
          ✓  ✓  ✓  x  –

Interpretation:
- D is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 1 = D
- E is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 2 = E
- C is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 3 = C (NOT 4!)
- O is **not** in the word
- R is in the word but **not** in position 5

Ah! **C is now fixed at position 3, not 4.**

Revised fixed positions:
1 = D  
2 = E  
3 = C  

Positions still open: 4 and 5.

Letters known in word: D, E, C, R  
Letters known not in word: A, N, T, I, K, S, O, H, plus any that have been ruled out in all positions.

Now we need R to appear once, and it must be in position 4 or 5.

- R cannot be in 5 (Guess 4 feedback shows R(-) in position 5).
Therefore R **must** be in position 4.

So the word form is:
D E C R _

Only position 5 is blank.

Available letters (unused, not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word of the form “DECR_”.

The only common word is “DECRY”.

Check constraints:
- D, E, C, R all placed correctly
- Y is not yet excluded (it has not appeared in any guess, so it is still possible)

Thus the word must be:

<guess>DECRY</guess>

- Guess 5: DERCH → D(✓) E(✓) R(-) C(-) H(x)  
  Here we see:
  - R in position 3 is – (so R is NOT in position 3)

Therefore R **cannot** be in positions 1,2,3,5 (positions 1 and 2 are already D and E).  
The only remaining position for R is position 4, but C is already fixed there.

- D is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 1 = D
- E is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 2 = E
- C is in the word and in the **correct** position → position 3 = C (NOT 4!)
- O is **not** in the word
- R is in the word but **not** in position 5

Ah! **C is now fixed at position 3, not 4.**

Revised fixed positions:
1 = D  
2 = E  
3 = C  

Positions still open: 4 and 5.

Letters known in word: D, E, C, R  
Letters known not in word: A, N, T, I, K, S, O, H, plus any that have been ruled out in all positions.

Now we need R to appear once, and it must be in position 4 or 5.

- R cannot be in 5 (Guess 4 feedback shows R(-) in position 5).
Therefore R **must** be in position 4.

So the word form is:
D E C R _

Only position 5 is blank.

Available letters (unused, not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word of the form “DECR_”.

The only common word is “DECRY”.

Check constraints:
- D, E, C, R all placed correctly
- Y is not yet excluded (it has not appeared in any guess, so it is still possible)

Thus the word must be:

<guess>DECRY</guess>",Guess 6: DECRY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
