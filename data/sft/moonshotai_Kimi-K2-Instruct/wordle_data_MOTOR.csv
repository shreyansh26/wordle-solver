This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The goal here is to maximize the amount of information I can get from this single guess. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, ideally with no repeated letters, to test as many different letters as possible. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular starting word that many use is ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. 

I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better because it includes 'I' which is a common vowel that 'SLATE' doesn't cover, and 'R' and 'S' are also very common. So I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x): A, I, S, E are all NOT in the word at all.

What the feedback tells us so far:

1. From RAISE:  
   - R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - A, I, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. From ROUND:  
   - O is in the word **and** is in position 2.  
   - U, N, D are **not** in the word.

3. From MORPH:  
   - M is in the word **and** is in position 1.  
   - O is still in position 2 (consistent).  
   - R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - P, H are **not** in the word.

Current constraints:

- Positions:  
  – Position 1: M (confirmed).  
  – Position 2: O (confirmed).  
  – Position 3: **NOT** R, and **NOT** any of A, I, S, E, U, N, D, P, H.  
  – Positions 4 and 5: **NOT** any of A, I, S, E, U, N, D, P, H, and R **could** be here.

- R must be in either position 4 or 5.

- Letters that have **not** been eliminated yet:  
  B, C, F, G, J, K, L, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since R cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, the only remaining spots for R are 4 or 5. So the pattern so far is:

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints and tests a couple of new letters. Let’s try “MOBRY”:

- B is a new letter.  
- R fits in position 4 (valid).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal here is to maximize the amount of information I can get from this single guess. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, ideally with no repeated letters, to test as many different letters as possible. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A popular starting word that many use is ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. 

I think ""RAISE"" might be slightly better because it includes 'I' which is a common vowel that 'SLATE' doesn't cover, and 'R' and 'S' are also very common. So I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x): A, I, S, E are all NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has an R somewhere, but not at the start.
- The word does NOT contain A, I, S, or E.
- We still need to test other common letters like O, U, T, N, L, C, etc.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Includes R in a different position (not 1st).
2. Uses other common letters not yet tested (like O, U, T, N, L).
3. Does NOT use A, I, S, E (since they're excluded).

A word like ""ROUND"" could work: it has R in 2nd position and tests O, U, N, D. Or ""TRUNK"" tests T, R, U, N, K. 

I'll go with ""ROUND"" as it uses common letters and positions R in slot 2.

3. The letters A, I, S, E, U, N, D are **not** in the word at all.

We want a word that:
- keeps O in position 2,
- puts R in one of positions 3, 4, or 5,
- uses only letters that have not been excluded,
- and ideally tests a few new common consonants.

M O L K R → not a valid word.  
M O L A R → A excluded.

A valid word that fits is “FOGOR” – but F and G are allowed, O repeats (invalid).  
Next, “MOGULR” – too long.  
Looking at the allowed letters again, a valid word is “MOCKR” – but not valid.  
“MOGUL” – invalid.
