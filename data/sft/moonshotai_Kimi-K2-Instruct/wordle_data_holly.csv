For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The goal is to use common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. According to frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

Good starting words often contain a mix of these common letters without repeating any. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with CRANE because it contains C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters while avoiding duplicates. This should give good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters, so I need to pivot to a word that uses the next-most-frequent letters that have not been ruled out.

The next tier of common letters (that we haven’t used yet) includes:  
T, O, L, I, S, U, D, P, H, G, B, K, M, F, Y, W.

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that uses five unique letters from this remaining pool, ideally covering high-frequency consonants plus a high-frequency vowel.  
A classic choice in this situation is “SLOTH” – it uses S, L, O, T, H, which are all still possible and fairly common.

So I’ll guess:

S L O T H

1. Letters that have been completely ruled out (marked “x”): C, R, A, N, E, S, T, G, U

3. Therefore the secret word has the form [unused letters] + L + O + H in some order using exactly those three plus two more distinct letters from {B,D,F,I,K,M,P,V,W,Y}.

4. Next-guess strategy: pick a valid 5-letter word that
   – uses L, O, H once each  
   – uses two new letters from the still-available set  
   – places L, O, H in positions they have not yet occupied (to avoid the “-” spot again).

5. Candidate words satisfying the above:

   – “PHLOX” – contains X (ruled out)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to use common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. According to frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

Good starting words often contain a mix of these common letters without repeating any. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with CRANE because it contains C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the top 10 most common letters while avoiding duplicates. This should give good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common letters, so I need to pivot to a word that uses the next-most-frequent letters that have not been ruled out.

The next tier of common letters (that we haven’t used yet) includes:  
T, O, L, I, S, U, D, P, H, G, B, K, M, F, Y, W.

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that uses five unique letters from this remaining pool, ideally covering high-frequency consonants plus a high-frequency vowel.  
A classic choice in this situation is “SLOTH” – it uses S, L, O, T, H, which are all still possible and fairly common.

So I’ll guess:

S L O T H

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word but not in the positions guessed: L, O, H (each appeared as “-”, so they’re somewhere else)
- Therefore the secret word must contain L, O, H, and two other letters we haven’t used yet.

Available high-frequency letters we haven’t tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that
  – includes L, O, H exactly once each,
  – does NOT contain any ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, T),
  – places L, O, H in positions different from those in SLOTH (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

Possible candidates: 
- FOUL (missing H)
- HOULD (not a valid word)
- FLOUR (uses R, ruled out)
- GHOUL (uses G, H, O, U, L) → valid word, all letters unused so far, and each of H, O, L appears in a new position.

GHOUL satisfies all constraints: G, H, O, U, L – none of these have been marked “x” yet, and H, O, L appear in new positions compared to SLOTH.

From the latest feedback:

H (✓) O (✓) L (✓) D (x) Y (✓)

So the secret word is of the form:

H O L _ Y

The only letter we don’t yet know is the 4th position.  
Letters already ruled-out by earlier “x” marks include:  
C, R, A, N, E, S, T, G, U, D.

Letters still allowed: B, F, I, K, M, P, V, W.

The valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern H O L _ Y, with the blank allowed only from the remaining letters, is:

HOLLY – but L is repeated (already in position 3) → invalid  
HOLKY – uses K (allowed) → this is a valid English word (“holky” is an old Scots plural of “holk”).  
HOLFY, HOLMY, HOLVY, HOLBY, etc. are either not common English words or do not exist.

Therefore the only plausible candidate is HOLKY, but it’s obscure.

Another common dictionary word: HOLLY is invalid because L repeats.

Recheck: the word must be exactly H-O-L-_-Y with the fourth letter new and unused.  
The only everyday word that fits is “HOLLY,” but it repeats L, so it would have been rejected as a guess.

Among the remaining, “HOLLY” is invalid, and no other common word exists except possibly HOLKY.

However, the puzzle’s dictionary might allow HOLLY despite the double L, but the strict rules say no repeated letters since feedback never indicated duplicates.

Therefore the only remaining choice is:

HOLKY (or none). Since HOLKY is valid in some dictionaries and uniquely fits, let’s go with HOLKY.

But let’s double-check for any other common word: there is none. So it must be HOLKY.

Wait—there is also “HOLLY” which is extremely common, and the feedback does not forbid repeated letters (the feedback system in Wordle allows word duplicates).

So the most probable word is HOLLY.

Let me verify:

HOLLY: H O L L Y.

Feedbacks would be: H(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓).

Since we have no evidence against duplicate letters, HOLLY is the clear choice.
