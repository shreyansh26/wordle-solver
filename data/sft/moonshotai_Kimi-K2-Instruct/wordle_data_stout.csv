- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

As this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy at this stage is to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback (letters in the word or correct positions). Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next guess based on the feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

The best strategy at this stage is to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback (letters in the word or correct positions). Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for the next guess based on the feedback.

3. A(x) – A is not in the word.
4. T(-) – T is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position.
5. E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S _ _ _ _
- Contains T, but T ≠ 4th letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, E.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.
Popular second-guess patterns to test new letters while keeping S and T in play:
– S T _ _ _  (but T can’t be 4th)
– S _ T _ _  
– S _ _ T _  (but T can’t be 4th so avoid 4th spot)
– S _ _ _ T  (T last)

Let’s try a word that keeps S first, puts T somewhere useful, and introduces high-frequency letters R, I, N:

STRIP: S T R I P  
- Checks S in 1st, T in 2nd, R,I,P new letters.  
- T is not 4th, so compliant.

This seems like a good next probe.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ST and uses only the remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters that haven't been tested yet: N, O, U, C, K, M, D, B, H, G.

Looking for common patterns that start with ST and use these letters:

Looking for ST + (N, O, U) + (K, M, D, B, H, G) combinations:

STUNK, STUMD (not a word), STOND (not a word), STOCK, STONK, STOKE, STUNK, STING (but I is out), STUNK (U is allowed), STUNK is valid.

STUNK seems to be a valid word, uses new letters U, N, K.

Another possibility is STUCK (uses C, U).

STOCK uses O, C, K.

Let me go with STUCK since C, U, K are all new and common.

STUCK also has K which is a good consonant to test.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback interpretation:
1. S(✓) – S is the first letter of the secret word.
2. L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
3. A(x) – A is not in the word.
4. T(-) – T is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position.
5. E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S _ _ _ _
- Contains T, but T ≠ 4th letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, E.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.
Popular second-guess patterns to test new letters while keeping S and T in play:
– S T _ _ _  (but T can’t be 4th)
– S _ T _ _  
– S _ _ T _  (but T can’t be 4th so avoid 4th spot)
– S _ _ _ T  (T last)

Let’s try a word that keeps S first, puts T somewhere useful, and introduces high-frequency letters R, I, N:

STRIP: S T R I P  
- Checks S in 1st, T in 2nd, R,I,P new letters.  
- T is not 4th, so compliant.

This seems like a good next probe.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STRIP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) R(x) I(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. S is the first letter (✓ in position 1 twice).
2. T is the second letter (✓ in position 2 in the second guess).
3. The letters L, A, E, R, I, P are NOT in the word at all (all marked x).
4. The word begins with ST _ _ _.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ST and uses only the remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters that haven't been tested yet: N, O, U, C, K, M, D, B, H, G.

Looking for common patterns that start with ST and use these letters:

Looking for ST + (N, O, U) + (K, M, D, B, H, G) combinations:

STUNK, STUMD (not a word), STOND (not a word), STOCK, STONK, STOKE, STUNK, STING (but I is out), STUNK (U is allowed), STUNK is valid.

STUNK seems to be a valid word, uses new letters U, N, K.

Another possibility is STUCK (uses C, U).

STOCK uses O, C, K.

Let me go with STUCK since C, U, K are all new and common.

STUCK also has K which is a good consonant to test.

So, STUCK.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STRIP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) R(x) I(x) P(x)
Guess 3: STUCK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) U(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STUCK:
- S(✓) T(✓) – first two letters are ST.
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in 3rd position.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.

Letters still ruled out: L, A, E, R, I, P, C, K  
Letters confirmed: S, T  
Letters known to be present: U (somewhere after position 2)  

Therefore the word is ST _ _ _ where the last three letters are chosen from the remaining pool and must include U somewhere, but U cannot be 3rd.

Remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: O (U is the only remaining vowel we know must appear)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ST, contains U, and does NOT contain any banned letters.

Possible positions for U: 4th or 5th (since U cannot be 3rd)

Let’s list valid patterns:

ST _ U _  
ST _ _ U  

We still have consonants B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowel O to fill the blanks.

Consider common endings:
STUN_ – but N is allowed.
STU__ – already used U.
ST_ U _ – second letter is T.

Looking for real words:
STUN_ – STUNG, STUNK (K is out), STUNS (S already used), STUNT
ST_ _ U – STODU (invalid), STOLU (invalid), STROU (invalid), STUDIO (too long), etc.

STUNG: uses N and G.
STUNT: uses N and T (T already used in 2nd spot, so T cannot appear again).

STUNG seems valid:
- Starts ST
- Contains U in 4th position (allowed)
- Uses new letters N and G
- No banned letters.

STUNG is a valid word. Let’s try it.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Word is ST _ _ _
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, E, R, I, P, C, K, N, G
- The letter U is present but NOT in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5)
- Allowed letters left for the blank spots: B, D, F, H, J, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for U:
- ST _ U _
- ST _ _ U

We need two more consonants from the allowed list. Looking for common ST… words:
- STUBM (invalid)
- STUDB (invalid)
- STU _ _ combinations with remaining consonants.

Let’s consider STUM_ (but M is allowed) – no valid word.
STU _ B (B allowed) – STUB_ – STUBS (S already used), STUBH (invalid)
STU _ D – STUD_ – STUDS (S already used), STUDY (Y allowed)
STU _ F – STUFF (F allowed)
STU _ H – STU _ _ – STUPH (invalid)
STU _ M – STUMM (invalid)
STU _ O – impossible (O is vowel, already U)
STU _ V – STU _ V – STUPV (invalid)
STU _ Y – STUDY (Y allowed)

STUDY is a valid word:
- Starts ST
- Has U in 4th position (allowed)
- Uses new letters D and Y (both still allowed)
- No banned letters.

Let’s go with STUDY.

We know:
1. The word begins with ST (positions 1-2 confirmed).
2. The letter U is present but not in position 3 (feedback “-” in guesses 3-5), so it must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters already ruled out by “x”: L, A, E, R, I, P, C, K, N, G, D, Y.

Remaining alphabet letters not yet excluded: B, F, H, J, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Starts with ST.
- Contains U either in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters for the other blank.

Possible U positions:
- ST _ U _ : position 3 must be one of {B, F, H, J, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Z} and position 5 must be one of the same set.
- ST _ _ U : positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining letters.

Real English words fitting these patterns are scarce. Let’s scan:

ST _ U _ candidates:
- STFU_ – none valid.
- STMU_ – none.
- STBU_ – none.
- ST _ _ U candidates:
  - STB_U – none.
  - STF_U – none.
  - STM_U – STUM_ doesn’t end in U.
  - STV_U – none.
  - STB_U – none.
  - STJ_U – none.

Eventually, the only remaining common word that fits is “STUPA” (a Buddhist shrine), but A is ruled out.

Next possibility: “STOUP” – O is allowed, P and A are ruled out, but P was ruled out in guess 2.

Wait: P was marked x in guess 2 (“STRIP” feedback P(x)), so P is excluded.

Another candidate: “STOUM” – valid Scots word for a measure of liquor, M allowed.

So “STOUM” fits:
- ST confirmed.
- O in position 3 (allowed, not yet excluded).
- U in position 4 (allowed position).
- M in position 5 (allowed).

All letters used: S, T, O, U, M – none have been ruled out by “x” so far.
