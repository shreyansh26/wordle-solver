For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word should not have repeating letters so that I can test as many different letters as possible. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), but it's not optimal because S is less common than other consonants. ""SLATE"" is another strong option with S, L, A, T, E - covering common letters. However, ""CRANE"" might be even better as it includes C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters in 5-letter words. After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" gives me the best spread of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Includes both S and E (in new positions).
2. Avoids A, R, O.
3. Tests new common letters (like T, N, L, I, etc.).

Good candidates:
- ""steed"" – but E repeats (not ideal for first few guesses).
- ""senti"" – but I is less common, and S is first (might be good to test S elsewhere).
- ""liest"" – but L and I are less common.
- ""tense"" – has T, N, S, E and avoids banned letters. S is now in position 4 again (not optimal since it was in position 4 before).
- ""unset"" – has U, N, S, E, T. S is now in position 4 again (same issue).
- ""lends"" – L, E, N, D, S. S is now in position 5 (E was in position 5 before, so S in 5 is new). This tests L, N, D.

Best option seems ""lends"" – it keeps S and E, moves S to position 5 (new), and introduces L, N, D while avoiding A, R, O.

Summary of what we now know  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, L, N, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S and E  
- Allowed positions for S: can’t be 4 (from arose) or 5 (from lends) → S must be in 1, 2, or 3  
- Allowed positions for E: can’t be 2 (from lends) or 5 (from arose) → E must be in 1, 3, or 4  

We still need to test fresh consonants and a vowel.  
Good untested consonants: T, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K  
Good untested vowels: I, U  

Let’s build a word that:
1. Uses S and E in valid positions (S in 1-3, E in 1,3,4)  
2. Uses only untested letters otherwise  
3. Avoids repeats and banned letters.

Candidate constructions:
- S _ E _ _  → needs two new letters for positions 2 and 5  
- _ S E _ _  → needs two new letters for positions 1 and 5  
- _ _ S E _  → needs two new letters for positions 1 and 2  
- _ _ _ E S  → invalid (S can’t be 5)  
- E _ S _ _  → needs two new letters for positions 2 and 5  

Let’s pick the pattern “_ _ S E _”:
positions 1 and 2 need new consonants, position 5 needs a new letter (consonant or vowel).

Fill with common untested consonants T and C, and a consonant for position 5 that hasn’t been tried: K.

Word: T C S E K → “t c s e k” → “tesck” not valid. Swap C and T: C T S E K → “ctsek” not valid.  
Try simpler consonants: T I S E M → “tisem” not valid.  
How about S _ E _ _ ?  
S T E E _ → repeat E.  
S T E _ _ → need consonant at 4: S T E P _?  
S T E P _ → need consonant at 5: S T E P K → “stepk” not valid.  
Try S P E C K → “speck” – valid, uses S (pos 1 ok), E (pos 3 ok), and fresh letters P, C, K.

Checks:
- letters used: S, P, E, C, K – none banned.
- S is in position 1 (allowed 1-3)  
- E is in position 3 (allowed 1,3,4)  

Therefore, “speck” is a good third guess.
