For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. The strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in the English language to maximize information gain. 

Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A very popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of the most frequent letters in 5-letter words and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let’s synthesize everything we now know.

Confirmed letters & positions:
- 1st letter: T (✓) from THROE and TITLE.
- 5th letter: E (✓) from all guesses.
- 2nd letter: I (✓) from TITLE.

Confirmed letters NOT in the word:
- S, A, H, R, O (from earlier feedback).
- From TITLE we see the 2nd T is marked (-), so there is no second T; the word has only one T (position 1).

Known letters that must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4:
- L (from SLATE’s feedback “L(-)” and TITLE’s feedback “L(-)”).

Therefore the word looks like:
T I _ _ E
and must contain L in either position 3 or 4.

Legal remaining letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate patterns:
- T I L _ E: need a valid 3rd letter; e.g., TILDE (but has D, E already fixed), TILER (R ruled out), TILGE (no), TILKE (no), etc. None of these are common 5-letter words.
- T I _ L E: need a valid 3rd letter; e.g., TIBLE (no), TICLE (no), TIDLE (no), TIGLE (no), TIMLE (no), TINLE (no), TIPLE (no), TISLE (S ruled out), TIVLE (no)… the only common word that fits is “TIGLE” (no) or “TILDE” (but that puts L in 3rd). Actually, the standard word “TIGER” is blocked by R. The simple, common word left is “TILDE” but it puts L in 3rd, which we already know is possible.

The only remaining common word that satisfies:
T I _ L E
with legal letters is:

T I N L E → No, that’s not a word.
T I D L E → Not a word.
T I C L E → …
T I G L E → …
T I M L E → …
T I P L E → …

Actually, let me list all valid English words of the pattern T I _ L E:
- “TIGLE” – not in most dictionaries.
- “TIDLE” – not valid.
- “TINLE” – not valid.
- “TISLE” – invalid (S ruled out).
- “TIVLE” – invalid.

Conversely, pattern T I L _ E:
- T I L D E – “TILDE” is a valid word.

We have confirmation that L must be in the word and cannot be in position 5 (it’s already E). So L must be in position 3 or 4. “TILDE” places L in position 3. Let’s check:
- T ✓ (position 1)
- I ✓ (position 2)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- D new
- E ✓ (position 5)

It introduces D and tests L in position 3. If that doesn’t work, we will know L must be in position 4 and the 3rd letter must be something else.

So the next logical guess is TILDE.
