For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, O, and N.

Looking at common letter frequencies in English, some of the most frequent letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A balanced word would include a mix of vowels and consonants. 

""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in just 5 positions, helping to quickly narrow down possible words.

Feedback recap from AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: correct, but wrong position (-) → actually feedback says R(✓) so R is in correct position (position 2)
- O: not in word (x)
- S: in word but wrong position (-) → actually feedback says S(✓) so S is in correct position (position 4)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) → E is in word but not in last position

Rewriting correctly:
Position 1: A(x) → not A, and not in position 1
Position 2: R(✓) → R is correct here
Position 3: O(x) → not O, and not in position 3
Position 4: S(✓) → S is correct here
Position 5: E(-) → E is somewhere in word but not position 5

So word pattern so far:
- 1st letter: not A, O
- 2nd letter: R
- 3rd letter: not O
- 4th letter: S
- 5th letter: not E

Letters known to be in word: R, S, E (and E not last)
Letters known NOT in word: A, O

Possible word structure: _ R _ S _ where 5th letter ≠ A,O,E

Common 5-letter words with R in 2nd, S in 4th, and E somewhere:
- E R I S T? Wait, E can be in positions 1,3
- T R E S S? No, E is in position 3
- C R E S T? No, E is in position 3
- B R E S T? Not valid
- F R E S H? Not S in 4th
- P R E S S? But E is in 3rd, S in 4th and 5th

- C R I S P? No E
- D R E S S? E in 3rd, but S is in 4th and 5th

Actually let me think differently. Known:
- R is position 2
- S is position 4
- E is somewhere (not 5)
- No A, O

So word is: _ R _ S _ with E in 1 or 3
Possible candidates:

- F R E S H? No, H not 5th
- G R E S T? Not a word
- P R E S T? Not a word

Let me re-interpret the two clues so far correctly.

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Meaning:
- R is in the right place (position 2).
- S is in the right place (position 4).
- E is in the word, but **not** in position 5 (so it must be in 1 or 3).
- A and O are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: C R E S T  
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓)  
Meaning:
- R (position 2) is confirmed again as correct.
- E is **now** in the right place (position 3).
- S (position 4) is confirmed again as correct.
- T is in the right place (position 5).
- C is not in the word.

So the current pattern is:

Position 1: ? (not A, O, C)  
Position 2: R (fixed)  
Position 3: E (fixed)  
Position 4: S (fixed)  
Position 5: T (fixed)

That leaves only the first letter unknown.  We know it can’t be A, O, or C.  It must be any other consonant or vowel except those three (and perhaps others already eliminated).

Candidate first letters (common remaining): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words matching _ R E S T:

- BREST  
- DREST  
- FREST? (not a word)  
- GREST? (not a word)  
- PREST (rare, not common)  
- TREST? (only as TRESTLE)  
- WREST (valid)

Among these, BREST (a common place name) and WREST (a valid English word meaning to forcefully pull) are the most probable.  Between them, BREST is more familiar and more likely to be the intended secret word.

Let’s choose BREST.

<guess>BREST</guess>",BREST,"Let me re-interpret the two clues so far correctly.

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
Meaning:
- R is in the right place (position 2).
- S is in the right place (position 4).
- E is in the word, but **not** in position 5 (so it must be in 1 or 3).
- A and O are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: C R E S T  
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(✓) T(✓)  
Meaning:
- R (position 2) is confirmed again as correct.
- E is **now** in the right place (position 3).
- S (position 4) is confirmed again as correct.
- T is in the right place (position 5).
- C is not in the word.

So the current pattern is:

Position 1: ? (not A, O, C)  
Position 2: R (fixed)  
Position 3: E (fixed)  
Position 4: S (fixed)  
Position 5: T (fixed)

That leaves only the first letter unknown.  We know it can’t be A, O, or C.  It must be any other consonant or vowel except those three (and perhaps others already eliminated).

Candidate first letters (common remaining): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, etc.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,WREST,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, O, and N.

Looking at common letter frequencies in English, some of the most frequent letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A balanced word would include a mix of vowels and consonants. 

""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in just 5 positions, helping to quickly narrow down possible words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap from AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: correct, but wrong position (-) → actually feedback says R(✓) so R is in correct position (position 2)
- O: not in word (x)
- S: in word but wrong position (-) → actually feedback says S(✓) so S is in correct position (position 4)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) → E is in word but not in last position

Rewriting correctly:
Position 1: A(x) → not A, and not in position 1
Position 2: R(✓) → R is correct here
Position 3: O(x) → not O, and not in position 3
Position 4: S(✓) → S is correct here
Position 5: E(-) → E is somewhere in word but not position 5

So word pattern so far:
- 1st letter: not A, O
- 2nd letter: R
- 3rd letter: not O
- 4th letter: S
- 5th letter: not E

Letters known to be in word: R, S, E (and E not last)
Letters known NOT in word: A, O

Possible word structure: _ R _ S _ where 5th letter ≠ A,O,E

Common 5-letter words with R in 2nd, S in 4th, and E somewhere:
- E R I S T? Wait, E can be in positions 1,3
- T R E S S? No, E is in position 3
- C R E S T? No, E is in position 3
- B R E S T? Not valid
- F R E S H? Not S in 4th
- P R E S S? But E is in 3rd, S in 4th and 5th
- T R E S S? E in 3rd, S in 4th and 5th, but S is already known in 4th
- C R I S P? No E
- D R E S S? E in 3rd, but S is in 4th and 5th

Actually let me think differently. Known:
- R is position 2
- S is position 4
- E is somewhere (not 5)
- No A, O

So word is: _ R _ S _ with E in 1 or 3
Possible candidates:
- E R I S E? But S is 4th, E 5th but E can't be 5th
- E R A S E? A is invalid
- E R U S E? U could work
- T R E S S? E 3rd, S 4th and 5th, but we'd have SS at end
- B R E S T? E 3rd, S 4th, T 5th - this seems valid
- C R E S T? E 3rd, S 4th, T 5th - this is valid
- F R E S H? No, H not 5th
- G R E S T? Not a word
- P R E S T? Not a word
- D R E S S? E 3rd, S 4th and 5th

CREST seems most likely - uses C (common), R, E, S, T
Letters used: C (new), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4), T (position 5)
This covers new letters C and T to test, while fitting all constraints.

Wait, let me double-check:
- R is position 2: ✓
- S is position 4: ✓
- E is in word but not position 5: E is in 3rd position ✓
- No A, O: ✓
- 5-letter valid word: ✓
