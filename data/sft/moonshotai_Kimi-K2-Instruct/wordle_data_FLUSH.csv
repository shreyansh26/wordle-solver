For the first guess, I want a word that will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing common letters in strategic positions. A good opening word should have:
1. Common letters (vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English)
2. No repeating letters (to test more unique letters)
3. Good letter placement to test positions

Some excellent starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it tests:
- C (common consonant, good for 1st position)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives us a good spread of common letters in various positions.

All five letters in CRANE are marked “x”, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E appears anywhere in the secret word.  
That rules out a huge set of words containing any of those letters.

To find the secret word in as few guesses as possible, I should now try a word whose letters have not been tested yet.  
Looking at the remaining alphabet, common high-frequency letters that are still available include: S, T, I, L, O, U, D, etc.

A good second-guess word using five fresh, common letters is “SLOTH”.  
It tests:
- S (very common initial consonant)  
- L (common consonant)  
- O (common vowel)  
- T (common consonant)  
- H (common final consonant)

This will give maximal information while avoiding all previously ruled-out letters.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Letters completely ruled out (from CRANE): C, R, A, N, E  
2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions (from SLOTH):  
   - S is somewhere in the word, but **not** in position 1.  
   - L is in the word and **currently in position 2**.  
   - O and T are not in the word at all.  
   - H is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pos 1: not C, R, S  
- Pos 2: L (fixed)  
- Pos 3,4,5: still unknown, but cannot use C, R, A, N, E, O, T  
- Additional letters that must appear somewhere: S, H  
- No duplicates used yet, so duplicates are still possible.

Letters still available: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus S and H to place.

A useful next guess should:
- Confirm the positions of L, S, and H.  
- Use only the still-allowed letters.  
- Try to fill as many unknown slots as possible.

A word that satisfies these constraints and tests several new letters is “FLUSH”.

Check each slot:
1. F – allowed (not in any banned list).  
2. L – fixed evidence says it’s correct here.  
3. U – allowed.  
4. S – allowed (and needs to appear somewhere).  
5. H – allowed (and needs to appear somewhere), and position 5 is okay because H was only ruled out of position 5 in SLOTH, not globally.

Therefore, FLUSH is a valid next guess.
