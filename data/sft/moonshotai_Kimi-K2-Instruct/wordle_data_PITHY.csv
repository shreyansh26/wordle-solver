For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities early on. A good starting word often includes common vowels (like E, A) and consonants (like R, T, N, S). The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it covers:
- C (consonant)
- R (consonant)
- A (vowel)
- N (consonant)
- E (vowel)

This combination helps test multiple high-frequency letters at once, giving useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

All five letters in CRANE were marked “x,” so C, R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates any word containing those letters.

To cast a wide net with fresh letters, I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (no C,R,A,N,E).  
- Includes a good mix of other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, L, M, P, etc.).  

A strong second-guess candidate is “SLOTH”:
- S, L, O, T, H – none of these appeared in the first guess, so they’re all new.  
- The vowel O plus consonants S, L, T, H are all fairly frequent in five-letter English words, giving maximum information on the next turn.

So far we have eliminated:
Letters that are completely OUT of the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O.
Letters that are IN the word but not in their positions: T and H.

Since T and H must appear at least once each, and in different spots than:
- T is NOT in position 4 (it was the 4th letter in SLOTH, but is only “-” meaning wrong position).  
- H is NOT in position 5 (it was the 5th letter in SLOTH, but is only “-”).

A good next guess should:
1. Include both T and H.  
2. Place T somewhere other than position 4.  
3. Place H somewhere other than position 5.  
4. Use only letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O).  

Available consonants left: D, G, B, M, P, F, V, K, Y, etc.  
Available vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out).

One clean candidate: “MIGHT”
- Letters: M, I, G, H, T – none of C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O.  
- T is in position 5 → allowed (we only know it’s not in 4).

Current constraints:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, M, G.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - I is in position 2 (✓).
   - H is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (✓ for existence, - for position).
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (since it was “-” in both previous attempts at those positions).

The confirmed pattern so far:
- Position 2 = I
- H is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5). But position 2 is already I, so H can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- T is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4). But position 2 is I, so T can be in 1 or 4.

We need to test remaining valid letters and positions. Available letters (excluding eliminated ones): B, D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T and H to place.

Since we have I fixed in position 2, let’s construct a word that places T and H in possible remaining positions while using new letters. 

Possible patterns to test:
- Position 1: T or H
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 3: H (if T is in position 1 or 4)
- Position 4: T (if H is in position 1 or 3)
- Position 5: whatever fits

One word that fits: “BITHU”
- B (new letter)
- I (fixed at position 2)
- T (in position 3 - allowed since T not excluded from 3, only 3/5 were disallowed before)
- H (in position 4 - but H was marked as “-” in position 4 before, so this is invalid)

Alternative: “PIVOT” - but O is eliminated.

Better: “WITHY”
- W (new)
- I (fixed at 2)
- T (position 3 - allowed)
- H (position 4 - but H was “-” at 4 before, so invalid)

Another: “DITCH” - C is eliminated.

Correct placement: T must be in 1 or 4, H must be in 1, 3, or 5, and they can’t both be in 1.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: (new letter)
- Position 4: (new letter)
- Position 5: H

Candidate: “TIDYH” - but Y is available, D is available (not eliminated), and this satisfies:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (✓)
- D in 3 (new)
- Y in 4 (new)
- H in 5 (allowed)

This tests H in position 5 and T in position 1.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,PITHY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities early on. A good starting word often includes common vowels (like E, A) and consonants (like R, T, N, S). The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it covers:
- C (consonant)
- R (consonant)
- A (vowel)
- N (consonant)
- E (vowel)

This combination helps test multiple high-frequency letters at once, giving useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE were marked “x,” so C, R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates any word containing those letters.

To cast a wide net with fresh letters, I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses entirely different letters (no C,R,A,N,E).  
- Includes a good mix of other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, L, M, P, etc.).  

A strong second-guess candidate is “SLOTH”:
- S, L, O, T, H – none of these appeared in the first guess, so they’re all new.  
- The vowel O plus consonants S, L, T, H are all fairly frequent in five-letter English words, giving maximum information on the next turn.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have eliminated:
Letters that are completely OUT of the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O.
Letters that are IN the word but not in their positions: T and H.

Since T and H must appear at least once each, and in different spots than:
- T is NOT in position 4 (it was the 4th letter in SLOTH, but is only “-” meaning wrong position).  
- H is NOT in position 5 (it was the 5th letter in SLOTH, but is only “-”).

A good next guess should:
1. Include both T and H.  
2. Place T somewhere other than position 4.  
3. Place H somewhere other than position 5.  
4. Use only letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O).  

Available consonants left: D, G, B, M, P, F, V, K, Y, etc.  
Available vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out).

One clean candidate: “MIGHT”
- Letters: M, I, G, H, T – none of C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O.  
- T is in position 5 → allowed (we only know it’s not in 4).  
- H is in position 4 → allowed (we only know it’s not in 5).  

Let’s use that.

Real word: “HILOT” – but O is already out.  
Real word: “HILTS”? L is already out.  
Real word: “HIKST”? S is out.  
Actually “HIKUT” is not valid.

Turn to pattern _ I H T 5.  
Then position 1 and 5 must be filled with allowed letters, forming a valid English word.

Possible word: “WIGHT” – but G is out.  
“FITCH” – C is out.  
“PITHY” – P and Y are allowed, and “PITHY” is an actual word.

Check P I T H Y:
- Letters: P (allow), I (locked at 2), T (must be in 4), H (must be in 3 or 1), Y (allow).  
  It places H at 3 (allowed), T at 4 (required), and uses P and Y which are still allowed.  
  Every letter is fresh or confirmed.
