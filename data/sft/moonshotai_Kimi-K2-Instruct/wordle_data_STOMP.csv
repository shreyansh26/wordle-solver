For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best opening words in Wordle typically contain:
- Many common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- No repeated letters

Some of the best statistical starting words include CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or ADIEU. I'll go with CRANE because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is a top vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter in English

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were rejected, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I need a completely fresh set of letters.  
A good second-word strategy is to use the next-most-common letters that were not in the first guess.  
Those include: S, L, U, I, O, T, D, G, M, P, B, etc.

I’ll pick a word that uses five new, high-frequency letters:  
- S (very common)  
- L (common)

From the feedback so far we know:

1. Positions:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: T
   - Position 3: O
   - Position 4: M
   - Position 5: P

2. Letters in the word: S, T, O, M, P (all placed correctly except O, but the feedback for STUMP shows P is in position 5 ✓, so O must be in position 3 as well ✓)

So the only possible word that fits these exact placements is STOMP.
