Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes our chances of hitting some correct letters or at least eliminating common ones.

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C
- Good starter words often use a mix of vowels and common consonants.

Some good options would be:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes both vowels and consonants.

Confirmed letters with positions:  
- E at position 2  
- O at position 4  

Confirmed letters without positions:  
- M  
- N  

Letters that are NOT excluded yet: B, C, D, E (position 2), F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O (position 4), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word where:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = O
- It must contain both M and N somewhere (each exactly once, since they were marked yellow)
- No A, R, S, L

So the pattern is: _ E _ O _ , and it must contain M and N in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5).

Possible placements:
- M and N can go in positions 1 & 3, 1 & 5, or 3 & 5.

Possible combinations:
1. M E N O ?
   - Then N is in position 3, but that would leave M at position 1 and N already used. Then we need a 5th letter but we've already placed E, O, M, N. So we'd need a word like MENON, which isn't valid.
2. M E ? O N
   - Then ? must be another letter, but we still need to place N at position 5 and M at position 1. The missing letter at position 3 must be a new letter (since M and N are already placed). So word would be M E _ O N where _ is a new letter. But we know the word must contain M and N, and here M is at 1 and N is at 5, satisfying that. So we just need to choose a valid letter for position 3.
3. ? E M O N
   - Then ? is position 1, M is at 3, N at 5. This uses M and N correctly.

Looking at valid English words:

From option 3: _ E M O N → the only common word is ""DEMON"" (D, E, M, O, N)
Check if D is allowed - it wasn't excluded.

From option 2: M E _ O N → looking for words like M E T O N (invalid), M E C O N (invalid), etc. - no common words fit.

Thus ""DEMON"" is the only strong candidate that fits all constraints.

Letters excluded so far: A, R, S, L  
Confirmed letters with positions:  
- E at position 2  
- O at position 4  

Confirmed letters without positions:  
- M  
- N  

Letters that are NOT excluded yet: B, C, D, E (position 2), F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O (position 4), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word where:
- Position 2 = E
- Position 4 = O
- It must contain both M and N somewhere (each exactly once, since they were marked yellow)
- No A, R, S, L

So the pattern is: _ E _ O _ , and it must contain M and N in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5).

Possible placements:
- M and N can go in positions 1 & 3, 1 & 5, or 3 & 5.

Possible combinations:
1. M E N O ?
   - Then N is in position 3, but that would leave M at position 1 and N already used. Then we need a 5th letter but we've already placed E, O, M, N. So we'd need a word like MENON, which isn't valid.
2. M E ? O N
   - Then ? must be another letter, but we still need to place N at position 5 and M at position 1. The missing letter at position 3 must be a new letter (since M and N are already placed). So word would be M E _ O N where _ is a new letter. But we know the word must contain M and N, and here M is at 1 and N is at 5, satisfying that. So we just need to choose a valid letter for position 3.
3. ? E M O N
   - Then ? is position 1, M is at 3, N at 5. This uses M and N correctly.

Looking at valid English words:

From option 3: _ E M O N → the only common word is ""DEMON"" (D, E, M, O, N)
Check if D is allowed - it wasn't excluded.

From option 2: M E _ O N → looking for words like M E T O N (invalid), M E C O N (invalid), etc. - no common words fit.

Thus ""DEMON"" is the only strong candidate that fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after all three guesses.

Excluded letters (from any “x” feedback):
A, R, S, L, D

Confirmed letters with positions:
E at position 2
O at position 4

Confirmed letters with wrong positions (yellow):
- M must appear somewhere but NOT at position 3
- N must appear somewhere but NOT at position 5

So the pattern is:
? E ? O ?

and the word must additionally contain BOTH M and N exactly once each, placed in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5) with the constraints above.

Available positions for M: 1 or 5  (cannot be 3 because it was yellow at 3)
Available positions for N: 1 or 3  (cannot be 5 because it was yellow at 5)

We need to place M and N in those slots without overlapping.

Case 1: M at 1 and N at 3
   Word form: M E N O ?  
   The last letter (position 5) must be new and not yet excluded.  
   Candidate: MENOI – invalid (not a word)

Case 2: M at 5 and N at 1
   Word form: N E ? O M  
   Position 3 must be a new letter, not excluded and not already used.  
   Candidate: N E T O M – invalid word  
   Candidate: N E X O M – invalid  
   Candidate: N E W O M – invalid  

Case 3: M at 1 and N at 3 (same as case 1) already didn’t yield a word.

Case 4: M at 5 and N at 3
   Word form: ? E N O M  
   Position 1 must be a new letter.  
   Candidate: B E N O M – invalid  
   Candidate: C E N O M – invalid  
   Candidate: F E N O M – invalid  
   Candidate: G E N O M – invalid
