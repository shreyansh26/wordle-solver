For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Is statistically likely to reveal multiple letters

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage across different types of letters.

None of the five letters in ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate all of them.  
That means we need a 5-letter word that contains none of these letters.

Next most common letters that remain:  
- Consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, H  
- Vowels: I, O, U  

A good second-guess candidate should use several highly-frequent unused letters.  
Looking at the remaining frequent letters: R, I, N, C, O, U, P, M, etc.

A strong combination is C, R, O, U, D, N, I, M, P. One good balanced word is ""ROUND"" (R, O, U, N, D), which uses four new high-frequency letters plus one medium-frequency letter and gives a vowel/consonant mix.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, N, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word, but in the wrong positions: O and U.

So the secret word contains the vowels O and U somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3. Available positions are 1, 4, 5 for O and U.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out:
Consonants: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(We already eliminated S, L, T, R, N, D.)

Vowels: I, Y (since we’ve only used A, E, O, U so far).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and U exactly once each.
- Does NOT use any letters in {S, L, A, T, E, R, N, D}.
- Possibly includes other remaining common consonants.

One high-frequency remaining consonant is M, so let’s try to build a word containing M along with O and U.

Candidate words that fit:
- MOPIC (but C is in position 4, and we have no information yet if C exists)
- MUCID (but D is excluded)
- CHOMP (but P is in position 5, and we don’t know if P is in the word)

Another approach: use a word like ""MOUTH"" but H is untested and we know O and U must be rearranged. ""MOUTH"" uses O in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so let’s avoid that.

Let’s try ""CHUMP"" – but P is untested and not sure.

Let’s try ""COUGH"": 
- C, O, U, G, H – all letters are untested except O and U which are confirmed to exist.
- O is in position 2 (but we know from ROUND that O isn’t position 2), so COUGH is invalid.

Next: ""PLUMB"" – but P and B are untested.

Let’s try ""FUNKY"" – but N is excluded.

Let’s try ""GUMBO"":
- G, U, M, B, O – all letters are untested except O and U (confirmed present).
- O is position 5, U is position 2 (position 2 is allowed for U since previous feedback only ruled out position 2 for O).
- GUMBO is valid.

But let me check if GUMBO uses any excluded letters: G, U, M, B, O – none are in {S, L, A, T, E, R, N, D}. Good.

Another possible word: ""HUMID"" – but D is excluded.

Another: ""JUMBO"" – J is low frequency but allowed. O is position 5, U is position 2.

Let me pick ""GUMBO"" as it uses common remaining consonants G and M and vowels O and U in positions not yet ruled out.

Careful check:
- O must not be position 2 (from ROUND). In GUMBO, O is position 5 – allowed.

But let me check if GUMBO uses any excluded letters: G, U, M, B, O – none are in {S, L, A, T, E, R, N, D}. Good.

Another possible word: ""HUMID"" – but D is excluded.

Another: ""JUMBO"" – J is low frequency but allowed. O is position 5, U is position 2.

Let me pick ""GUMBO"" as it uses common remaining consonants G and M and vowels O and U in positions not yet ruled out.

Careful check:
- O must not be position 2 (from ROUND). In GUMBO, O is position 5 – allowed.
- U must not be position 3 (from ROUND). In GUMBO, U is position 2 – allowed.

Current facts:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, N, D, M
- Letters confirmed in the word (but not their positions): O, U, B, G  
- Each of O, U, B, G must appear exactly once, so the secret word uses exactly these four letters plus one more letter not yet tried.

We now know:
- O is present but NOT at position 5 (from GUMBO feedback: O(-) means “in the word but wrong spot”, and in GUMBO it was at position 5).
- U is present but NOT at position 2 (from GUMBO feedback: U(-) means “in the word but wrong spot”, and in GUMBO it was at position 2).
- B is present but NOT at position 4.
- G is present but NOT at position 1.

Remaining positions (1-5) and allowed placements:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not 5).
- U can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).
- B can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4).
- G can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not 1).

We still need one more distinct letter that has never been used. Alphabet letters not yet used:
C, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From these, let’s pick a common consonant that has not appeared: C or H are good choices.

We want a word that uses O, U, B, G plus one of these new letters, and respects the placement restrictions above.

Try to place the new letter first; let’s choose H. We need a 5-letter arrangement of O, U, B, G, H that is a valid English word and satisfies the constraints.

Let’s list possible permutations:

- HOBUG
- HUGBO
- BUGHO
- BOUGH  (common word: “bough”)

Check BOUGH:
Letters: B, O, U, G, H – all constraints met, each appears once.
Position check:
- B at 1: allowed (B can’t be 4)
- O at 2: allowed (O can’t be 5)
- U at 3: allowed (U can’t be 2)
- G at 4: allowed (G can’t be 1)
- H at 5: allowed

BOUGH is a valid English word.
