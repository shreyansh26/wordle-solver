- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to guide us. The optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and frequently used consonants as possible. This maximizes the information we gain from the feedback.

Good starting words often include:
- A combination of common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z for the first guess

One of the most statistically effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

However, another strong contender is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five most common vowels (though only 4 unique ones) and the common consonant S. But since we can only use 5 letters, ""AROSE"" is actually a great choice as it covers A, O, S, E, R.

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess as it covers:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in 5-letter words

1. O is in the word but NOT at position 3.
2. Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Newly eliminated letters: P, I, N, T  
Still available common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on the more common ones).

We need a five-letter word that:
- Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (i.e., avoid A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T).

Good remaining vowels: O (must be placed), U (only untested vowel left).  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

Possible patterns:  
O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that places O in position 2 and introduces new common consonants and U.  
Candidate: “CLOUD” – but D is allowed and C, L, U are untested.  

However, let’s check letters in CLOUD:
- C – not yet tested
- L – not yet tested
- O – in word but now at position 2
- U – untested vowel
- D – not yet tested

This seems valid and tests new letters efficiently.

Another quick check: All letters in CLOUD are from the allowed set (C, L, O, U, D) and none are in the eliminated list. O is in position 2, satisfying the feedback.

So, CLOUD is a strong next guess.
