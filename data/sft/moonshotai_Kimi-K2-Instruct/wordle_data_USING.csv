For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word. I want to maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like E, A, or O)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, or L)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Popular choices among Wordle players include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This will give me information on 5 unique common letters right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

That means:
- The word contains S but not in position 4 (the last letter).
- We must avoid A, R, O, E entirely.

Since the word must still be 5 letters and we need to probe new consonants and vowels, I’ll pick common letters we haven’t tested yet (like T, I, N, L, U, D, etc.) while keeping S in a new position.

A balanced next guess:
- Include S in a different position (say position 2).
- Use new high-frequency letters: T, I, N, L, U, etc.
- Avoid the eliminated letters A, R, O, E.

A good candidate is ""STUDY"":

From the second guess STUDY we now know:

- S is still marked (-) – it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- T, D, Y are NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

So far we have three confirmed letters:
- S – present, possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- U – present, possible positions: 1, 2, 4, 5
And we must exclude: A, R, O, E, T, D, Y

We need a word with:

- No forbidden letters
- S not in 1 or 4; U not in 3

Let me think of 5-letter words that satisfy:
– Start with U or have U in 2, 4, 5
– Have S in 2, 3 or 5
– Use only remaining common letters

For example: S-I-N-U-S keeps S in 3 and U in 4, but N and I are untested.
Another word: S-L-I-N-G uses S in 1 (forbidden), so skip.
Another: S-P-U-N-K has S in 1 (forbidden).
Another: L-U-S-H (too short).
Another: S-U-N-N-Y has Y (forbidden).
Another: S-I-N-G-S has two S’s but S in 1 and 5 (1 is bad).
Another: S-W-I-S-H – W and I are new, S in 1 (bad).

Current confirmed facts:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, D, Y, M, C  

Letters that **are** in the word, but their exact positions are still unknown:  
S, U, I  

From the three guesses we also have positional constraints:

1. S  
   - not in position 1 (from STUDY and MUSIC)  
   - not in position 4 (from AROSE)  
   - not in position 3 (from MUSIC)  
   ⇒ S must be in position 2 or 5  

2. U  
   - not in position 2 (from STUDY)  
   - not in position 3 (from STUDY)  
   - not in position 2 (from MUSIC) – redundant  
   ⇒ U must be in position 1, 4, or 5  

3. I  
   - not in position 4 (from MUSIC)  
   ⇒ I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2,3,5 could clash with other letters)

Allowed alphabet so far:  
S, U, I, plus any letters not yet tried (N, L, G, H, K, P, B, F, V, W, X, Z, etc.).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- uses **S, U, I**  
- **no** letters from the forbidden list  
- satisfies the positional rules

Candidate words that come to mind:
- **USING** (U1, S2, I3, N4, G5) – fits all rules  
  – S in position 2 (allowed)  
  – U in position 1 (allowed)  
  – I in position 3 (allowed)  
  – N and G are fresh letters

No conflicts, so USING is a solid next guess.
