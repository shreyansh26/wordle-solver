For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the possible letters in the secret word. A strong starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Some popular first guesses include words like CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU. I'm going to choose CRANE because:
- C is a common consonant
- R appears in many words
- A is a very common vowel
- N is also common
- E is the most frequently used vowel in English

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the first guess CRANE, the feedback tells us:

- C(-) — C is in the word but NOT in the first position.
- R(x) — R is NOT in the word at all.
- A(x) — A is NOT in the word at all.
- N(x) — N is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) — E is in the word but NOT in the fifth position.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude entirely: R, A, N.
- Letters that are in the word and must appear somewhere: C and E.
- Positions to exclude for C (1) and E (5).

We need a word that:
1. Contains C and E.
2. Does NOT contain R, A, N.
3. C is not in position 1.
4. E is not in position 5.

Good letters to consider for filling the remaining spots (since R, A, N, and possibly others are out): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible second-guess words might be:
- BICEP (but P isn’t super common)
- SPICE (contains S, P, I, C, E) — but E is in 5, which we know is bad.
- CEDAR — contains A (excluded) and R (excluded), so no.
- DECKS — contains E and C, and avoids R, A, N. C is in 3, E in 2. Could be good.

Let me think of another: DECOY — contains C and E, avoids R, A, N. C is in 2, E in 1. Seems solid.

Another: SCENE — but N is excluded, so no.
Another: CHECK — double C and K, but C is in 1 (excluded), so no.

Let’s go with DECOY. It has:
- D (new)
- E (must be in word, and in 1st here, which is okay)
- C (must be in word, in 2nd, which is okay)
- O (new)
- Y (new)

Excludes R, A, N. Good spread.

Alternatively, MEDIC — has C and E, avoids R, A, N. C is in 4, E in 2. Also good.

Between DECOY and MEDIC, MEDIC is more centrally placed for C and E. Let’s go with MEDIC.
