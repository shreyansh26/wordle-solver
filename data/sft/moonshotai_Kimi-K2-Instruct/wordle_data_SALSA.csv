For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps identify which letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. 

Some of the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any, to cover as many possibilities as quickly as possible.

A solid choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This word is likely to provide good feedback on which of these common letters are in the secret word and where they might be positioned.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 1).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in S and does not contain R, O, or E.  
We know A must appear somewhere other than the first letter.  
We need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A (not in position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.

We now look for a 5-letter word that fits these constraints.  
Possible letters to use: A, plus common consonants like N, T, L, D, etc. (avoiding R, O, E).

A good next guess is ""NAILS"":
- Ends with S (matches S in position 5).
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- Uses N, I, L which are common and haven’t been ruled out.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(✓), E(x)
   - S is in the word and must be in position 5.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.

2. NAILS → N(x), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(-)
   - A is now correctly placed at position 2.
   - L is in the word but NOT at position 4.
   - S was marked “-” at position 5.  
     This is inconsistent with the first result (S was ✓ at 5 before), so “-” must here mean “right letter, wrong position”.  
     However, position 5 is already the only possible spot for S, so the only way “-” can apply to S is if the checker used “-” as “correct letter, wrong spot” even when no other spot exists.  
     More likely, it’s simply indicating S is in the word (already known).  
     We’ll ignore this minor inconsistency and continue trusting the first result: S is in position 5.

3. BALMS → B(x), A(✓), L(✓), M(x), S(-)
   - A is locked at position 2.
   - L is now locked at position 3.
   - S is still in position 5.
   - Letters ruled out so far: B, R, O, E, N, I, M.

So the pattern is: _ A L _ S  
Letters still allowed appear to be any that haven’t been excluded yet (not B, R, O, E, N, I, M).

Possible remaining consonants that fit: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 1 and 4 we need consonants that haven’t been ruled out, forming valid English words.

Looking at the pattern _ A L _ S, reasonable possibilities include:
- C A L V S → “CALVS” (rare plural)
- D A L K S → “DALKS” (not a word)
- C A L K S → “CALKS” (valid, means to seal with calk)

- C A L L S → “CALLS” (double L already in word)
- C A L K S is the most common valid word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “CALKS”.

It fits:
- C (allowed)
- A (position 2, ✓)
- L (position 3, ✓)
- K (allowed)
- S (position 5, ✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This helps identify which letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. 

Some of the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any, to cover as many possibilities as quickly as possible.

A solid choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This word is likely to provide good feedback on which of these common letters are in the secret word and where they might be positioned.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 1).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in S and does not contain R, O, or E.  
We know A must appear somewhere other than the first letter.  
We need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A (not in position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.

We now look for a 5-letter word that fits these constraints.  
Possible letters to use: A, plus common consonants like N, T, L, D, etc. (avoiding R, O, E).

A good next guess is ""NAILS"":
- Ends with S (matches S in position 5).
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- Uses N, I, L which are common and haven’t been ruled out.

- Letters R, O, E, N, I are not in the word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 4 (from NAILS feedback).

So the pattern is:  
_ A _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: A (fixed at position 2), L (somewhere), S (fixed at position 5).  
Letters known not to be in the word: R, O, E, N, I.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need to pick a word with:
- A at position 2
- S at position 5
- L somewhere (not position 4)
- No R, O, E, N, I

A good candidate is ""BALMS"":
- B (valid consonant)
- A (position 2)
- L (position 3)
- M (valid consonant)
- S (position 5)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with S (✓)
- A at position 2 (✓)

Possible remaining consonants that fit: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 1 and 4 we need consonants that haven’t been ruled out, forming valid English words.

Looking at the pattern _ A L _ S, reasonable possibilities include:

- T A L K S → “TALKS” (but K already used in CALKS)
- C A L L S → “CALLS” (double L already in word)
- C A L K S is the most common valid word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “CALKS”.

- The pattern is: _ A L _ S.

Remaining consonants NOT yet excluded for positions 1 and 4:
D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need an English word of the form ? A L ? S.

Obvious candidates:
- D A L L S → double L already placed once at 3, but “DALL S” is not a word.
- F A L L S → same double-L issue plus the extra L.
- G A L L S → same.
- H A L L S → same.

- P A L M S → M is ruled out.
- P A L P S → not a word.
- F A L D S → not a word.
- V A L V S → not a word.
- G A L L S → already considered.

The only common word left that matches _ A L _ S without using any excluded letters is “FALDS,” but it is archaic or plural of “fald,” and not standard.

A slightly more common but still obscure word is “VALDS” (Scandinavian surname) or “TALCS” but C is out.

Another possibility is “PALPS” but P is usable and the word exists. Let me check:
P A L P S – yes, it is an English plural (palps are insect mouthparts).

However, P is still allowed and we have no feedback against P.

Remaining consonants NOT yet excluded for positions 1 and 4:

Another possibility is “PALPS” but P is usable and the word exists. Let me check:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SALSA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps identify which letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. 

Some of the most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any, to cover as many possibilities as quickly as possible.

A solid choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This word is likely to provide good feedback on which of these common letters are in the secret word and where they might be positioned.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 1).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word ends in S and does not contain R, O, or E.  
We know A must appear somewhere other than the first letter.  
We need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A (not in position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.

We now look for a 5-letter word that fits these constraints.  
Possible letters to use: A, plus common consonants like N, T, L, D, etc. (avoiding R, O, E).

A good next guess is ""NAILS"":
- Ends with S (matches S in position 5).
- Contains A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, E.
- Uses N, I, L which are common and haven’t been ruled out.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: NAILS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Word ends in S (✓ position 5).
- Letter A is in the word in the correct place (✓ position 2, since in NAILS A was in position 2 and got ✓).
- Letters R, O, E, N, I are not in the word.
- Letter L is in the word but not in position 4 (from NAILS feedback).

So the pattern is:  
_ A _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: A (fixed at position 2), L (somewhere), S (fixed at position 5).  
Letters known not to be in the word: R, O, E, N, I.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need to pick a word with:
- A at position 2
- S at position 5
- L somewhere (not position 4)
- No R, O, E, N, I

A good candidate is ""BALMS"":
- B (valid consonant)
- A (position 2)
- L (position 3)
- M (valid consonant)
- S (position 5)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with S (✓)
- A at position 2 (✓)
- L is in the word at position 3 (valid, since L can't be at 4)
- No R, O, E, N, I.

Guess 3: BALMS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) L(✓) M(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(✓), E(x)
   - S is in the word and must be in position 5.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.

2. NAILS → N(x), A(✓), I(x), L(-), S(-)
   - A is now correctly placed at position 2.
   - L is in the word but NOT at position 4.
   - S was marked “-” at position 5.  
     This is inconsistent with the first result (S was ✓ at 5 before), so “-” must here mean “right letter, wrong position”.  
     However, position 5 is already the only possible spot for S, so the only way “-” can apply to S is if the checker used “-” as “correct letter, wrong spot” even when no other spot exists.  
     More likely, it’s simply indicating S is in the word (already known).  
     We’ll ignore this minor inconsistency and continue trusting the first result: S is in position 5.

3. BALMS → B(x), A(✓), L(✓), M(x), S(-)
   - A is locked at position 2.
   - L is now locked at position 3.
   - S is still in position 5.
   - Letters ruled out so far: B, R, O, E, N, I, M.

So the pattern is: _ A L _ S  
Letters still allowed appear to be any that haven’t been excluded yet (not B, R, O, E, N, I, M).

Possible remaining consonants that fit: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 1 and 4 we need consonants that haven’t been ruled out, forming valid English words.

Looking at the pattern _ A L _ S, reasonable possibilities include:
- C A L V S → “CALVS” (rare plural)
- D A L K S → “DALKS” (not a word)
- C A L K S → “CALKS” (valid, means to seal with calk)
- F A L K S → “FALKS” (proper noun)
- G A L L S → “GALLS” (but L already in word)
- H A L L S → “HALLS” (but L already in word)
- T A L K S → “TALKS” (but K already used in CALKS)
- C A L L S → “CALLS” (double L already in word)
- C A L K S is the most common valid word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “CALKS”.

It fits:
- C (allowed)
- A (position 2, ✓)
- L (position 3, ✓)
- K (allowed)
- S (position 5, ✓)
- Uses no excluded letters.

The only common word left that matches _ A L _ S without using any excluded letters is “FALDS,” but it is archaic or plural of “fald,” and not standard.

A slightly more common but still obscure word is “VALDS” (Scandinavian surname) or “TALCS” but C is out.

Another possibility is “PALPS” but P is usable and the word exists. Let me check:

Consider again carefully.\n\nAnother English word: “PALSY” ends in Y not S. \n\nRe-examine: “DALTS” not a word.\n\nEventually, the only common word left fitting pattern without excluded letters is “FALDS” (folds in Scots plural). \n\nBut “FALDS” uses letter F and D, neither of which have been ruled out.\n\nSince we must guess a valid English word, “FALDS” appears to be the least obscure remaining option.\n\nHowever, checking again: “PALMS” uses M (excluded). \n\nAnother common word: “VALES” (E excluded).\n\nWait—there’s “WALKS” but K is excluded.\n\nAfter exhaustive scan, the only valid English word left matching _ A L _ S without any excluded letters is:\n\n“FALDS” (archaic plural of fold).\n\nBut let me double-check. Actually, the word “FALDS” is accepted in dictionaries as a plural of “fald” (a fold in cloth). \n\nTherefore, we’ll proceed with it.We now know the pattern is _ A L _ S and the letters B, C, K, M, R, O, E, N, I are excluded.  \nThe only remaining English word that fits is:\n\n<guess>FALDS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: NAILS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: BALMS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) L(✓) M(x) S(-)\nGuess 4: CALKS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) L(✓) K(x) S(-)\nGuess 5: FALDS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) L(✓) D(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
All feedback so far:
- Position 5 is S (✓ in every guess).
- Position 2 is A (✓ in every guess since NAILS).
- Position 3 is L (✓ in every guess since BALMS).
- Letters ruled out so far: B, C, D, F, K, M, R, O, E, N, I.

The pattern is fixed: _ A L _ S  
We still need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4 that are NOT in the banned list.

Remaining available consonants: G, H, J, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
