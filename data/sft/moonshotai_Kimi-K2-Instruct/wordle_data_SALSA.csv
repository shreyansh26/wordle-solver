For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a common 5-letter English word
2. Contains some of the most frequently used letters in English (like vowels and common consonants) to maximize information gain
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get feedback on as many unique letters as possible

Some good starter words include: ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, RAISE, STARE, etc. These cover common letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, I, S, E) that appear frequently in English words.

Let’s summarize everything we know so far.

1. From Guess 1 (ARISE):
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (LOANS):
   - L is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3 (already knew it’s not in 1).
   - O is NOT in the word.
   - N is NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 5.  
     Wait: this conflicts with Guess 1 where S was marked ✓ in position 5.  
     That’s impossible—if S was already confirmed in position 5, it can’t simultaneously be “in the word but in the wrong position” in the same spot.  
     Therefore, the feedback must mean that S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) in Guess 1, but in Guess 2 the fifth letter S is being marked with the symbol that indicates “correct letter, wrong position.” The only way that makes sense is if the feedback symbols were intended to be interpreted differently in the two turns, but that’s not possible.  

     Re-reading the rules: the symbols are:
       ✓ : correct letter, correct position  
       - : correct letter, wrong position  
       x : letter not in word  

     In Guess 2, the feedback is “LOANS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) N(x) S(-)”.

     That implies:
       S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 5.  
     That directly contradicts Guess 1 where S was ✓ in position 5.

     This must be an error in the feedback provided. According to the rules, once a letter is confirmed at a position (✓), that position is fixed. S cannot simultaneously be “correct in position 5” and “wrong in position 5.”

     Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must be mis-typed. The only logical correction is that the final S should have been ✓ again, indicating it is still correct in position 5.

     Assuming that:
       S is ✓ in position 5 (from Guess 1), and the Guess 2 feedback for S should also be ✓, not (-).

     Under that correction, the actual new information from Guess 2 is:
       L is in the word but not in position 1.
       A is in the word but not in position 3.
       O is NOT in the word.
       N is NOT in the word.
       S is fixed in position 5.

     Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): A, L, S, plus any untested common letters (D, T, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.).

     Current known constraints:
       - Word ends in S.
       - Contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1, not 3 this turn so far).
       - Contains L somewhere (not 1, not 5).
       - No R, I, E, O, N.
       - Other untested letters: T, D, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.

     Possible patterns:
       _ A L _ S
       _ L A _ S
       A _ _ _ S – but A cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1).
       _ _ A _ S

                A is in position 2 (allowed), L in 3, S in 5.  
                K is untested – possible.

       GALAS – repeats A in 2 and 4, but duplicate letters are allowed unless ruled out.

                B, A, L, D, S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Is a common 5-letter English word
2. Contains some of the most frequently used letters in English (like vowels and common consonants) to maximize information gain
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get feedback on as many unique letters as possible

Some good starter words include: ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, RAISE, STARE, etc. These cover common letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, I, S, E) that appear frequently in English words.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains the letter A, but A is not in position 1.
- Letters R, I, E are NOT in the word.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S fixed at the last position.
2. Incorporate A in a different position (positions 2-4).
3. Use new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. and possibly other vowels like O, U).

Possible candidates (ending in S, with A somewhere else):
- TASPS – but TASPS isn’t common.
- NASTY – ends in Y, not S.
- TALES – E already ruled out.
- STAND – ends in D, not S.
- LOANS – ends in S, fits constraints.

LOANS:
- Ends in S ✓
- Contains A in position 3 (not position 1) ✓
- Uses new letters L, O, N.

Let’s try LOANS.

<guess>LOANS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LOANS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize everything we know so far.

1. From Guess 1 (ARISE):
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (LOANS):
   - L is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3 (already knew it’s not in 1).
   - O is NOT in the word.
   - N is NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 5.  
     Wait: this conflicts with Guess 1 where S was marked ✓ in position 5.  
     That’s impossible—if S was already confirmed in position 5, it can’t simultaneously be “in the word but in the wrong position” in the same spot.  
     Therefore, the feedback must mean that S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) in Guess 1, but in Guess 2 the fifth letter S is being marked with the symbol that indicates “correct letter, wrong position.” The only way that makes sense is if the feedback symbols were intended to be interpreted differently in the two turns, but that’s not possible.  

     Re-reading the rules: the symbols are:
       ✓ : correct letter, correct position  
       - : correct letter, wrong position  
       x : letter not in word  

     In Guess 2, the feedback is “LOANS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) N(x) S(-)”.

     That implies:
       S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 5.  
     That directly contradicts Guess 1 where S was ✓ in position 5.

     This must be an error in the feedback provided. According to the rules, once a letter is confirmed at a position (✓), that position is fixed. S cannot simultaneously be “correct in position 5” and “wrong in position 5.”

     Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must be mis-typed. The only logical correction is that the final S should have been ✓ again, indicating it is still correct in position 5.

     Assuming that:
       S is ✓ in position 5 (from Guess 1), and the Guess 2 feedback for S should also be ✓, not (-).

     Under that correction, the actual new information from Guess 2 is:
       L is in the word but not in position 1.
       A is in the word but not in position 3.
       O is NOT in the word.
       N is NOT in the word.
       S is fixed in position 5.

     Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): A, L, S, plus any untested common letters (D, T, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.).

     Current known constraints:
       - Word ends in S.
       - Contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1, not 3 this turn so far).
       - Contains L somewhere (not 1, not 5).
       - No R, I, E, O, N.
       - Other untested letters: T, D, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.

     Possible patterns:
       _ A L _ S
       _ L A _ S
       A _ _ _ S – but A cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1).
       _ _ A _ S
       _ _ _ A S

     Let’s list some candidate words that fit:
       TALKS – no K allowed? K not ruled out. Let’s check letters: T, A, L, K, S.  
                Ruled out letters: none of these are R, I, E, O, N.  
                A is in position 2 (allowed), L in 3, S in 5.  
                K is untested – possible.

       CALMS – C, A, L, M, S.  
                All letters untested or allowed.  
                A in 2, L in 3, S in 5.  
                Looks good.

       GALAS – repeats A in 2 and 4, but duplicate letters are allowed unless ruled out.  
                However, we don’t have evidence for a second A.

       VALES – E is ruled out.

       BALDS – D is untested.  
                B, A, L, D, S.  
                All letters allowed.

     Among these, CALMS seems strong: C, A, L, M, S are all allowable letters, and it fits the fixed S in position 5, A not in 1 or 3 (A is in 2), L somewhere (3), and no banned letters.

     Let’s try CALMS.

Reconstruct everything we now know.

1. From Guess 1 (ARISE)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - S is in the word and in position 5.  
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (LOANS) – note the feedback symbols must be interpreted consistently  
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - O, N are NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5, which contradicts the earlier ✓.  
     The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbol for S in Guess 2 was a typo and should have been ✓.  
     So: S is fixed in position 5.

3. From Guess 3 (CALMS)  
   - C is NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word and in position 2 (✓).  
   - L is in the word and in position 3 (✓).  
   - M is NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5 again, but we already know S is ✓ in position 5.  
     Ignore the conflicting symbol; treat it as ✓.

Current picture:
Word looks like: _ A L _ S  
Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: A and L.  
Position 5 is fixed: S.  
Letters still unknown: position 1 and 4.

Letters already ruled out: R, I, E, O, N, C, M  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A, L, S are already used.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A L _ S.

Candidate words:
- BALKS – K is allowed, S already fixed.  
- BALES – E is ruled out.  
- DALKS – invalid word.  
- DALES – E ruled out.  
- FALES – E ruled out.  
- GALAS – second A possible, but we have no evidence of repeated letters and the pattern requires position 4 to be a new letter.  
- HALFS – F is allowed. HALFS is a valid plural.  
- PALMS – M ruled out.  
- TALKS – K allowed; TALKS is valid.  
- VALES – E ruled out.  
- WALES – E ruled out.

The two strongest candidates are TALKS and HALFS.

TALKS is a very common word and uses the common consonants T and K, both still allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains the letter A, but A is not in position 1.
- Letters R, I, E are NOT in the word.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S fixed at the last position.
2. Incorporate A in a different position (positions 2-4).
3. Use new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. and possibly other vowels like O, U).

Possible candidates (ending in S, with A somewhere else):
- TASPS – but TASPS isn’t common.
- NASTY – ends in Y, not S.

   - S is in the word, but not in position 5.  
     Wait: this conflicts with Guess 1 where S was marked ✓ in position 5.  
     That’s impossible—if S was already confirmed in position 5, it can’t simultaneously be “in the word but in the wrong position” in the same spot.  
     Therefore, the feedback must mean that S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) in Guess 1, but in Guess 2 the fifth letter S is being marked with the symbol that indicates “correct letter, wrong position.” The only way that makes sense is if the feedback symbols were intended to be interpreted differently in the two turns, but that’s not possible.  

     Re-reading the rules: the symbols are:
       ✓ : correct letter, correct position  
       - : correct letter, wrong position  
       x : letter not in word  

     In Guess 2, the feedback is “LOANS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) N(x) S(-)”.

     That implies:
       S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 5.  
     That directly contradicts Guess 1 where S was ✓ in position 5.

     This must be an error in the feedback provided. According to the rules, once a letter is confirmed at a position (✓), that position is fixed. S cannot simultaneously be “correct in position 5” and “wrong in position 5.”

     Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must be mis-typed. The only logical correction is that the final S should have been ✓ again, indicating it is still correct in position 5.

     Assuming that:
       S is ✓ in position 5 (from Guess 1), and the Guess 2 feedback for S should also be ✓, not (-).

     Under that correction, the actual new information from Guess 2 is:
       L is in the word but not in position 1.
       A is in the word but not in position 3.
       O is NOT in the word.
       N is NOT in the word.
       S is fixed in position 5.

     Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): A, L, S, plus any untested common letters (D, T, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.).

     Current known constraints:
       - Word ends in S.
       - Contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1, not 3 this turn so far).
       - Contains L somewhere (not 1, not 5).
       - No R, I, E, O, N.
       - Other untested letters: T, D, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.

     Possible patterns:
       _ A L _ S
       _ L A _ S
       A _ _ _ S – but A cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1).
       _ _ A _ S
       _ _ _ A S

     Let’s list some candidate words that fit:
       TALKS – no K allowed? K not ruled out. Let’s check letters: T, A, L, K, S.  
                Ruled out letters: none of these are R, I, E, O, N.  
                A is in position 2 (allowed), L in 3, S in 5.  
                K is untested – possible.

       CALMS – C, A, L, M, S.  
                All letters untested or allowed.  
                A in 2, L in 3, S in 5.  
                Looks good.

       GALAS – repeats A in 2 and 4, but duplicate letters are allowed unless ruled out.  
                However, we don’t have evidence for a second A.

       VALES – E is ruled out.

       BALDS – D is untested.  
                B, A, L, D, S.  
                All letters allowed.

     Among these, CALMS seems strong: C, A, L, M, S are all allowable letters, and it fits the fixed S in position 5, A not in 1 or 3 (A is in 2), L somewhere (3), and no banned letters.

     Let’s try CALMS.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Reconstruct everything we now know.

1. From Guess 1 (ARISE)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - S is in the word and in position 5.  
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (LOANS) – note the feedback symbols must be interpreted consistently  
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - O, N are NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5, which contradicts the earlier ✓.  
     The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbol for S in Guess 2 was a typo and should have been ✓.  
     So: S is fixed in position 5.

3. From Guess 3 (CALMS)  
   - C is NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word and in position 2 (✓).  
   - L is in the word and in position 3 (✓).  
   - M is NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5 again, but we already know S is ✓ in position 5.  
     Ignore the conflicting symbol; treat it as ✓.

Current picture:
Word looks like: _ A L _ S  
Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: A and L.  
Position 5 is fixed: S.  
Letters still unknown: position 1 and 4.

Letters already ruled out: R, I, E, O, N, C, M  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A, L, S are already used.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A L _ S.

Candidate words:
- BALKS – K is allowed, S already fixed.  
- BALES – E is ruled out.  
- DALKS – invalid word.  
- DALES – E ruled out.  
- FALES – E ruled out.  
- GALAS – second A possible, but we have no evidence of repeated letters and the pattern requires position 4 to be a new letter.  
- HALFS – F is allowed. HALFS is a valid plural.  
- PALMS – M ruled out.  
- TALKS – K allowed; TALKS is valid.  
- VALES – E ruled out.  
- WALES – E ruled out.

The two strongest candidates are TALKS and HALFS.

TALKS is a very common word and uses the common consonants T and K, both still allowed.

Let’s guess TALKS.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get feedback on as many unique letters as possible

Some good starter words include: ADIEU, AUDIO, ARISE, RAISE, STARE, etc. These cover common letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, I, S, E) that appear frequently in English words.

- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- I(x): I is not in the word at all.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains the letter A, but A is not in position 1.
- Letters R, I, E are NOT in the word.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S fixed at the last position.
2. Incorporate A in a different position (positions 2-4).
3. Use new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. and possibly other vowels like O, U).

Possible candidates (ending in S, with A somewhere else):
- TASPS – but TASPS isn’t common.
- NASTY – ends in Y, not S.
- TALES – E already ruled out.
- STAND – ends in D, not S.
- LOANS – ends in S, fits constraints.

LOANS:

     That’s impossible—if S was already confirmed in position 5, it can’t simultaneously be “in the word but in the wrong position” in the same spot.  
     Therefore, the feedback must mean that S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) in Guess 1, but in Guess 2 the fifth letter S is being marked with the symbol that indicates “correct letter, wrong position.” The only way that makes sense is if the feedback symbols were intended to be interpreted differently in the two turns, but that’s not possible.

       ✓ : correct letter, correct position  
       - : correct letter, wrong position  
       x : letter not in word  

     In Guess 2, the feedback is “LOANS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) N(x) S(-)”.

     That implies:
       S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 5.  
     That directly contradicts Guess 1 where S was ✓ in position 5.

     This must be an error in the feedback provided. According to the rules, once a letter is confirmed at a position (✓), that position is fixed. S cannot simultaneously be “correct in position 5” and “wrong in position 5.”

     Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must be mis-typed. The only logical correction is that the final S should have been ✓ again, indicating it is still correct in position 5.

     Assuming that:
       S is ✓ in position 5 (from Guess 1), and the Guess 2 feedback for S should also be ✓, not (-).

     Under that correction, the actual new information from Guess 2 is:
       L is in the word but not in position 1.
       A is in the word but not in position 3.
       O is NOT in the word.
       N is NOT in the word.
       S is fixed in position 5.

     Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): A, L, S, plus any untested common letters (D, T, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.).

     Current known constraints:
       - Word ends in S.
       - Contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not 1, not 3 this turn so far).
       - Contains L somewhere (not 1, not 5).
       - No R, I, E, O, N.
       - Other untested letters: T, D, C, G, B, F, U, Y, etc.

     Possible patterns:
       _ A L _ S
       _ L A _ S
       A _ _ _ S – but A cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1).
       _ _ A _ S
       _ _ _ A S

     Let’s list some candidate words that fit:
       TALKS – no K allowed? K not ruled out. Let’s check letters: T, A, L, K, S.  
                Ruled out letters: none of these are R, I, E, O, N.  
                A is in position 2 (allowed), L in 3, S in 5.  
                K is untested – possible.

       CALMS – C, A, L, M, S.  
                All letters untested or allowed.  
                A in 2, L in 3, S in 5.  
                Looks good.

       GALAS – repeats A in 2 and 4, but duplicate letters are allowed unless ruled out.  
                However, we don’t have evidence for a second A.

       VALES – E is ruled out.

       BALDS – D is untested.  
                B, A, L, D, S.  
                All letters allowed.

     Among these, CALMS seems strong: C, A, L, M, S are all allowable letters, and it fits the fixed S in position 5, A not in 1 or 3 (A is in 2), L somewhere (3), and no banned letters.

     Let’s try CALMS.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Reconstruct everything we now know.

1. From Guess 1 (ARISE)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - S is in the word and in position 5.  
   - R, I, E are NOT in the word.

2. From Guess 2 (LOANS) – note the feedback symbols must be interpreted consistently  
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - O, N are NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5, which contradicts the earlier ✓.  
     The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbol for S in Guess 2 was a typo and should have been ✓.  
     So: S is fixed in position 5.

3. From Guess 3 (CALMS)  
   - C is NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word and in position 2 (✓).  
   - L is in the word and in position 3 (✓).  
   - M is NOT in the word.  
   - S gave “-” in position 5 again, but we already know S is ✓ in position 5.  
     Ignore the conflicting symbol; treat it as ✓.

Current picture:
Word looks like: _ A L _ S  
Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: A and L.  
Position 5 is fixed: S.  
Letters still unknown: position 1 and 4.

Letters already ruled out: R, I, E, O, N, C, M  
Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A, L, S are already used.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A L _ S.

Candidate words:
- BALKS – K is allowed, S already fixed.  
- BALES – E is ruled out.  
- DALKS – invalid word.  
- DALES – E ruled out.  
- FALES – E ruled out.  
- GALAS – second A possible, but we have no evidence of repeated letters and the pattern requires position 4 to be a new letter.  
- HALFS – F is allowed. HALFS is a valid plural.  
- PALMS – M ruled out.  
- TALKS – K allowed; TALKS is valid.  
- VALES – E ruled out.  
- WALES – E ruled out.

The two strongest candidates are TALKS and HALFS.

TALKS is a very common word and uses the common consonants T and K, both still allowed.

Let’s guess TALKS.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Positions already locked in:
   - Position 2: A (✓ from CALMS and TALKS)
   - Position 3: L (✓ from CALMS and TALKS)
   - Position 5: S (✓ from ARISE)

   So the word looks like: _ A L _ S

2. Letters that cannot appear anywhere:
   R, I, E, O, N, C, M, T, K

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:
   B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

4. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? A L ? S.

Candidate words:
- BALDS - contains D and B
- BALFS - not a recognized word
- BALKS - K is ruled out
- BALMS - M is ruled out
- DALES - E is ruled out
- FALES - E is ruled out
- HALFS - valid word
- PALES - E is ruled out
- VALES - E is ruled out
- WALKS - K is ruled out

The only valid common word left that fits is HALFS.

Let's verify:
- HALFS: H A L F S
- H and F have not been tested yet and are allowed
- Fits the pattern _ A L _ S
- All other constraints are satisfied

Therefore, HALFS is the next logical guess.
