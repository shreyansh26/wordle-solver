For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in English words are vowels (especially E, A, O) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L, etc. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains frequently used letters while avoiding repeats. Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is a common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter in English

This covers 5 distinct letters that appear often in 5-letter words, giving good initial information.

From the feedback on CRANE, we know:

- C is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- A is correct in position 3.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the current pattern is: C R A N _

Only the last letter remains unknown, and it cannot be E. Since we already have four known letters, the final letter must form a valid English word starting with CRAN_.

Common letters that fit after ""CRAN"":

- CRANK – valid word meaning a handle or to irritate someone.
- CRANE – but E is ruled out.
- CRANG – not a valid word.
- CRANT – uncommon, but ""CRANT"" isn't a recognized word.

The most obvious and valid 5-letter word completing CRAN_ is ""CRANK"".

Let's try CRANK.
