This is my first guess in Wordle, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal first word should contain common letters to maximize information gain. Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good first word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters (to test more letters)
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Some excellent starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, RAINE, ROAST, etc. 

After considering these, I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-). So the word contains an E, but it’s not the last letter.

So far we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, L, A, T
- The word must have at least one E, but not in position 5.

Let’s form a new guess keeping these constraints:
- Include E somewhere other than position 5.
- Exclude S, L, A, T.
- Try to include other common letters not yet tested: R, O, I, N, C, D, U, P, M, B, etc.

A balanced word with E in a different spot: “ROBIN”
Checks:
- R, O, B, I, N — none of these letters were in the first guess (so none are S, L, A, T).
- E is not used here, but we know E is in the word. So we need to include E.
Oops, that’s no good — “ROBIN” doesn’t contain E.

Let’s try “MEDIC”:
- Letters: M, E, D, I, C — none are S, L, A, T.
- E is in position 2, satisfying the E not in position 5.
- Uses new common letters: M, E, D, I, C.

This seems like a strong next guess to test new letters and incorporate the known E.
