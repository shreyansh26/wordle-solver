moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,CANOE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I'll start with a word that contains commonly used letters to maximize information gain. I'll choose a word with a good distribution of vowels and common consonants. A classic strong starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- C is in the word and in position 1.  
- E is in the word and in position 5.  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- N is in the word but not in position 4.  
- R is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: C _ _ _ E with A and N appearing somewhere in the middle three positions (but A not in spot 3 and N not in spot 4).

Good next-step letters to test are common consonants not yet used (S, T, L, M, etc.) and see where A or N fit.

Let me try “CLEAN”:
- Keeps C and E locked in place.
- Places A in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in position 3), so A needs to move.
- Places N in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so N needs to move.

Next try “CANOE”:
- C ✓  
- A could be in position 2 ✓  
- N in position 3 ✓ (allowed)  
- O is new test letter  
- E ✓  

This satisfies all constraints so far.
