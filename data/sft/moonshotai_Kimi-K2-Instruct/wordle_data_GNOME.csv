For the first guess, we want a word that can provide maximum information—ideally one with common letters in different positions to quickly narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English 5-letter words include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters, avoiding repeats to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E—all highly common letters. Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it covers vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) without repeats.

So, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R (x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O (✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd spot).
- S (x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E (✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th spot).

So far we know:
- Third letter = O
- Fifth letter = E
- Letters A, R, S are ruled out.

Good consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good vowels still allowed: I, U (since A is out and O, E are already placed)

A strong next-guess should:
1. Keep the known O in position 3 and E in position 5.
2. Introduce new common letters that are still possible.
3. Avoid any ruled-out letters (A, R, S).

A few candidate structures: _ _ O _ E  
Common starters: B, C, D, H, L, M, N, P, T  
Common middles: I, U, N, L, T, etc.

One high-value word that fits is “POINT” (P-O-I-N-T), but it has an S ruled out… wait, S is ruled out, so that’s bad.  
Next: “CLOVE” but E is already at the end.  
Try “BLONE” – but N and E are fine, B and L are still allowed.  
Actually, “CLONE” is valid: C, L, O, N, E → O and E are in the correct spots, no forbidden letters.  
Another check: “MOTEL” – but R is ruled out and T is fine, but we need to keep O and E fixed… actually “MOTEL” would be M-O-T-E-L, which has E in 4th, not 5th – conflict.

So the simplest valid word respecting the fixed positions is: C _ O _ E → “CLOVE” (C-L-O-V-E). No forbidden letters, and it tests new letters C, L, V.

But “CLONE” is also valid (C-L-O-N-E) and N is very common. Between “CLONE” and “CLOVE,” “CLONE” tests the more frequent N.

Therefore, I’ll go with CLONE.

We now have:

Known positions:
- 3rd letter = O
- 5th letter = E

Known letters:
- C (x) – not in the word
- L (x) – not in the word
- N (-) – in the word but not in slot 4
- O and E already placed

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ E  
Letters ruled out: A, R, S, C, L  
Letters still allowed (including the one that needs to fit somewhere): N must appear somewhere other than slot 4.

Remaining consonants (common): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y)

Since N is required but cannot be in slot 4, the only remaining positions are 1, 2, or 3 – but 3 is already O, so N must be in slot 1 or 2.

Good candidates:
- N _ O _ E  
- _ N O _ E

Let’s list 5-letter words matching _ _ O _ E with N in 1 or 2, avoiding forbidden letters A,R,S,C,L:

N _ O _ E:
- N O O _ E – no, repeats O
- N I O _ E – no standard word
- N U O _ E – nothing

_ N O _ E:
- B N O _ E – no word
- D N O _ E – no word
- F N O _ E – no word
- T N O _ E – no word
- H N O _ E – no word
- P N O _ E – no word
- M N O _ E – no word

Wait, we can reverse the order: N in 1 or 2 still leaves:

N _ O _ E:
- N D O _ E – “N D O” unlikely
- N T O _ E – nothing
- N F O _ E – nothing

_ N O _ E:
- B N O _ E – nothing
- P N O _ E – nothing

Let’s step back and look for all common _ _ O _ E words avoiding A,R,S,C,L and then check if they contain N elsewhere:

Some common _ _ O _ E words:
- CHOKE – has C (out)  
- GLOVE – has L (out)  
- BROKE – has R (out)  
- STONE – has S (out)  
- PROVE – has R (out)  
- BLOKE – has L (out)  
- DOWSE – S (out)  
- HOMER – R (out)  
- MOTEL – E not at end  
- VOILE – I allowed, but is it common?  
- VOGUE – U in slot 2, but pattern _ O _ _ E doesn’t fit

Wait, we need N somewhere. Let’s list _ _ O _ E words that include N but not in slot 4:

Examples:
- ANODE – A out  
- ENVOY – pattern wrong  
- FOUND – pattern wrong, but F, O, U, N, D – let me check: F O U N D – doesn’t match _ _ O _ E.  
- HONEY – pattern H O N E Y – wrong pattern  
- JONES – S out  
- MONEY – M O N E Y – pattern M _ O N E? no, must be _ _ O _ E. M O N E Y ends in Y, not E.  
- CONEY – C out  
- PWNED – slang, not ideal  

Let’s try a more systematic approach: all 5-letter words ending O _ E with letters not in {A,R,S,C,L} and containing N somewhere.

We have the fixed skeleton: ? ? O ? E (positions 1,2,3,4,5)  
Constraints:
- letters 1,2,4 cannot be A,R,S,C,L  
- N must appear once in the word (and not in position 4) → so N must be in 1,2 (since 3 is O, 5 is E)

Thus possible positions for N: 1 or 2.

Let’s try N in 1: N ? O ? E  
Fourth letter cannot be A,R,S,C,L,N,O,E (since O and E are already fixed in their spots) and must be consonant.

So fourth letter options: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,T,V,W,Y,Z

Need a valid word of form N ? O ? E

Common examples:
- N O O ? E – none  
- N I O ? E – none  
- N U O ? E – none  
- N D O ? E – none  
- N T O ? E – none  

Try N in 2: ? N O ? E

First letter options: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,Y,Z (not A,R,S,C,L)

Fourth letter options: same list minus any used letters.

Need common word ? N O ? E:

- B N O ? E – “B N O” unlikely  
- D N O ? E – none  
- F N O ? E – none  
- G N O ? E – none  
- H N O ? E – none  
- M N O ? E – none  
- P N O ? E – none  
- T N O ? E – none  
- V N O ? E – none  
- W N O ? E – none  
- Y N O ? E – none  

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe we’re missing a word. Let me think of real words:

- “PHONE” – P H O N E  
   P H O N E → pattern P H O N E → matches _ _ O _ E and has N in 4 – but feedback said N cannot be in 4 → so PHONE is invalid.  
- “WHONE” – not a word  
- “GNOME” – G N O M E → G N O M E → pattern _ N O _ E → but E is at 5, M at 4: G N O M E → this fits! G (ok), N (must be in word), O (fixed), M (ok), E (fixed). All letters allowed: G,N,O,M,E – none of A,R,S,C,L. Also N is in position 2, which is allowed.  

So GNOME seems a valid next guess.

Let me double-check:
- G (ok)
- N (must be in word, and is in position 2 – allowed)
- O (correct position 3)
- M (ok)
- E (correct position 5)
- No forbidden letters (A,R,S,C,L) appear.

This seems perfect.

- C (x) – not in the word
- L (x) – not in the word
- N (-) – in the word but not in slot 4
- O and E already placed

So far the pattern is: _ _ O _ E  
Letters ruled out: A, R, S, C, L  
Letters still allowed (including the one that needs to fit somewhere): N must appear somewhere other than slot 4.

Remaining consonants (common): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y)

Since N is required but cannot be in slot 4, the only remaining positions are 1, 2, or 3 – but 3 is already O, so N must be in slot 1 or 2.

Good candidates:
- N _ O _ E  
- _ N O _ E

Let’s list 5-letter words matching _ _ O _ E with N in 1 or 2, avoiding forbidden letters A,R,S,C,L:

N _ O _ E:
- N O O _ E – no, repeats O
- N I O _ E – no standard word
- N U O _ E – nothing

_ N O _ E:
- B N O _ E – no word
- D N O _ E – no word
- F N O _ E – no word
- T N O _ E – no word
- H N O _ E – no word
- P N O _ E – no word
- M N O _ E – no word

Wait, we can reverse the order: N in 1 or 2 still leaves:

N _ O _ E:
- N D O _ E – “N D O” unlikely
- N T O _ E – nothing
- N F O _ E – nothing

_ N O _ E:
- B N O _ E – nothing
- P N O _ E – nothing

Let’s step back and look for all common _ _ O _ E words avoiding A,R,S,C,L and then check if they contain N elsewhere:

Some common _ _ O _ E words:
- CHOKE – has C (out)  
- GLOVE – has L (out)  
- BROKE – has R (out)  
- STONE – has S (out)  
- PROVE – has R (out)  
- BLOKE – has L (out)  
- DOWSE – S (out)  
- HOMER – R (out)  
- MOTEL – E not at end  
- VOILE – I allowed, but is it common?  
- VOGUE – U in slot 2, but pattern _ O _ _ E doesn’t fit

Wait, we need N somewhere. Let’s list _ _ O _ E words that include N but not in slot 4:

Examples:
- ANODE – A out  
- ENVOY – pattern wrong  
- FOUND – pattern wrong, but F, O, U, N, D – let me check: F O U N D – doesn’t match _ _ O _ E.  
- HONEY – pattern H O N E Y – wrong pattern  
- JONES – S out  
- MONEY – M O N E Y – pattern M _ O N E? no, must be _ _ O _ E. M O N E Y ends in Y, not E.  
- CONEY – C out  
- PWNED – slang, not ideal  

Let’s try a more systematic approach: all 5-letter words ending O _ E with letters not in {A,R,S,C,L} and containing N somewhere.

We have the fixed skeleton: ? ? O ? E (positions 1,2,3,4,5)  
Constraints:
- letters 1,2,4 cannot be A,R,S,C,L  
- N must appear once in the word (and not in position 4) → so N must be in 1,2 (since 3 is O, 5 is E)

Thus possible positions for N: 1 or 2.

Let’s try N in 1: N ? O ? E  
Fourth letter cannot be A,R,S,C,L,N,O,E (since O and E are already fixed in their spots) and must be consonant.

So fourth letter options: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,T,V,W,Y,Z

Need a valid word of form N ? O ? E

Common examples:
- N O O ? E – none  
- N I O ? E – none  
- N U O ? E – none  
- N D O ? E – none  
- N T O ? E – none  

Try N in 2: ? N O ? E

First letter options: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,N,P,Q,T,V,W,Y,Z (not A,R,S,C,L)

Fourth letter options: same list minus any used letters.

Need common word ? N O ? E:

- B N O ? E – “B N O” unlikely  
- D N O ? E – none  
- F N O ? E – none  
- G N O ? E – none  
- H N O ? E – none  
- M N O ? E – none  
- P N O ? E – none  
- T N O ? E – none  
- V N O ? E – none  
- W N O ? E – none  
- Y N O ? E – none  

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe we’re missing a word. Let me think of real words:

- “PHONE” – P H O N E  
   P H O N E → pattern P H O N E → matches _ _ O _ E and has N in 4 – but feedback said N cannot be in 4 → so PHONE is invalid.  
- “WHONE” – not a word  
- “GNOME” – G N O M E → G N O M E → pattern _ N O _ E → but E is at 5, M at 4: G N O M E → this fits! G (ok), N (must be in word), O (fixed), M (ok), E (fixed). All letters allowed: G,N,O,M,E – none of A,R,S,C,L. Also N is in position 2, which is allowed.  

So GNOME seems a valid next guess.

Let me double-check:
- G (ok)
- N (must be in word, and is in position 2 – allowed)
- O (correct position 3)
- M (ok)
- E (correct position 5)
- No forbidden letters (A,R,S,C,L) appear.

This seems perfect.

<guess>GNOME</guess>",Guess 3: GNOME -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) N(✓) O(✓) M(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
