- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English. This helps us gather information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Some common letters in English 5-letter words are: A, E, T, R, O, I, N, S, L, C.

A good starting word would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to identify potential letters in the secret word.

We now have two useful pieces of feedback.

From Guess 2 (SHEET):
- S is in the correct position (position 1).
- H, E, E are in the word and correctly placed (positions 2, 3, 4).
- T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern so far: S H E E _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T
- Remaining letters available: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a fifth letter that:
1. Is not A, R, O, T (already excluded).
2. Hasn’t been ruled out in any previous positions.
3. Forms a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""SHEE"".

Likely candidates for the fifth letter: D (SHEED), K (SHEEK), N (SHEEN), P (SHEEP), R (SHEER), S (SHEES), but R is already excluded, S would repeat S, and D/K/N/P are left.

Among these, ""SHEEN"" and ""SHEEP"" are common. ""SHEEP"" seems slightly more familiar, but both are valid. Let's try ""SHEEN"" first.
