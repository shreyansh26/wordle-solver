For my first guess, I want to maximize the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English, particularly vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). This way, I can quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me the best chance at identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

That means the secret word has:
- S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- E somewhere other than the 5th position.
- No A, R, or O.

Next, I want to find the exact positions of S and E while testing new, common consonants. A good approach is to place S and E in fresh spots and bring in new letters like T, I, N, L, etc. A balanced word that does this is ""STEIN"":
- S moves to position 1.

Current confirmed facts:
- Letters in the word and their correct positions: S _ _ _ _ (S in 1st), E _ _ _ _ (E in 2nd), _ _ _ _ N (N in 5th).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I.
- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, U, Y, H, K, M, P, etc.

Pattern so far: S E _ _ N

The 3rd and 4th positions are open. We need two distinct letters that have not been ruled out yet. Good candidates for these slots are common consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared. The remaining common vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Common consonants left include C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Testing common combinations:
- ""SEDAN"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""SEVEN"" – V is less common, E is already used in 2nd spot.
- ""SELDN"" – Not a valid word.
- ""SENSE"" – E is already in 2nd spot, N is already in 5th spot (invalid repetition and overlapping).
- ""SEDGE"" – G is possible, but E is already in 2nd spot.

A valid and common word is ""SECOND"":
- But it’s 6 letters, so invalid.

Valid 5-letter options:
- ""SEDUM"" (plant) – U and D are new.
- ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- ""SEWIN"" – I is ruled out.
- ""SEMIN"" – M and I. I is ruled out.
- ""SEPYN"" – P and Y. All letters new and valid.

""SEPYN"" is a valid word (archaic variant of ""seep"" + past participle), but quite obscure. A more common word is ""SEDAN"", but A is ruled out.

Wait, let me think of better options:
- ""SEDGY"" – G and Y, but Y is less common.
- ""SEDUM"" is obscure but valid.

Actually, ""SEDUM"" is the best valid option with new letters D and U.

However, a more common word is ""SELDN"" which is invalid. Let me think differently: ""SEMIN"" has I (invalid). ""SEPSI"" – I invalid. ""SEPSN"" – invalid.

Rechecking, ""SEDUM"" is the only valid 5-letter word fitting S E _ _ N with unused letters.

But if we consider ""SEDUM"" obscure, perhaps ""SEPSY"" (also obscure). Better to go with ""SEDUM"" as it’s at least a recognized plant name.

However, looking again, ""SEMIN"" is invalid due to I. ""SEDGE"" has G and D, and E is already in 2nd spot (but G is new). But ""SEDGE"" has E in 5th which conflicts with N in 5th.

Oops, my pattern is S E _ _ N, so the last letter is N. Thus, the word must be S E _ _ N. Therefore, the missing letters are 3rd and 4th positions.

Let me list possible pairs for 3rd and 4th:
- S E _ _ N

Unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common combinations:
- S E C _ N – ""SECTION"" too long. ""SECON"" – not a word.
- S E D _ N – ""SEDAN"" has A (invalid). ""SEDEN"" – invalid.
- S E L _ N – ""SELEN"" (prefix), but obscure. ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- S E M _ N – ""SEMEN"" – valid word. But E is already in 2nd spot, and E cannot be repeated unless allowed (Wordle allows repeats).

""SEMEN"" is valid:
- S E M E N
- E appears twice: once in 2nd (confirmed) and once in 4th. This is allowed.

This tests M and the repeated E in 4th spot.

Thus, ""SEMEN"" is a good next guess.

But wait, E is already in 2nd spot (confirmed), and we have S E _ _ N. The 4th spot could be E again. So ""SEMEN"" fits: S(1), E(2), M(3), E(4), N(5).

This tests:
- M in 3rd spot.
- E in 4th spot (already in 2nd spot, so E is used twice).

This is plausible.

Current constraints:
- Word starts with S, has E in second position, ends with N: _S E _ _ N_
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, T, I
- Thus, possible letters for 3rd and 4th positions from remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The 3rd and 4th positions are open. We need two distinct letters that have not been ruled out yet. Good candidates for these slots are common consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared. The remaining common vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Common consonants left include C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Testing common combinations:
- ""SEDAN"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""SEVEN"" – V is less common, E is already used in 2nd spot.
- ""SELDN"" – Not a valid word.
- ""SENSE"" – E is already in 2nd spot, N is already in 5th spot (invalid repetition and overlapping).
- ""SEDGE"" – G is possible, but E is already in 2nd spot.

A valid and common word is ""SECOND"":
- But it’s 6 letters, so invalid.

Valid 5-letter options:
- ""SEDUM"" (plant) – U and D are new.
- ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- ""SEWIN"" – I is ruled out.
- ""SEMIN"" – M and I. I is ruled out.
- ""SEPYN"" – P and Y. All letters new and valid.

""SEPYN"" is a valid word (archaic variant of ""seep"" + past participle), but quite obscure. A more common word is ""SEDAN"", but A is ruled out.

Wait, let me think of better options:
- ""SEDGY"" – G and Y, but Y is less common.
- ""SEDUM"" is obscure but valid.

Actually, ""SEDUM"" is the best valid option with new letters D and U.

However, a more common word is ""SELDN"" which is invalid. Let me think differently: ""SEMIN"" has I (invalid). ""SEPSI"" – I invalid. ""SEPSN"" – invalid.

Rechecking, ""SEDUM"" is the only valid 5-letter word fitting S E _ _ N with unused letters.

But if we consider ""SEDUM"" obscure, perhaps ""SEPSY"" (also obscure). Better to go with ""SEDUM"" as it’s at least a recognized plant name.

However, looking again, ""SEMIN"" is invalid due to I. ""SEDGE"" has G and D, and E is already in 2nd spot (but G is new). But ""SEDGE"" has E in 5th which conflicts with N in 5th.

Oops, my pattern is S E _ _ N, so the last letter is N. Thus, the word must be S E _ _ N. Therefore, the missing letters are 3rd and 4th positions.

Let me list possible pairs for 3rd and 4th:
- S E _ _ N

Unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common combinations:
- S E C _ N – ""SECTION"" too long. ""SECON"" – not a word.
- S E D _ N – ""SEDAN"" has A (invalid). ""SEDEN"" – invalid.
- S E L _ N – ""SELEN"" (prefix), but obscure. ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- S E M _ N – ""SEMEN"" – valid word. But E is already in 2nd spot, and E cannot be repeated unless allowed (Wordle allows repeats).

""SEMEN"" is valid:
- S E M E N
- E appears twice: once in 2nd (confirmed) and once in 4th. This is allowed.

This tests M and the repeated E in 4th spot.

Thus, ""SEMEN"" is a good next guess.

But wait, E is already in 2nd spot (confirmed), and we have S E _ _ N. The 4th spot could be E again. So ""SEMEN"" fits: S(1), E(2), M(3), E(4), N(5).

This tests:
- M in 3rd spot.
- E in 4th spot (already in 2nd spot, so E is used twice).

This is plausible.Current constraints:
- Word starts with S, has E in second position, ends with N: _S E _ _ N_
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, T, I
- Thus, possible letters for 3rd and 4th positions from remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words matching S E _ _ N:
- SEMEN (S, E, M, E, N) – uses M for 3rd and repeats E in 4th.

This is a valid English word and tests new letter M while placing E in 4th spot.

Possible patterns:
1. S N _ E _  → but then we need another E in the blank, giving S N E E _  (but last letter unknown).

- N is in word and would be 2nd (allowed, since it was ""-"" before).
- E is 3rd and 4th, satisfying both the E in word and not 5th.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to maximize the amount of information I can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English, particularly vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). This way, I can quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives me the best chance at identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions early on.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

That means the secret word has:
- S somewhere other than the 4th position.
- E somewhere other than the 5th position.
- No A, R, or O.

Next, I want to find the exact positions of S and E while testing new, common consonants. A good approach is to place S and E in fresh spots and bring in new letters like T, I, N, L, etc. A balanced word that does this is ""STEIN"":
- S moves to position 1.
- E moves to position 2.
- Adds T, I, N (none used before).

This gives me 3 new letters plus the relocated S and E, maximizing information gained.

- Letters in the word and their correct positions: S _ _ _ _ (S in 1st), E _ _ _ _ (E in 2nd), _ _ _ _ N (N in 5th).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I.
- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, U, Y, H, K, M, P, etc.

Pattern so far: S E _ _ N

The 3rd and 4th positions are open. We need two distinct letters that have not been ruled out yet. Good candidates for these slots are common consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared. The remaining common vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Common consonants left include C, D, L, M, P, etc.

Testing common combinations:
- ""SEDAN"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""SEVEN"" – V is less common, E is already used in 2nd spot.
- ""SELDN"" – Not a valid word.
- ""SENSE"" – E is already in 2nd spot, N is already in 5th spot (invalid repetition and overlapping).
- ""SEDGE"" – G is possible, but E is already in 2nd spot.

A valid and common word is ""SECOND"":
- But it’s 6 letters, so invalid.

Valid 5-letter options:
- ""SEDUM"" (plant) – U and D are new.
- ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- ""SEWIN"" – I is ruled out.
- ""SEMIN"" – M and I. I is ruled out.
- ""SEPYN"" – P and Y. All letters new and valid.

""SEPYN"" is a valid word (archaic variant of ""seep"" + past participle), but quite obscure. A more common word is ""SEDAN"", but A is ruled out.

Wait, let me think of better options:
- ""SEDGY"" – G and Y, but Y is less common.
- ""SEDUM"" is obscure but valid.

Actually, ""SEDUM"" is the best valid option with new letters D and U.

However, a more common word is ""SELDN"" which is invalid. Let me think differently: ""SEMIN"" has I (invalid). ""SEPSI"" – I invalid. ""SEPSN"" – invalid.

Rechecking, ""SEDUM"" is the only valid 5-letter word fitting S E _ _ N with unused letters.

But if we consider ""SEDUM"" obscure, perhaps ""SEPSY"" (also obscure). Better to go with ""SEDUM"" as it’s at least a recognized plant name.

However, looking again, ""SEMIN"" is invalid due to I. ""SEDGE"" has G and D, and E is already in 2nd spot (but G is new). But ""SEDGE"" has E in 5th which conflicts with N in 5th.

Oops, my pattern is S E _ _ N, so the last letter is N. Thus, the word must be S E _ _ N. Therefore, the missing letters are 3rd and 4th positions.

Let me list possible pairs for 3rd and 4th:
- S E _ _ N

Unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common combinations:
- S E C _ N – ""SECTION"" too long. ""SECON"" – not a word.
- S E D _ N – ""SEDAN"" has A (invalid). ""SEDEN"" – invalid.
- S E L _ N – ""SELEN"" (prefix), but obscure. ""SELDN"" – invalid.
- S E M _ N – ""SEMEN"" – valid word. But E is already in 2nd spot, and E cannot be repeated unless allowed (Wordle allows repeats).

""SEMEN"" is valid:
- S E M E N
- E appears twice: once in 2nd (confirmed) and once in 4th. This is allowed.

This tests M and the repeated E in 4th spot.

Thus, ""SEMEN"" is a good next guess.

But wait, E is already in 2nd spot (confirmed), and we have S E _ _ N. The 4th spot could be E again. So ""SEMEN"" fits: S(1), E(2), M(3), E(4), N(5).

This tests:
- M in 3rd spot.
- E in 4th spot (already in 2nd spot, so E is used twice).

This is plausible.Current constraints:
- Word starts with S, has E in second position, ends with N: _S E _ _ N_
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, T, I
- Thus, possible letters for 3rd and 4th positions from remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words matching S E _ _ N:
- SEMEN (S, E, M, E, N) – uses M for 3rd and repeats E in 4th.

This is a valid English word and tests new letter M while placing E in 4th spot.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- S U B E N → ""SUBEN"" – not a word.

- S C E E N → ""SCENE"" fits: S C E E N. 2nd=C, 3rd=E, 4th=E. This is valid.

""SCENE"" uses only allowed letters (C, E, N, S) and fits the pattern perfectly with E in 4th and N in 5th, and no contradictions.

But wait, in SEMEN feedback, 2nd letter E was marked as ""wrong position,"" meaning E is in the word but not in 2nd position. That’s already satisfied since E is in 4th position in SCENE.

A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English, particularly vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). This way, I can quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters.\n\nOne of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 common consonants (R, S)\n\nThis gives me the best chance at identifying which letters are in the word and their possible positions early on.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).\n- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n\nThat means the secret word has:\n- S somewhere other than the 4th position.\n- E somewhere other than the 5th position.\n- No A, R, or O.\n\nNext, I want to find the exact positions of S and E while testing new, common consonants. A good approach is to place S and E in fresh spots and bring in new letters like T, I, N, L, etc. A balanced word that does this is ""STEIN"":\n- S moves to position 1.\n- E moves to position 2.\n- Adds T, I, N (none used before).\n\nThis gives me 3 new letters plus the relocated S and E, maximizing information gained.\n\n<guess>STEIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current confirmed facts:\n- Letters in the word and their correct positions: S _ _ _ _ (S in 1st), E _ _ _ _ (E in 2nd), _ _ _ _ N (N in 5th).\n- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I.\n- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, L, U, Y, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\nPattern so far: S E _ _ N\n\nThe 3rd and 4th positions are open. We need two distinct letters that have not been ruled out yet. Good candidates for these slots are common consonants and vowels that haven’t appeared. The remaining common vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Common consonants left include C, D, L, M, P, etc.\n\nTesting common combinations:\n- ""SEDAN"" – but A is ruled out.\n- ""SEVEN"" – V is less common, E is already used in 2nd spot.\n- ""SELDN"" – Not a valid word.\n- ""SENSE"" – E is already in 2nd spot, N is already in 5th spot (invalid repetition and overlapping).\n- ""SEDGE"" – G is possible, but E is already in 2nd spot.\n\nA valid and common word is ""SECOND"":\n- But it’s 6 letters, so invalid.\n\nValid 5-letter options:\n- ""SEDUM"" (plant) – U and D are new.\n- ""SELDN"" – invalid.\n- ""SEWIN"" – I is ruled out.\n- ""SEMIN"" – M and I. I is ruled out.\n- ""SEPYN"" – P and Y. All letters new and valid.\n\n""SEPYN"" is a valid word (archaic variant of ""seep"" + past participle), but quite obscure. A more common word is ""SEDAN"", but A is ruled out.\n\nWait, let me think of better options:\n- ""SEDGY"" – G and Y, but Y is less common.\n- ""SEDUM"" is obscure but valid.\n\nActually, ""SEDUM"" is the best valid option with new letters D and U.\n\nHowever, a more common word is ""SELDN"" which is invalid. Let me think differently: ""SEMIN"" has I (invalid). ""SEPSI"" – I invalid. ""SEPSN"" – invalid.\n\nRechecking, ""SEDUM"" is the only valid 5-letter word fitting S E _ _ N with unused letters.\n\nBut if we consider ""SEDUM"" obscure, perhaps ""SEPSY"" (also obscure). Better to go with ""SEDUM"" as it’s at least a recognized plant name.\n\nHowever, looking again, ""SEMIN"" is invalid due to I. ""SEDGE"" has G and D, and E is already in 2nd spot (but G is new). But ""SEDGE"" has E in 5th which conflicts with N in 5th.\n\nOops, my pattern is S E _ _ N, so the last letter is N. Thus, the word must be S E _ _ N. Therefore, the missing letters are 3rd and 4th positions.\n\nLet me list possible pairs for 3rd and 4th:\n- S E _ _ N\n\nUnused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon combinations:\n- S E C _ N – ""SECTION"" too long. ""SECON"" – not a word.\n- S E D _ N – ""SEDAN"" has A (invalid). ""SEDEN"" – invalid.\n- S E L _ N – ""SELEN"" (prefix), but obscure. ""SELDN"" – invalid.\n- S E M _ N – ""SEMEN"" – valid word. But E is already in 2nd spot, and E cannot be repeated unless allowed (Wordle allows repeats).\n\n""SEMEN"" is valid:\n- S E M E N\n- E appears twice: once in 2nd (confirmed) and once in 4th. This is allowed.\n\nThis tests M and the repeated E in 4th spot.\n\nThus, ""SEMEN"" is a good next guess.\n\nBut wait, E is already in 2nd spot (confirmed), and we have S E _ _ N. The 4th spot could be E again. So ""SEMEN"" fits: S(1), E(2), M(3), E(4), N(5).\n\nThis tests:\n- M in 3rd spot.\n- E in 4th spot (already in 2nd spot, so E is used twice).\n\nThis is plausible.Current constraints:\n- Word starts with S, has E in second position, ends with N: _S E _ _ N_\n- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, T, I\n- Thus, possible letters for 3rd and 4th positions from remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words matching S E _ _ N:\n- SEMEN (S, E, M, E, N) – uses M for 3rd and repeats E in 4th.\n\nThis is a valid English word and tests new letter M while placing E in 4th spot.\n\n<guess>SEMEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)\nGuess 3: SEMEN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(-) M(x) E(✓) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current confirmed facts:\n- 1st letter = S (✓)\n- 2nd letter ≠ E (from SEMEN feedback: E is in wrong position)\n- 3rd letter ≠ M (x)\n- 4th letter = E (✓)\n- 5th letter = N (✓)\n\nSo the pattern is: S _ _ E N, with E not in 2nd spot.\n\nLetters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I, M.\n\nRemaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to fill 2nd and 3rd positions with available letters.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- S U B E N → ""SUBEN"" – not a word.\n- S U C E N → ""SUCEN"" – not a word.\n- S U D E N → ""SUDEN"" – not a word.\n- S L E E N → ""SLEEN"" – not a word.\n- S P E E N → ""SPEEN"" – variant spelling of ""spoon,"" but rare.\n- S H E E N → ""SHEEN"" – valid word.\n- S C E E N → ""SCENE"" – but C is unused, E is allowed in 4th.\n- S C E E N → ""SCENE"" fits: S C E E N. 2nd=C, 3rd=E, 4th=E.

3. SCENE → S(✓) 1st, E(✓) 4th, N(✓) 2nd  (reveals N is actually 2nd, not 4th, and the extra E is 3rd)
4. SNEER → S(✓) 1st, N(✓) 2nd, E(✓) 3rd, E(✓) 4th, R(x)

4th: E
5th: ?

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, T, I, M, C, R (again)

We need a 5-letter word that starts SNEE_.  The only common English word that fits is “SNEED” (valid variant or dialect form) but dictionaries also list “SNEEZ”.  Between them, “SNEED” is more widely accepted.  Either way, only the 5th letter is unknown.  The only letters left that haven’t been tried and are not yet excluded are very few; the first un-tested letter that makes a valid word is D.

Therefore, the secret word must be SNEED.

Guessing it now will reveal whether the final letter is D or something else.
