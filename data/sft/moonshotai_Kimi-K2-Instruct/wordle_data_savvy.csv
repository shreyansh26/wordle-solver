For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and the most frequent consonants. Popular choices are words like:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a good balance of common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). This should give us solid information about five different letters that appear frequently in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- L, T, and E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word starts with S, includes the letter A somewhere other than position 3, and does not contain L, T, or E.

Next, I want to test common letters that haven't been ruled out, especially consonants like R, N, D, C, and vowel O, to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SOUND"". It keeps the S fixed in position 1, moves A to a new position (though SOUND uses O instead), and tests the new letters O, U, N, D.

3. The letters L, T, E, O, U, N, D are all excluded.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and the most frequent consonants. Popular choices are words like:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a good balance of common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). This should give us solid information about five different letters that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- L, T, and E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word starts with S, includes the letter A somewhere other than position 3, and does not contain L, T, or E.

Next, I want to test common letters that haven't been ruled out, especially consonants like R, N, D, C, and vowel O, to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SOUND"". It keeps the S fixed in position 1, moves A to a new position (though SOUND uses O instead), and tests the new letters O, U, N, D.

Remaining unused common letters we still want to test: R, I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, K, F, W.  

Since A must appear somewhere other than position 3, the possible positions for A are 2, 4, or 5.

A word that keeps S fixed in position 1, places A in a new position (say position 2), and introduces several still-allowed consonants is **SHARK** (S, H, A, R, K).

Current constraints:

1. Word starts with S (position 1, ✓).
2. Must contain the letter A, but:
   - A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SHARK and SLATE feedback).
   - A is NOT in position 4 (from SCAMP feedback).
   ⇒ A must be in position 5.
3. Forbidden letters: L, T, E, O, U, N, D, H, R, K, C, M, P.

So the pattern is: S _ _ _ A

Allowed letters for positions 2-4:  
Consonants: B, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (since A is already used, and E, O, U are forbidden).

Possible valid English words with this pattern:
- SIGMA (but M is forbidden)  
- SILVA (but V hasn't been tested, L is forbidden)  
- SOPRA (O, P, R forbidden)  
- SIMAA (not valid)  
- SIBIA (valid, uses S, I, B, I, A)  

""SIBIA"" is a valid 5-letter word (a genus of birds, accepted in Scrabble/Wordle lists). It introduces new letters I and B while fitting all constraints.

However, another more common option is ""SIGMA"" but M is forbidden. Another is ""SINAI"" (but N is forbidden).  

Looking at the remaining allowed letters (B, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, I), the most plausible word is ""SWIZA"" (not valid).  

Actually, ""SABIA"" is invalid (A can't be in position 2).  

Re-evaluating, the best remaining valid word is ""SIGMA"" but M is forbidden.  

Next option is ""SIBIA"" (valid per Wordle dictionary).  

Alternatively, ""VIGIA"" starts with V but we need S.  

Thus, the only viable guess left seems ""SIBIA"".

But let me double-check: The constraints are:
- S _ _ _ A  
- Letters used so far: S, A  
- Forbidden: L, T, E, O, U, N, D, H, R, K, C, M, P  

Remaining unused letters: B, F, G, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Valid words:
- SIBIA  
- SIGFA (invalid)  
- SIZAR (R forbidden)  
- SQUIZ (Q, U, Z but U is forbidden)  

Thus, ""SIBIA"" is the best remaining choice.

Remaining available letters: B, F, G, I, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

A valid word fitting this pattern is **SIBIA**.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Must contain A, but the feedback shows A is NOT in the word (from SIBIA: A(-) now appears with ""x"", not ""-"").
Wait – the SIBIA line says A(-). That symbol ""-"" still means the letter A is in the word but in the wrong place.  
However, in positions 2,3,4,5 we have already eliminated A from 2,3,4.  
Therefore the only remaining possible place for A is position 5.

But SIBIA has A in position 5 and still got A(-), which can’t happen if A is allowed to be there.  
That contradiction implies that A is actually NOT in the word, despite earlier ""-"" feedback.  
Recheck:

- SLATE: A(-)  → A exists but not in position 3  
- SHARK: A(-)  → A exists but not in position 2  
- SCAMP: A(-)  → A exists but not in position 4  
- SIBIA: A(-)  → A exists but not in position 5  

But every position 2,3,4,5 has been ruled out for A while still getting ""-"". That’s impossible unless A is NOT in the word – the feedback must have been mis-read.

Looking carefully: in the prompt the feedback for SIBIA is written as  
SIBIA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(x) B(x) I(x) A(-)

But by the rules:  
✓ = correct position  
- = in word, wrong position  
x = not in word  

Hence SIBIA’s A(-) still claims A is in the word somewhere.  
But positions 2,3,4,5 have all been eliminated for A.  
Therefore the feedback data must contain a typo; the only logically consistent reading is that A is actually NOT in the word, so the ""-"" should have been ""x"".  
Accepting that, we remove A from consideration entirely.

So updated constraints:
- Starts with S (position 1)
- Does NOT contain: L,T,E,O,U,N,D,H,R,K,C,M,P,A,I,B
- Remaining unused letters: F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and sometimes others (but many are rare).

Looking for a valid 5-letter word starting with S and using only the still-allowed letters in positions 2-5.  
Allowed letters: F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and maybe others not yet ruled out).

Valid English word: SWIZZ (slang for energy/oomph, accepted in Wordle dictionary).  
It uses S, W, I, Z, Z – but I was already marked x in SIBIA.  
Next: SWIZZ is invalid (I).  
Next: SQUIZ – uses Q,U (U forbidden).  
Next: SYZGY (not 5 letters).

The only remaining valid word in standard Wordle answer list is **SWYFT** (invalid T).

However, according to the constraints we must have missed something. Re-examine:  
The banned letters so far: L,T,E,O,U,N,D,H,R,K,C,M,P,A,I,B
