Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possible letters in the word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (a very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination covers 5 different common letters and will give good information about their presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it is NOT in position 1).
- L and A are NOT in the word at all.
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is NOT in the word.

- The word ends in “_ _ _ T _”.
- The letters L, A, and E are absent.
- The letter S is present somewhere, but not in position 1.

2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.

- T is in the word and must be in position 4.  
- Letters L, A, E are not in the word.

From PRINT:  
- P, I, N are not in the word.  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (contradiction with previous info).

Wait, this is impossible. The feedback for PRINT lists T(-), meaning T is in the word but in the wrong position. However, T was already confirmed to be in position 4 from SLATE. The only way T can be in position 4 (from SLATE) and also be in the word but in the wrong position (from PRINT) is if the secret word has two 'T's, which is not allowed since all letters must be unique in the feedback system (or if the feedback were inconsistent, but we should assume it's correct).

But more likely, the feedback for PRINT's last letter T(-) means that T is in the word but not in position 5, which is compatible with T being in position 4. So no contradiction. We just know:

- T is in position 4.  
- S is in the word, not position 1.  
- R is in the word, not position 2.  
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E, P, I, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is not in position 1, and R is not in position 2.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has T in position 4 (already).  
- Uses S and R in new positions.  
- Uses new common letters not yet tested.

A good candidate is “FIRST”:
- F and O are new letters (but O is not in FIRST, so ignore this).  
Wait, FIRST uses F, I, R, S, T.  
But I is already out from PRINT feedback. So FIRST is invalid (contains I).

Next, try “WORST”:
- W, O, R, S, T.  
But O hasn’t been tested, and I is out, but O is allowed.  
- T is in position 4 (ok).  
- S is in position 5 (ok, since S can’t be in 1).  
- R is in position 3 (ok, since R can’t be in 2).  
- W and O are new letters.

But let me check if any of W, O, R, S, T conflict with known info:
- W: new, ok.

- S is in the word, not position 1.  
- R is in the word, not position 2.  
- Letters not in the word: L, A, E, P, I, N.

So far, the word looks like: _ _ _ T _, with S and R somewhere, and none of L A E P I N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know S is not in position 1, and R is not in position 2.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has T in position 4 (already).  
- Uses S and R in new positions.  
- Uses new common letters not yet tested.

A good candidate is “FIRST”:
- F and O are new letters (but O is not in FIRST, so ignore this).  
Wait, FIRST uses F, I, R, S, T.  
But I is already out from PRINT feedback. So FIRST is invalid (contains I).

Next, try “WORST”:
- W, O, R, S, T.  
But O hasn’t been tested, and I is out, but O is allowed.  
- T is in position 4 (ok).  
- S is in position 5 (ok, since S can’t be in 1).  
- R is in position 3 (ok, since R can’t be in 2).  
- W and O are new letters.

But let me check if any of W, O, R, S, T conflict with known info:
- W: new, ok.  
- O: new, ok.  
- R: in word, not position 2 (here it's 3, ok).  
- S: in word, not position 1 (here it's 5, ok).  
- T: position 4, ok.

No conflicts with known absences (L, A, E, P, I, N).

Let’s extract the constraints from all feedback so far:

1. From SLATE:
   - T is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
   - Letters L, A, E are not in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:
   - P, I, N are not in the word (x).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - T is in the word and NOT in position 5 (-) – this is consistent with T in position 4.

3. From WORST:
   - W, O are not in the word (x).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-) – so R cannot be in 2 or 3; only possible positions are 1 or 5, but position 5 is already T, so R must be in position 1.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-) – already knew it wasn’t in 1; still possible positions 2,3,5, but position 5 is T, so S must be in 2 or 3.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) – already knew it is in 4, so this is fine.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: R _ _ T _  (because R must be in position 1)
- Letters definitely in: R (pos 1), T (pos 4), S (pos 2 or 3)
- Letters definitely out: L, A, E, P, I, N, W, O
- Untested common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, Y

We need a 5-letter word starting with R, ending in _ _ _ T _ (but we already have T in pos 4), with S in position 2 OR 3, and the remaining two letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try S in position 2: word looks like R S _ T _
Possible for third letter: any unused common consonant or vowel, not repeating.

A common middle consonant is C: R S C T ?
But we need a fifth letter. Common endings: R S C T _ – the fifth letter must be one of the allowed letters.

Let’s pick a valid word: R U S T _ – but we need to fill in the fifth letter. Actually, the pattern is R _ _ T _ with S in 2 or 3.

Word must be 5 letters: R _ _ T _.

If S is in position 2: R S _ T _ -> need two more letters, one for position 3 and one for 5.

Let’s try R S C T H – but not a valid English word.

Actually, a valid word fitting R S _ T _ is RUSTY, but O and U are allowed so far, but RUSTY has U (ok) and Y (ok), and S in position 2. Let me check: RUSTY has T in position 4, R in 1, S in 2, U in 3, Y in 5. No forbidden letters.

But wait, does this use S in position 2? Yes, that’s allowed.

Let me check the letters:
- R (pos 1) ok
- U (new, ok)
- S (pos 2) ok (not in 1, and not in 4)
- T (pos 4) ok
- Y (new, ok)

No conflicts with prior feedback.
