For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common English letters to gather maximum information. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N are among the most frequent in English. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Common starting choices include words like:
- STARE
- AROSE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- ROAST

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial coverage of the alphabet.

From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1  
R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we now know:
- The word contains A, R, E (but not where they are now).
- It does NOT contain O or S.

Next, I need a word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions.
- Avoids O and S entirely.
- Brings in new letters to test.

A good next word might use consonants like T, N, L, I with the known letters. Trying “EARLY”:
- Places E in position 1, A in 2, R in 3, L in 4, Y in 5.  
This satisfies:
- E not in pos 5 (new pos 1)  
- A not in pos 1 (new pos 2)  
- R not in pos 2 (new pos 3)  
- Introduces L and Y for new information.  

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(-), O(x), S(x), E(-)  
   Meaning: A, R, E are all in the word but in wrong positions; O and S are not present.

2. EARLY → E(-), A(✓), R(-), L(x), Y(x)  
   Meaning:
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - L and Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- E is somewhere other than positions 1 or 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 1 (from EARLY), so E must be in position 3 or 4.
- R must be placed in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- The word cannot contain O, S, L, Y.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Places E in 3 or 4.
- Places R in 1, 4, or 5 (not colliding with E).
- Uses new letters to test.

Let me list possible letter positions:
- 1: not yet constrained (could be R or another new letter)
- 2: A (fixed)
- 3: could be E or another new letter
- 4: could be E or another new letter
- 5: could be R or another new letter

Let’s try R in position 1 and E in position 3:
R A E _ _

Now we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These must be new and not O, S, L, Y. Good candidates are T, N, D, C, etc.

Possible words: RAETN, RAETD, RAE_N, etc. Let me think of actual 5-letter words:
- RAVEN: A is correct pos 2, E in 4 (valid), R in 1 (valid), V and N are new.
  Check positions:
    R: not in pos 2 or 3 – ok in 1.
    A: pos 2 ✓
    V: new
    E: pos 4 (not 1,5) – ok
    N: new
  This looks valid.

Another option: RATER – but R is already in 1 and 4, which might not help test new letters. RAVEN seems better.

So my next guess is RAVEN.
