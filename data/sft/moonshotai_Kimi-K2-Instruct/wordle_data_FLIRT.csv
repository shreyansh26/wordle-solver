For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words typically contain:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- RAISE

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S, L, T (very common consonants)
- A, E (the two most common vowels)
- No repeating letters

This will give us good feedback on several key letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(✓) – L is in the word and is the second letter.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far:
- L is locked in position 2.
- T must appear somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 4).
- No S, A, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps L in position 2,
- Uses T somewhere else,
- Avoids S, A, E,
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels.

Possible vowels left: I, O, U
Common consonants left: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “BLITZ”:
- B (new consonant)
- L (fixed)
- I (vowel we haven’t used)
- T (must appear, now in position 4)
- Z (helps test less common letters)

But wait, T is in position 4 here, and the feedback said T is **not** in position 4. So BLITZ is invalid because it puts T back in position 4.

Next candidate: “CLIMB”
- C (new consonant)
- L (fixed)
- I (new vowel)
- M (new consonant)
- B (new consonant)
But this doesn’t include T at all, so we lose the info that T is in the word.

Next try: “PLUTO”
- P (new consonant)
- L (fixed)
- U (new vowel)
- T (now in position 4 again – invalid)

Next try: “FLINT”
- F (new consonant)
- L (fixed)
- I (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (now in position 5 – acceptable, since it’s not position 4)

This satisfies all constraints:
- L is in position 2.
- T is in position 5 (not position 4).
- No S, A, E.
- Uses new letters F, I, N.

So FLINT is a good next guess.
