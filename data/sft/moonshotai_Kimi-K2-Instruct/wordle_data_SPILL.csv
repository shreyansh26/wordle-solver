For the first guess, we want to choose a word that covers common letters and helps us quickly identify potential letters and their positions. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. Words like ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at ""STARE"":
- S: Very common starting letter
- T: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- R: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters without repeating any letters, maximizing the information we can gather from this first guess.

The feedback tells us:
- S is correct in the first position (S _ _ _ _).
- T, A, R, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. The remaining four letters cannot be T, A, R, E.
3. We still need to test other common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants.

A good next guess would use new common letters while preserving the S in the first spot. ""SOUND"" is a strong candidate because:
- Keeps S in position 1 (confirmed correct).
- Introduces O and U (common untested vowels).
- Introduces N and D (common consonants not yet tested).
- Avoids T, A, R, E which we know are not in the word.

We now have:

S (✓) L (-) I (✓) C (x) K (x)

This tells us:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- I is fixed in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- C and K are not present at all.

So the pattern is: S _ I _ _

Valid letters still available (after removing T,A,R,E,O,U,N,D,C,K) are essentially:
B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels we haven’t ruled out (only I is confirmed).

Since we already have I in position 3, we need to place L in one of positions 2, 4, or 5, but NOT in position 2 (since L was marked ""-"" there). So L must be in position 4 or 5.

We need two more letters from the remaining pool, and common consonants are B, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess is: ""SPILL""
- Starts with S (fixed)
- P and L are from remaining letters
- L appears again, but now in position 4 (allowed since L was only wrong in position 2)
- Ends with L in position 5 (also allowed)
- Second letter P is from remaining pool (not yet ruled out)

This tests P in position 2 and L in positions 4 and 5. It’s a strategic placement to maximize information about L's position and test P.

Alternative strong guesses could be ""SMILY"" or ""SWILL"", but ""SPILL"" seems most informative.

<guess>SPILL</guess>",SPILL,"We now have:

S (✓) L (-) I (✓) C (x) K (x)

This tells us:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- I is fixed in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- C and K are not present at all.

So the pattern is: S _ I _ _

Valid letters still available (after removing T,A,R,E,O,U,N,D,C,K) are essentially:
B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any vowels we haven’t ruled out (only I is confirmed).

Since we already have I in position 3, we need to place L in one of positions 2, 4, or 5, but NOT in position 2 (since L was marked ""-"" there). So L must be in position 4 or 5.

We need two more letters from the remaining pool, and common consonants are B, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess is: ""SPILL""
- Starts with S (fixed)
- P and L are from remaining letters
- L appears again, but now in position 4 (allowed since L was only wrong in position 2)
- Ends with L in position 5 (also allowed)
- Second letter P is from remaining pool (not yet ruled out)

This tests P in position 2 and L in positions 4 and 5. It’s a strategic placement to maximize information about L's position and test P.

Alternative strong guesses could be ""SMILY"" or ""SWILL"", but ""SPILL"" seems most informative.",Guess 4: SPILL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
