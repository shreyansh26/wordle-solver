For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a good spread of vowels and consonants. This helps rule in or out many possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Some popular and effective opening words include: ADIEU, SLATE, CRANE, STARE, ARISE.

Looking at these:
- ADIEU has 4 vowels, which is great for identifying vowels but uses 'U' which is less common.
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - covering very common letters.
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also excellent coverage.
- STARE is similar to SLATE but swaps L for R.
- ARISE has A, R, I, S, E - good coverage.

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good information about letter presence and positioning.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- I: in word, but wrong position (-)  → I is present, but NOT in position 3
- S: not in word (x)

So we know:
1. The word is 5 letters ending in E.
2. It contains the letter I, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Let’s tally the current constraints:

1. From ARISE:
   - A, R, S are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - E is in position 5 (last letter).

2. From WIDEN:
   - W is in the word and in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (same as before) and now we know it’s also not in position 2.
   - D and N are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (contradicts ARISE feedback where E was shown as position 5).  
   Correction: the second feedback lists E(-) which means E is in the word but NOT in position 4, which is consistent with position 5 being correct.

So far we have:
- Pattern: W _ _ _ E
- Letters still allowed: I (not in positions 2 or 3), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, D, N.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with W, ends with E, contains I not in positions 2 or 3. The only remaining positions for I are 4.  
So the pattern is W _ _ I E.

Possible 3rd and 4th letters from the remaining alphabet: common consonants like L, T, M, G, H, etc.  
A quick scan of words that fit W _ _ I E:  
- “WHIPE” – but H and P may not be common.  
- “WLIPE”, “WMITE” – quickly, the only valid English word that fits W _ _ I E is “WHITE”.

Check “WHITE”:
- Starts with W, ends with E.
- Contains I in position 4 (allowed).
- No A, R, S, D, N.
- Uses common letters (W, H, I, T, E) to test for H and T.

This seems the best strategic next guess.
