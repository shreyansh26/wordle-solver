For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting letters that might be in the secret word.

Let’s digest the two pieces of feedback.

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

- Letters present in the secret word but in wrong positions: A, R, E  
- Letters absent: O, S

Guess 2: E A R L Y  
Feedback: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(-)

- Letters present but in wrong positions: E, A, R, Y  
- Letters absent: L (and we already knew S, O were absent)

Combining both sets:

Present letters: A, R, E, Y  
Absent letters: O, S, L

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be 1 or 2 (was in 1, then 2)
- R cannot be 2 or 3 (was in 2, then 3)
- E cannot be 5 or 1 (was in 5, then 1)
- Y cannot be 5 (was in 5)

So the remaining viable positions for each letter:

A: positions 3, 4, 5  
R: positions 1, 4, 5  
E: positions 2, 3, 4  
Y: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses each of A, R, E, Y exactly once and one additional letter not yet tested (and not among O, S, L). Good untested consonants include T, N, D, H, C, etc.

A quick scan for patterns:

One common pattern is to put the consonants at the start and end. Let’s try places:

- Y at 1, R at 5: Y _ _ _ R → need A, E in 2-4.  
  Possible: Y A E _ R (but then the fourth letter must be new).  
  Word: YAEDR — not valid.

- A at 3, E at 2, R at 5, Y at 1: Y E A _ R → the blank needs a new letter.  
  YAENR? Not a word.

Another promising pattern:  
Put R in 1, Y in 4, A in 3, E in 2: R E A Y _ → the fifth letter must be new.  
REA Y? : REAYx — not valid.

Let’s rearrange:

Try A in 4, R in 1, E in 2, Y in 5: R E _ A Y → fill with a new consonant.

REx AY → RET AY → “RETAY” — not a valid English word.

How about E in 3, A in 4, R in 1, Y in 2: R Y E A _ → RYEAx → RYE A N → “RYEAN” — no.

Wait, let’s search for a valid word fitting the constraints.

A valid word satisfying:
- Uses A, R, E, Y exactly once each plus one new letter  
- New letter not in {O, S, L}  
- Ensures no letter goes in a banned position

Consider “YACKE” — no, has two vowels extra.

Consider “YEARD” — but D is new and positions:
Y(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). Check constraints:

Y in 1 — allowed (was only banned at 5)  
E in 2 — allowed (was banned at 1 and 5)  
A in 3 — allowed (was banned at 1 and 2)  
R in 4 — allowed (was banned at 2 and 3)  
D new — ok

Word “YEARD” is valid.

Verify:

YEARD:

Positions: 1=Y, 2=E, 3=A, 4=R, 5=D — none break prior bans.

Thus I’ll guess YEARD.

Wait, let’s search for a valid word fitting the constraints.

A valid word satisfying:
- Uses A, R, E, Y exactly once each plus one new letter  
- New letter not in {O, S, L}  
- Ensures no letter goes in a banned position

Consider “YACKE” — no, has two vowels extra.

Consider “YEARD” — but D is new and positions:
Y(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). Check constraints:

Y in 1 — allowed (was only banned at 5)  
E in 2 — allowed (was banned at 1 and 5)  
A in 3 — allowed (was banned at 1 and 2)  
R in 4 — allowed (was banned at 2 and 3)  
D new — ok

Word “YEARD” is valid.

Verify:

YEARD:
Letters: Y, E, A, R, D — includes all required (A, R, E, Y) and new D.  
Positions: 1=Y, 2=E, 3=A, 4=R, 5=D — none break prior bans.

Thus I’ll guess YEARD.

From the feedback on YEARD:
- Y, E, A, R are all in the correct positions (1-4)
- D is not in the word at all.

So the secret word is:
Y E A R ?

The only remaining slot is position 5. We need a single letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out from previous guesses:
- O, S (from AROSE feedback)
- L (from EARLY feedback)
- D (from YEARD feedback)

Common remaining consonants to test: T, N, C, H, K, M, P, etc.

A very common ending for “YEAR_” is “YEAR + T” making “YEART” – but that’s not a standard English word.

Real words ending in a single consonant:
- YEARN
- YEARS

“YEARN” is valid and uses N (not yet tested). Let’s try it.
