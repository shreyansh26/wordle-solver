For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include A, E, T, R, S, N, L, and C. Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)

3. We should test fresh consonants to maximize information gain.

- Place L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5)
- Include new vowels (preferably I and/or O)
- Use new consonants (avoid S, A, T, E)

Current constraints:

1. Letters not in the word: S A T E G O R U M P
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - L (cannot be in positions 2 or 3 — from SLATE and GLORY)  
   - L also cannot be in position 1 — because LUMPY had L(–) in position 1, so L must be in position 4.
   - Y is in position 5 (✓ from GLORY and confirmed by LUMPY)

So the only possible pattern is:
_ _ _ L Y

Available letters (unused so far):  
Consonants: B C D F H I J K N Q V W X Z  
Vowels: I (only remaining common vowel)

We need a 5-letter word ending in LY that:
- uses only letters from the available set
- has L in position 4
- has Y in position 5

Candidate endings: “ILY” won’t make a word. “NILY” is invalid.  
But “H” + “I” + “N” + “L” + “Y” = “HINLY” is not valid.  
Another option: “F” + “I” + “L” + “L” + “Y” = “FILLY” – but double L, and both Fs and Is have not been used, and pattern is _ I _ L Y which is acceptable.

FILLY ends in LY, fits the positional constraints, and only uses letters not yet ruled out (F, I, L, Y). The second L is allowed because we only know one L exists, but a second L is not forbidden by prior feedback.
