For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the secret word. This means selecting a word that contains common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities early. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which also appear frequently
This combination should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word, and potentially their positions.

Alternative good starting words could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

A candidate is “TORCH”:
- T (new, common) in position 1
- O (✓ in 2)
- R (must be somewhere, try 3)
- C (new, common) in 4
- H (new, common) in 5
- N is not in this word, so we’ll see if N is truly needed later.

Wait — we know N **must** be in the word (from Guess 2), so “TORCH” omits N and is therefore impossible. Let’s revise: put N in position 1 and R in position 3, and use common consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Revised candidate: “NORTH”  
Positions:  
1 N (must be present)  
2 O (✓)  
3 R (must be present)  
4 T (new)  
5 H (new)

This uses all required letters (R, O, N) in allowable positions and introduces two new common consonants (T, H).

This means selecting a word that contains common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities early. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.\n\nOne of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English\n- 2 common consonants (R, S) which also appear frequently\nThis combination should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word, and potentially their positions.\n\nAlternative good starting words could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 2nd letter).\n- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd letter).\n- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.\n- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word contains R and O, but they are not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.\n- The letters A, S, E are definitely not in the word.\n- We still have 3 more unknown letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) but we know positions 1,4,5 cannot be A/S/E and position 3 cannot be O.\n\nAmong common letters not yet tried, we have: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nSince R and O must appear elsewhere, I\'ll try placing R in position 1 and O in position 4 to maximize information.

From Guess 3 (NORTH → N(-) O(✓) R(✓) T(x) H(x)):
- N is in the word but not in position 1.
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- R is in the word and now confirmed in position 3 (because it got ✓).
- T and H are not in the word.

Therefore the word pattern is: _ O R _ _
Letters we know must be present: N (but not in 1), R (already in 3), O (in 2).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, E, S, U, D, T, H.

We need to place N in positions 4 or 5, and find two new common letters for positions 1 and 5 (or 4 if N is in 5).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, P, Y.
Common vowels left: I (since A, E, U are out).

Let’s try:
- Position 1: C (common consonant)
- Position 4: N (must be here or 5)
- Position 5: I (new vowel)

This forms ""CORNI"", but that’s not a valid 5-letter word.

Alternative: ""CORNY"":
- C (1), O (2), R (3), N (4), Y (5)
- Valid word and uses N in position 4 where it hasn't been tried.

Check constraints:
- C, Y are new and allowed.
- N is in position 4 (never tested, and N cannot be in 1, but can be here).
- All required letters (N, O, R) are present.

This seems valid.
