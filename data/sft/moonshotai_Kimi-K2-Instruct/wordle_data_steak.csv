Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that has common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct or at least in the word. A good starting word contains common vowels and consonants like S, T, R, N, L, etc. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the word or at least identifying which letters are not present.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓).  
- L is not in the word (x).  
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-).  
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).  

So the word starts with S and contains A, T, E somewhere else.

  Feedback check: S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), R(x), E(✓) — but we don’t know about R yet.  
- ""saute"" – S A U T E → S first, A second, T fourth, E fifth.  
- ""septa"" – S E P T A → S first, E second, T fourth, A fifth.

""stare"" looks cleanest because it places T in the second slot (which was position 4 in “slate”), A in the third slot (from position 3), and E in the fifth (from position 5). We also haven’t used R yet so we’ll get info on R.

   3: not A, not R, not L  
   4: not T, not A, not R, not L  
   5: not E, not A, not R, not L  

2. Letters still “in the word somewhere”  
   - A, E must appear (because they were marked “-” in earlier guesses).  
   - Consequently, the word must contain both A and E exactly once each (since 5-letter word).  

3. Available positions for A and E  
   A cannot be in 3 or 4 (from stare feedback).  
   E cannot be in 5 (from slate).  
   So:  
   A can only go in 2 or 5 → but position 2 is already T.  
   ⇒ A must be in position 5.  

   E can only go in 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are taken by S, T, A).  

4. Candidate skeleton  
   S T _ _ A  
   - Slot 3 and 4 must be filled with E and one more unused consonant (no L, R).  
   - Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, Y …  

5. Build a valid word  
   Try to put E in slot 3:  
   S T E _ A → need a consonant for slot 4.  
   Common consonants: N → STENA (not a valid word)  
   X → STEXA (invalid)  
   P → STEPA (invalid)  
   M → STEMA (valid 5-letter word meaning a surgical instrument)  

   Try E in slot 4:  
   S T _ E A → need consonant in slot 3.  
   C → STCEA (invalid)  
   D → STD** (invalid)  
   K → STKEA (invalid)  
   P → STPEA (invalid)  
   So only plausible word so far is STEMA.

Let’s double-check STEMA:
- S T E M A  
- S (✓) T (✓) positions confirmed.  
- E placed in 3 (was “-”, so ok).

4. Candidate skeleton  
   S T _ _ A  
   - Slot 3 and 4 must be filled with E and one more unused consonant (no L, R).  
   - Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, Y …  

5. Build a valid word  
   Try to put E in slot 3:  
   S T E _ A → need a consonant for slot 4.  
   Common consonants: N → STENA (not a valid word)  
   X → STEXA (invalid)  
   P → STEPA (invalid)  
   M → STEMA (valid 5-letter word meaning a surgical instrument)  

   Try E in slot 4:  
   S T _ E A → need consonant in slot 3.  
   C → STCEA (invalid)  
   D → STD** (invalid)  
   K → STKEA (invalid)  
   P → STPEA (invalid)  
   So only plausible word so far is STEMA.

Let’s double-check STEMA:
- S T E M A  
- S (✓) T (✓) positions confirmed.  
- E placed in 3 (was “-”, so ok).  
- A placed in 5 (was “-”, so ok).  
- M hasn’t been used or ruled out yet.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is STEMA.

Current constraints:

1. Fixed prefix: S T E _ _   (positions 1, 2, 3 are locked in)
2. Letters already shown to exist in the word but not yet placed:
   - A (currently “-” in position 5 of ST E M A, so A must be in position 4)
   - E is already placed at 3, so A must be the fourth letter and E is already satisfied
3. Letters excluded so far: L, R, M

Therefore the pattern is:

S T E A _

Only one empty slot (position 5).  
Allowed letters: any consonant not yet ruled out (cannot be L, R, M).  
Common consonants left: C, D, G, H, K, N, P, V, Y, etc.

Quick scan of viable English words:

STEAK – K is allowed  
STEAD – D is allowed  
STEAM – but M is excluded  
STEAP – not a valid word  
STEAK seems the only common 5-letter word fitting S T E A _ with remaining consonant not yet excluded.
