For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities effectively. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants. Let me think of words like ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", or ""CRANE"".

""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""AROSE"":
- A and R are correct in their positions (1st and 2nd letters).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A R _ _ _
The remaining letters must include E somewhere but not at the end, and cannot use O or S.

Possible positions for E: 3rd or 4th letter.

Let me think of words matching:
- A R E _ _
- A R _ E _

Common letters left that could fit: N, T, L, D, M, P, C, etc.

For ""A R E _ _"": words like ARENA, AREAL, ARENA, ARENA, AREAL, ARENA - but ARENA doesn't fit (has A in 1st, R in 2nd, E in 3rd, but N in 4th, A in 5th - but A is already in 1st position so 5th can't be A). 

For ""A R _ E _"": words like ARDEN, ARTER, ARPEL, ARGUE, etc. ARTER seems too obscure. ARGUE has G and U - but O is already out so U is possible.

Actually, let me think of ""ARIEL"" - A R I E L: fits A(1st), R(2nd), E(4th), and doesn't use O or S. But I need to check if this is a valid word - yes, it's a name/word meaning a type of gazelle or spirit.

But maybe ""ARGUE"" is better - A R G U E: has E in 5th position but feedback said E is not in 5th position (it was ""-"" not ""x""), so E is in word but not 5th. So ARGUE is invalid because E is 5th.

""A R E N A"" - but A is already first letter, can't be last too? No, letters can repeat unless feedback shows otherwise.

Wait, ARENA is A R E N A - but A is already in 1st position, and feedback didn't say anything about duplicates. The feedback only tells us about positions, not letter counts. So ARENA could be possible.

But let me think differently. The best approach is to try a word that uses new common letters while respecting the known positions.

A R _ _ _ with E somewhere in 3rd or 4th. Let me try ""ARENA"" - A R E N A. This places E in 3rd position and uses new letters N and A (A is already known but could be repeated).

But ARENA has A at start and end - is that allowed? The feedback didn't indicate A can't be at end, only that it must be at start.

Alternative: ""ARGUE"" is invalid due to E at 5th. ""ARMED"" - A R M E D: E in 4th position, uses M and D. This seems good.

""ARMED"" fits:
- A in 1st (✓)
- R in 2nd (✓)
- M, E, D new letters
- E in 4th position (allowed since E is ""-"" - in word but not 5th)
- No O or S used
</think>

Based on the feedback, A and R are correct in positions 1 and 2, E is in the word but not at the end, and O and S are not in the word. I'll try a word that keeps A and R in place, places E in position 4, and introduces new common letters.

From the two guesses we know:

1. A R _ _ _ (A and R are locked in the first two spots).
2. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because in ARMED it was “-” in the 4th spot, and E was already “-” in the 5th spot in AROSE).

3. Letters we must avoid: O, S, M, D.
