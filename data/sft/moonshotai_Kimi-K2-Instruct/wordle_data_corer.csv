For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll use ""AROSE"" because it has:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

What we know:
1. Letters not present: A, S
2. Letters present but misplaced: R, O, E

Next strategy:
- Use a word that keeps R, O, E but places them in new positions, and adds new common letters to test.
- Avoid A and S.
- Good candidates: words like ""ROGER"", ""TROPE"", ""GROPE"", ""PROVE"", ""STORE"", etc.

""PROTE"" would test:
- P (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2 from 2→now 2→still excluded, wait R was in pos 2 originally (-), so we can't have it in pos 2 again. Actually, R was in position 2 in AROSE and got (-), so in new word it must not be in position 2.
- O (originally position 3, got (-); now position 3 again would be same position - bad. Must move it.)
- T (new letter)
- E (originally position 5, got (-); must move it)

So ""PROTE"" has:
- R in 2 (same as original, bad)
- O in 3 (same as original, bad)
- E in 5 (same as original, bad)
This violates placement rules.

Better choice: ""TROPE""
- T (new)
- R (originally pos 2, now pos 2 - same, bad)
Wait, same issue.

Let me pick ""GROPE"":
- G (new)
- R (pos 1, originally pos 2 - new position, allowed)
- O (pos 2, originally pos 3 - new position, allowed)
- P (new)
- E (pos 5, originally pos 5 - same position, bad)

""GROPE"" has E in same (5) position as before - no good.

Next try ""GOPER"":
- G (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- P (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems to satisfy all constraints.

However, ""GOPER"" might not be a common word. Let's check ""FORCE"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- R (pos 3, originally 2 - new)
- C (new)
- E (pos 5, originally 5 - same, bad)

""FOXER"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- X (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems valid.

But is ""FOXER"" a valid word? It's a bit obscure (meaning a fox hunter).

Better common word: ""ORDER"":

No.

""COVER"":

Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll use ""AROSE"" because it has:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

What we know:
1. Letters not present: A, S
2. Letters present but misplaced: R, O, E

Next strategy:
- Use a word that keeps R, O, E but places them in new positions, and adds new common letters to test.
- Avoid A and S.
- Good candidates: words like ""ROGER"", ""TROPE"", ""GROPE"", ""PROVE"", ""STORE"", etc.

""PROTE"" would test:
- P (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2 from 2→now 2→still excluded, wait R was in pos 2 originally (-), so we can't have it in pos 2 again. Actually, R was in position 2 in AROSE and got (-), so in new word it must not be in position 2.
- O (originally position 3, got (-); now position 3 again would be same position - bad. Must move it.)
- T (new letter)
- E (originally position 5, got (-); must move it)

So ""PROTE"" has:
- R in 2 (same as original, bad)
- O in 3 (same as original, bad)
- E in 5 (same as original, bad)
This violates placement rules.

Better choice: ""TROPE""
- T (new)
- R (originally pos 2, now pos 2 - same, bad)
Wait, same issue.

Let me pick ""GROPE"":
- G (new)
- R (pos 1, originally pos 2 - new position, allowed)
- O (pos 2, originally pos 3 - new position, allowed)
- P (new)
- E (pos 5, originally pos 5 - same position, bad)

""GROPE"" has E in same (5) position as before - no good.

Next try ""GOPER"":
- G (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- P (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems to satisfy all constraints.

However, ""GOPER"" might not be a common word. Let's check ""FORCE"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- R (pos 3, originally 2 - new)
- C (new)
- E (pos 5, originally 5 - same, bad)

No, E still in 5.

""FOXER"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- X (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems valid.

But is ""FOXER"" a valid word? It's a bit obscure (meaning a fox hunter).

Better common word: ""ORDER"":
- O (pos 1, originally 3 - new)
- R (pos 2, originally 2 - same, bad)
No.

""COVER"":
- C (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- V (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This works.

""COVER"" is a valid word and satisfies all placement constraints.Based on the feedback that A and S are not in the word, while R, O, and E are present but in wrong positions, my next guess will reposition these known letters and introduce new common consonants.

Guess 2: COVER -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on COVER:
- C(✓) – C is correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.

- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 5.

We now know the exact pattern:
C O _ E R

The only unknown is the third letter. It must be a consonant (since we already have C, R and vowels O, E are placed) and must not be A, S, or V (those are ruled out).

Common 5-letter English words fitting C O _ E R:
- COMER
- CODER
- COGER (less common)
- COYER (less common)
- CONER (less common)

The most common is likely ""COMER"" or ""CODER"". Between these, ""COMER"" is a frequent word meaning ""one who comes"". Let me choose that.

So the guess should be COMER.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll use ""AROSE"" because it has:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S
This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

What we know:
1. Letters not present: A, S
2. Letters present but misplaced: R, O, E

Next strategy:
- Use a word that keeps R, O, E but places them in new positions, and adds new common letters to test.
- Avoid A and S.
- Good candidates: words like ""ROGER"", ""TROPE"", ""GROPE"", ""PROVE"", ""STORE"", etc.

""PROTE"" would test:
- P (new letter)
- R (moved to position 2 from 2→now 2→still excluded, wait R was in pos 2 originally (-), so we can't have it in pos 2 again. Actually, R was in position 2 in AROSE and got (-), so in new word it must not be in position 2.
- O (originally position 3, got (-); now position 3 again would be same position - bad. Must move it.)
- T (new letter)
- E (originally position 5, got (-); must move it)

So ""PROTE"" has:
- R in 2 (same as original, bad)
- O in 3 (same as original, bad)
- E in 5 (same as original, bad)
This violates placement rules.

Better choice: ""TROPE""
- T (new)
- R (originally pos 2, now pos 2 - same, bad)
Wait, same issue.

Let me pick ""GROPE"":
- G (new)
- R (pos 1, originally pos 2 - new position, allowed)
- O (pos 2, originally pos 3 - new position, allowed)
- P (new)
- E (pos 5, originally pos 5 - same position, bad)

""GROPE"" has E in same (5) position as before - no good.

Next try ""GOPER"":
- G (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- P (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems to satisfy all constraints.

However, ""GOPER"" might not be a common word. Let's check ""FORCE"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- R (pos 3, originally 2 - new)
- C (new)
- E (pos 5, originally 5 - same, bad)

No, E still in 5.

""FOXER"":
- F (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- X (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This seems valid.

But is ""FOXER"" a valid word? It's a bit obscure (meaning a fox hunter).

Better common word: ""ORDER"":
- O (pos 1, originally 3 - new)
- R (pos 2, originally 2 - same, bad)
No.

""COVER"":
- C (new)
- O (pos 2, originally 3 - new)
- V (new)
- E (pos 4, originally 5 - new)
- R (pos 5, originally 2 - new)
This works.

""COVER"" is a valid word and satisfies all placement constraints.Based on the feedback that A and S are not in the word, while R, O, and E are present but in wrong positions, my next guess will reposition these known letters and introduce new common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: COVER -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on COVER:
- C(✓) – C is correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.
- V(x) – V is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 5.

We now know the exact pattern:
C O _ E R

The only unknown is the third letter. It must be a consonant (since we already have C, R and vowels O, E are placed) and must not be A, S, or V (those are ruled out).

Common 5-letter English words fitting C O _ E R:
- COMER
- CODER
- COGER (less common)
- COYER (less common)
- CONER (less common)

The most common is likely ""COMER"" or ""CODER"". Between these, ""COMER"" is a frequent word meaning ""one who comes"". Let me choose that.

So the guess should be COMER.

- C O G E R → G is still possible  
- C O P E R → P is still possible  

Among these, the most common English word is “CODER.”
