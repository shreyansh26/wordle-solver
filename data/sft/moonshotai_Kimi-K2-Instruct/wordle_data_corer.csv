Since this is my first guess and I have no previous feedback to work from, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any.

Some strong starting words include:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with AROSE because it uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E in positions other than 2,3,5 respectively.
- The word cannot contain A or S.
- Letters left to test: common ones are T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, O, E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A and S.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R moved to 1, O to 2, E to 5 - but O was in position 3, so 2 is new for it; E was in 5, so this wouldn't test its new position)
- TROVE (T, R, O, V, E) - tests T and V
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) - tests C and N
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E) - tests D and V

I'll choose CRONE because C and N are very common, and it keeps R, O, E while moving them to new positions (R in 2, O in 3, E in 5 - but E was originally in 5, so this might not be ideal. Maybe better to move E to position 4).

Actually, better to move E away from position 5. Let me pick TROPE instead - T, R, O, P, E. This moves R to 2, O to 3, E to 5 (but E was originally in 5). Hmm.

Let me try THORO - but it has O twice. Not allowed. 

Looking at valid words, DOPER is good - D, O, P, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces D and P.

But P is less common. Let me try TONER - T, O, N, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces T and N, both very common.

This seems optimal.

But P is less common. Let me try TONER - T, O, N, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces T and N, both very common.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any.

Some strong starting words include:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with AROSE because it uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E in positions other than 2,3,5 respectively.
- The word cannot contain A or S.
- Letters left to test: common ones are T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, O, E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A and S.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R moved to 1, O to 2, E to 5 - but O was in position 3, so 2 is new for it; E was in 5, so this wouldn't test its new position)
- TROVE (T, R, O, V, E) - tests T and V
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) - tests C and N
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E) - tests D and V

I'll choose CRONE because C and N are very common, and it keeps R, O, E while moving them to new positions (R in 2, O in 3, E in 5 - but E was originally in 5, so this might not be ideal. Maybe better to move E to position 4).

Actually, better to move E away from position 5. Let me pick TROPE instead - T, R, O, P, E. This moves R to 2, O to 3, E to 5 (but E was originally in 5). Hmm.

Let me try THORO - but it has O twice. Not allowed. 

Looking at valid words, DOPER is good - D, O, P, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces D and P.

But P is less common. Let me try TONER - T, O, N, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is my first guess and I have no previous feedback to work from, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible without repeating any.

Some strong starting words include:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with AROSE because it uses five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, E in positions other than 2,3,5 respectively.
- The word cannot contain A or S.
- Letters left to test: common ones are T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R, O, E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A and S.

Possible candidates:
- ROUTE (R moved to 1, O to 2, E to 5 - but O was in position 3, so 2 is new for it; E was in 5, so this wouldn't test its new position)
- TROVE (T, R, O, V, E) - tests T and V
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) - tests C and N
- DROVE (D, R, O, V, E) - tests D and V

I'll choose CRONE because C and N are very common, and it keeps R, O, E while moving them to new positions (R in 2, O in 3, E in 5 - but E was originally in 5, so this might not be ideal. Maybe better to move E to position 4).

Actually, better to move E away from position 5. Let me pick TROPE instead - T, R, O, P, E. This moves R to 2, O to 3, E to 5 (but E was originally in 5). Hmm.

Let me try THORO - but it has O twice. Not allowed. 

Looking at valid words, DOPER is good - D, O, P, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces D and P.

But P is less common. Let me try TONER - T, O, N, E, R. This moves:
- O from 3 to 2
- E from 5 to 4
- R from 2 to 5
And introduces T and N, both very common.

This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TONER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TONER:

- T is not in the word (x)
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is correct in position 4 (✓)
- R is correct in position 5 (✓)

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ E R
- No letters A, S, T, N
- Letters already fixed: O (pos 2), E (pos 4), R (pos 5)

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3.
Common remaining letters to try: C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y…

Good candidates avoiding A, S, T, N:
- COVER (C, O, V, E, R) – fits _ O _ E R with V in 3
- LOWER (L, O, W, E, R) – fits _ O _ E R with W in 3
- POWER (P, O, W, E, R) – fits _ O _ E R with W in 3
- MOVER (M, O, V, E, R) – fits _ O _ E R with V in 3

Let’s try COVER first because C and V are common and haven’t been eliminated.

<guess>COVER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: COVER -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on COVER:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)
- O is still correct in position 2 (✓)
- V is not in the word (x)
- E is still correct in position 4 (✓)
- R is still correct in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now: C O _ E R with the blank in position 3.

Letters already confirmed: C, O, E, R
Letters eliminated so far: A, S, T, N, V

Common remaining consonants for position 3: D, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words following C O _ E R:
- CODER (C O D E R)
- COGER (C O G E R) – ""gager"" is valid
- COMER (C O M E R)
- COPER (C O P E R)
- COWER (C O W E R)

Among these, CODER uses D, a highly common letter we haven’t tested yet. Let’s try it.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CODER:
- C (✓) – position 1 is correct
- O (✓) – position 2 is correct
- D (x) – D is NOT in the word
- E (✓) – position 4 is correct
- R (✓) – position 5 is correct

Confirmed pattern: C O _ E R
Letters already placed: C, O, E, R
Letter eliminated from position 3: D
Previously eliminated letters: A, S, T, N, V, D

Remaining common consonants/likely candidates for position 3: G, H, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Possible valid words:
- COGER (but “gager” is not a common word, and “coger” is rare)
- COMER – legitimate word
- COPER – legitimate word
- COWER – legitimate word
- CORER – but R is already in position 5
- COYER – legitimate word (comparative of coy)

Among these, COMER and COWER are the most common. Let’s try COMER (C O M E R) first since M is highly common.
