For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good first guess should have frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (moderately common consonant)

This gives good coverage across common letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Interpreting the latest feedback on MOUNT:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word  
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word  
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (contradicting the earlier certainty that T is in position 4 from SLATE).  

Wait—let’s re-check:

From SLATE we were told T(✓) which means T is in the word AND in position 4.  
From MOUNT we are told T(-) which means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
These two clues are compatible: T is indeed in position 4, so it is not in position 5—no contradiction.

Confirmed facts:
1. T is fixed in position 4: _ _ _ T _  
2. O is somewhere else (positions 1,3,5)  
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Letters we have not tested yet and are still candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need a 5-letter English word:
- T in position 4  
- Contains O but not in position 2  
- Uses only the remaining candidate letters  

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ T _ and containing O elsewhere:

- B O R T Y → but Y not yet ruled out; but R and Y still possible  
- P O R T S → but S already ruled out  
- C O R P T → not valid  
- W O R T H → H and W still possible  
- F O R T Y → F, R, Y allowed  
- C O R T E → E ruled out  
- G O R T Y → G, R, T, Y allowed but “GORTY” is not a valid English word  
- P O R T Y → P, O, R, T, Y allowed, and “PORTY” is slang but not a common dictionary word  
- F O R T Y → “FORTY” is a valid English word, uses F, O, R, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out except T is known in position 4, and O can’t be in position 2 (in FORTY it’s position 2—so invalid).

O must not be in position 2, so we need O in position 1, 3, or 5.

Words with T in position 4 and O not in position 2:
- _ O _ T _ → e.g., “ROOTY” but O repeated, and R, Y allowed  
- _ _ O T _ → e.g., “COOTY” invalid  
- _ _ _ T O → e.g., “BIGTO” invalid  
- “NORTH” but N is ruled out  
- “WORTH” W, O, R, T, H → O is position 2—invalid  
- “HOTCH” but T not in position 4  
- “POOTY” invalid  
- “GOTHI” invalid  
- “ROBOT” but T in 5th, not 4th  
- “DITTO” T in 4th, O in 5th, D, I, T, O allowed → “DITTO” fits all clues.

Check DITTO:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good first guess should have frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (moderately common consonant)

This gives good coverage across common letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has T as its 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
2. No S, L, A, or E appear anywhere in the word.

I now want to test other common letters while respecting these constraints. A good next guess is “MOUNT”:
- It contains T in the 4th spot.
- It introduces the vowels O, U and consonants M, N.
- None of the letters S, L, A, E are used.

Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the latest feedback on MOUNT:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word  
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word  
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (contradicting the earlier certainty that T is in position 4 from SLATE).  

Wait—let’s re-check:

From SLATE we were told T(✓) which means T is in the word AND in position 4.  
From MOUNT we are told T(-) which means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
These two clues are compatible: T is indeed in position 4, so it is not in position 5—no contradiction.

Confirmed facts:
1. T is fixed in position 4: _ _ _ T _  
2. O is somewhere else (positions 1,3,5)  
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Letters we have not tested yet and are still candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need a 5-letter English word:
- T in position 4  
- Contains O but not in position 2  
- Uses only the remaining candidate letters  

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ T _ and containing O elsewhere:

- B O R T Y → but Y not yet ruled out; but R and Y still possible  
- P O R T S → but S already ruled out  
- C O R P T → not valid  
- W O R T H → H and W still possible  
- F O R T Y → F, R, Y allowed  
- C O R T E → E ruled out  
- G O R T Y → G, R, T, Y allowed but “GORTY” is not a valid English word  
- P O R T Y → P, O, R, T, Y allowed, and “PORTY” is slang but not a common dictionary word  
- F O R T Y → “FORTY” is a valid English word, uses F, O, R, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out except T is known in position 4, and O can’t be in position 2 (in FORTY it’s position 2—so invalid).

O must not be in position 2, so we need O in position 1, 3, or 5.

Words with T in position 4 and O not in position 2:
- _ O _ T _ → e.g., “ROOTY” but O repeated, and R, Y allowed  
- _ _ O T _ → e.g., “COOTY” invalid  
- _ _ _ T O → e.g., “BIGTO” invalid  
- “NORTH” but N is ruled out  
- “WORTH” W, O, R, T, H → O is position 2—invalid  
- “HOTCH” but T not in position 4  
- “POOTY” invalid  
- “GOTHI” invalid  
- “ROBOT” but T in 5th, not 4th  
- “DITTO” T in 4th, O in 5th, D, I, T, O allowed → “DITTO” fits all clues.

Check DITTO:
- Letters: D, I, T, T, O  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- D and I have not been used nor ruled out  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, E, M, U, N) appear  
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, DITTO is a strong next guess.

   - POTTY feedback shows T in positions 3 and 4 both marked (-) and (✓) respectively.  
     – Position 3 T(-) means T is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
     – Position 4 T(✓) confirms T **is** in position 4.  
   Therefore the second T cannot be in position 3, and cannot be in position 4 (already taken).  
   So second T must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

2. All failed letters so far:
   S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I, P, Y are **not** in the word.

3. O is in the word but may **not** appear in positions 2 or 5 (from MOUNT and POTTY feedback).  
   Therefore O must appear in position 1 or 3.  
   But position 3 can’t be O if it must be T (but we just ruled T out of 3).  
   So position 3 is **not** T, and is **not** O (because O is only allowed in 1 or 3, and 3 is available). Wait reread: O is allowed in 3 because the feedback only said O(-) meaning NOT in its *original* positions. From DITTO O(-) meant not in position 5, from MOUNT O(-) meant not in position 2. So O can be in position 1 or 3.

4. Combining:
   We need a 5-letter English word fitting one of these two patterns:
   - T _ O T _   (second T in position 4, O in 3, extra T in 1) → T T O T ? (five letters only) — impossible, would require six letters.
   - O _ _ T T   (O in 1, second T in 5) → word like O X X T T
   - _ O _ T T   (O in 2, second T in 5) — but O is forbidden in 2 (from MOUNT feedback O(-) in 2). So this is invalid.
   - T O _ T _   (T in 1, O in 2, T in 4) — but O is forbidden in 2. Invalid.
   - O _ T T _   (O in 1, T in 3-4) — but T in 3 is forbidden. Invalid.

Wait, I need a pattern with exactly **two T’s**, one fixed at position 4, the other in position 1, 2, or 5, and O in 1 or 3 (but 3 is ruled out for T, but OK for O). So two viable patterns remain:

A. T _ O T _  → impossible, because we only have five slots and already have T at 4, so T _ O T _ would require T at 1 and 4, total two, which is OK.  
   Example word: T W O T ?? Doesn’t exist.

B. _ O _ T T  → but O in 2 is forbidden.  Invalid.

C. O _ _ T T  → O in 1, two T’s at 4 and 5.  This fits all constraints.

So the only possible pattern is O _ _ T T.

Possible letters for gaps (from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z and O already placed in 1).

Looking for real 5-letter English words: O _ _ T T.

Check dictionary:
- OBOTT – invalid
- ORATT – invalid
- OFTTT – invalid
- … scanning reveals **OTT** root, but that would repeat T.

Actually the only valid English word that fits O _ _ T T and uses allowed letters is **OFTTT** (no). There is **no standard word** matching O _ _ T T.

Wait, step back: pattern O _ _ T T has two T’s (positions 4,5), O in 1. Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Real word: **OFTTT** invalid, **ORBTT** invalid, **OCHTT** invalid… none exist.

Therefore the second T must be in position 2.

Pattern: _ T _ T _  (T in 2 and 4), O must go in 1 or 3.  
O(-) only means “not in original positions” (2,5).  So O may be in 1,3,4.  But 4 is T, so 1 or 3.

Candidate patterns:
- O T _ T _  → O in 1, T in 2 and 4
- _ T O T _  → O in 3, T in 2 and 4

Check real words:
1. O T _ T _ :  
   OTTER – but E is banned  
   OTTAH – invalid  
2. _ T O T _ :  
   C T O T _ – C allowed, but C T O T ?  
   Only “STOTT” uses S (banned)  
   “CTOTT” invalid  

Real word **STOTT** invalid (S banned). **FTOTT** invalid.

Next candidate: **B T O T _** invalid.

Real valid word: **B T O T H**? No, H allowed, but T in 4, O in 3, B in 1, remaining letter H in 5.  
Word: **BTOTH** invalid.

Actually, let me re-examine: the word **COTTA** has two T’s but A is banned.

Another candidate: **HTOTT** invalid.

It appears the only viable pattern left is **OTT** something, but I missed **OTT** with two T’s. Actually the valid word is:

**OTT** + 2 letters: **OTT??** no.

Wait, I realize: real English word **OTT** is 3 letters. There is **OTTER** but E banned.

Upon more careful search, the only valid 5-letter English word that has exactly two T’s (positions 2 and 4) and an O in position 1 or 3, and avoids all banned letters is:

**B T O T H** invalid, **C T O T H** invalid.

Turns out **""BTO""** is invalid.

Let me list remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Try pattern: C T O T _ → **CTOTG** invalid, **CTOTY** (Y banned), **CTOTZ** invalid.

No valid word found.

Next pattern: O T _ T _ → **OTFTT** invalid, **OTHTT** invalid.

I have exhausted patterns. Therefore my earlier assumption must be corrected: the word does NOT necessarily have two T’s. The feedback rules are per-guess, not absolute counts.

Re-examining DITTO:  
D(x) I(x) T(-) T(✓) O(-)  
means:
- T is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
So only one T exists, not two. Previous conclusion about two T’s was wrong.

Therefore we simply have:
- T in position 4 (✓)  
- O in the word, banned from positions 2,5 (from MOUNT & POTTY)  
- Letters banned: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I, P, Y

So pattern: _ _ _ T _  
O must appear in position 1, 3 (not 2,5)  
Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ T _ with O in 1 or 3:

- O _ _ T _ : O R B O T → **ORBOT** invalid  
- O _ _ T _ : **OFTBY** invalid  
- _ _ O T _ : **BROTH** – but H allowed, B, R, O, T, H, all allowed?  
  Ruled letters: none of B, R, O, T, H are banned.  
  Word: **BROTH** – valid 5-letter English word.  
  Pattern: _ _ O T _ → matches _ _ _ T _ with O in 3.

Check BROTH against all constraints:
- T is in position 4 ✓  
- O is in position 3 (allowed)  
- Letters used: B, R, O, T, H – none are in the banned list  
- Word is valid.

Therefore the next guess is BROTH.

<guess>BROTH</guess>",BROTH,"Let me extract every absolute constraint we have so far.

1. Pattern after 4 guesses:
   - Position 4 is always T(✓) → _ _ _ T _
   - Two T’s total ⇒ second T must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
   - POTTY feedback shows T in positions 3 and 4 both marked (-) and (✓) respectively.  
     – Position 3 T(-) means T is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
     – Position 4 T(✓) confirms T **is** in position 4.  
   Therefore the second T cannot be in position 3, and cannot be in position 4 (already taken).  
   So second T must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

2. All failed letters so far:
   S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I, P, Y are **not** in the word.

3. O is in the word but may **not** appear in positions 2 or 5 (from MOUNT and POTTY feedback).  
   Therefore O must appear in position 1 or 3.  
   But position 3 can’t be O if it must be T (but we just ruled T out of 3).  
   So position 3 is **not** T, and is **not** O (because O is only allowed in 1 or 3, and 3 is available). Wait reread: O is allowed in 3 because the feedback only said O(-) meaning NOT in its *original* positions. From DITTO O(-) meant not in position 5, from MOUNT O(-) meant not in position 2. So O can be in position 1 or 3.

4. Combining:

   - T O _ T _   (T in 1, O in 2, T in 4) — but O is forbidden in 2. Invalid.
   - O _ T T _   (O in 1, T in 3-4) — but T in 3 is forbidden. Invalid.

Wait, I need a pattern with exactly **two T’s**, one fixed at position 4, the other in position 1, 2, or 5, and O in 1 or 3 (but 3 is ruled out for T, but OK for O). So two viable patterns remain:

B. _ O _ T T  → but O in 2 is forbidden.  Invalid.

C. O _ _ T T  → O in 1, two T’s at 4 and 5.  This fits all constraints.

Re-examining DITTO:  
D(x) I(x) T(-) T(✓) O(-)  
means:
- T is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
So only one T exists, not two. Previous conclusion about two T’s was wrong.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good first guess should have frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- L (moderately common consonant)

This gives good coverage across common letters without repeating any letters, which helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has T as its 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
2. No S, L, A, or E appear anywhere in the word.

I now want to test other common letters while respecting these constraints. A good next guess is “MOUNT”:
- It contains T in the 4th spot.
- It introduces the vowels O, U and consonants M, N.
- None of the letters S, L, A, E are used.

<guess>MOUNT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the latest feedback on MOUNT:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word  
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word  
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (contradicting the earlier certainty that T is in position 4 from SLATE).  

Wait—let’s re-check:

From SLATE we were told T(✓) which means T is in the word AND in position 4.  
From MOUNT we are told T(-) which means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
These two clues are compatible: T is indeed in position 4, so it is not in position 5—no contradiction.

Confirmed facts:
1. T is fixed in position 4: _ _ _ T _  
2. O is somewhere else (positions 1,3,5)  
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, M, U, N

Letters we have not tested yet and are still candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need a 5-letter English word:
- T in position 4  
- Contains O but not in position 2  
- Uses only the remaining candidate letters  

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ T _ and containing O elsewhere:

- B O R T Y → but Y not yet ruled out; but R and Y still possible  
- P O R T S → but S already ruled out  
- C O R P T → not valid  
- W O R T H → H and W still possible  
- F O R T Y → F, R, Y allowed  
- C O R T E → E ruled out  
- G O R T Y → G, R, T, Y allowed but “GORTY” is not a valid English word  
- P O R T Y → P, O, R, T, Y allowed, and “PORTY” is slang but not a common dictionary word  
- F O R T Y → “FORTY” is a valid English word, uses F, O, R, T, Y, none of which have been ruled out except T is known in position 4, and O can’t be in position 2 (in FORTY it’s position 2—so invalid).

O must not be in position 2, so we need O in position 1, 3, or 5.

Words with T in position 4 and O not in position 2:
- _ O _ T _ → e.g., “ROOTY” but O repeated, and R, Y allowed  
- _ _ O T _ → e.g., “COOTY” invalid  
- _ _ _ T O → e.g., “BIGTO” invalid  
- “NORTH” but N is ruled out  
- “WORTH” W, O, R, T, H → O is position 2—invalid  
- “HOTCH” but T not in position 4  
- “POOTY” invalid  
- “GOTHI” invalid  
- “ROBOT” but T in 5th, not 4th  
- “DITTO” T in 4th, O in 5th, D, I, T, O allowed → “DITTO” fits all clues.

Check DITTO:
- Letters: D, I, T, T, O  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- D and I have not been used nor ruled out  
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, E, M, U, N) appear  
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, DITTO is a strong next guess.

Guess 3: DITTO -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) T(-) T(✓) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have three pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → T is in position 4 (✓) and S, L, A, E are not in the word.
2. MOUNT → T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) and O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-); M, U, N are not in the word.
3. DITTO → T is in position 4 (✓) (consistent!) but also appears in position 3 (-) … meaning the word contains T twice: one in position 4 and another T elsewhere; also O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-); D and I are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ T T _  (because we must have two T’s with one fixed at position 4 and the other at position 3)
- Letters NOT allowed anywhere: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I
- O must appear in either position 1, 2, or 3 (it cannot be in 2 because position 3 is now T)

Given the pattern _ _ T T _ the only possible place for O is position 1 or 2.

Valid English 5-letter words matching _ _ T T _ that only use the remaining allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O):

- COTTY – C, O, T, T, Y (C, O, T, Y are allowed)
- POTTY – P, O, T, T, Y (all allowed)
- WITTY – I is not allowed
- BATTY – A is not allowed
- FATTY – A is not allowed
- HUTTY – U is not allowed
- RATTY – A is not allowed

Only COTTY and POTTY satisfy every constraint. Between them, POTTY is more common.

Let’s guess POTTY.

Guess 4: POTTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) T(-) T(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me extract every absolute constraint we have so far.

1. Pattern after 4 guesses:
   - Position 4 is always T(✓) → _ _ _ T _
   - Two T’s total ⇒ second T must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
   - POTTY feedback shows T in positions 3 and 4 both marked (-) and (✓) respectively.  
     – Position 3 T(-) means T is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
     – Position 4 T(✓) confirms T **is** in position 4.  
   Therefore the second T cannot be in position 3, and cannot be in position 4 (already taken).  
   So second T must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

2. All failed letters so far:
   S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I, P, Y are **not** in the word.

3. O is in the word but may **not** appear in positions 2 or 5 (from MOUNT and POTTY feedback).  
   Therefore O must appear in position 1 or 3.  
   But position 3 can’t be O if it must be T (but we just ruled T out of 3).  
   So position 3 is **not** T, and is **not** O (because O is only allowed in 1 or 3, and 3 is available). Wait reread: O is allowed in 3 because the feedback only said O(-) meaning NOT in its *original* positions. From DITTO O(-) meant not in position 5, from MOUNT O(-) meant not in position 2. So O can be in position 1 or 3.

4. Combining:
   We need a 5-letter English word fitting one of these two patterns:
   - T _ O T _   (second T in position 4, O in 3, extra T in 1) → T T O T ? (five letters only) — impossible, would require six letters.
   - O _ _ T T   (O in 1, second T in 5) → word like O X X T T
   - _ O _ T T   (O in 2, second T in 5) — but O is forbidden in 2 (from MOUNT feedback O(-) in 2). So this is invalid.
   - T O _ T _   (T in 1, O in 2, T in 4) — but O is forbidden in 2. Invalid.
   - O _ T T _   (O in 1, T in 3-4) — but T in 3 is forbidden. Invalid.

Wait, I need a pattern with exactly **two T’s**, one fixed at position 4, the other in position 1, 2, or 5, and O in 1 or 3 (but 3 is ruled out for T, but OK for O). So two viable patterns remain:

A. T _ O T _  → impossible, because we only have five slots and already have T at 4, so T _ O T _ would require T at 1 and 4, total two, which is OK.  
   Example word: T W O T ?? Doesn’t exist.

B. _ O _ T T  → but O in 2 is forbidden.  Invalid.

C. O _ _ T T  → O in 1, two T’s at 4 and 5.  This fits all constraints.

So the only possible pattern is O _ _ T T.

Possible letters for gaps (from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z and O already placed in 1).

Looking for real 5-letter English words: O _ _ T T.

Check dictionary:
- OBOTT – invalid
- ORATT – invalid
- OFTTT – invalid
- … scanning reveals **OTT** root, but that would repeat T.

Actually the only valid English word that fits O _ _ T T and uses allowed letters is **OFTTT** (no). There is **no standard word** matching O _ _ T T.

Wait, step back: pattern O _ _ T T has two T’s (positions 4,5), O in 1. Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Real word: **OFTTT** invalid, **ORBTT** invalid, **OCHTT** invalid… none exist.

Therefore the second T must be in position 2.

Pattern: _ T _ T _  (T in 2 and 4), O must go in 1 or 3.  
O(-) only means “not in original positions” (2,5).  So O may be in 1,3,4.  But 4 is T, so 1 or 3.

Candidate patterns:
- O T _ T _  → O in 1, T in 2 and 4
- _ T O T _  → O in 3, T in 2 and 4

Check real words:
1. O T _ T _ :  
   OTTER – but E is banned  
   OTTAH – invalid  
2. _ T O T _ :  
   C T O T _ – C allowed, but C T O T ?  
   Only “STOTT” uses S (banned)  
   “CTOTT” invalid  

Real word **STOTT** invalid (S banned). **FTOTT** invalid.

Next candidate: **B T O T _** invalid.

Real valid word: **B T O T H**? No, H allowed, but T in 4, O in 3, B in 1, remaining letter H in 5.  
Word: **BTOTH** invalid.

Actually, let me re-examine: the word **COTTA** has two T’s but A is banned.

Another candidate: **HTOTT** invalid.

It appears the only viable pattern left is **OTT** something, but I missed **OTT** with two T’s. Actually the valid word is:

**OTT** + 2 letters: **OTT??** no.

Wait, I realize: real English word **OTT** is 3 letters. There is **OTTER** but E banned.

Upon more careful search, the only valid 5-letter English word that has exactly two T’s (positions 2 and 4) and an O in position 1 or 3, and avoids all banned letters is:

**B T O T H** invalid, **C T O T H** invalid.

Turns out **""BTO""** is invalid.

Let me list remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Try pattern: C T O T _ → **CTOTG** invalid, **CTOTY** (Y banned), **CTOTZ** invalid.

No valid word found.

Next pattern: O T _ T _ → **OTFTT** invalid, **OTHTT** invalid.

I have exhausted patterns. Therefore my earlier assumption must be corrected: the word does NOT necessarily have two T’s. The feedback rules are per-guess, not absolute counts.

Re-examining DITTO:  
D(x) I(x) T(-) T(✓) O(-)  
means:
- T is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
So only one T exists, not two. Previous conclusion about two T’s was wrong.

Therefore we simply have:
- T in position 4 (✓)  
- O in the word, banned from positions 2,5 (from MOUNT & POTTY)  
- Letters banned: S, L, A, E, M, U, N, D, I, P, Y

So pattern: _ _ _ T _  
O must appear in position 1, 3 (not 2,5)  
Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Candidate words fitting _ _ _ T _ with O in 1 or 3:

- O _ _ T _ : O R B O T → **ORBOT** invalid  
- O _ _ T _ : **OFTBY** invalid  
- _ _ O T _ : **BROTH** – but H allowed, B, R, O, T, H, all allowed?  
  Ruled letters: none of B, R, O, T, H are banned.  
  Word: **BROTH** – valid 5-letter English word.  
  Pattern: _ _ O T _ → matches _ _ _ T _ with O in 3.

Check BROTH against all constraints:
- T is in position 4 ✓  
- O is in position 3 (allowed)  
- Letters used: B, R, O, T, H – none are in the banned list  
- Word is valid.

Therefore the next guess is BROTH.
