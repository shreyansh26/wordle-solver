For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, helping us gather maximum information from the first guess.

So far, none of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all.  
That means we need a word that avoids those five letters entirely.  
We still have the other 21 letters of the alphabet to work with, so I’ll pick a fresh set that covers common remaining vowels and consonants.  
Good “second-guess” letters that weren’t used yet include R, O, U, I, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc.  
A balanced choice is “ROUND”:  
- R and N are frequent consonants.  
- O and U are common vowels.  
- D is also reasonably common.  
None of these letters conflict with the known exclusions (S, L, A, T, E).

We already know:
- Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D
- Letters confirmed to be in the word but not yet in the correct spot: R, O (both appear somewhere, but not where they were placed in ROUND)

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, (sometimes Y)

We need a fresh 5-letter word that uses R and O somewhere inside it, avoids every letter listed above as “ruled out,” and ideally tests new letters to narrow the search quickly.

A good candidate is “CROWM” – but that’s not a common word.  
A better, valid word is “CHIRP,” but it lacks O.  
Next, “PRIMO” – contains both R and O, uses P, I, M which are still possible, and skips every excluded letter. However, O is in position 3 again, and in ROUND it was position 2, so we need to move O to another spot to test new positions.

Another valid word is “PRION” – but N is already excluded.  
“CHORD” – uses D and U which are out.  
“GRIOT” – uses T which is out.  
“FROCK” – uses C and K, both still allowed, and moves R and O to new positions.

So FROCK:
- R in position 2 (was in 1)  
- O in position 3 (was in 2)  
- F, C, K are entirely new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- No letter appears that we already know is absent.

Therefore, FROCK is a solid next guess.

- So far we know: _ R O _ _

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, G, H, I, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  … plus any vowels not yet excluded.
Remaining vowels we can still use: I, (sometimes Y)

We need a 5-letter word in the pattern _ R O _ _ that uses only the still-allowed letters and preferably tests new ones.  Candidate words:
- B R O W N → N ruled out
- G R O W N → N ruled out
- P R O W L → L ruled out
- B R O K E → K, E ruled out
- G R O M Y → valid letters: G, R, O, M, Y; G, M, Y are still allowed
- P R O G Y → not a common word
- B R O I N → I is allowed, N is not
- P R O I M → not a word
- M R O W L → not a word
- P R O B E → B, E allowed?  E is ruled out
- B R O W N → N ruled out
- G R O I N → N ruled out
- B R O I D → D ruled out

One valid dictionary word that fits is “GROVY” — but “GROVY” is not standard.  
Next check “PROXY” — uses P, R, O, X, Y.  X is still allowed (never tested), Y is allowed.  It fits the pattern _ R O _ _ and contains only allowed letters.

Therefore, PROXY is our next guess.
