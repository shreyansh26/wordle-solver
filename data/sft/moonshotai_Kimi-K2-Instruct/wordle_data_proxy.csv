Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word contains common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Popular choices include words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, and L.

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the mystery word.  
Since we’ve just eliminated five of the most common letters, we now need a word that avoids those letters entirely and still uses other frequent letters to maximize new information.

Good consonants still in play include R, N, C, H, B, M, D, G, K, P, F, etc.  
Good vowels still in play include O, I, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that uses three of those remaining vowels plus two common consonants is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D  
This gives us coverage of three new vowels and two new consonants, none of which were in SLATE. That should tell us a lot on the next turn.

To maximize coverage while staying valid, let’s pick two common unused consonants.  
Good choices include K and M, giving the word KMOR_ but we need a valid English word.

KMOR_ isn’t valid.  
Another option: P and M → PMOR_ (still invalid).  
Let’s try M and W → M W O R _  → MWOR_ isn’t a word either.

Valid 5-letter words that fit _ _ O R _ and use only the remaining letters:
- FROST  – but F and S/T already ruled out.  
- WORDY  – but D and I ruled out.  
- GORGE  – G and G, but second G also ruled out.  
- VROOM – V, R, O, O, M – but O is already in position 3 and second O is allowed, but R must be in position 4. VROOM has R in position 4, which fits.  
- WORRY – but second R is not confirmed, and Y is allowed.

VROOM fits:
- V – new letter  
- R – fixed in position 4  
- O – fixed in position 3  
- O – second O allowed (not ruled out)  
- M – new letter  

So VROOM is valid and gives us maximal new information.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,proxy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word contains common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Popular choices include words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, and L.

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the mystery word.  
Since we’ve just eliminated five of the most common letters, we now need a word that avoids those letters entirely and still uses other frequent letters to maximize new information.

Good consonants still in play include R, N, C, H, B, M, D, G, K, P, F, etc.  
Good vowels still in play include O, I, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that uses three of those remaining vowels plus two common consonants is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D  
This gives us coverage of three new vowels and two new consonants, none of which were in SLATE. That should tell us a lot on the next turn.

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
  – R (somewhere, but not first)
  – O (somewhere, but not second)

Remaining vowels still in play: I, O (already confirmed), Y (sometimes counted as vowel).  
Strong remaining consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, R (confirmed), W, Y, B (but B wasn’t used yet).

We have 5 slots and must place:
- R in one of positions 2-5
- O in one of positions 1,3-5 (cannot be 2nd)

We also need three more “safe” consonants (from the unused set) plus possibly another vowel.

A good covering word that uses R and O in new positions plus three fresh common consonants is “CHORI”:
- C, H, O, R, I
  – O is now in position 3 (allowed).
  – R is now in position 4 (allowed).
  – C, H, I are all new letters we haven’t tried yet.

That should maximize information about these new letters while re-using our two confirmed letters in new spots.

What we now know:

1. Letters ruled out entirely: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, C, H, I, V, M.  
2. From ROUND: R is in the word but not in position 1.  
3. From CHORI: O is in position 3 → pattern _ _ O _ _.  
4. From VROOM: R is now fixed in position 2 (✓), so pattern becomes _ R O _ _.  
5. From VROOM: the second O (in position 4) is wrong (-) → position 4 ≠ O.  
   Therefore the second O must appear somewhere else (only possible left is position 1 or 5, but position 3 is already O).  
   Therefore the word has two O’s: one at position 3 and one at position 5.  
   Pattern so far: _ R O _ O.

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (not yet tested and not ruled out):  
B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ R O _ O.

Possible candidates:
- BROOD – B and D: D is ruled out.  
- FRODO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROCO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROPO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROSO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROTO – G, T, but T is ruled out.  
- KROKO – doesn’t exist.  
- PROBO – doesn’t exist.  
- PROSO – P, S, but S is ruled out.  
- GROBO – doesn’t exist.  

Only real candidate left is GROOV – but this isn’t a word.  
Checking again: “GROOF” is not a word, “GROOV” is not a word, “GROOK” is not a word.  
Wait, “GROOV” is not valid, but “GROOF” doesn’t fit.

Let me list valid dictionary words ending with “…RO _O” or “_ R O _ O”.

Valid English 5-letter words matching _ R O _ O:
- BROOD – denied (D ruled out)  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROOK – not standard  
- PROOF – P, O, O, F all allowed.  

PROOF fits the pattern:

P (position 1) – unused and allowed  
R (position 2) – correct from feedback  
O (position 3) – confirmed  
O (position 4) – we had feedback that O was in position 3 only, but we inferred that the second O must be at 5.  
Wait, let’s re-examine:

We deduced the pattern must be _ R O _ O because the second O must be at 5 (cannot be 4, and 3 is already filled).  
A valid 5-letter word matching _ R O _ O is GROPO – doesn’t exist.  
But “GROOF” is not a word.

Another valid word is “BROOD” – but D is out.  
“GROOK” is not valid.  
“FRODO” is not valid.  
“GROPO” not valid.  

Let’s check the exact pattern again: _ R O _ O.  
Only real word is “GROOF” but it’s uncommon.  
After careful dictionary check, “GROOF” is not standard, but “GROOK” is not either.

However, “BROOK” – B, R, O, O, K.  
This fits positions 1,2,3,4,5 as B R O O K. But O in position 4 is not allowed as per feedback.

Wait, let’s re-confirm.

From VROOM feedback:
V(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) M(x)  
This means:
- R is in position 2 (✓).  
- O is in position 3 (✓).  
- O in position 4 is wrong (-), so no other O at 4.  

Thus the pattern is _ R O _ _ with no second O required.  
We previously inferred two O’s, but feedback only confirmed one O at position 3.  
So we need only one O at position 3.

Therefore pattern: _ R O _ _  
Positions 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching _ R O _ _:

- BROWN – N is out  
- GROPE – G, P, E: E is out  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROOK – not standard  
- GROOM – M is out  
- GROOP – P is allowed  
- GROUT – T is out  
- PROOF – P, O, O, F: second O at 4 is fine (we don’t have restriction against 4th position O except from VROOM feedback that O in position 4 is wrong for that word, but doesn’t restrict it entirely) – but we have O at 3 already.  
Wait, PROOF is P R O O F. This has O at 4, which feedback said was wrong in VROOM, but does not prevent it here. However, we have O already at 3. So PROOF has two O’s, which is allowed as long as one is at 3 and other is at 4. But VROOM feedback only said O at 4 for VROOM was wrong, not globally.  

But earlier, we know O is at position 3 only for the word. So PROOF is not valid because it has O at 3 and 4, but we only have one O confirmed at 3.

Actually, the word could have only one O at position 3. Then positions 1, 4, 5 must be other letters.

Valid single-O words matching _ R O _ _:

- BROOM – M is out  
- GRODY – D is out  
- GROKS – isn’t a word  
- GROIN – I is out  
- GROPE – P, E: E is out  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROWN – N is out  
- GROWS – S is out  
- PROBE – B, E: E is out  
- PROOF – F, but has second O which we may not have  
- PROPS – S is out  
- PROUD – D is out  
- PROWL – L is out  
- PROWS – S is out  
- GROOF – invalid  
- GROOK – invalid  
- GROOP – P, but has second O  

Actually, the only valid word left is GROPE (G R O P E), but E is ruled out.  
Similarly, GROOF is not standard.

Let me list again the remaining allowed letters:  
Positions: 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from {B, F, G, K, P, W, Y}.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with no reused letters:

- GROCK – C is out  
- GROKS – invalid  
- GROOF – invalid  
- GROOM – M is out  
- GROOP – P is allowed, but has second O  
- GROPE – E is out  
- GROPY – Y is allowed: G R O P Y – valid word  
- PROBE – E is out  
- PROCK – invalid  
- PROFS – S is out  
- PROGS – S is out  
- PROKE – E is out  
- PROMO – M is out  
- PROOF – F, but has second O  
- PROOS – S is out  
- PROPS – S is out  
- PROSY – S is out  
- PROUD – D is out  
- PROWL – L is out  
- PROWS – S is out  
- GROPY – valid  

GROPY: G R O P Y  
- G, P, Y are all allowed and unused.  
- R is at 2, O at 3, rest fit.

This seems to be the only valid word left.

Therefore, the next guess is GROPY.

V(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) M(x)  
This means:
- R is in position 2 (✓).  
- O is in position 3 (✓).  
- O in position 4 is wrong (-), so no other O at 4.  

Thus the pattern is _ R O _ _ with no second O required.  
We previously inferred two O’s, but feedback only confirmed one O at position 3.  
So we need only one O at position 3.

Therefore pattern: _ R O _ _  
Positions 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching _ R O _ _:

- BROWN – N is out  
- GROPE – G, P, E: E is out  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROOK – not standard  
- GROOM – M is out  
- GROOP – P is allowed  
- GROUT – T is out  
- PROOF – P, O, O, F: second O at 4 is fine (we don’t have restriction against 4th position O except from VROOM feedback that O in position 4 is wrong for that word, but doesn’t restrict it entirely) – but we have O at 3 already.  
Wait, PROOF is P R O O F. This has O at 4, which feedback said was wrong in VROOM, but does not prevent it here. However, we have O already at 3. So PROOF has two O’s, which is allowed as long as one is at 3 and other is at 4. But VROOM feedback only said O at 4 for VROOM was wrong, not globally.  

But earlier, we know O is at position 3 only for the word. So PROOF is not valid because it has O at 3 and 4, but we only have one O confirmed at 3.

Actually, the word could have only one O at position 3. Then positions 1, 4, 5 must be other letters.

Valid single-O words matching _ R O _ _:

- BROOM – M is out  
- GRODY – D is out  
- GROKS – isn’t a word  
- GROIN – I is out  
- GROPE – P, E: E is out  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROWN – N is out  
- GROWS – S is out  
- PROBE – B, E: E is out  
- PROOF – F, but has second O which we may not have  
- PROPS – S is out  
- PROUD – D is out  
- PROWL – L is out  
- PROWS – S is out  
- GROOF – invalid  
- GROOK – invalid  
- GROOP – P, but has second O  

Actually, the only valid word left is GROPE (G R O P E), but E is ruled out.  
Similarly, GROOF is not standard.

Let me list again the remaining allowed letters:  
Positions: 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from {B, F, G, K, P, W, Y}.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ _ with no reused letters:

- GROCK – C is out  
- GROKS – invalid  
- GROOF – invalid  
- GROOM – M is out  
- GROOP – P is allowed, but has second O  
- GROPE – E is out  
- GROPY – Y is allowed: G R O P Y – valid word  
- PROBE – E is out  
- PROCK – invalid  
- PROFS – S is out

- PROPS – S is out  
- PROSY – S is out  
- PROUD – D is out  
- PROWL – L is out  
- PROWS – S is out  
- GROPY – valid  

GROPY: G R O P Y  
- G, P, Y are all allowed and unused.  
- R is at 2, O at 3, rest fit.

This seems to be the only valid word left.

Therefore, the next guess is GROPY.",Guess 5: GROPY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(-) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,proxy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word contains common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Popular choices include words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, and L.

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word and will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “SLATE” (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the mystery word.  
Since we’ve just eliminated five of the most common letters, we now need a word that avoids those letters entirely and still uses other frequent letters to maximize new information.

Good consonants still in play include R, N, C, H, B, M, D, G, K, P, F, etc.  
Good vowels still in play include O, I, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced word that uses three of those remaining vowels plus two common consonants is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D  
This gives us coverage of three new vowels and two new consonants, none of which were in SLATE. That should tell us a lot on the next turn.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
  – R (somewhere, but not first)
  – O (somewhere, but not second)

Remaining vowels still in play: I, O (already confirmed), Y (sometimes counted as vowel).  
Strong remaining consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, R (confirmed), W, Y, B (but B wasn’t used yet).

We have 5 slots and must place:
- R in one of positions 2-5
- O in one of positions 1,3-5 (cannot be 2nd)

We also need three more “safe” consonants (from the unused set) plus possibly another vowel.

A good covering word that uses R and O in new positions plus three fresh common consonants is “CHORI”:
- C, H, O, R, I
  – O is now in position 3 (allowed).
  – R is now in position 4 (allowed).
  – C, H, I are all new letters we haven’t tried yet.

That should maximize information about these new letters while re-using our two confirmed letters in new spots.

<guess>CHORI</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: CHORI -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(-) I(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
1. The word does NOT contain: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, C, H, I  
2. The letter O is in the word (✓) and is in the correct position: position 3  
   Therefore the pattern is: _ _ O _ _  
3. The letter R is in the word (-) but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from the feedback in ROUND and CHORI).  
   That leaves only position 4 for R: _ _ O R _

So far we know: _ _ O R _

Remaining unused letters (from the untouched set): B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus vowels Y.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2 that haven’t been tried yet.  
To maximize coverage while staying valid, let’s pick two common unused consonants.  
Good choices include K and M, giving the word KMOR_ but we need a valid English word.

KMOR_ isn’t valid.  
Another option: P and M → PMOR_ (still invalid).  
Let’s try M and W → M W O R _  → MWOR_ isn’t a word either.

Valid 5-letter words that fit _ _ O R _ and use only the remaining letters:
- FROST  – but F and S/T already ruled out.  
- WORDY  – but D and I ruled out.  
- GORGE  – G and G, but second G also ruled out.  
- VROOM – V, R, O, O, M – but O is already in position 3 and second O is allowed, but R must be in position 4. VROOM has R in position 4, which fits.  
- WORRY – but second R is not confirmed, and Y is allowed.

VROOM fits:
- V – new letter  
- R – fixed in position 4  
- O – fixed in position 3  
- O – second O allowed (not ruled out)  
- M – new letter  

So VROOM is valid and gives us maximal new information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. Letters ruled out entirely: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, C, H, I, V, M.  
2. From ROUND: R is in the word but not in position 1.  
3. From CHORI: O is in position 3 → pattern _ _ O _ _.  
4. From VROOM: R is now fixed in position 2 (✓), so pattern becomes _ R O _ _.  
5. From VROOM: the second O (in position 4) is wrong (-) → position 4 ≠ O.  
   Therefore the second O must appear somewhere else (only possible left is position 1 or 5, but position 3 is already O).  
   Therefore the word has two O’s: one at position 3 and one at position 5.  
   Pattern so far: _ R O _ O.

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (not yet tested and not ruled out):  
B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ R O _ O.

Possible candidates:
- BROOD – B and D: D is ruled out.  
- FRODO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROCO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROPO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROSO – doesn’t exist.  
- GROTO – G, T, but T is ruled out.  
- KROKO – doesn’t exist.  
- PROBO – doesn’t exist.  
- PROSO – P, S, but S is ruled out.  
- GROBO – doesn’t exist.  

Only real candidate left is GROOV – but this isn’t a word.  
Checking again: “GROOF” is not a word, “GROOV” is not a word, “GROOK” is not a word.  
Wait, “GROOV” is not valid, but “GROOF” doesn’t fit.

Let me list valid dictionary words ending with “…RO _O” or “_ R O _ O”.

Valid English 5-letter words matching _ R O _ O:
- BROOD – denied (D ruled out)  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROOK – not standard  
- PROOF – P, O, O, F all allowed.  

PROOF fits the pattern:

P (position 1) – unused and allowed  
R (position 2) – correct from feedback  
O (position 3) – confirmed  
O (position 4) – we had feedback that O was in position 3 only, but we inferred that the second O must be at 5.  
Wait, let’s re-examine:

We deduced the pattern must be _ R O _ O because the second O must be at 5 (cannot be 4, and 3 is already filled).  
A valid 5-letter word matching _ R O _ O is GROPO – doesn’t exist.  
But “GROOF” is not a word.

Another valid word is “BROOD” – but D is out.  
“GROOK” is not valid.  
“FRODO” is not valid.  
“GROPO” not valid.  

Let’s check the exact pattern again: _ R O _ O.  
Only real word is “GROOF” but it’s uncommon.  
After careful dictionary check, “GROOF” is not standard, but “GROOK” is not either.

However, “BROOK” – B, R, O, O, K.  
This fits positions 1,2,3,4,5 as B R O O K. But O in position 4 is not allowed as per feedback.

Wait, let’s re-confirm.

From VROOM feedback:
V(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) M(x)  
This means:
- R is in position 2 (✓).  
- O is in position 3 (✓).  
- O in position 4 is wrong (-), so no other O at 4.  

Thus the pattern is _ R O _ _ with no second O required.  
We previously inferred two O’s, but feedback only confirmed one O at position 3.  
So we need only one O at position 3.

Therefore pattern: _ R O _ _  
Positions 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching _ R O _ _:

- BROWN – N is out  
- GROPE – G, P, E: E is out  
- GROOF – not standard  
- GROOK – not standard  
- GROOM – M is out  
- GROOP – P is allowed  
- GROUT – T is out  
- PROOF – P, O, O, F: second O at 4 is fine (we don’t have restriction against 4th position O except from VROOM feedback that O in position 4 is wrong for that word, but doesn’t restrict it entirely) – but we have O at 3 already.  
Wait, PROOF is P R O O F. This has O at 4, which feedback said was wrong in VROOM, but does not prevent it here. However, we have O already at 3. So PROOF has two O’s, which is allowed as long as one is at 3 and other is at 4. But VROOM feedback only said O at 4 for VROOM was wrong, not globally.  

But earlier, we know O is at position 3 only for the word. So PROOF is not valid because it has O at 3 and 4, but we only have one O confirmed at 3.

Actually, the word could have only one O at position 3. Then positions 1, 4, 5 must be other letters.

Valid single-O words matching _ R O _ _:

From VROOM: the second O (in position 4) is wrong (-) → position 4 ≠ O.  \n   Therefore the second O must appear somewhere else (only possible left is position 1 or 5, but position 3 is already O).  \n   Therefore the word has two O’s: one at position 3 and one at position 5.  \n   Pattern so far: _ R O _ O.\n\nLetters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (not yet tested and not ruled out):  \nB, F, G, K, P, W, Y.\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ R O _ O.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- BROOD – B and D: D is ruled out.  \n- FRODO – doesn’t exist.  \n- GROCO – doesn’t exist.  \n- GROPO – doesn’t exist.  \n- GROSO – doesn’t exist.  \n- GROTO – G, T, but T is ruled out.  \n- KROKO – doesn’t exist.  \n- PROBO – doesn’t exist.  \n- PROSO – P, S, but S is ruled out.  \n- GROBO – doesn’t exist.  \n\nOnly real candidate left is GROOV – but this isn’t a word.  \nChecking again: “GROOF” is not a word, “GROOV” is not a word, “GROOK” is not a word.  \nWait, “GROOV” is not valid, but “GROOF” doesn’t fit.\n\nLet me list valid dictionary words ending with “…RO _O” or “_ R O _ O”.\n\nValid English 5-letter words matching _ R O _ O:\n- BROOD – denied (D ruled out)  \n- GROOF – not standard  \n- GROOK – not standard  \n- PROOF – P, O, O, F all allowed.  \n\nPROOF fits the pattern:\n\nP (position 1) – unused and allowed  \nR (position 2) – correct from feedback  \nO (position 3) – confirmed  \nO (position 4) – we had feedback that O was in position 3 only, but we inferred that the second O must be at 5.  \nWait, let’s re-examine:\n\nWe deduced the pattern must be _ R O _ O because the second O must be at 5 (cannot be 4, and 3 is already filled).  \nA valid 5-letter word matching _ R O _ O is GROPO – doesn’t exist.  \nBut “GROOF” is not a word.\n\nAnother valid word is “BROOD” – but D is out.  \n“GROOK” is not valid.  \n“FRODO” is not valid.  \n“GROPO” not valid.  \n\nLet’s check the exact pattern again: _ R O _ O.  \nOnly real word is “GROOF” but it’s uncommon.  \nAfter careful dictionary check, “GROOF” is not standard, but “GROOK” is not either.\n\nHowever, “BROOK” – B, R, O, O, K.  \nThis fits positions 1,2,3,4,5 as B R O O K. But O in position 4 is not allowed as per feedback.\n\nWait, let’s re-confirm.\n\nFrom VROOM feedback:\nV(x) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) M(x)  \nThis means:\n- R is in position 2 (✓).  \n- O is in position 3 (✓).  \n- O in position 4 is wrong (-), so no other O at 4.  \n\nThus the pattern is _ R O _ _ with no second O required.  \nWe previously inferred two O’s, but feedback only confirmed one O at position 3.  \nSo we need only one O at position 3.\n\nTherefore pattern: _ R O _ _  \nPositions 1, 4, 5 must be chosen from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, K, P, W, Y.\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words matching _ R O _ _:\n\n- BROWN – N is out  \n- GROPE – G, P, E: E is out  \n- GROOF – not standard  \n- GROOK – not standard  \n- GROOM – M is out  \n- GROOP – P is allowed  \n- GROUT – T is out  \n- PROOF – P, O, O, F: second O at 4 is fine (we don’t have restriction against 4th position O except from VROOM feedback that O in position 4 is wrong for that word, but doesn’t restrict it entirely) – but we have O at 3 already.  \nWait, PROOF is P R O O F. This has O at 4, which feedback said was wrong in VROOM, but does not prevent it here. However, we have O already at 3. So PROOF has two O’s, which is allowed as long as one is at 3 and other is at 4. But VROOM feedback only said O at 4 for VROOM was wrong, not globally.  \n\nBut earlier, we know O is at position 3 only for the word. So PROOF is not valid because it has O at 3 and 4, but we only have one O confirmed at 3.\n\nActually, the word could have only one O at position 3.

From the accumulated feedback:

Known pattern:  
- O is fixed at position 3 → _ _ O _ _  
- R is fixed at position 2 → _ R O _ _  
- Letters now ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, C, H, I, V, M, G, Y  
  (G and Y just ruled out by GROPY)

From GROPY feedback:  
- P in position 4 is wrong position (-) but IS in the word.  
  Therefore P must appear in position 1 or 5 (since 2,3,4 are already taken by R, O, and now-disqualified 4).

The only remaining unused letters (from the alphabet minus all eliminated ones) are: B, F, K, W (plus we have P to place).

We must form a valid 5-letter word matching: P R O P _  (P at 1, R at 2, O at 3, P at 5) but that would be “PROPP” – invalid.

Or _ R O _ P with P at 5.

Valid 5-letter English words fitting _ R O _ P using only remaining letters for position 1 and 4:

- B R O O P – P would be at 5, O already at 3 – word “BROOP” is invalid.  
- F R O O P – invalid.  
- K R O O P – invalid.  
- W R O O P – invalid.  

But we must use only remaining letters {B, F, K, W} plus P.  
The word “BROOK” has been considered before but contains O at 4 which is not forbidden (only O in 4 was wrong for VROOM, not globally).  
However, B, R, O, O, K are all allowed (K not yet used and not ruled out).  
“BROOK” is a valid English word and matches: B(1) R(2) O(3) O(4) K(5).  
None of these letters have been ruled out except D, etc. already excluded.

GROPY feedback said P(-) in position 4, which means P is in the word but not at 4.  
The word must therefore contain P, but the only possible position left is 1 or 5.  
Let’s try P at position 1: P R O _ _  
Allowed letters for 4 and 5: B, F, K, W (Y is out).  
Possible words:  
- P R O B E – E is out.  
- P R O F S – S is out.  
- P R O W L – L is out.  
- P R O B S – S is out.  

None of these fit.  
Next, P at position 5: _ R O _ P  
Possible words:  
- B R O O P – invalid.  
- B R O W P – invalid.  
- F R O W P – invalid.  
- K R O W P – invalid.  
- F R O S P – S is out.  

The only valid word left that fits _ R O _ P and uses only allowed letters is:

B R O W P – invalid.  
Wait, let’s list again.

Actually, from remaining letters {B, F, K, W} and P must be used once, and the pattern is _ R O _ P:

Valid words:  
- B R O W P – invalid.  
- F R O W P – invalid.  
- K R O W P – invalid.  

No valid word.  

Realizing: we have P must be in word, and positions 1 and 5 are the only options.  
Re-examining: the word must be _ R O _ P and P is at 5.  
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: B, F, K, W.  
Valid word: B R O O P is invalid.  
B R O W P invalid.  

But “BROOK” has two O’s and K, all allowed except P not present.  
However, P must appear in the word.  

Therefore, the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is “PROOF” which has P, R, O, O, F.  
But F is allowed (not ruled out), and the word is valid.  

Let’s verify:  
- P at 1 – new position  
- R at 2 – correct  
- O at 3 – correct  
- O at 4 – allowed (only O at 4 was wrong in VROOM, not globally)  
- F at 5 – allowed.  

So “PROOF” is the only valid word left that meets all constraints.
