Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words include those with common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes common vowels A, I, E
- It has common consonants R, S
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving good coverage

From MAVEN:
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word
- A(✓), V(✓), E(✓), N(✓) → A, V, E, N are all in their correct positions
So the pattern is now: _ A V E N

We still need one more letter in the first position, and we know it cannot be:
R, I, S, P, L, M (from earlier feedback)

Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for a valid 5-letter word of the form ? A V E N:
- BAVEN? Not a word
- CAVEN? Not a word
- DAVEN? Valid (as in ""to daven"")
- FAVEN? Not a word
- GAVEN? Not a word
- HAVEN? Valid
- JAVEN? Not a word
- KAVEN? Not a word
- OAVEN? Not a word
- TAVEN? Not a word
- WAVEN? Not a word
- XAVEN? Not a word
- YAVEN? Not a word
- ZAVEN? Not a word

So possible candidates: DAVEN or HAVEN. Since ""haven"" is the more common word, we'll choose that.
