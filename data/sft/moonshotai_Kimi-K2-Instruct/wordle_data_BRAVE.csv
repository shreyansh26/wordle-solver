For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. 

One of the best starting words according to many strategies is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives me coverage of several high-frequency letters in common positions, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.

Current certainties:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E  
- R is locked at position 2, A at 3, E at 5.  
Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, C, N, F, M.

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4 drawn from the remaining letters (B, D, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.) that form a valid 5-letter word _R A _ E.

Candidate list:
- BRAVE → B…E (B & V still allowed)  
- GRADE → G…E (G & D still allowed)  
- GRAPE → G…E (G & P still allowed)  
- DRANK → uses N (ruled out)  
- BRAKE → B…E (B & K still allowed)  
- GRACE → uses C (ruled out)  
- BRACE → uses C (ruled out)  

The word BRAVE introduces two new letters (B and V) that haven’t been tested yet and fits the pattern perfectly.
