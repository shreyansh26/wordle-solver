2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that contains several of these would be ideal. After considering options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters and doesn't repeat any letters, which maximizes the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Contains A, R, S (and NOT O or E).
2. Does NOT have A in position 1.
3. Does NOT have R in position 2.
4. Does NOT have S in position 4.

Letters to include: A, R, S  
Letters to exclude: O, E  

I want a new word that uses the confirmed letters (A, R, S) plus two new letters that haven't been tested yet. I’ll pick common consonants like T and N to maximize information. One candidate is “STARN” (S T A R N), but let me check:
- S in position 1 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 4 for S).
- A in position 3 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 1 for A).
- R in position 4 is allowed (feedback only ruled out position 2 for R).

Thus, STARN satisfies all constraints so far and introduces two new letters (T, N) for more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The secret word is S T A R _ in that exact order (positions 1-4).
2. The only remaining unknown is the fifth letter.
3. Letters already ruled out (from AROSE and STARN): O, E, N.
4. Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that begins with STAR and ends with any of the remaining letters. A quick scan gives common possibilities like:
- STARK
- STARF (not a word)
- STARS (but S is already in position 4, so repeating S would conflict with feedback)
- STARY (not a word)
- STARCH (too long)
- STARE (but E is already ruled out)
- STARK is the most common word left.

Therefore, STARK seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints.
