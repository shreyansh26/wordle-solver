For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will give me a good amount of information about the secret word. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English. Some good options include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good initial information about which of these common letters appear in the secret word and where they might be positioned.

So from the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word
- L: is in the word, but not in position 2
- A: not in the word
- T: not in the word
- E: not in the word

That eliminates S, A, T, E from the entire word, and tells us L exists somewhere but not in slot 2.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Must contain an L (but not in position 2)
- Must NOT contain S, A, T, or E
- Should use other common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

The remaining common vowels are I, O, U. Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out include R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should test new letters while respecting the constraints. A word like “GLORY” would use G, L, O, R, Y, but we don’t know about O or R yet. Another option: “CLINK” uses C, L, I, N, K. Since we know L can’t be in position 2, let’s try a word where L is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

“CLINK” has L in position 2 – that’s disallowed (feedback says L is not in position 2). So let’s try “FLINT” – F, L, I, N, T. T is already ruled out. 

Let’s try “BLIND” – B, L, I, N, D. None of S, A, T, E appear, and L is in position 2 – again disallowed.

“WORLD” – W, O, R, L, D. L is in position 4, which is allowed. Also introduces O, R, D, W. No forbidden letters. 

Another check: “BLOCK” – B, L, O, C, K. L is in position 2 – not allowed.

“FLUID” – F, L, U, I, D. L in position 2 – not allowed.

“GUILD” – G, U, I, L, D. L in position 4 – allowed. Uses G, U, I, D.

Between WORLD and GUILD, WORLD uses O and R which are more common. I’ll go with WORLD.

- W O V L ? – nothing
- W O Y L ? – nothing
- W O U L ? – already saw D is forbidden
- W O U L ? – only “would” but D is out

- W O Y L ? – “woyld” – not a word
- W O _ L Y – looking for words ending in LY:
