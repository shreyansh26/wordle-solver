For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with several vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate or identify key letters. 

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This combination should help identify which vowels and common consonants are present in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains an E in position 5.
- The word contains O somewhere except position 3.
- The letters A, R, S are not present.

I want a second guess that:
1. Keeps the known E in position 5.
2. Introduces new common letters (especially consonants and another vowel or two) to help narrow down remaining possibilities.
3. Places the O in a different spot (not position 3).

A good choice is “TOILE”:
- T, I, L are new letters.
- O is placed in position 2 instead of 3.
- E is kept in position 5.

Current known facts:
1. E is fixed in position 5 (from both guesses).
2. O is now fixed in position 2 (from toile feedback).
3. Letters that have been eliminated so far: A, R, S, T, L.
4. Letter that is present but not yet placed: I (since it got “-” in toile ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3).

So the word shape is _ O _ _ E, and we know I must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We want a new guess that:
- Keeps O in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Places I in a new slot (positions 1, 3, or 4) to test its correct location.
- Introduces new consonants that haven’t been used yet (common ones left: N, D, C, P, M, etc.).

Candidate words that fit _ O _ _ E and contain I:
- DOGME → no I, invalid.
- BOVINE → 6 letters, invalid.
- POISE → P, O, I, S, E → S already eliminated, invalid.
- MOVIE → M, O, V, I, E → all letters new except O, E, and puts I in position 4; good test.

Let’s choose “MOVIE”:
- M, V are completely new letters.
- Places I in position 4 (a spot it hasn’t been tested in yet).
- Keeps O in position 2 and E in position 5.

If we get:
- I(✓) in position 4 → we know the word is _ O _ I E.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4 ⇒ must be in position 1 or 3.
- I(x) → contradiction with earlier “-”, impossible.

So MOVIE is a logical next guess.
