For a first guess, it's most strategic to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in English (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N).
2. Covers a variety of these letters to maximize information gain.
3. Is a valid 5-letter word.

A popular strategic choice for Wordle's first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

From both guesses:

2. From AROSE:

   - R, O, E are **not** in the word at all.
   - S is in the correct position (last letter).

- Contains A and L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but:

- Has an A somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Has an L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but not in position 2.
- No R, O, E, N.

4. Possible 4th-letter candidates (common letters not ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. The only common English word that fits P A L _ S is “P A L L S” (but double L is awkward).

6. However, “P A L L S” is acceptable in English (as the plural of “pall”). Let me check alternatives:
   - P A L I S → “Palis” is rare/old.
   - P A L U S → doesn’t exist.
   - So “PALLS” is the only plausible remaining word.

But wait – earlier feedback for L in Guess 2 (PLANS) said L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 3 (PALMS) L was in position 3 and marked ✓, so that’s consistent.

Double-checking constraints:
   - P A L _ S
   - No R, O, E, N, M

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

1. Contains common letters in English (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N).
2. Covers a variety of these letters to maximize information gain.
3. Is a valid 5-letter word.

A popular strategic choice for Wordle's first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – letter A is in the word, but in the wrong position.
- R(x) – letter R is **not** in the word.
- O(x) – letter O is **not** in the word.
- S(✓) – letter S is in the word **and in the correct 5th position**.
- E(x) – letter E is **not** in the word.

Constraints so far:
1. Word ends in S: _ _ _ _ S
2. Contains A, but A is **not** in position 1.
3. No R, O, or E anywhere.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-4.
- Does **not** contain R, O, or E.

Let me brainstorm words:
- _ A _ _ S: LAKES – invalid, contains E.
- _ A _ _ S: BADIS – not a common word.
- _ _ A _ S: CLAPS – contains P (allowed), no R, O, E.
- _ _ _ A S: PLANS – contains N (allowed), no R, O, E, and A is in position 4 which satisfies (-) feedback.

CLAPS and PLANS both fit, but PLANS fits all constraints (A in position 4, ends in S, no R/O/E).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From both guesses:

1. The word ends with S, so the pattern is _ _ _ _ S.
2. From AROSE:
   - A is somewhere in the word (just not first position).
   - R, O, E are **not** in the word at all.
   - S is in the correct position (last letter).

3. From PLANS:
   - P is in the correct **first** position (✓).
   - L is in the word, but **not** in position 2.
   - A is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
   - N is **not** in the word.

So far we have:
- P _ _ _ S
- Contains A and L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but:
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - L cannot be in position 2.

Possible letters left to try (common remaining vowels/consonants not yet used and not ruled out): I, U, Y, D, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P and ends with S.
- Has an A somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Has an L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but not in position 2.
- No R, O, E, N.

Let me think of candidates:
- PL _ A S: PLA?S – doesn’t fit (A would be in position 4, but L would be in position 2 which is forbidden).
- P A L _ S: ""PALMS"" – fits all rules:
   - Position 1: P (✓).
   - Position 2: A (allowed; was ""-"" in AROSE, meaning allowed anywhere but position 1).
   - Position 3: L (allowed; was ""-"" in PLANS, meaning allowed anywhere but position 2).
   - Position 4: M (new letter, not ruled out).
   - Position 5: S (✓).
   - No R, O, E, N.

""PALMS"" seems perfect.

From the latest feedback:

- P(✓) A(✓) L(✓) L(-) S(-)

Interpretation:
- P, A, S are all in the correct positions (positions 1, 2, 5).
- The two L’s: the first L (position 3) is ✓, so it’s correct there.
- The second L (position 4) is marked (-), meaning the letter L is in the word but not in position 4. That’s impossible, because position 3 already has L and we only get one L in the word. This means the letter in position 4 must be something else entirely.

Therefore the pattern must be:
P A L _ S
and the blank (position 4) cannot be L (since we already have L in position 3), nor any of the excluded letters R, O, E, N, M.

We need a single letter that:
- Has not been ruled out yet.
- Makes a valid English word when inserted in P A L _ S.

Letters already confirmed / ruled out:
- Confirmed positions: P(1), A(2), L(3), S(5).
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, N, M.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter words of the form P A L _ S:
- PALBS – no.
- PALCS – no.
- PALDS – no.
- PALES – contains E (ruled out).
- PALFS – no.
- PALGS – no.
- PALHS – no.
- PALIS – archaic spelling of palisade (rare, but valid).
- PALKS – no.
- PALQS – no.
- PALTS – no.
- PALVS – no.
- PALWS – no.
- PALXS – no.
- PALYS – no.
- PALZS – no.

The only plausible candidate here is “PALIS”. It’s rare but listed in dictionaries as an old plural of “pale” (stakes used in fortifications).

But let’s double-check constraints:
- P A L I S?
- I has never been used or ruled out, so it’s allowable.
- This fills the pattern P A L _ S correctly.

- PALBS – no.
- PALCS – no.
- PALDS – no.
- PALES – contains E (ruled out).
- PALFS – no.
- PALGS – no.
- PALHS – no.
- PALIS – archaic spelling of palisade (rare, but valid).
- PALKS – no.
- PALQS – no.
- PALTS – no.
- PALVS – no.
- PALWS – no.
- PALXS – no.
- PALYS – no.
- PALZS – no.

The only plausible candidate here is “PALIS”. It’s rare but listed in dictionaries as an old plural of “pale” (stakes used in fortifications).

But let’s double-check constraints:
- P A L I S?
- I has never been used or ruled out, so it’s allowable.
- This fills the pattern P A L _ S correctly.

Therefore the next logical guess is:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,PALSY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess, it's most strategic to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in English (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N).
2. Covers a variety of these letters to maximize information gain.
3. Is a valid 5-letter word.

A popular strategic choice for Wordle's first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – letter A is in the word, but in the wrong position.
- R(x) – letter R is **not** in the word.
- O(x) – letter O is **not** in the word.
- S(✓) – letter S is in the word **and in the correct 5th position**.
- E(x) – letter E is **not** in the word.

Constraints so far:
1. Word ends in S: _ _ _ _ S
2. Contains A, but A is **not** in position 1.
3. No R, O, or E anywhere.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-4.
- Does **not** contain R, O, or E.

Let me brainstorm words:
- _ A _ _ S: LAKES – invalid, contains E.
- _ A _ _ S: BADIS – not a common word.
- _ _ A _ S: CLAPS – contains P (allowed), no R, O, E.
- _ _ _ A S: PLANS – contains N (allowed), no R, O, E, and A is in position 4 which satisfies (-) feedback.

CLAPS and PLANS both fit, but PLANS fits all constraints (A in position 4, ends in S, no R/O/E).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From both guesses:

1. The word ends with S, so the pattern is _ _ _ _ S.
2. From AROSE:
   - A is somewhere in the word (just not first position).
   - R, O, E are **not** in the word at all.
   - S is in the correct position (last letter).

3. From PLANS:
   - P is in the correct **first** position (✓).
   - L is in the word, but **not** in position 2.
   - A is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
   - N is **not** in the word.

So far we have:
- P _ _ _ S
- Contains A and L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but:
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - L cannot be in position 2.

Possible letters left to try (common remaining vowels/consonants not yet used and not ruled out): I, U, Y, D, G, H, K, M, T, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P and ends with S.
- Has an A somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Has an L somewhere inside (positions 2, 3, or 4) but not in position 2.
- No R, O, E, N.

Let me think of candidates:
- PL _ A S: PLA?S – doesn’t fit (A would be in position 4, but L would be in position 2 which is forbidden).
- P A L _ S: ""PALMS"" – fits all rules:
   - Position 1: P (✓).
   - Position 2: A (allowed; was ""-"" in AROSE, meaning allowed anywhere but position 1).
   - Position 3: L (allowed; was ""-"" in PLANS, meaning allowed anywhere but position 2).
   - Position 4: M (new letter, not ruled out).
   - Position 5: S (✓).
   - No R, O, E, N.

""PALMS"" seems perfect.

Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(-) A(-) N(x) S(-)
Guess 3: PALMS -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) L(✓) M(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

1. Word pattern: P A L _ S
   - P (✓) position 1
   - A (✓) position 2
   - L (✓) position 3
   - M (x) – M is not in the word
   - S (✓) position 5

2. R, O, E, N, M are completely out.

3. We still need a 5-letter word that starts “P A L _ S” and uses only allowed letters.

4. Possible 4th-letter candidates (common letters not ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. The only common English word that fits P A L _ S is “P A L L S” (but double L is awkward).

6. However, “P A L L S” is acceptable in English (as the plural of “pall”). Let me check alternatives:
   - P A L I S → “Palis” is rare/old.
   - P A L U S → doesn’t exist.
   - So “PALLS” is the only plausible remaining word.

But wait – earlier feedback for L in Guess 2 (PLANS) said L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In Guess 3 (PALMS) L was in position 3 and marked ✓, so that’s consistent.

Double-checking constraints:
   - P A L _ S
   - No R, O, E, N, M
   - L is allowed in position 3 (✓)

Thus, the only remaining candidate is:

P A L L S

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

- P(✓) A(✓) L(✓) L(-) S(-)

Interpretation:
- P, A, S are all in the correct positions (positions 1, 2, 5).
- The two L’s: the first L (position 3) is ✓, so it’s correct there.
- The second L (position 4) is marked (-), meaning the letter L is in the word but not in position 4. That’s impossible, because position 3 already has L and we only get one L in the word. This means the letter in position 4 must be something else entirely.

Therefore the pattern must be:
P A L _ S
and the blank (position 4) cannot be L (since we already have L in position 3), nor any of the excluded letters R, O, E, N, M.

We need a single letter that:
- Has not been ruled out yet.
- Makes a valid English word when inserted in P A L _ S.

Letters already confirmed / ruled out:
- Confirmed positions: P(1), A(2), L(3), S(5).
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, N, M.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter words of the form P A L _ S:
- PALBS – no.
- PALCS – no.
