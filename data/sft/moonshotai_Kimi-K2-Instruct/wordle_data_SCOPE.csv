For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words and cover as many different vowels and consonants as possible.

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

Looking at these options, I think STARE is particularly good because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- T: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- R: very common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:

From the feedback so far:

1. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)  
   Pattern so far: S _ _ _ E  
   Eliminated letters: T, A, R.

2. SLICE → C is in the word but not in position 4 (-).  
   Eliminated letters now include L and I.

3. SCONE → C(✓) in position 2, O(✓) in position 3, E(✓) in position 5, and N(x) is not in the word.  
   Current pattern: S C O _ E

Letters known not in the word: T, A, R, L, I, N.

Available letters for the 4th position (excluding the above and already confirmed letters S, C, O, E):
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (since O is already used and A, I are eliminated)

Looking for 5-letter words that fit the pattern ""S C O _ E"" and use only allowed letters:
- SCORE (but R is eliminated)
- SCOBE (B is allowed)
- SCOGE (G is allowed)
- SCOFE (F is allowed)
- SCOME (M is allowed)
- SCOPE (P is allowed)
- SCUPE (but U is allowed, but P and E are fine)

The most common and likely word here is SCOPE.

Let's verify:
- SCOPE: S(✓), C(✓), O(✓), P(new), E(✓)  
  P hasn't been used or eliminated yet, so this is a valid next guess.
