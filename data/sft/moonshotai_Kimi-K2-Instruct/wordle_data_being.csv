Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a first guess that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they include high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (another common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about several key letters.

- E is in the word but **not** in the last position (-).

Goal: choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E but **not** in position 5.
2. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
3. Explores other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

High-frequency letters left to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, Y, K, etc.

A balanced word that fits all criteria is “CHORE”:

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, P, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:  
E (must appear somewhere, but not in position 5)  
I (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2)  
N (must appear somewhere, but not in position 3)

Therefore the secret word:

- E must not be in position 5  
- I must not be in position 2  
- N must not be in position 3  

Available unused letters (common ones first):  
D, G, B, F, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

We still need two more letters plus the required E, I, N to form a 5-letter word. We also need to place the three required letters in allowed positions.

We know:
- E cannot be in position 5  
- I cannot be in position 2  
- N cannot be in position 3  

Possible combinations:
A word that uses D, G, or F plus one more unused letter.

Let’s try to construct a word. One candidate is “MIDGE” but D and G are okay, but G and D are allowed, but E is in position 5 which is not allowed.

Another candidate: “FINED”
- F, D are new letters.
- Word uses E, I, N, F, D.
- Check positions:
  - F (1) ✓
  - I (2) → but I cannot be in position 2 from feedback (from PINEY, I was in position 2 and was marked wrong position). So “FINED” has I in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “DINGE”
- D, G are new.
- Word uses D, I, N, G, E.
- Position check:
  - D (1), I (2) → I cannot be in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “WIDGE” – but W is unused, but G and D are okay. But again I is in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “UNFED”
- U, F, D are new letters.
- Word uses U, N, F, E, D.
- Check positions:
  - U (1) ✓
  - N (2) – allowed (N was in position 3 before, now in 2) ✓
  - F (3) ✓
  - E (4) – allowed (E was in position 4 before and marked wrong position? Wait no, in previous guesses E was in position 5 (SLATE) and position 5 (CHORE) and position 4 (PINEY). In PINEY, E was in position 4 and marked ""-"" meaning wrong position, but that means E is in the word but not in 4 – so E cannot be in 4 either. So E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly:
- I must not be in position 2
- N must not be in position 3

Let’s try to place E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Candidate: “INNED” – but N is repeated and invalid.

Candidate: “NUDIE”

Candidate: “MUNGE”
- M, U, N, G, E.
- Positions:
  - M (1) – new
  - U (2) – new
  - N (3) – but N cannot be in 3 → invalid.

Candidate: “KNEED”
- K, D are new.
- Word uses K, N, E, E, D.
- Positions:
  - K (1) – new
  - N (2) – allowed
  - E (3) – allowed (E can be in 3)
  - E (4) – allowed
  - D (5) – new
- Letters: K, N, E, D are allowed (E is used twice, which is fine).
- Check constraints:
  - E is in 3 and 4 – allowed as long as not in 5.
  - I is not used – but we determined I must be in the word. So “KNEED” is invalid because it lacks I.

We must include I. Reconstructing:

Required letters: E, I, N  
Must be placed according to position constraints.

Let me list possible positions for E, I, N:

E can be in 1, 2, 3 (not 4, 5)
I can be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2)
N can be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)

We need to arrange E, I, N in these positions and add two more letters from allowed set: D, G, B, F, K, M, U, V, W.

Possible valid arrangements:
- E in 1, I in 3, N in 2: E, N, I, _, _ → need two more letters.
  - Word: “ENI_ _”. Possible: “ENI_ _” with D, G, etc. “ENID_” – not 5 letters.
  - “ENIGM” – not a word.
  - “ENI_ _” isn’t forming valid words.

- E in 1, I in 4, N in 2: E, N, _, I, _ → need one letter in 3 and 5.
  - E, N, _, I, _ → possible: “EN_ I _” – not obvious.
  - “ENFIL” – L is banned.
  - “ENVID” – V, D new. “ENVIED” – too long.

- E in 2, I in 1, N in 4: I, E, _, N, _ → need 3 and 5 letters.
  - “I E _ N _” – “IEB_N” – not valid.
  - “IEW_N” – not valid.

- E in 2, I in 3, N in 1: N, E, I, _, _ → need 4 and 5 letters.
  - N, E, I, _, _ → “NEIGH” – H is banned.
  - “NEIF_” – not valid.

- E in 2, I in 4, N in 1: N, E, _, I, _ → need 3 and 5 letters.
  - N, E, _, I, _ → “NEFID” – valid word (slang but acceptable).
  - Check constraints:
    - N (1) – allowed (was in 3 before)
    - E (2) – allowed
    - F (3) – new
    - I (4) – allowed (was in 2 before)
    - D (5) – new
  - Letters used: N, E, F, I, D – all allowed.
  - N is in 1 (ok), E in 2 (ok), I in 4 (ok), F and D new.

“NEFID” seems to fit. Alternatively, check dictionary for valid 5-letter words with E, I, N under constraints.

Another check: “UNFED”
- U, N, F, E, D
- Positions:
  - U (1) – new
  - N (2) – allowed (was in 3)
  - F (3) – new
  - E (4) – but E cannot be in 4 (from PINEY feedback, E was in 4 and marked wrong position) → invalid.

Thus, “NEFID” appears to be the best available.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,being,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a first guess that maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they include high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (another common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about several key letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the last position (-).

Goal: choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E but **not** in position 5.
2. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
3. Explores other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

High-frequency letters left to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, Y, K, etc.

A balanced word that fits all criteria is “CHORE”:
- C, H, R, O have not been tested yet.
- E is included and placed in the 4th position (new spot).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T).

Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
- Letter that IS in the word but **not** in position 5: E  
- So E must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

Remaining high-frequency English letters we have not yet tried include: N, D, I, U, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except position 5.
2. Avoids all of S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R entirely.
3. Introduces as many new common consonants and vowels as possible to maximize information gain.

Candidate words:
- “BEGIN” – but B, G, I, N are all new; E is in 2nd position.
- “MIDGE” – but G and D are new; E is in 5th (forbidden).
- “PINEY” – P, I, N, Y new; E is 4th (allowed).

“PINEY” looks good because:
- P, I, N, Y are all fresh letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Word is valid.

I’ll go with PINEY.

From the new feedback on NEFID:

- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 1.  
- E(✓) – E is in the word **and** in position 2.  
- F(x) – F is not in the word.  
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  

So the secret word must:
- Have E fixed in position 2.  
- Contain N and I, but N ≠ 1 and I ≠ 4.  
- Exclude all letters marked x so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, P, Y, F, D.  
  Remaining unused, common letters: B, G, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Pattern so far: _ E _ _ _  
Letters still to place: N, I, plus two more allowed letters.

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is E, that also contains N and I (with positional exclusions) and uses only still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Positions:
1: any unused consonant (B, G, K, M, U, V, W)  
2: E (fixed)  
3: any unused letter  
4: any unused letter except I (since I ≠ 4)  
5: any unused letter

Known letters to include: N and I.

Case 1: N in position 3  
   Word looks like: _ E N _ _  
   Then we still need I (not in 4) and one more allowed letter.  
   Possible candidates:  
   – B E N I _ → “BENIN” (place I in 5) – valid, uses only allowed letters.  
   – G E N I _ → “GENIE” – but I would be 4 → invalid (I ≠ 4).  
   – M E N I _ → “MENIL” – L banned.  
   – K E N I _ → “KENIT” – T banned.  
   So “BENIN” works.

Case 2: N in position 4  
   Word looks like: _ E _ N _  
   Then I must be in 1, 3 or 5.  
   – I in 1: I E _ N _ → need 3 and 5 letters; e.g. “IEWNG” – invalid.  
   – I in 3: _ E I N _ → e.g. “BEIGN” – but G is allowed, word exists.  
   – I in 5: _ E _ N I → e.g. “BEGNI” – not a word.  
   “BEIGN” is valid, but we already have a simpler candidate “BENIN”.

Case 3: N in position 5  
   Word looks like: _ E _ _ N  
   Then I must be in 1 or 3.  
   – I in 1: I E _ _ N → e.g. “IEBKN” – invalid.  
   – I in 3: _ E I _ N → e.g. “BEIGN” again.

Among these, “BENIN” satisfies every constraint:
- Letters used: B, E, N, I (all allowed).  
- Second letter is E (✓).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 1).  
- I is in position 5 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).  
- No forbidden letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is “BENIN”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they include high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (another common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good information about several key letters.

Goal: choose a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E but **not** in position 5.
2. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
3. Explores other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

High-frequency letters left to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, F, Y, K, etc.

A balanced word that fits all criteria is “CHORE”:
- C, H, R, O have not been tested yet.
- E is included and placed in the 4th position (new spot).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T).

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
- Letter that IS in the word but **not** in position 5: E  
- So E must appear somewhere in positions 1-4.

Remaining high-frequency English letters we have not yet tried include: N, D, I, U, M, P, B, G, K, F, Y, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except position 5.
2. Avoids all of S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R entirely.
3. Introduces as many new common consonants and vowels as possible to maximize information gain.

Candidate words:
- “BEGIN” – but B, G, I, N are all new; E is in 2nd position.
- “MIDGE” – but G and D are new; E is in 5th (forbidden).
- “PINEY” – P, I, N, Y new; E is 4th (allowed).

“PINEY” looks good because:
- P, I, N, Y are all fresh letters.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Word is valid.

I’ll go with PINEY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, P, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:  
E (must appear somewhere, but not in position 5)  
I (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2)  
N (must appear somewhere, but not in position 3)

Therefore the secret word:  
- Must contain E, I, N  
- Must not contain any of S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, P, Y  
- E must not be in position 5  
- I must not be in position 2  
- N must not be in position 3  

Available unused letters (common ones first):  
D, G, B, F, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

We still need two more letters plus the required E, I, N to form a 5-letter word. We also need to place the three required letters in allowed positions.

We know:
- E cannot be in position 5  
- I cannot be in position 2  
- N cannot be in position 3  

Possible combinations:
A word that uses D, G, or F plus one more unused letter.

Let’s try to construct a word. One candidate is “MIDGE” but D and G are okay, but G and D are allowed, but E is in position 5 which is not allowed.

Another candidate: “FINED”
- F, D are new letters.
- Word uses E, I, N, F, D.
- Check positions:
  - F (1) ✓
  - I (2) → but I cannot be in position 2 from feedback (from PINEY, I was in position 2 and was marked wrong position). So “FINED” has I in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “DINGE”
- D, G are new.
- Word uses D, I, N, G, E.
- Position check:
  - D (1), I (2) → I cannot be in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “WIDGE” – but W is unused, but G and D are okay. But again I is in position 2 → invalid.

Next candidate: “UNFED”
- U, F, D are new letters.
- Word uses U, N, F, E, D.
- Check positions:
  - U (1) ✓
  - N (2) – allowed (N was in position 3 before, now in 2) ✓
  - F (3) ✓
  - E (4) – allowed (E was in position 4 before and marked wrong position? Wait no, in previous guesses E was in position 5 (SLATE) and position 5 (CHORE) and position 4 (PINEY). In PINEY, E was in position 4 and marked ""-"" meaning wrong position, but that means E is in the word but not in 4 – so E cannot be in 4 either. So E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly:
- I must not be in position 2
- N must not be in position 3

Let’s try to place E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Candidate: “INNED” – but N is repeated and invalid.

Candidate: “NUDIE”
- N, U, D, I, E.
- Positions:
  - N (1) – allowed (N was in position 3 before)
  - U (2) – new
  - D (3) – new
  - I (4) – allowed (I was in position 2 before)
  - E (5) – but E cannot be in 5 → invalid.

Candidate: “UNDID” – no E → invalid.

Candidate: “UNIDE” – not a word.

Candidate: “UNDEN” – not a word.

Candidate: “BUNGE” – but B is unused, U, N, G, E.
- Positions:
  - B (1) – new
  - U (2) – new
  - N (3) – but N cannot be in 3 → invalid.

Candidate: “UNBID” – no E → invalid.

Candidate: “DUNGE”
- D, U, N, G, E.
- Positions:
  - D (1) – new
  - U (2) – new
  - N (3) – but N cannot be in 3 → invalid.

Candidate: “FUNDY” – Y is banned.

Candidate: “MUNGE”
- M, U, N, G, E.
- Positions:
  - M (1) – new
  - U (2) – new
  - N (3) – but N cannot be in 3 → invalid.

Candidate: “KNEED”
- K, D are new.
- Word uses K, N, E, E, D.
- Positions:
  - K (1) – new
  - N (2) – allowed
  - E (3) – allowed (E can be in 3)
  - E (4) – allowed
  - D (5) – new
- Letters: K, N, E, D are allowed (E is used twice, which is fine).
- Check constraints:
  - E is in 3 and 4 – allowed as long as not in 5.
  - I is not used – but we determined I must be in the word. So “KNEED” is invalid because it lacks I.

We must include I. Reconstructing:

Required letters: E, I, N  
Must be placed according to position constraints.

Let me list possible positions for E, I, N:

E can be in 1, 2, 3 (not 4, 5)
I can be in 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2)
N can be in 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3)

We need to arrange E, I, N in these positions and add two more letters from allowed set: D, G, B, F, K, M, U, V, W.

Possible valid arrangements:
- E in 1, I in 3, N in 2: E, N, I, _, _ → need two more letters.
  - Word: “ENI_ _”. Possible: “ENI_ _” with D, G, etc. “ENID_” – not 5 letters.
  - “ENIGM” – not a word.
  - “ENI_ _” isn’t forming valid words.

- E in 1, I in 4, N in 2: E, N, _, I, _ → need one letter in 3 and 5.
  - E, N, _, I, _ → possible: “EN_ I _” – not obvious.
  - “ENFIL” – L is banned.
  - “ENVID” – V, D new. “ENVIED” – too long.

- E in 2, I in 1, N in 4: I, E, _, N, _ → need 3 and 5 letters.
  - “I E _ N _” – “IEB_N” – not valid.
  - “IEW_N” – not valid.

- E in 2, I in 3, N in 1: N, E, I, _, _ → need 4 and 5 letters.
  - N, E, I, _, _ → “NEIGH” – H is banned.
  - “NEIF_” – not valid.

- E in 2, I in 4, N in 1: N, E, _, I, _ → need 3 and 5 letters.
  - N, E, _, I, _ → “NEFID” – valid word (slang but acceptable).
  - Check constraints:
    - N (1) – allowed (was in 3 before)
    - E (2) – allowed
    - F (3) – new
    - I (4) – allowed (was in 2 before)
    - D (5) – new
  - Letters used: N, E, F, I, D – all allowed.
  - N is in 1 (ok), E in 2 (ok), I in 4 (ok), F and D new.

“NEFID” seems to fit. Alternatively, check dictionary for valid 5-letter words with E, I, N under constraints.

Another check: “UNFED”
- U, N, F, E, D
- Positions:
  - U (1) – new
  - N (2) – allowed (was in 3)
  - F (3) – new
  - E (4) – but E cannot be in 4 (from PINEY feedback, E was in 4 and marked wrong position) → invalid.

Thus, “NEFID” appears to be the best available.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) E(-)
Guess 3: PINEY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) N(-) E(-) Y(x)
Guess 4: NEFID -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) F(x) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on NEFID:

- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 1.  
- E(✓) – E is in the word **and** in position 2.  
- F(x) – F is not in the word.  
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  

So the secret word must:
- Have E fixed in position 2.  
- Contain N and I, but N ≠ 1 and I ≠ 4.  
- Exclude all letters marked x so far: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, P, Y, F, D.  
  Remaining unused, common letters: B, G, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Pattern so far: _ E _ _ _  
Letters still to place: N, I, plus two more allowed letters.

We need a 5-letter word whose second letter is E, that also contains N and I (with positional exclusions) and uses only still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Positions:
1: any unused consonant (B, G, K, M, U, V, W)  
2: E (fixed)  
3: any unused letter  
4: any unused letter except I (since I ≠ 4)  
5: any unused letter

Known letters to include: N and I.

Case 1: N in position 3  
   Word looks like: _ E N _ _  
   Then we still need I (not in 4) and one more allowed letter.  
   Possible candidates:  
   – B E N I _ → “BENIN” (place I in 5) – valid, uses only allowed letters.  
   – G E N I _ → “GENIE” – but I would be 4 → invalid (I ≠ 4).  
   – M E N I _ → “MENIL” – L banned.  
   – K E N I _ → “KENIT” – T banned.  
   So “BENIN” works.

Case 2: N in position 4  
   Word looks like: _ E _ N _  
   Then I must be in 1, 3 or 5.  
   – I in 1: I E _ N _ → need 3 and 5 letters; e.g. “IEWNG” – invalid.  
   – I in 3: _ E I N _ → e.g. “BEIGN” – but G is allowed, word exists.  
   – I in 5: _ E _ N I → e.g. “BEGNI” – not a word.  
   “BEIGN” is valid, but we already have a simpler candidate “BENIN”.

Case 3: N in position 5  
   Word looks like: _ E _ _ N  
   Then I must be in 1 or 3.  
   – I in 1: I E _ _ N → e.g. “IEBKN” – invalid.  
   – I in 3: _ E I _ N → e.g. “BEIGN” again.

Among these, “BENIN” satisfies every constraint:
- Letters used: B, E, N, I (all allowed).  
- Second letter is E (✓).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 1).  
- I is in position 5 (allowed, since it can’t be in 4).  
- No forbidden letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is “BENIN”.

Possible positions:

- I cannot be in 4th, so I must be 3rd or 5th.
But 5th position must be N (since N must be 4th), so I must be 3rd.

Thus the pattern must be: B E I N _

The 5th letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters: G, K, M, U, V, W.

Looking for valid words:
- BEING – uses G (allowed), fits the pattern perfectly.

Check constraints:

- N must be in 4th or 5th, but 5th is excluded for N, so N must be 4th.
- I cannot be in 4th, so I must be 3rd or 5th.
But 5th position must be N (since N must be 4th), so I must be 3rd.

Thus the pattern must be: B E I N _

The 5th letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters: G, K, M, U, V, W.

Looking for valid words:
- BEING – uses G (allowed), fits the pattern perfectly.

Check constraints:
- B(✓) position 1 – matches.  
- E(✓) position 2 – matches.  
- N is in 4th (allowed, since N can't be 3rd or 5th).  
- I is in 3rd (allowed, since I can't be 4th).  
- G is an unused letter (allowed).  

No violations.",Guess 6: BEING -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
