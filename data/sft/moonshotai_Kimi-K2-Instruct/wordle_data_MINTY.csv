For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Covers different letters to test multiple possibilities
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. I'll try to include several of these in my first guess.

A good starting word should test common vowels and consonants. I'm going to choose ""AROSE"" because it:
- Uses 5 different letters
- Includes 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Includes 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Is a valid word

This will give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

All five letters A, R, O, S, E are absent from the word.  
That means:
- Vowels A, O, E are out.
- Consonants R, S are out.

Next I should try a word that avoids those letters entirely and instead introduces other common letters.  
Among the remaining frequent letters are I, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.

I need to pick 5 distinct letters from that pool and form a valid word.  
Good choices: I, T, N, U, D → ""UNTID"" is not a word, but ""UNITY"" uses U, N, I, T, Y and is valid.  
Another: I, T, C, H, U → ""ITCHY"" is valid and uses common consonants.

Between these, I'll go with ""UNITY"" to get the vowel I and common consonants N, T, Y (U is less common but still useful).

From the latest feedback:

- U is not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong place (-).
- I is in the word but in the wrong place (-).
- T is in the word and in the correct fourth position (✓).
- Y is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).

So our provisional pattern is: _ _ _ T Y  
Known letters in the word: N, I (positions unknown), T (4th), Y (5th).

We also know we cannot use A, R, O, S, E, U.

We need a 5-letter word ending with “TY” and containing N and I somewhere in positions 1–3.

Possible combinations for the first three positions:
- Positions 1–3 must include I and N once each (order unknown), plus one new letter that hasn’t been ruled out.

Let’s look for common letters remaining: among earlier unused consonants are D, L, C, H, M, G, B, F, K.

Try “F” + “I” + “N” → “FINTY” is not a word.  
Try “P” + “I” + “N” → “PINTY” – not a word.  
Try “M” + “I” + “N” → “MINTY” – valid word.

“MINTY” uses M, I, N, T, Y.  
Matches constraints:
- M, I, N are allowed (not yet excluded).  
- T is fixed at 4th, Y at 5th.  
- I and N are both in the word; their positions will get feedback.

Hence, best next guess is “MINTY”.
