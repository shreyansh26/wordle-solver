Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Some of the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular starting word among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters and includes three vowels. This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters and covers different positions. Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it uses more vowels upfront.

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O is not in the word (x).

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

2. A, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that avoids A, O, S and includes both R and E in new positions.

- Move R and E to new positions.  
- Introduce new common letters to test.

Letters in the word  
- R – present, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- E – present, but NOT in positions 5 or 4.  
- I – is in the correct position 2 (✓).  

Letters ruled out  
- A, O, S, T, D  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ I _ _ _  

Letters still allowed that are neither confirmed nor ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints  
1. R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
2. E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2 (already taken by I), 3, or 5.  
3. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word meeting these restrictions.

A good next guess should:
- Keep the confirmed I in position 2.  
- Move R and E to the only legal places left.  
- Introduce a new common consonant to test.

Possible placements satisfying the constraints:

- R in 1, E in 3: R I E _ _  → “RIEFY” (invalid), “RIELS” (invalid, S ruled out), etc.  
- R in 1, E in 5: R I _ _ E → “RIDGE” (D ruled out), “RIFLE” (F new, L new) – candidate.

- R in 5, E in 1: E I _ _ R → “EIDER” (D ruled out), “EIGER” (G new, R already known) – candidate.

Among the valid English words, “RIFLE” and “EIGER” both satisfy all constraints.  
Between them, “RIFLE” is more common and tests the letters F and L, which are high-frequency.  

Therefore, RIFLE is the best next guess.

4. Current pattern: _ I _ _ _ with the still-unknown letters among {B, C, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Valid placements for R and E

- Case 3: E in 3, R in 4 → _ I E R _  
- Case 4: E in 3, R in 5 → _ I _ E R  

We need a legitimate 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

   - C, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc. for first letter  
   - Valid word: “PIER_” → but 5th letter must be allowed and real word.

   - “WIER_” → nothing common  
   - “BIERS” (S ruled out)

   - “N I M E R” (NIMER not common)  
   - “H I V E R” (H I V E R) → “HIVER” is a valid English word meaning winter, though a bit obscure.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,finer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Some of the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular starting word among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters and includes three vowels. This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters and covers different positions. Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it uses more vowels upfront.

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x).  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O is not in the word (x).  
- S is not in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So we know:
1. R and E are present, but not where they were in AROSE (R at 2, E at 5).
2. A, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that avoids A, O, S and includes both R and E in new positions.

Common remaining letters to try: T, L, N, I, D, C, U, etc.  
A good next guess should:
- Move R and E to new positions.  
- Introduce new common letters to test.

Candidate words:
- TIRED (uses T, I, R, E, D) — but R and E are in positions 3 and 4, same as AROSE for E (position 5 vs 4 is different, but R is now at 3 which is different from 2, so valid).
- ENTER (but uses E twice, and N, T, R).
- RELIC (but C is less common than T/D).

Best choice: TIRED — it moves R and E, introduces T, I, D.

<guess>TIRED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word  
- R – present, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- E – present, but NOT in positions 5 or 4.  
- I – is in the correct position 2 (✓).  

Letters ruled out  
- A, O, S, T, D  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ I _ _ _  

Letters still allowed that are neither confirmed nor ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints  
1. R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
2. E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2 (already taken by I), 3, or 5.  
3. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word meeting these restrictions.

A good next guess should:
- Keep the confirmed I in position 2.  
- Move R and E to the only legal places left.  
- Introduce a new common consonant to test.

Possible placements satisfying the constraints:

- R in 1, E in 3: R I E _ _  → “RIEFY” (invalid), “RIELS” (invalid, S ruled out), etc.  
- R in 1, E in 5: R I _ _ E → “RIDGE” (D ruled out), “RIFLE” (F new, L new) – candidate.  
- R in 4, E in 3: _ I E R _ → “VIERS” (S ruled out), “LIERS” (S ruled out).  
- R in 5, E in 1: E I _ _ R → “EIDER” (D ruled out), “EIGER” (G new, R already known) – candidate.

Among the valid English words, “RIFLE” and “EIGER” both satisfy all constraints.  
Between them, “RIFLE” is more common and tests the letters F and L, which are high-frequency.  

Therefore, RIFLE is the best next guess.

   - “N I M E R” (NIMER not common)  
   - “H I V E R” (H I V E R) → “HIVER” is a valid English word meaning winter, though a bit obscure.  
   - “WIPER” is definitely common.

The clearest valid candidate is “WIPER” (Case 4: _ I _ E R).

Let’s tabulate the new information from the fourth guess.

Feedback on WIPER  
W – not in the word (x)  
P – not in the word (x)  
I – correct position 2 (✓) (already known)  
E – correct position 3 (✓) (this is new positional info)  
R – correct position 5 (✓) (this is new positional info)

So we now know the exact skeleton:

Letter positions
1 – unknown (but cannot be any of A, O, S, T, D, L, F, W, P)
2 – I
3 – E
4 – unknown (cannot be any of the letters ruled out above)
5 – R

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (from the full English alphabet minus the eleven ruled-out letters) are:  
B, C, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a real 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ I E _ R.

Scanning common English words fitting that pattern:

- BIERR → not a word  
- CIER_ → nothing  
- GIER_ → nothing  
- HIER_ → nothing  
- JIER_ → nothing  
- KIER_ → nothing (except “kier” itself is 4 letters)  
- MIER_ → nothing  
- NIER_ → nothing  
- QIER_ → nothing  
- UIER_ → nothing  
- VIER_ → “VIER” is 4 letters  
- XIER_ → nothing  
- YIER_ → nothing  
- ZIER_ → nothing

This suggests the missing 4th letter must be able to form a real word ending in “IER”.  
The standard pattern is a consonant + “IER” meaning “one who does X”, but the “IER” is positions 2-4, and we need the final R (position 5) already fixed.  
The only common 5-letter word that matches _ I E _ R is:

- B I E B R → not a word  
- C I E C R → not a word  
… wait, what about “BIDER”? D is ruled out.  
“HIDER”? D ruled out.  
“SIZER”? S ruled out.  
“VIBER”? P is ruled out but V and B are allowed. “VIBER” is a real word (short for “vibrator” in texting slang, and now in dictionaries). Unfortunately B is allowed, so “VIBER” (V I B E R) actually fits the pattern _ I E _ R.

But let me double-check:

V – allowed  
I – correct position 2  
B – allowed (not yet ruled out)  
E – correct position 3  
R – correct position 5  

So “VIBER” fits. Another candidate is “NIGER” but that’s a proper noun (country) and might not be accepted. “MIMER” is valid but M is allowed and already used. “CIDER” uses D which is ruled out. “ZIBER” is not a real word. “KIBER” is not a real word. The only really common, acceptable word left is “VIBER”.

Therefore, the next guess is VIBER.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,finer,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Some of the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A popular starting word among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters and includes three vowels. This gives us a broad initial test of letters and positions. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters and covers different positions. Between these, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better as it uses more vowels upfront.

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is not in the word (x).  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O is not in the word (x).  
- S is not in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  

So we know:
1. R and E are present, but not where they were in AROSE (R at 2, E at 5).
2. A, O, S are not in the word at all.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that avoids A, O, S and includes both R and E in new positions.

Common remaining letters to try: T, L, N, I, D, C, U, etc.  
A good next guess should:
- Move R and E to new positions.  
- Introduce new common letters to test.

Candidate words:
- TIRED (uses T, I, R, E, D) — but R and E are in positions 3 and 4, same as AROSE for E (position 5 vs 4 is different, but R is now at 3 which is different from 2, so valid).
- ENTER (but uses E twice, and N, T, R).
- RELIC (but C is less common than T/D).

Best choice: TIRED — it moves R and E, introduces T, I, D.

<guess>TIRED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word  
- R – present, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- E – present, but NOT in positions 5 or 4.  
- I – is in the correct position 2 (✓).  

Letters ruled out  
- A, O, S, T, D  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ I _ _ _  

Letters still allowed that are neither confirmed nor ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints  
1. R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
2. E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2 (already taken by I), 3, or 5.  
3. The word must be a valid 5-letter English word meeting these restrictions.

A good next guess should:
- Keep the confirmed I in position 2.  
- Move R and E to the only legal places left.  
- Introduce a new common consonant to test.

Possible placements satisfying the constraints:

- R in 1, E in 3: R I E _ _  → “RIEFY” (invalid), “RIELS” (invalid, S ruled out), etc.  
- R in 1, E in 5: R I _ _ E → “RIDGE” (D ruled out), “RIFLE” (F new, L new) – candidate.  
- R in 4, E in 3: _ I E R _ → “VIERS” (S ruled out), “LIERS” (S ruled out).  
- R in 5, E in 1: E I _ _ R → “EIDER” (D ruled out), “EIGER” (G new, R already known) – candidate.

Among the valid English words, “RIFLE” and “EIGER” both satisfy all constraints.  
Between them, “RIFLE” is more common and tests the letters F and L, which are high-frequency.  

Therefore, RIFLE is the best next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's synthesize all feedback so far.

Known facts
1. Letters definitely in the word: I (fixed at position 2), R, E.
2. Positions ruled out for these letters  
   - R: not pos 2, 3, 1 (from AROSE, TIRED, RIFLE) ⇒ R must be at 4 or 5.  
   - E: not pos 5, 4 (from AROSE, TIRED) ⇒ E must be at 1 or 3.  
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D, L, F.  
4. Current pattern: _ I _ _ _ with the still-unknown letters among {B, C, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Valid placements for R and E
- Case 1: E in 1, R in 4 → E I _ R _  
- Case 2: E in 1, R in 5 → E I _ _ R  
- Case 3: E in 3, R in 4 → _ I E R _  
- Case 4: E in 3, R in 5 → _ I _ E R  

We need a legitimate 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Quick scan of common words:

Case 3: _ I E R _  
   - C, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, etc. for first letter  
   - Valid word: “PIER_” → but 5th letter must be allowed and real word.  
   - “PIER” + (K) → “PIERK” invalid  
   - “VIER_” → nothing common  
   - “WIER_” → nothing common  
   - “BIERS” (S ruled out)  
   - “GIERS” (S ruled out)  
   - “HIERS” (S ruled out)  

Case 4: _ I _ E R  
   - “CIDER” (D ruled out)  
   - “WIPER” (P allowed, W allowed) → W I P E R  
   - “N I M E R” (NIMER not common)  
   - “H I V E R” (H I V E R) → “HIVER” is a valid English word meaning winter, though a bit obscure.  
   - “WIPER” is definitely common.

Case 1: E I _ R _  
   - E I G R _ → no common word  
   - E I N R _ → none  
   - E I M R _ → none  

Case 2: E I _ _ R  
   - E I K R → no pattern  
   - E I N J R → invalid  

The clearest valid candidate is “WIPER” (Case 4: _ I _ E R).  
It places W (new), I (fixed), P (new), E (must be at 3), R (must be at 5) and satisfies every constraint.
