Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in strategic positions. A good first guess uses common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities. 

Common letters in English 5-letter words include: A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I. A balanced approach is to use a word with a mix of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because:
- S (common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This covers 3 vowels (A, E, and the sometimes-vowel Y isn't here) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T), providing good feedback potential.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the correct position (position 3) and is the 3rd letter.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position – it cannot be in position 2.
- S, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ A _ _ with no S, T, or E.

We need:
- A in position 3.
- L somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; but 3 is taken by A, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Exclude S, T, E.

Good letters to consider next: common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (R, N, I, O, D, etc.).

A promising structure: start with consonants that pair well with L elsewhere, and introduce new letters.

Let's try a word where L is first and we bring in new vowels/consonants: ""FLAIR"" – but F isn’t a top-common letter, and R and I are good candidates.

Actually, ""CLAMP"" has no S/T/E, keeps A in position 3, and places L in position 2 (but L cannot be in position 2 per feedback). So ""CLAMP"" is invalid.

Better: ""PLAIN"" – has L in position 2 (invalid). ""GRAIL"" has L in position 4 (valid) and no S/T/E. This is strong.

""GRAIL"":
- G: new consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: correct position
- I: new vowel
- L: in position 5 (valid placement)
No S/T/E present.

This tests R, I, G, and confirms L's position.

Therefore the word must be:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Contains L (cannot be positions 2 or 5, so must be 1 or 4).
- Cannot contain S, T, E, G, R, I.

Letters still allowed: A (fixed), L, plus remaining common consonants/vowels: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possibilities:
- L in position 1: L _ A _ _
  Possible letters for positions 2, 4, 5: any except the banned ones.
  Good candidates: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, Y
  Example: L A A N D – invalid (two A’s)
  Example: L O A N D – but I is banned, so N and D are okay.
  Let’s try LOADN – not a valid word.
  LOAMY – but Y is okay, but M and Y are okay.
  LOAMY – valid word, but check letters: L, O, A, M, Y – none of banned letters.

- L in position 4: _ _ A L _
  Example: C H A L K – C, H, A, L, K – none banned.
  Example: M A L L Y – but L in 4 is okay, but M and Y are okay.
  However, double letters might be risky, and MALLY is not common.

Between these, ""CHALK"" is valid and tests C, H, K, with A and L in known positions.

From all prior feedback:

- A is fixed in position 3.
- L is now fixed in position 4.
- K is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, T, E, G, R, I, C, H.

Pattern: _ _ A L _

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.

K must appear somewhere. Since it cannot be position 5, it must be position 1 or 2.

Possible placements:
1. K _ A L _
2. _ K A L _

Letters still allowed (excluding all banned and already placed A, L, K):  
B, D, F, J, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, Y (but many are uncommon).

Let’s list valid words:

- K _ A L _ : K is first.
  K N A L D – invalid (D is fine, but KNALD isn’t a word).
  K _ A L _ : K O A L A – invalid (double A, and A already used).
  K _ A L _ : K U A L _ – invalid.
  K _ A L _ : K N A L _ – KNALE? KNALL? No.

- _ K A L _ : K second.
  S K A L _ – S banned.
  F K A L _ – FKALE? No.
  B K A L _ – BKALE? No.
  N K A L _ – NKALE? No.

Now, K can also be in position 5 (but feedback says K is in word but not in position 5). So K must be in 1 or 2.

Wait – actually the feedback for CHALK showed K(-) which means K is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Thus, K must be in position 1 or 2.

Looking for valid English words fitting _ _ A L _ with K in 1 or 2, and no banned letters.

Valid English word: KNA L _ – KNALE? No.  
B A K A L – BAKAL? No.  
B L A K _ – but L is already fixed in 4.

Realize that L is fixed in 4, so positions 1,2,5 are open.

K must be 1 or 2.

- K _ A L _ : KNOWN word: KOALA – but O is allowed, A is fixed in 3, so K O A L _ – but KOALA has 6 letters. KOAL_ – KOALN? Not a word.

- _ K A L _ : B K A L _ – not a word.  
  F K A L _ – not a word.  
  M K A L _ – not a word.  
  N K A L _ – not a word.

Wait, let me think differently – maybe we missed a simple word.

Consider ""KOALA"" is 5 letters: K-O-A-L-A – but A is repeated, and position 5 must be K, but K cannot be 5. So KOALA invalid.

Next, ""KNA L _"" – not a word.  
""B A K A L"" – not a word.

Realize we need to include K in 1 or 2.

Valid English 5-letter word: K B A L O – KBALO? No.  
K N A L D – KNALD? No.

Actually, ""ALK"" is in the word, so _ _ A L K – but K cannot be last. So this is impossible.

Thus, K must be in 1 or 2.

Real word: ""KNA L _"" – KNALE? No.  
""K A L _ _"" – but A is fixed 3, L fixed 4, so K must be 1 or 2.

Realize that the only valid English word fitting is ""KNA L _"" – but no 5-letter word starts with KNAL.

Next, check if K is in 1: K _ A L _  
Valid word: K-O-A-L-A – KOALA is 5 letters but A repeats and K is 1, O 2, A 3, L 4, A 5 – but A already fixed 3, and A in 5 would repeat A, and we have no info against repeats.

But KOALA is valid: K(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), A(5) – no banned letters.

But is double A allowed? The rules don't prohibit repeats, and we have no feedback against it.

Check other possibilities:  
F A L K _ – but L is 4, so F _ A L K – but K cannot be 5.

Thus, KOALA seems the only possible candidate left.

But let me think again – the word must have K and L, with A in 3, L in 4, K not in 5.

Thus, K must be in 1 or 2.

KOALA: K in 1, O in 2, A in 3, L in 4, A in 5 – this fits all constraints.

After checking all constraints, the only 5-letter English word that fits the pattern _ _ A L _ with K present but not in position 5, and without any of the forbidden letters, is ""KOALA"".
