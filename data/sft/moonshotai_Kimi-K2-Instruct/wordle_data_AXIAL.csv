For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters frequently found in English words
2. Has a good vowel-to-consonant ratio to help identify vowels
3. Contains no repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers:

The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (marked -).

Since we know A must appear somewhere other than the 2nd spot and no other letters from CRANE are in the word, we should pick a word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2)
2. Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
3. Uses other common letters to maximize new information

I'll try a word with A in a different position and common consonants. ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but D is already used (CRANE feedback didn't exclude D, but it's safer to avoid). Instead, ""PAINT"" uses A in position 2 (bad), ""MADLY"" uses A in position 2. 

A better choice is ""SLATE"" - but this uses E which we know is not in the word. 

After reconsidering, ""ADIOS"" uses A in position 1 (allowed), and introduces new common letters (D, I, O, S). However, this uses O and S which could be helpful.

Another strong option is ""BASIC"" - uses A in position 3, and introduces B, S, I, C (but C is excluded).

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word:  
C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S

Letters that **are** in the word (and their positional hints):
- I is in the word and is correctly placed in position 3 (✓ in guess 3).
- A is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (- in guesses 1 and 3).
- L is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (- in guesses 2 and 3).

So the word looks like:
_ _ I _ _
with A and L still to be placed, and they must go in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Contains A and L somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set above.

A good word satisfying these constraints is “ALIBI”:
- A (allowed, can be in position 1)  
- L (allowed, can be in position 2)  
- I (fixed in position 3)  
- B (allowed)  
- I (but this would repeat I, which is not allowed since all letters in Wordle are unique unless feedback suggests otherwise)

Wait, “ALIBI” uses I twice, which is unlikely. Let’s find a word with unique letters.

Try “GAILY”:
- G (allowed)  
- A (must be in position 1, 4, or 5; here position 2 → not allowed)  

Next, “VITAL”:
- V (allowed)  
- I (position 3, correct)  
- T (allowed)  
- A (position 4, allowed)  
- L (position 5, allowed)  

This uses A in position 4 and L in position 5, both allowed by the feedback. All letters are from the allowed set.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

2. Has a good vowel-to-consonant ratio to help identify vowels
3. Contains no repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers:

- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).

Since we know A must appear somewhere other than the 2nd spot and no other letters from CRANE are in the word, we should pick a word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2)
2. Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
3. Uses other common letters to maximize new information

Good candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I'll try a word with A in a different position and common consonants. ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but D is already used (CRANE feedback didn't exclude D, but it's safer to avoid). Instead, ""PAINT"" uses A in position 2 (bad), ""MADLY"" uses A in position 2. 

A better choice is ""SLATE"" - but this uses E which we know is not in the word. 

After reconsidering, ""ADIOS"" uses A in position 1 (allowed), and introduces new common letters (D, I, O, S). However, this uses O and S which could be helpful.

Another strong option is ""BASIC"" - uses A in position 3, and introduces B, S, I, C (but C is excluded). 

Best option seems ""PLAID"" - uses A in position 3, and new letters P, L, I, D (none excluded).

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, D  
Letters in the word but position unknown: A, L, I  

So the secret word must contain A, L, and I (each in some position), and must NOT contain C, R, N, E, P, D.

Looking at the positions:
- In PLAID, A and I were both marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
  – In PLAID, A was in position 3 and I in position 4.  
  – Therefore the word contains A but not in position 3, and I but not in position 4.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Includes A, L, I (each once)  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining set {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}  
- Places A and I in new spots.

Good candidate letters to pair with A, L, I: S, T, M, B, etc.

One simple word obeying all these constraints is “MAILS”:
- Letters: M, A, I, L, S  
- All constraints satisfied: contains A, L, I; avoids forbidden letters; A is now in position 2 (not 3), I is in position 3 (not 4).

Let's decode the new feedback:

1. VITAL → V(x) I(-) T(x) A(✓) L(✓)

- V and T are NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked '-').
- A is in the word AND in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- L is in the word AND in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

So we now have:
- Word structure: _ _ I A L (positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as I, A, L respectively)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T
- I must be in position 3 (from guess 3) but the latest feedback says I is '-' (wrong position). Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Guess 3 MAILS: I(✓) means I is in position 3 correctly.
- Guess 4 VITAL: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 2. This is consistent because I is actually in position 3.

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: A

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that:
- Are not in the forbidden set: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T
- Make a valid English word ending in -IAL

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for 5-letter words ending in -IAL:
- B: BIAL? (not a word)

Hmm, none of single letters + IAL seem valid. Maybe we need two letters at start.

Looking for common patterns:
- Words ending in -IAL: DIAL (D forbidden), PIAL (P forbidden), SIAL (S forbidden), BIAL (B+IAL? Not standard), CIAL (C forbidden), RIAL (R forbidden), etc.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word starts with F and has a second letter. Possible words:
- FILIAL (too long)
- Looking at remaining letters, possible combinations:
  - B + ? + IAL
  - F + ? + IAL
  - G + ? + IAL

The only common 5-letter word ending in IAL with our constraints appears to be ""BIAL"" (but that's 4 letters). 

Looking more carefully, the word must be _ _ I A L. Let's think of valid English words:
- B,I,A,L → BIALY (but that's 5 letters: B-I-A-L-Y)
But Y is allowed and not forbidden. BIALY is a valid word (type of bread).

But does it fit?
- B (allowed)
- I (position 3, correct)
- A (position 4, correct)
- L (position 5, correct)
- Y (allowed, not forbidden)

All letters are from allowed set and positions match.

1. VITAL → V(x) I(-) T(x) A(✓) L(✓)

- V and T are NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked '-').
- A is in the word AND in position 4 (✓ in position 4).
- L is in the word AND in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

So we now have:
- Word structure: _ _ I A L (positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as I, A, L respectively)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T
- I must be in position 3 (from guess 3) but the latest feedback says I is '-' (wrong position). Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Guess 3 MAILS: I(✓) means I is in position 3 correctly.
- Guess 4 VITAL: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 2. This is consistent because I is actually in position 3.

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters frequently found in English words
2. Has a good vowel-to-consonant ratio to help identify vowels
3. Contains no repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (marked -).

Since we know A must appear somewhere other than the 2nd spot and no other letters from CRANE are in the word, we should pick a word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2)
2. Avoids C, R, N, E entirely
3. Uses other common letters to maximize new information

Good candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I'll try a word with A in a different position and common consonants. ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but D is already used (CRANE feedback didn't exclude D, but it's safer to avoid). Instead, ""PAINT"" uses A in position 2 (bad), ""MADLY"" uses A in position 2. 

A better choice is ""SLATE"" - but this uses E which we know is not in the word. 

After reconsidering, ""ADIOS"" uses A in position 1 (allowed), and introduces new common letters (D, I, O, S). However, this uses O and S which could be helpful.

Another strong option is ""BASIC"" - uses A in position 3, and introduces B, S, I, C (but C is excluded). 

Best option seems ""PLAID"" - uses A in position 3, and new letters P, L, I, D (none excluded). 

Wait, let me pick something even cleaner: ""MADLY"" - but A is in position 2 (disallowed). 

""GRASP"" - uses A in position 3, and G, S, P (none excluded). This seems good.

But let's go with ""PLAID"" as it covers very common letters.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, D  
Letters in the word but position unknown: A, L, I  

So the secret word must contain A, L, and I (each in some position), and must NOT contain C, R, N, E, P, D.

Looking at the positions:
- In PLAID, A and I were both marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
  – In PLAID, A was in position 3 and I in position 4.  
  – Therefore the word contains A but not in position 3, and I but not in position 4.

We need a five-letter word that:
- Includes A, L, I (each once)  
- Uses three other letters from the remaining set {B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}  
- Places A and I in new spots.

Good candidate letters to pair with A, L, I: S, T, M, B, etc.

One simple word obeying all these constraints is “MAILS”:
- Letters: M, A, I, L, S  
- All constraints satisfied: contains A, L, I; avoids forbidden letters; A is now in position 2 (not 3), I is in position 3 (not 4).

This should give us maximal information on where A, L, I sit and whether any of the new letters (M, S) appear.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word:  
C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S

Letters that **are** in the word (and their positional hints):
- I is in the word and is correctly placed in position 3 (✓ in guess 3).
- A is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (- in guesses 1 and 3).
- L is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (- in guesses 2 and 3).

So the word looks like:
_ _ I _ _
with A and L still to be placed, and they must go in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Contains A and L somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set above.

A good word satisfying these constraints is “ALIBI”:
- A (allowed, can be in position 1)  
- L (allowed, can be in position 2)  
- I (fixed in position 3)  
- B (allowed)  
- I (but this would repeat I, which is not allowed since all letters in Wordle are unique unless feedback suggests otherwise)

Wait, “ALIBI” uses I twice, which is unlikely. Let’s find a word with unique letters.

Try “GAILY”:
- G (allowed)  
- A (must be in position 1, 4, or 5; here position 2 → not allowed)  

Next, “VITAL”:
- V (allowed)  
- I (position 3, correct)  
- T (allowed)  
- A (position 4, allowed)  
- L (position 5, allowed)  

This uses A in position 4 and L in position 5, both allowed by the feedback. All letters are from the allowed set.

- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked '-').
- A is in the word AND in position 4 (✓ in position 4).

- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T
- I must be in position 3 (from guess 3) but the latest feedback says I is '-' (wrong position). Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Guess 3 MAILS: I(✓) means I is in position 3 correctly.
- Guess 4 VITAL: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 2. This is consistent because I is actually in position 3.

So the confirmed positions are:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: L

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that:
- Are not in the forbidden set: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T
- Make a valid English word ending in -IAL

Hmm, none of single letters + IAL seem valid. Maybe we need two letters at start.

Looking for common patterns:
- Words ending in -IAL: DIAL (D forbidden), PIAL (P forbidden), SIAL (S forbidden), BIAL (B+IAL? Not standard), CIAL (C forbidden), RIAL (R forbidden), etc.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word starts with F and has a second letter. Possible words:
- FILIAL (too long)
- Looking at remaining letters, possible combinations:
  - B + ? + IAL
  - F + ? + IAL
  - G + ? + IAL

The only common 5-letter word ending in IAL with our constraints appears to be ""BIAL"" (but that's 4 letters). 

Looking more carefully, the word must be _ _ I A L. Let's think of valid English words:

Let's carefully merge all feedback so far.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, D, M, S, V, T, B, Y  
(12 letters ruled out)

Letters confirmed to be in the word: A, I, L

Positional constraints after all guesses:
- I: must be in position 3 (from MAILS feedback I(✓))  
- L: must be in position 5 (from VITAL feedback L(✓))  
- A: must be in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from CRANE, PLAID, MAILS, VITAL, BIALY) → only possible spot left is position 1

So the word structure is now fixed:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Letter:  A   ?   I   ?   L  

We still need two more letters for positions 2 and 4.

Allowed remaining letters (none of which have been ruled out):  
F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need two distinct letters from this set to make a valid English word.

Candidates:

- A _ I _ L  
Valid English words of this pattern:
– AFIELD (6 letters, too long)  
– AGILE  (but ends with E, already forbidden)  
– AFOIL? (not a word)  
– AHIGH? (not a word)  
– AKILA? (not a word)  
– AQUIL? (not a word)  
– AWFUL (but doesn’t match pattern)  
– AXIOM (doesn’t match)  

Realize no common word fits A _ I _ L with available letters. Let me re-examine if any constraints were mis-read.

Wait - in BIALY feedback:
- A(-) means A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (BIALY had A in position 3), so A is still allowed in positions 1, 2, 4.  
- L(-) means L is in the word but **not** in position 4 (BIALY had L in position 4), so L is still allowed in positions 1, 2.  

But from VITAL we had L(✓) in position 5, so L is fixed in 5.

From VITAL we also had A(✓) in position 4, so A is fixed in 4.

So corrected fixed positions:
- I in position 3 (from MAILS)  
- A in position 4 (from VITAL)  
- L in position 5 (from VITAL)  

Thus structure is: _ _ I A L

Now we need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining allowed: F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

Valid English 5-letter words ending in -IAL:
- F + ? + IAL → F + K + IAL? → FKIAL? Not a word.  
- G + ? + IAL → G + O + IAL → GOIAL? Not a word.  
- H + ? + IAL → H + I + IAL → HIIAL? Not valid.  
- K + ? + IAL → K + I + IAL → KIIAL? Not valid.  

Only common word of _ _ I A L that fits is ""FINAL"", but F is allowed, I is allowed, N is forbidden.  

Realize we have exhausted common words. Re-examining constraints:

Actually, from CRANE: A(-) means not position 2  
PLAID: A(-) means not position 3  
MAILS: A(-) means not position 2  
VITAL: A(✓) means position 4  
BIALY: A(-) means not position 3  

Thus A is fixed in position 4.

Similarly L is fixed in position 5.

I is fixed in position 3.

So word is ? ? I A L

From remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

Possible combinations:
- F I I A L? No, duplicate I.  
- G I I A L? No.  
- H I I A L? No.  

This shows no valid word can be formed with the remaining letters, indicating an earlier assumption may be wrong.

Rechecking: we have the fixed structure A _ I _ L is impossible because A is fixed at 4 and L at 5, so structure is _ _ I A L.

From remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

The only possible valid word is ""QUAIL"", but:
- Q U A I L → positions: Q(1),U(2),A(3),I(4),L(5)  
But we need I in 3 and A in 4, which would require A in 4, I in 3, so word would be ? ? I A L.

""QUAIL"" doesn't fit this pattern.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid word matching the constraints is ""AXIAL"":
- A(1), X(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)  
But A repeats, which is usually invalid.

Realizing the constraints lead to ""AXIAL"" as the only possible word despite the A repeat, as it's the only dictionary word fitting _ _ I A L with available letters.

However, A is already confirmed in position 4, so position 1 must be a different letter.

This indicates the correct word must be:

_ _ I A L with first two letters from F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

The only valid word is ""AXIAL"" despite the duplicate A, but this is unusual.

Rechecking: the constraints are absolute, and ""AXIAL"" is the only possibility left.
