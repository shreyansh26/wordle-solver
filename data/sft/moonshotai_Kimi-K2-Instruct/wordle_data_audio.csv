For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains all vowels (A, O, E) plus common consonants R and S. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, whether they're correct positions or wrong positions.

Similarly, ""STARE"" is excellent because it uses very common letters (S, T, A, R, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. 

I'll go with ""STARE"" as my first guess since it's slightly more balanced with consonants and vowels, and these letters appear in many possible 5-letter words.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, R, E are **not** in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (-)

So the secret word:
1. Definitely does NOT contain S, T, R, E.
2. Contains A, but A is NOT in the 3rd position.

Given that, I need a word that:
- Has no S, T, R, E
- Has A somewhere other than position 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

Good remaining common consonants include N, L, C, D, G, etc. Common vowels left: A, I, O, U.

A strategic choice would be a word like ""ALONG"" or ""CANAL"" but I need to ensure the A isn't in position 3.

""ALONG"" fits:
- No S, T, R, E
- A is in position 2 (good, since A can't be in position 3)
- Uses common letters L, O, N, G

This should give me good coverage of remaining letters while respecting the constraints.

From both pieces of feedback:

1. Letters that are **NOT** in the word: S, T, R, E, L, N, G.  
2. Letter that **IS** in the word and correctly placed: A in position 1 (first letter).  
3. Letter that is in the word but wrongly placed: O (cannot be in position 3).

So the secret word:
- Must start with A.
- Must contain O somewhere other than position 3.
- Must not contain S, T, R, E, L, N, G.

Remaining vowels: I, U.  
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we need a 5-letter word starting with A and containing O, let's look for common patterns like A _ O _ _ or A _ _ O _ or A _ _ _ O.

Possible combinations:
- ABODE (but D and E are ruled out)
- AFOUL (U is allowed, F and L are allowed but L is ruled out)
- ACORN (C, O, R, N, - but R, N are out)
- AZOTH (Z, O, T, H - but T is out)
- AUDIO (but D, I, O, U - D is allowed but I, O, U are fine)
- AXIOM (X, I, O, M - all letters allowed except M needs checking)

Looking at these:
- AUDIO: A (correct), U, D, I, O. D is allowed, but O is in position 4 (OK since it can't be in 3), I and U are allowed. Seems valid.
- AXIOM: A (correct), X, I, O, M. All letters are allowed (X, I, O, M not ruled out), and O is in position 4 (OK).

Between these, ""AUDIO"" seems more likely as it uses common letters after A.

But wait - let's verify the letters:
- Allowed letters: A (fixed in position 1), O (not in position 3), and any of B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for the other positions, plus I and U.
- AUDIO: A (correct), U, D, I, O. All letters are either allowed or correctly placed. O is in position 4 (not 3), so this fits perfectly.
