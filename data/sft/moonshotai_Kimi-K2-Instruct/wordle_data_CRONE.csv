- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

As this is my first guess, I have no prior feedback or constraints. The best initial strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - vowels heavy)

I'm going to choose ""CRANE"" because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE, I know:

- C is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 2.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.
- A is not in the word at all (and certainly not in position 3).

So the pattern looks like: C R _ N E.

I need a 5-letter word that starts with CR and ends with NE, and the third letter cannot be A.

Let me think of possibilities:
- CRONE (CR-ONE) – the third letter is O, not A, so this fits.
- CRANE – already ruled out because A is not allowed.
- CREEN – but E is already in position 5, and double E is possible but this is a less common word.
- CRINE – but ""crine"" is not a common English word (it's archaic Scottish for ""shrink"").
- CRONE is the most common and valid word that fits.

Thus, my next guess is CRONE.
