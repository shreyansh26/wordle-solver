Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that will give me maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English. The most common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these common letters. ""ARISE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Feedback recap:
- A (x) – not in the word at all.
- R (x) – not in the word at all.
- I (x) – not in the word at all.
- S (x) – not in the word at all.
- E (-) – the letter E is somewhere in the word, but it’s not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, or S.
- Does contain the letter E, but E is not the last letter.

To maximize information on the second guess, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses none of the eliminated letters (A, R, I, S).
2. Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
3. Includes other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, W, Y plus the known vowel E.

Common 5-letter words satisfying these constraints: “TOUCH” (but it lacks E), “TONEY” (contains E and new letters T, O, N, Y), and “BLEND” (B, L, N, D, E).  
“BLEND” seems ideal: it uses four fresh consonants (B, L, N, D) and places E in the 4th slot, which hasn’t been tested yet and is compatible with the feedback E(-).

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

1. Eliminated letters: A, R, I, S, B, D (they all got an ‘x’).
2. Present letters (but not yet pinned down):
   - E (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 4th or 5th position).  
   - L (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 2nd position).  
   - N (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 4th position).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, L, N exactly once each.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and L cannot be in position 2, N cannot be in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, S, B, D.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining unused vowels: O, U, Y (sometimes)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses the letters E, L, N once each (positions unknown).  
- Adds two fresh letters (consonants or vowels) that have not been eliminated.  
- Places E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Does not violate the positional restrictions already learned.

Simple candidate word that satisfies all: “CLONE”
C, O are new letters; positions: C L O N E
But wait – we already know L cannot be in position 2 (from BLEND feedback).  
In CLONE, L is in position 2 → violates the restriction.  So CLONE is invalid.

Next candidate: “GLEN” but it’s only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.  
Another candidate: “KNelt” – no, “N” is in position 4 there which is disallowed.  
Try “LENTO”: L E N T O
- letters used: L, E, N (all required), plus T, O (both allowed).  
- Check positional conflicts:
    – E is in 2nd position (allowed, since E can’t only be 4th/5th).  
    – L is in 1st position (allowed, since only 2nd is banned for L).  
    – N is in 3rd position (allowed, 4th is banned).  
Looks good.

Alternative: “TOLEN” – same letters, same compliance.  
Either is acceptable; I’ll go with LENTO.

Let’s gather what we now know after three guesses.

Eliminated letters (x): A, R, I, S, B, D, T.

Letters definitely present (- feedback, but wrong position):  
- E appears in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it got “-” in positions 4, 2, 2 respectively).  
- L appears in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it got “-” in 2, 1, 1).  
- N appears in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (it got “-” in 3, 3).  
- O appears in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So the constraints on the four known letters:
- E: can only be in position 1.
- L: can only be in positions 4 or 5.
- N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but 1 is already taken by E), so 2 or 5.
- O: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one each of E, L, N, O.  
2. Places E in position 1.  
3. Places L in 4 or 5.  
4. Places N in 2 or 5.  
5. Places O somewhere compatible with the above.  
6. Uses one additional unused consonant (possible candidates left: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s map possible valid placements:

If E = 1, then:
- L can be 4 or 5.
- N can be 2 or 5 (but must differ from L).

Case 1: L = 4, N = 2  
Word pattern: E N _ L _  
We need one more letter in position 3 and one letter in position 5, chosen from remaining unused consonants and ensuring O is placed too.

But we have four required letters (E, L, N, O) and only five slots, so the fifth letter must be one of the still-unused consonants. The four required letters already occupy positions 1, 2, 4, so O must go into 3 or 5.  
If O goes into 3: E N O L _ → then 5th letter must be an unused consonant.  
Example: E N O L K → ENOLK (but is that a valid word? No.)  
Example: E N O L F → ENOLF (not valid).  
Better: E N O L G → ENOLG (invalid).  

Case 2: L = 5, N = 2  
Pattern: E N _ _ L  
Again, O must go into 3 or 4, and we need one more consonant.  
Possible words:
- E N O _ L → ENOKL (invalid), ENOWL (invalid)  
- E N _ O L → EN G O L → ENGOL (valid word, British English variant of “ingle”).  

ENGOL is 5 letters, valid, and satisfies all constraints.

Let me double-check:
ENGOL  
E in position 1 (allowed).  
N in position 2 (allowed).  
G new, unused.  
O in position 4 (allowed).  
L in position 5 (allowed).  

Therefore ENGOL is a compliant candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English. The most common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these common letters. ""ARISE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
- A (x) – not in the word at all.
- R (x) – not in the word at all.
- I (x) – not in the word at all.
- S (x) – not in the word at all.
- E (-) – the letter E is somewhere in the word, but it’s not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, or S.
- Does contain the letter E, but E is not the last letter.

To maximize information on the second guess, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses none of the eliminated letters (A, R, I, S).
2. Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
3. Includes other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, W, Y plus the known vowel E.

Common 5-letter words satisfying these constraints: “TOUCH” (but it lacks E), “TONEY” (contains E and new letters T, O, N, Y), and “BLEND” (B, L, N, D, E).  
“BLEND” seems ideal: it uses four fresh consonants (B, L, N, D) and places E in the 4th slot, which hasn’t been tested yet and is compatible with the feedback E(-).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

1. Eliminated letters: A, R, I, S, B, D (they all got an ‘x’).
2. Present letters (but not yet pinned down):
   - E (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 4th or 5th position).  
   - L (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 2nd position).  
   - N (somewhere in the word, but definitely NOT in 4th position).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, L, N exactly once each.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and L cannot be in position 2, N cannot be in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, S, B, D.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining unused vowels: O, U, Y (sometimes)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses the letters E, L, N once each (positions unknown).  
- Adds two fresh letters (consonants or vowels) that have not been eliminated.  
- Places E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Does not violate the positional restrictions already learned.

Simple candidate word that satisfies all: “CLONE”
C, O are new letters; positions: C L O N E
But wait – we already know L cannot be in position 2 (from BLEND feedback).  
In CLONE, L is in position 2 → violates the restriction.  So CLONE is invalid.

Next candidate: “GLEN” but it’s only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.  
Another candidate: “KNelt” – no, “N” is in position 4 there which is disallowed.  
Try “LENTO”: L E N T O
- letters used: L, E, N (all required), plus T, O (both allowed).  
- Check positional conflicts:
    – E is in 2nd position (allowed, since E can’t only be 4th/5th).  
    – L is in 1st position (allowed, since only 2nd is banned for L).  
    – N is in 3rd position (allowed, 4th is banned).  
Looks good.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Eliminated letters (x): A, R, I, S, B, D, T, G.

Letters definitely present (- or ✓):
- E (-) appears in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it got ""-"" in 4, 2, 2, 1). This is impossible—there's no position left for E. This contradiction implies our previous interpretation was wrong. Re-examining the feedback:

ENGOL feedback: E(-) N(-) G(x) O(-) L(✓)

This means:
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 4.
- L is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So L = position 5 (✓).

Letters still in play: E, N, O (each must appear once), and we need one more consonant (from C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Positions filled:
- Position 5: L

Constraints for remaining letters:
- E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 1 or 5).
- N can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
- O can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).

We need to place E, N, O and one unused consonant in positions 1-4, ensuring no conflicts.

Possible patterns:
1. Position 1: N or O or consonant
2. Position 2: E or O or consonant
3. Position 3: E, N, O, or consonant
4. Position 4: E or N or consonant
5. Position 5: L (fixed)

One systematic way is to try placing E in position 2 (middle-start):
- E in 2: _ E _ _ L
Then N and O must go in 1, 3, or 4 with constraints:
- N cannot be in 2 (already), must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in 4 or 5, must be in 1 or 3.
Also need one more consonant.

Possible arrangement:
- Position 1: N
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: needs a consonant (unused: F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.)
This gives: N E O _ L → need consonant for position 4.

Valid word: NECKL (invalid), NEVOL (invalid), NEPOL (invalid), NEWOL (invalid), NEFOL (invalid).

Next try E in position 3:
- _ _ E _ L
Then O must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 4), and N must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is E, 4 is open).
Possible:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: N
- Position 4: consonant
Gives: O N E _ L → need consonant for 4.

Valid word: ONEWL (invalid), ONECL (invalid), ONEPL (invalid), ONEFL (invalid).

Next try E in position 4:
- _ _ _ E L
Then N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 2 or 4), O must be in 1, 2, or 3.
Possible:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: consonant
Gives: N O _ E L → need consonant for 3.

Valid word: N O C E L → NOCEL (invalid), N O V E L → NOVEL (valid!).

Check NOVEL:
- N: position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 5)
- O: position 2 (allowed, not 4 or 5)
- V: new unused consonant
- E: position 4 (allowed, not 1,2,3,5)
- L: position 5 (correct, from ✓)
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is NOVEL.
