Since this is my first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that will give me the most information about the letters in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, and to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize the amount of information gained.

Some excellent starting words include:
- CRATE (contains C, R, A, T, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers several vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S – not in the word (x)  
- L – in the word but wrong spot (-)  
- A – in the word but wrong spot (-)  
- T – not in the word (x)  
- E – in the word but wrong spot (-)

So the secret word contains the letters {L, A, E}, none of which are in the positions they occupied in SLATE (L in 2nd, A in 3rd, E in 5th).  
Letters ruled out entirely: {S, T}.

To maximize new information while re-using the known letters, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses L, A, E in different positions from before.
2. Avoids S and T.
3. Introduces new, common consonants.

Possible candidates:
- ALERT – reuses all three known letters and adds R; positions: A1, L2, E4 (all new). But A is now first; maybe okay.
- LEARN – also good, but A is second (used to be third).
- PLANE – P and N are new, positions L2, A3, E5 (A and E in old spots, so this is bad).
- REALM – R, M new; A1, E2, L5 (all new).
- LABEL – uses L twice; wastes a slot.

Between ALERT and REALM, REALM gives us the new consonants R and M, and all three known letters are in completely fresh positions (A1, E2, L5). That seems the most informative.

So I’ll choose REALM.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. Letters NOT in the secret word: S, T, R, M.

   • A – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE and REALM).  
   • L – in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5, which leaves only 1st or 3rd.

So far the pattern is: _ E _ _ _, with the set {A, L} among the remaining three slots.

   • keeps E in slot 2,  
   • tries L in slot 1 or 3,  
   • tries A in one of its still-allowed spots (1, 3, 5), and  
   • introduces two brand-new, common consonants.

Let’s try “LEACH”:
   Positions: 1 = L (still allowed), 2 = E (correct), 3 = A (allowed), 4 = C (new), 5 = H (new).

Check constraints:
   • L could be in 1st (still open).  
   • A could be in 3rd (still open).

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, M, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 2 fixed), A, L, C

Positions ruled out for each of those three remaining letters from prior guesses:

• A: must NOT be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLATE, REALM, LEACH)  
  → only possible spot left: position 5

• L: must NOT be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from SLATE, REALM, LEACH)  
  → only possible spot left: position 3

• C: must NOT be in position 4 (from LEACH)  
  → can still be in 1, 3, 5, but 3 is already taken by L, 5 is taken by A  
  → only possible spot left: position 1

So the pattern is forced to be:

C (1)  E (2)  L (3)  _ (4)  A (5)

Hence the only possible word that fits all constraints is

C E L _ A

That missing letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out and not yet placed elsewhere.  Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, N, P, V, Y, etc.

Looking at 5-letter English words matching C E L ? A:

- CELIA – but that’s a name and has I, which we haven’t tested; could be possible.  
- CELLA – a biological term; also possible.  
- CELSA – not common.  
- CELGA – not a word.  
- CELNA – not a word.  
- CELBA – not a word.  

The best/common choice is CELIA (the name, but allowed in Wordle lists) or CELLA.  CELLA is the more standard dictionary word (plural of cella).  However, many word lists accept CELIA.

But let me double-check with more common everyday words: “celeb” is 5 letters but ends in B.  That fits the pattern: C E L E B.

Wait, let me list:

- C E L E B – valid word (“celeb” short for celebrity).  
- C E L L A – valid word.

Both fit.  “Celeb” is more common in everyday usage.  Either way, both are valid.  I’ll choose CELEB because it introduces the new letter B, which hasn’t been tested yet and is common.

Therefore my next guess is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, and to avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize the amount of information gained.

Some excellent starting words include:
- CRATE (contains C, R, A, T, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers several vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

- L – in the word but wrong spot (-)  
- A – in the word but wrong spot (-)  
- T – not in the word (x)  
- E – in the word but wrong spot (-)

So the secret word contains the letters {L, A, E}, none of which are in the positions they occupied in SLATE (L in 2nd, A in 3rd, E in 5th).  
Letters ruled out entirely: {S, T}.

To maximize new information while re-using the known letters, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses L, A, E in different positions from before.
2. Avoids S and T.
3. Introduces new, common consonants.

Possible candidates:
- ALERT – reuses all three known letters and adds R; positions: A1, L2, E4 (all new). But A is now first; maybe okay.
- LEARN – also good, but A is second (used to be third).
- PLANE – P and N are new, positions L2, A3, E5 (A and E in old spots, so this is bad).
- REALM – R, M new; A1, E2, L5 (all new).
- LABEL – uses L twice; wastes a slot.

Between ALERT and REALM, REALM gives us the new consonants R and M, and all three known letters are in completely fresh positions (A1, E2, L5). That seems the most informative.

So I’ll choose REALM.

   • A – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE and REALM).  
   • L – in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5, which leaves only 1st or 3rd.

So far the pattern is: _ E _ _ _, with the set {A, L} among the remaining three slots.

Candidate consonants to test next (common ones not yet ruled out): C, D, N, G, H, P, B, V, K, etc.

I’d like a single word that:
   • keeps E in slot 2,  
   • tries L in slot 1 or 3,  
   • tries A in one of its still-allowed spots (1, 3, 5), and  
   • introduces two brand-new, common consonants.

Let’s try “LEACH”:
   Positions: 1 = L (still allowed), 2 = E (correct), 3 = A (allowed), 4 = C (new), 5 = H (new).

Check constraints:
   • L could be in 1st (still open).  
   • A could be in 3rd (still open).  
   • No disallowed letters (S, T, R, M already out).  
   • Two new consonants C and H.

Let’s update what we know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the secret word:  
S, T, R, M, H, B

Letters that **must** be in the secret word:  
- E (locked in position 2)  
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) – but the only remaining 5-letter positions are 1–5; A has been excluded from 1, 3, 4, 5 via prior feedback. That leaves **no possible place for A**, which is impossible.  
Therefore, my deduction must have an error.

Recheck A's allowed positions:

From SLATE (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From REALM (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From LEACH (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From CELEB (A unused)  

Hence A still can be positions 1, 4, or 5.

Likewise, L and C:

L: from SLATE (pos 2 wrong), REALM (pos 4 wrong), LEACH (pos 1 wrong), CELEB (pos 3 wrong) → only remaining positions: 5  
C: from LEACH (pos 4 wrong), CELEB (pos 1 wrong) → possible positions: 3, 5

So current constraints:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- L must be in position 5.
- C must be in position 3 (since 5 is taken by L).
- A must be in position 1 or 4 (from above).

That leaves two candidate patterns:

Pattern 1: A _ E C L (A in position 1)  
Pattern 2: _ E C A L (A in position 4)  

Now, the blank must be filled with a consonant not yet ruled out (not S, T, R, M, H, B). Remaining common consonants include D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s check English words:

- A E C L ? – no valid 5-letter word.  
- ? E C A L – yields one common word: DECAL (D is allowed).  
Another check:  
- G E C A L – uncommon, GE CAL not standard.  
- P E C A L – not standard.  

Thus the only remaining valid word meeting all constraints is DECAL.

Therefore, the next guess is DECAL.

<guess>DECAL</guess>",DECAL,"Let’s update what we know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the secret word:  
S, T, R, M, H, B

Letters that **must** be in the secret word:  
- E (locked in position 2)  
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) – but the only remaining 5-letter positions are 1–5; A has been excluded from 1, 3, 4, 5 via prior feedback. That leaves **no possible place for A**, which is impossible.  
Therefore, my deduction must have an error.

Recheck A's allowed positions:

From SLATE (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From REALM (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From LEACH (A was position 3 → wrong)  
From CELEB (A unused)  

Hence A still can be positions 1, 4, or 5.

Likewise, L and C:

L: from SLATE (pos 2 wrong), REALM (pos 4 wrong), LEACH (pos 1 wrong), CELEB (pos 3 wrong) → only remaining positions: 5  
C: from LEACH (pos 4 wrong), CELEB (pos 1 wrong) → possible positions: 3, 5

So current constraints:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- L must be in position 5.
- C must be in position 3 (since 5 is taken by L).
- A must be in position 1 or 4 (from above).

That leaves two candidate patterns:

Pattern 1: A _ E C L (A in position 1)  
Pattern 2: _ E C A L (A in position 4)  

Now, the blank must be filled with a consonant not yet ruled out (not S, T, R, M, H, B). Remaining common consonants include D, F, G, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Let’s check English words:

- A E C L ? – no valid 5-letter word.  
- ? E C A L – yields one common word: DECAL (D is allowed).  
Another check:  
- G E C A L – uncommon, GE CAL not standard.  
- P E C A L – not standard.  

Thus the only remaining valid word meeting all constraints is DECAL.

Therefore, the next guess is DECAL.",Guess 5: DECAL -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
