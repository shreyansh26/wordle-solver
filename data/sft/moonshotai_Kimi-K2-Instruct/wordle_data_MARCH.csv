moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,MARCH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are frequently used in English. A good starting word covers these letters without repeating any. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a solid baseline to interpret the feedback and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.

Key take-aways:
1. The word contains A and R, but neither is in the positions they occupied in AROSE.
2. The word has no O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
- Uses R somewhere other than position 2.
- Excludes O, S, E.

From the feedback on RANCH:
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word
- C(✓) – C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know the word has fixed letters:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

And it must contain R somewhere but not in position 1, and must not contain O, S, E, N.

The pattern is: _ A _ C H

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not O, S, E, N
- Include R somewhere (since we know R is in the word)
- Use remaining common letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Possible positions for R:
- Position 3: _ A R C H – but need to check if R in position 3 is allowed (no restriction)
- Position 5: already H, so no
- Position 1: R is excluded from position 1 (from R(-) in RANCH feedback)

So R must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ A R C H

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? A R C H where ? is any letter except O, S, E, N, and is not already used in positions 2,3,4,5.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Possible candidates:
- BAR CH
- DAR CH
- FAR CH
- GAR CH
- IAR CH – not valid (IARCH is not a word)
- KAR CH
- LAR CH
- MAR CH
- PAR CH
- TAR CH
- VAR CH
- WAR CH
- YAR CH

From these, the valid English words are:
- BAR CH – but ""BARCH"" is not a standard 5-letter word
- FAR CH – ""Farch"" is not standard
- GAR CH – ""Garch"" is not standard
- LAR CH – ""Larch"" is a valid word (type of tree)
- MAR CH – ""March"" is valid
- PAR CH – ""Parch"" is valid
- TAR CH – ""Tarch"" is not standard
- WAR CH – ""Warch"" is not standard
- YAR CH – ""Yarch"" is not standard

So valid candidates: LARCH, MARCH, PARCH

Among these, let's pick the most common one first: MARCH.

Let's verify:
- M: not excluded
- A: correct position 2
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- C: correct position 4
- H: correct position 5
- No O, S, E, N

This seems correct.

<guess>march</guess>",march,"From the feedback on RANCH:
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word
- C(✓) – C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- H(✓) – H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know the word has fixed letters:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

And it must contain R somewhere but not in position 1, and must not contain O, S, E, N.

The pattern is: _ A _ C H

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not O, S, E, N
- Include R somewhere (since we know R is in the word)
- Use remaining common letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Possible positions for R:
- Position 3: _ A R C H – but need to check if R in position 3 is allowed (no restriction)
- Position 5: already H, so no
- Position 1: R is excluded from position 1 (from R(-) in RANCH feedback)

So R must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ A R C H

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? A R C H where ? is any letter except O, S, E, N, and is not already used in positions 2,3,4,5.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y

Possible candidates:
- BAR CH
- DAR CH
- FAR CH
- GAR CH
- IAR CH – not valid (IARCH is not a word)
- KAR CH
- LAR CH
- MAR CH
- PAR CH
- TAR CH
- VAR CH
- WAR CH
- YAR CH

From these, the valid English words are:
- BAR CH – but ""BARCH"" is not a standard 5-letter word
- FAR CH – ""Farch"" is not standard
- GAR CH – ""Garch"" is not standard
- LAR CH – ""Larch"" is a valid word (type of tree)
- MAR CH – ""March"" is valid
- PAR CH – ""Parch"" is valid
- TAR CH – ""Tarch"" is not standard
- WAR CH – ""Warch"" is not standard
- YAR CH – ""Yarch"" is not standard

So valid candidates: LARCH, MARCH, PARCH

Among these, let's pick the most common one first: MARCH.

Let's verify:
- M: not excluded
- A: correct position 2
- R: position 3 (allowed)
- C: correct position 4
- H: correct position 5
- No O, S, E, N

This seems correct.",Guess 3: march -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
