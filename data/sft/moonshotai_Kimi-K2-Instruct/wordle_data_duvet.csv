For the first guess, it's optimal to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. A classic starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination allows us to test 5 unique letters that appear in many English words, giving us the best chance of identifying correct letters early.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

That leaves only E as a known letter.  
We also know none of C, R, A, N are present, so we should avoid those letters entirely.  
A good next guess should:
1. Include E in a new position.
2. Introduce other high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid any repeats of C, R, A, N.

High-frequency letters untested so far include: S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses E in position 3 or 5 (since it wasn’t in position 5 last time) and introduces S, T, L, O, I, etc.  
""STOLE"" uses S, T, O, L, E — all fresh letters except E, which we move from position 5 to 4.  
But ""STOLE"" might not be ideal because O and L are mid-frequency.  
A better balanced choice might be ""SLIDE"" (S, L, I, D, E) — covers common letters S, L, I, D, and shifts E to position 5 this time.

So ""SLIDE"" is a strong candidate.

2. SLIDE → S, L, I are out; D and E are both present but not in the positions we guessed.

Therefore:
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, L, I.
- Letters known to be in the word: D, E (still need their correct positions).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses D and E.
- Does NOT use C, R, A, N, S, L, I.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.
- Places D somewhere other than position 4 (since D(-) in position 4).

Let’s choose a word that places D in spot 1 or 2 and E in spot 2, 3 or 4.  
A good combination: D, E, plus T, O, H.  
Example: “DOTHE” – but that’s 6 letters and also has O in position 2, where E might fit.  

Let’s try shorter choices:
- “DEBUT” – but uses B, U, T (valid, but let’s see letters used).
- “DEPTH” – uses P, T, H.

From the new feedback on DEPTH:

- D is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 1) → D _ _ _ _
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from earlier, also not in 5 from CRANE).
- P and H are NOT in the word.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Letters ruled out so far: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, P, H.  
Letters confirmed in word: D (position 1), E, T.  
Letters still possible: B, F, G, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with D that includes E (but not in positions 2 or 5) and T (but not in position 4).  

Possible positions:
D _ _ _ _
E can be in 3 or 4.
T can be in 2, 3, 5.

Let’s try to place E in 3 and T in 2:
D T E _ _

Need two more letters from remaining pool (not C,R,A,N,S,L,I,P,H).  
Good candidates: B, F, G, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

“DT” isn’t a common start, but “DETOX” is invalid (has X, and O is allowed but X isn’t confirmed).  
Instead, let’s aim for D _ E T _ or similar.

Let’s try D W E T B – but “DWETB” isn’t a word.  
Let’s think of real words:  
“DUVET” – but V and U are allowed, but T is in position 4 here (invalid).  
“DEBUT” – but B is allowed, U is allowed, but E is in 2 (invalid).  
“DWELT” – but W, E, L, T; L is ruled out.  
“DETER” – but second E is in 2 (invalid), R is ruled out.  
“DEBIT” – but B, I, T; I is ruled out.  
“DEMOB” – but M, O, B; E is in 2 (invalid).  
“DEMOT” – similar issue with E in 2.  
“DUMPY” – but M, U, P, Y; P is ruled out.  

Let’s try placing T in 5 and E in 3:
D _ E _ T

Possible word: D W E L T – but L is ruled out.  
D U E T T – invalid (duplicate T).  
D O E R T – R is ruled out.  
D G E B T – “DGEBT” isn’t a word.  

Another approach: place T in 2 and E in 4:
D T _ E _

Possible word: D T U B E – “DTUBE” isn’t a word.  
D T O B E – “DTOBE” isn’t a word.  

Real word check: “DUCHY” – but no E or T.  
“DOUGH” – no E.  
“DOGME” – E in 5 (invalid).  

Let’s try E in 3 and T in 5:
D _ E _ T

Valid word: “DEXET” – no.  
“DOEST” – but O, E, S, T; S is ruled out.  
“DUETS” – S is ruled out.  

Wait, let’s list possible words starting with D and see which fit:
- D _ _ _ _ with E (not 2 or 5) and T (not 4).  
Valid English words:
- DOZEN – but Z isn’t tested, N is ruled out.  
- DOWEL – O, W, E, L; L is ruled out.  
- DUVET – U, V, E, T; but T is in 5 (allowed), E is in 4 (allowed). Wait, from DEPTH, E was in 2 (-), so 4 is new for E. T is in 5 here (allowed, since it was in 4 (-) in DEPTH).  
But earlier feedback: E cannot be in 5 (from CRANE) or 2 (from DEPTH), so 3 or 4.  
DUVET has E in 3 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed).  
Letters: D, U, V, E, T – none are ruled out except L, I, etc. which aren’t here.  

So DUVET fits:
- D in 1 (✓ from DEPTH).
- E in 3 (new position, allowed).
- T in 5 (new position, allowed).
- U and V are untested but not ruled out.

This seems valid.
