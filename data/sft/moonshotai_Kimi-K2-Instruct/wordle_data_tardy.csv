For the first guess, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices for this reason.

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants
- ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants
- ""CRANE"" contains C, R, A, N, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 of the 5 vowels and the very common consonants R and S, giving good coverage for initial elimination.

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- O, S, E, I, N are all absent.

Therefore we know:
- Word begins with T.  
- The letters used so far are T, A, R (present), all others from the two guesses are out.  
- A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
- R must be in positions 1 (already T), 4, or 5.  
- We still need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (no O,S,E,I,N).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U, Y (sometimes), but we only have A confirmed for a vowel so far.

Let’s try to place A and R. One straightforward pattern is:
T _ A _ R or T _ _ A R.

We need a third consonant in the middle. A common pattern is “T R A _ _” but R can’t be in 2. So perhaps T A R _ _.

Wait: T A R _ _ puts A in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 3 (NOT allowed). So that’s out.

Next viable pattern: T _ _ A R (A in 4, R in 5). We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet and not repeating any letters already excluded.

Good candidates: T, then a consonant, then another consonant, then A, R.

Let’s try “TUBAR” – but U is still allowed. Check all letters used: T, U, B, A, R. None of these are from the forbidden set {O,S,E,I,N}. Also positions:
T(1) (✓), U(2), B(3), A(4), R(5).

Next viable pattern: T _ _ A R (A in 4, R in 5). We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet and not repeating any letters already excluded.

Good candidates: T, then a consonant, then another consonant, then A, R.

Let’s try “TUBAR” – but U is still allowed. Check all letters used: T, U, B, A, R. None of these are from the forbidden set {O,S,E,I,N}. Also positions:
T(1) (✓), U(2), B(3), A(4), R(5).  
- A is in position 4 – fine (not 1 or 3).  
- R is in position 5 – fine (not 2 or 3).  

Looks valid.

Step-by-step analysis of all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   – O, S, E are **absent**

2. TRAIN → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   – T is **correctly placed** in position 1  
   – R is present but **not** in position 2 or 3  
   – A is present but **not** in position 3  
   – I, N are **absent**

3. TUBAR → T(✓) U(x) B(x) A(-) R(-)
   – T still correct in position 1  
   – U, B are **absent**  
   – A is present but **not** in position 4  
   – R is present but **not** in position 5  

Summary of what we now know:
- Fixed: T _ _ _ _
- Must include: A and R (and they cannot be in the positions already ruled out)
- Cannot include: O, S, E, I, N, U, B
- A must appear in position 2 or 5 (positions 1,3,4 are blocked for A)
- R must appear in position 4 or 5 (positions 1,2,3,5 are blocked for R)

Since A and R both need slots 4 or 5 but cannot both go there, the only consistent placement is:
- A in position 2  
- R in position 4  

Thus the pattern is: T A _ R _

Remaining letters to choose from (excluding all forbidden letters) must fill position 3. Available consonants include C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y. A common and useful choice is D, giving the word:

T A D R _
The fifth letter must be a new letter not yet used and not forbidden. Among the remaining ones, “Y” is handy and fits the pattern.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices for this reason.

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - covering 3 vowels and 2 common consonants
- ""SLATE"" contains S, L, A, T, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants
- ""CRANE"" contains C, R, A, N, E - covering 2 vowels and 3 common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 of the 5 vowels and the very common consonants R and S, giving good coverage for initial elimination.

- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in the 1st position

- O(x) : O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word  
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word  

So we must include A and R somewhere other than positions 1 and 2, and we must avoid O, S, E entirely.

Popular remaining vowels to try are I and U.  
Consonants still allowed include T, N, L, C, D, B, etc.

A common “second-guess” structure is to keep the revealed letters (A, R) while trying fresh consonants and vowels.  
Let’s try TRAIN:
- T: new consonant  
- R: confirmed present, placed in 3rd position (not 2nd)  
- A: confirmed present, placed in 2nd position (not 1st)  
- I: new vowel  
- N: new consonant  

Checks constraints:
- no O, S, E  
- R not in 2nd place  
- A not in 1st place  
- uses all-new letters except A,R

The new feedback tells us:

- T(✓) – fixed in position 1  
- A(✓) – fixed in position 2  
- R(-) – present in the word, but not in position 4  
- D(-) – present in the word, but not in position 3  
- Y(✓) – fixed in position 5  

So the revealed pattern is now:  
T A _ _ Y

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4, and we know:
- R must go somewhere other than position 4 → it can only be position 3  
- D must appear somewhere other than position 3 → it must be position 4  

No other letters are allowed if they were already excluded in prior rounds (O, S, E, I, N, U, B, and none of T, A, Y, R, D are excluded).

Thus the only remaining word that fits all constraints is:
T A R D Y
