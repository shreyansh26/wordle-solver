For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common English letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with several of these letters and avoid repeating letters to test as many different letters as possible.

Some good options:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it uses very common letters and no repeats.

So far we know:
- N is in the word and is in the 4th position.
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, E  
We know N is at position 4, so we need a word of the form: _ _ _ N _

Next, I should try a word that:
- Keeps N in the 4th spot
- Includes other common letters (especially T, O, I, S, H, L, M, D, U, G, P, etc.) that haven’t been tested yet
- Is still a valid 5-letter English word

Good candidates:
- POINT (but it has I and O, both untested, and places N correctly)
- SOUND (but places N correctly, uses S, O, U, D)
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T)

I’ll pick MOUNT because it tests M, O, U, T (all new letters) and keeps N in the 4th position.
