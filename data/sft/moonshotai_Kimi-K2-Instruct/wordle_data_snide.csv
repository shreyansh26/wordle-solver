For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A common strong starting word strategy is to use words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Looking at some optimal starting words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T), which should help quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in the secret word.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: S _ I _ E  (positions 1, 3, 5 fixed)
- Letters known to be in the word: S, I, E (in their correct positions)
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, P, N (from feedback)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (from SPINE feedback)

This creates a contradiction: N was marked ""-"" (in word but wrong position) in SPINE, but N wasn't used in positions 1,3,5 which are already fixed. So N must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 is already shown to be wrong (from SPINE), so N must be in position 2.

Therefore the word must be: S N I _ E
With remaining letters to test for position 4 (excluding already used/eliminated letters: L,A,T,R,P,N)

Available letters for position 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English words fitting S N I _ E:
- SNIDE (d is allowed)
- SNIVE (not a valid word)
- SNIGE (invalid)
- SNIRE (invalid, R excluded)
- SNICE (invalid)
- SNIZE (invalid)

""SNIDE"" appears to be the only valid word fitting S N I _ E pattern.

Let's verify: S N I D E
- S(✓) N(needs to be in word) I(✓) D(new letter) E(✓)
- Uses N in position 2 (which was shown as ""-"" in SIREN, meaning N is in word but not in position 5 - this checks out)
