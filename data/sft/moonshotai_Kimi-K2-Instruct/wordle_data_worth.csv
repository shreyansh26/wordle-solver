For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowel in English (A and E). This gives a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Feedback recap:
C (x) – not in the word at all  
R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
A (x), N (x), E (x) – none of these letters appear anywhere in the secret word  

Take-aways:
- The word contains R, but NOT in position 2.  
- It definitely does NOT contain C, A, N, or E.  

For the next guess we want:
1. To move R to a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5).  
2. To avoid C, A, N, E.  
3. To introduce other frequent consonants and one or two new vowels (since A and E are ruled out, possible vowels left are I, O, U, and occasionally Y).  

A strong choice that satisfies all of these is “DRIFT”:
- D and F are common consonants.  
- I and O are still possible vowels (we use I here).  
- R is shifted to position 2→3.  
- No C, A, N, E.  

Another solid option would be “FROST”, but “DRIFT” gives us two new vowel checks and keeps R in a different slot, so it feels slightly better for information gain.

From the two lines of feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- C, A, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: DRIFT → D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2 (same info) and now also not in position 3.  
- T exists somewhere, but not in position 5.  
- D, I, F are completely absent.

So the secret word:
- Must contain both R and T.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.  
- Must NOT contain any of: C, A, N, E, D, I, F.  

That leaves us with consonants: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
and vowels: O, U.

Most common remaining consonants: R, T, S, L, M, K, B, H, G, P, Y  
Most common remaining vowels: O, U.

We now need 5 letters that satisfy the constraints and place R and T in allowed positions.

Let’s look for a word that uses R, T, plus three of the remaining “good” letters (S, H, O, U, L, M, K, P, G, B, Y) and ensures:
- R is in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- T is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- No repeats and no excluded letters.

Possible candidate: “THROB”
- T in 1, H in 2, R in 3 → fails, R is forced to position 3 (forbidden).  
Possible candidate: “STORM”
- S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, M in 5.  
  Checks: R is in position 4 (allowed). T is in position 2 (allowed). Uses only allowed letters. No excluded letters. Looks good.

Another candidate: “TROOP” – but has two O’s (legal, but less informative).  
“SPORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → but T cannot be in 5 → fails.  
“TRUMP” – R is in 2 → fails.  
“SHIRT” – R in 4 (ok), T in 5 → fails (T can’t be 5).  
“SHORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → fails.  
“TROMS” → not a valid English word.  

So “STORM” seems the best valid word satisfying every constraint.

  Checks: R is in position 4 (allowed). T is in position 2 (allowed). Uses only allowed letters. No excluded letters. Looks good.

Another candidate: “TROOP” – but has two O’s (legal, but less informative).  
“SPORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → but T cannot be in 5 → fails.  
“TRUMP” – R is in 2 → fails.  
“SHIRT” – R in 4 (ok), T in 5 → fails (T can’t be 5).  
“SHORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → fails.  
“TROMS” → not a valid English word.  

So “STORM” seems the best valid word satisfying every constraint.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters confirmed present:
- R — must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- T — must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from DRIFT and STORM feedback).
  Therefore the only slot left for T is position 1.

Letters confirmed absent:
C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M (plus earlier C, A, N, E).

So the secret word:
- Starts with T.
- Contains R (but R can’t be in 2 or 3, so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Contains O (from STORM feedback O(-) indicates it’s in the word, not in position 3, so O must be in position 2 or 4 or 5).
- Does NOT contain any of C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M.

Available letters pool:
Vowels left: O, U  
Consonants left: B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z (plus R, T already used)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Begins with T.
- Has R in position 4 or 5.
- Has O somewhere among positions 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate words fitting this pattern:
- T _ R _ _  but R must be in 4 or 5, so positions 2 and 3 are open for other letters.
- T _ _ R _  (R in 4)
- T _ _ _ R  (R in 5)

Let’s look for common English words.

Try T _ O R _ or T _ _ R O, etc.

From allowed letters:
- Position 2: O, U
- Position 3: any remaining consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Possible examples:
- TORCH — but C is ruled out.
- TOWER — W, E, R → E is ruled out.
- TOYER — but Y is allowed, E is not.
- TROOP — O can repeat, but O is allowed; but P is allowed. But word has repeated O. Acceptable but maybe not optimal.
- TUBER — U is allowed, B, E, R — but E is ruled out.
- TURBO — U, R, B, O — all allowed letters. Positions: T(1), U(2), R(3) — but R cannot be in 3 (from earlier). So invalid.
- TUBAR — not a common word.
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TAPOR — not common.
- TROPY — Y is allowed, but not a common word.
- TROOP — valid word, but has repeated O. Let’s check its letters: T, R, O, O, P. All letters allowed, and positions: T(1), R(2) — but R can’t be in 2. So invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list:

We need:
T _ _ _ _

R is in 4 or 5.

O is somewhere among 2,4,5 (but not 3).

Let’s try:

Case 1: R in 4
Then word is T _ _ R _
O must fit in 2 or 5. (Cannot be 3 or 4)
So:
T O _ R _  or T _ _ R O

Available consonants for _ : B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z

Valid words:
- TOKER — E is ruled out.
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBER — E is ruled out.
- TIGER — I is ruled out, E is ruled out.
- TOWER — E is ruled out.
- TYPER — Y, P, E, R — E is ruled out.
- TROOP — already saw R is in 2, invalid.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.

Hmm, none of these work due to E.

Case 2: R in 5
Then word is T _ _ _ R
O must fit in 2 or 4 (not 3).

So:
T O _ _ R  or T _ _ O R

Possible:
- TOKOR — not valid.
- TUBOR — not valid.
- TOPAR — not valid.
- TOBOR — not valid.
- TOLAR — not valid.
- TAMER — M and E ruled out.
- TULIP — I is ruled out.
- TUTOR — U is allowed, T is allowed, O is allowed, R is allowed. Word is TUTOR.
  Check positions: T(1), U(2), T(3) — but T is already in 1, and we’re not sure if letters can repeat, but the game allows repeats. However, TUTOR has two T’s, which is allowed.
  But T can’t be in position 3 because earlier feedback only restricts T from positions 2,3,4,5 except position 1 is confirmed. So T in 3 is allowed? Wait, no — the earlier feedback:
  - From DRIFT: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 4 (since in DRIFT, T was in 5 and got (-), so T not in 5).
  - From STORM: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 2 (since T was in 2 in STORM and got (-)).
  - Therefore T is allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4? Wait no:
    - DRIFT: T was in 5 → (-) so T not in 5.
    - STORM: T was in 2 → (-) so T not in 2.
    - So T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
  So TUTOR has T in 1 and 3 — both allowed positions. All letters allowed. So TUTOR is valid.

Another possibility:
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.
- TONER — N, E ruled out.
- TUBAR — not common.
- TUMOR — M is ruled out.
- TYPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBOR — not a word.
- TURBO — R is in 3, which is forbidden.

So the only valid word left seems to be TUTOR.

Let’s verify:
Letters: T, U, T, O, R.
- T is in 1 and 3 — allowed positions.
- U is allowed.
- O is allowed.
- R is in 5 — allowed.
- No excluded letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowel in English (A and E). This gives a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:
C (x) – not in the word at all  
R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
A (x), N (x), E (x) – none of these letters appear anywhere in the secret word  

Take-aways:
- The word contains R, but NOT in position 2.  
- It definitely does NOT contain C, A, N, or E.  

For the next guess we want:
1. To move R to a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5).  
2. To avoid C, A, N, E.  
3. To introduce other frequent consonants and one or two new vowels (since A and E are ruled out, possible vowels left are I, O, U, and occasionally Y).  

A strong choice that satisfies all of these is “DRIFT”:
- D and F are common consonants.  
- I and O are still possible vowels (we use I here).  
- R is shifted to position 2→3.  
- No C, A, N, E.  

Another solid option would be “FROST”, but “DRIFT” gives us two new vowel checks and keeps R in a different slot, so it feels slightly better for information gain.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: DRIFT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two lines of feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- C, A, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: DRIFT → D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2 (same info) and now also not in position 3.  
- T exists somewhere, but not in position 5.  
- D, I, F are completely absent.

So the secret word:
- Must contain both R and T.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.  
- Must NOT contain any of: C, A, N, E, D, I, F.  

That leaves us with consonants: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
and vowels: O, U.

Most common remaining consonants: R, T, S, L, M, K, B, H, G, P, Y  
Most common remaining vowels: O, U.

We now need 5 letters that satisfy the constraints and place R and T in allowed positions.

Let’s look for a word that uses R, T, plus three of the remaining “good” letters (S, H, O, U, L, M, K, P, G, B, Y) and ensures:
- R is in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- T is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- No repeats and no excluded letters.

Possible candidate: “THROB”
- T in 1, H in 2, R in 3 → fails, R is forced to position 3 (forbidden).  
Possible candidate: “STORM”
- S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, M in 5.  
  Checks: R is in position 4 (allowed). T is in position 2 (allowed). Uses only allowed letters. No excluded letters. Looks good.

Another candidate: “TROOP” – but has two O’s (legal, but less informative).  
“SPORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → but T cannot be in 5 → fails.  
“TRUMP” – R is in 2 → fails.  
“SHIRT” – R in 4 (ok), T in 5 → fails (T can’t be 5).  
“SHORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → fails.  
“TROMS” → not a valid English word.  

So “STORM” seems the best valid word satisfying every constraint.

- TROOP — valid word, but has repeated O. Let’s check its letters: T, R, O, O, P. All letters allowed, and positions: T(1), R(2) — but R can’t be in 2. So invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list:

We need:
T _ _ _ _

R is in 4 or 5.

O is somewhere among 2,4,5 (but not 3).

Let’s try:

Case 1: R in 4
Then word is T _ _ R _
O must fit in 2 or 5. (Cannot be 3 or 4)
So:
T O _ R _  or T _ _ R O

Available consonants for _ : B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z

Valid words:
- TOKER — E is ruled out.
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBER — E is ruled out.
- TIGER — I is ruled out, E is ruled out.
- TOWER — E is ruled out.
- TYPER — Y, P, E, R — E is ruled out.
- TROOP — already saw R is in 2, invalid.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.

Hmm, none of these work due to E.

Case 2: R in 5
Then word is T _ _ _ R
O must fit in 2 or 4 (not 3).

So:
T O _ _ R  or T _ _ O R

Possible:
- TOKOR — not valid.
- TUBOR — not valid.
- TOPAR — not valid.
- TOBOR — not valid.
- TOLAR — not valid.
- TAMER — M and E ruled out.
- TULIP — I is ruled out.
- TUTOR — U is allowed, T is allowed, O is allowed, R is allowed. Word is TUTOR.
  Check positions: T(1), U(2), T(3) — but T is already in 1, and we’re not sure if letters can repeat, but the game allows repeats. However, TUTOR has two T’s, which is allowed.
  But T can’t be in position 3 because earlier feedback only restricts T from positions 2,3,4,5 except position 1 is confirmed. So T in 3 is allowed? Wait, no — the earlier feedback:
  - From DRIFT: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 4 (since in DRIFT, T was in 5 and got (-), so T not in 5).
  - From STORM: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 2 (since T was in 2 in STORM and got (-)).
  - Therefore T is allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4? Wait no:
    - DRIFT: T was in 5 → (-) so T not in 5.
    - STORM: T was in 2 → (-) so T not in 2.
    - So T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
  So TUTOR has T in 1 and 3 — both allowed positions. All letters allowed. So TUTOR is valid.

Another possibility:
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.
- TONER — N, E ruled out.
- TUBAR — not common.
- TUMOR — M is ruled out.
- TYPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBOR — not a word.
- TURBO — R is in 3, which is forbidden.

So the only valid word left seems to be TUTOR.

Let’s verify:
Letters: T, U, T, O, R.
- T is in 1 and 3 — allowed positions.
- U is allowed.
- O is allowed.
- R is in 5 — allowed.
- No excluded letters.

Let's digest each piece of feedback step by step.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. DRIFT → D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 3 (it was in 2 and got (-), so now we know it’s not in 2 or 3).  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 5.  
   - D, I, F absent.

3. STORM → S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 2 (it was in 2 and got (-)).  
   - O is somewhere, but not in position 3.  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 4 (it was in 4 and got (-)).  
   - S, M absent.

4. TUTOR → T(-) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 1 (it was in 1 and got (-)).  
   - U is absent.  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 3 (it was in 3 and got (-)).  
   - O is somewhere, but not in position 4.  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 5 (it was in 5 and got (-)).

Summary of constraints
- Letters that must appear: R, T, O
- Letters that must NOT appear: C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M, U
- Position constraints:
  – R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → only possible position: 1
  – T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → only possible position: 4
  – O cannot be in positions 3, 4 → possible positions: 2 or 5

So the three forced letters are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 4: T
- Position 2 or 5: O

Letters still allowed (besides R, T, O):
Consonants: B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: none left (only O is possible)

We need two more letters (positions 3 and either 5 or 2) from the remaining consonants.  
Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: R O _ T _
We need a consonant in position 3 and another in 5, both from {B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z}.

Valid 5-letter words of this form:
ROKTY – not a common word  
ROBTH – invalid  
ROBHT – invalid  
ROBET – E is forbidden  
ROGUT – U is forbidden  
ROPYL – not a word  

Pattern 2: R _ _ T O
We need consonants in positions 2 and 3.

Again, search for common 5-letter words starting R _ _ T O:
R H Y T O – not a word  
R B G T O – not a word  
R L B T O – not a word  

But one actual word matches: RHYTO – no, not in dictionary.

Wait, let’s systematically scan a word list for R _ _ T O.  
A real word that comes up is “ROYTH” – no.  
Another is “ROBTO” – no.  

However, the consonant pair “H” and “Y” gives us “RHYTO” – still not valid.

We need to look again carefully. Let me try each consonant in turn:

R B _ T O → RB?TO – nothing  
R G _ T O → RG?TO – nothing  
R H _ T O → RH?TO – nothing  
R K _ T O → RK?TO – nothing  
R L _ T O → RL?TO – nothing  
R P _ T O → RP?TO – nothing  
R W _ T O → RW?TO – nothing  
R Y _ T O → RY?TO – nothing

None of these produce a valid English word.

But let’s check “ROBTO” again – no.  
“ROKTO” – no.  
“ROGTO” – no.  

Actually, the correct pattern is R _ _ T O, and the only valid English word that fits all constraints is **ROBOT**.

Check:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- B is a valid consonant not yet excluded.  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed).  
All letters used are within the allowed set and satisfy position constraints.

Therefore, the next (and logically final) guess is ROBOT.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes very common consonants (C, R, N) and the most common vowel in English (A and E). This gives a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

3. To introduce other frequent consonants and one or two new vowels (since A and E are ruled out, possible vowels left are I, O, U, and occasionally Y).  

A strong choice that satisfies all of these is “DRIFT”:
- D and F are common consonants.  
- I and O are still possible vowels (we use I here).  
- R is shifted to position 2→3.  
- No C, A, N, E.  

Another solid option would be “FROST”, but “DRIFT” gives us two new vowel checks and keeps R in a different slot, so it feels slightly better for information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRIFT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two lines of feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- C, A, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: DRIFT → D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)  
- R exists somewhere, but not in position 2 (same info) and now also not in position 3.  
- T exists somewhere, but not in position 5.  
- D, I, F are completely absent.

So the secret word:
- Must contain both R and T.  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- T cannot be in position 5.  
- Must NOT contain any of: C, A, N, E, D, I, F.  

That leaves us with consonants: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
and vowels: O, U.

Most common remaining consonants: R, T, S, L, M, K, B, H, G, P, Y  
Most common remaining vowels: O, U.

We now need 5 letters that satisfy the constraints and place R and T in allowed positions.

Let’s look for a word that uses R, T, plus three of the remaining “good” letters (S, H, O, U, L, M, K, P, G, B, Y) and ensures:
- R is in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- T is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- No repeats and no excluded letters.

Possible candidate: “THROB”
- T in 1, H in 2, R in 3 → fails, R is forced to position 3 (forbidden).  
Possible candidate: “STORM”
- S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, M in 5.  
  Checks: R is in position 4 (allowed). T is in position 2 (allowed). Uses only allowed letters. No excluded letters. Looks good.

Another candidate: “TROOP” – but has two O’s (legal, but less informative).  
“SPORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → but T cannot be in 5 → fails.  
“TRUMP” – R is in 2 → fails.  
“SHIRT” – R in 4 (ok), T in 5 → fails (T can’t be 5).  
“SHORT” – R in 4, T in 5 → fails.  
“TROMS” → not a valid English word.  

So “STORM” seems the best valid word satisfying every constraint.

<guess>STORM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

Guess 3: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Letters confirmed present:
- R — must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- T — must be somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from DRIFT and STORM feedback).
  Therefore the only slot left for T is position 1.

Letters confirmed absent:
C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M (plus earlier C, A, N, E).

So the secret word:
- Starts with T.
- Contains R (but R can’t be in 2 or 3, so it must be in 4 or 5).
- Contains O (from STORM feedback O(-) indicates it’s in the word, not in position 3, so O must be in position 2 or 4 or 5).
- Does NOT contain any of C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M.

Available letters pool:
Vowels left: O, U  
Consonants left: B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z (plus R, T already used)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Begins with T.
- Has R in position 4 or 5.
- Has O somewhere among positions 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate words fitting this pattern:
- T _ R _ _  but R must be in 4 or 5, so positions 2 and 3 are open for other letters.
- T _ _ R _  (R in 4)
- T _ _ _ R  (R in 5)

Let’s look for common English words.

Try T _ O R _ or T _ _ R O, etc.

From allowed letters:
- Position 2: O, U
- Position 3: any remaining consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

Possible examples:
- TORCH — but C is ruled out.
- TOWER — W, E, R → E is ruled out.
- TOYER — but Y is allowed, E is not.
- TROOP — O can repeat, but O is allowed; but P is allowed. But word has repeated O. Acceptable but maybe not optimal.
- TUBER — U is allowed, B, E, R — but E is ruled out.
- TURBO — U, R, B, O — all allowed letters. Positions: T(1), U(2), R(3) — but R cannot be in 3 (from earlier). So invalid.
- TUBAR — not a common word.
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TAPOR — not common.
- TROPY — Y is allowed, but not a common word.
- TROOP — valid word, but has repeated O. Let’s check its letters: T, R, O, O, P. All letters allowed, and positions: T(1), R(2) — but R can’t be in 2. So invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically list:

We need:
T _ _ _ _

R is in 4 or 5.

O is somewhere among 2,4,5 (but not 3).

Let’s try:

Case 1: R in 4
Then word is T _ _ R _
O must fit in 2 or 5. (Cannot be 3 or 4)
So:
T O _ R _  or T _ _ R O

Available consonants for _ : B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z

Valid words:
- TOKER — E is ruled out.
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBER — E is ruled out.
- TIGER — I is ruled out, E is ruled out.
- TOWER — E is ruled out.
- TYPER — Y, P, E, R — E is ruled out.
- TROOP — already saw R is in 2, invalid.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.

Hmm, none of these work due to E.

Case 2: R in 5
Then word is T _ _ _ R
O must fit in 2 or 4 (not 3).

So:
T O _ _ R  or T _ _ O R

Possible:
- TOKOR — not valid.
- TUBOR — not valid.
- TOPAR — not valid.
- TOBOR — not valid.
- TOLAR — not valid.
- TAMER — M and E ruled out.
- TULIP — I is ruled out.
- TUTOR — U is allowed, T is allowed, O is allowed, R is allowed. Word is TUTOR.
  Check positions: T(1), U(2), T(3) — but T is already in 1, and we’re not sure if letters can repeat, but the game allows repeats. However, TUTOR has two T’s, which is allowed.
  But T can’t be in position 3 because earlier feedback only restricts T from positions 2,3,4,5 except position 1 is confirmed. So T in 3 is allowed? Wait, no — the earlier feedback:
  - From DRIFT: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 4 (since in DRIFT, T was in 5 and got (-), so T not in 5).
  - From STORM: T(-) means T is in word, not in position 2 (since T was in 2 in STORM and got (-)).
  - Therefore T is allowed in positions 1, 3, or 4? Wait no:
    - DRIFT: T was in 5 → (-) so T not in 5.
    - STORM: T was in 2 → (-) so T not in 2.
    - So T can be in 1, 3, or 4.
  So TUTOR has T in 1 and 3 — both allowed positions. All letters allowed. So TUTOR is valid.

Another possibility:
- TOPER — E is ruled out.
- TOYER — E is ruled out.
- TONER — N, E ruled out.
- TUBAR — not common.
- TUMOR — M is ruled out.
- TYPER — E is ruled out.
- TUBOR — not a word.
- TURBO — R is in 3, which is forbidden.

So the only valid word left seems to be TUTOR.

Let’s verify:
Letters: T, U, T, O, R.
- T is in 1 and 3 — allowed positions.
- U is allowed.
- O is allowed.
- R is in 5 — allowed.
- No excluded letters.

Guess 4: TUTOR -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's digest each piece of feedback step by step.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. DRIFT → D(x) R(-) I(x) F(x) T(-)  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 3 (it was in 2 and got (-), so now we know it’s not in 2 or 3).  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 5.  
   - D, I, F absent.

3. STORM → S(x) T(-) O(-) R(-) M(x)  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 2 (it was in 2 and got (-)).  
   - O is somewhere, but not in position 3.  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 4 (it was in 4 and got (-)).  
   - S, M absent.

4. TUTOR → T(-) U(x) T(-) O(-) R(-)  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 1 (it was in 1 and got (-)).  
   - U is absent.  
   - T is somewhere, but not in position 3 (it was in 3 and got (-)).  
   - O is somewhere, but not in position 4.  
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 5 (it was in 5 and got (-)).

Summary of constraints
- Letters that must appear: R, T, O
- Letters that must NOT appear: C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M, U
- Position constraints:
  – R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 → only possible position: 1
  – T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 → only possible position: 4
  – O cannot be in positions 3, 4 → possible positions: 2 or 5

So the three forced letters are:
- Position 1: R
- Position 4: T
- Position 2 or 5: O

Letters still allowed (besides R, T, O):
Consonants: B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: none left (only O is possible)

We need two more letters (positions 3 and either 5 or 2) from the remaining consonants.  
Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: R O _ T _
We need a consonant in position 3 and another in 5, both from {B, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z}.

Valid 5-letter words of this form:
ROKTY – not a common word  
ROBTH – invalid  
ROBHT – invalid  
ROBET – E is forbidden  
ROGUT – U is forbidden  
ROPYL – not a word  

Pattern 2: R _ _ T O
We need consonants in positions 2 and 3.

Again, search for common 5-letter words starting R _ _ T O:
R H Y T O – not a word  
R B G T O – not a word  
R L B T O – not a word  

But one actual word matches: RHYTO – no, not in dictionary.

Wait, let’s systematically scan a word list for R _ _ T O.  
A real word that comes up is “ROYTH” – no.  
Another is “ROBTO” – no.  

However, the consonant pair “H” and “Y” gives us “RHYTO” – still not valid.

We need to look again carefully. Let me try each consonant in turn:

R B _ T O → RB?TO – nothing  
R G _ T O → RG?TO – nothing  
R H _ T O → RH?TO – nothing  
R K _ T O → RK?TO – nothing  
R L _ T O → RL?TO – nothing  
R P _ T O → RP?TO – nothing  
R W _ T O → RW?TO – nothing  
R Y _ T O → RY?TO – nothing

None of these produce a valid English word.

But let’s check “ROBTO” again – no.  
“ROKTO” – no.  
“ROGTO” – no.  

Actually, the correct pattern is R _ _ T O, and the only valid English word that fits all constraints is **ROBOT**.

Check:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- B is a valid consonant not yet excluded.  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed).  
All letters used are within the allowed set and satisfy position constraints.

Therefore, the next (and logically final) guess is ROBOT.

Let's process the latest feedback from ROBOT:

R(-) O(✓) B(x) O(-) T(-)

- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- O is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
- B is not in the word at all.
- The second O is in the word but not in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
1. Letters present: R, O, T
2. Letters absent: C, A, N, E, D, I, F, S, M, U, B
3. Position constraints:
   - O is fixed in position 2.
   - R must be in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1.
   - T must be in positions 1,2,3,4 but not 5.
4. The word structure so far:
   _ O _ _ _

From the remaining consonants (G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, W, Y, Z) and vowels (only O is present), we need to place R and T in the remaining positions while respecting their constraints.

Since O is fixed in position 2 and R cannot be in position 1, possible placements:
- R could be in 3,4, or 5
- T could be in 1,3,4 (but not 5)

Let's consider possible positions for T:
Case 1: T in position 1
Word structure: T O _ _ _
Then R must be in 3,4, or 5. We've tried T O R _ _ but need two more consonants from remaining letters (G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,W,Y,Z). Possible words like TOGRY - invalid.

Case 2: T in position 3
Word structure: _ O T _ _
R must be in 4 or 5. Possible words like G O T R Y - invalid.

Case 3: T in position 4
Word structure: _ O _ T _
R must be in 3 or 5. 

Looking at _ O R T _:
We need a consonant for position 1 from remaining letters (G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,W,Y,Z). The only valid word here is ""HORTA"" - but A is excluded.

Looking at _ O _ T R:
We need consonants for positions 1 and 3. Possible combinations:
- G O K T R - invalid
- H O K T R - invalid
- L O K T R - invalid
- P O K T R - invalid
- W O K T R - invalid
- Y O K T R - invalid

Wait, let's try different consonants. The only valid English word that fits is ""WORTY"" - but not valid.

Upon closer inspection, the only remaining possible combination is:
_ O R T _
With position 1 being H: ""HORTO"" - invalid.

Actually, the correct word is ""HORST"" - but S is excluded.

Realizing there's only one valid word left: ""PORTY"" - but P,O,R,T,Y - checking:
P is allowed, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, Y in 5 - but this doesn't match our constraints as T needs to be in 1,3,4.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid word that fits all constraints is:
_ O _ T R
With positions 1 and 3 needing consonants. The valid word is ""GORTY"" - but not common.

Wait, let's systematically check:
We need a word with:
- O in position 2
- R somewhere (not position 1)
- T somewhere (not position 5)
- Letters from G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,W,Y,Z

The valid word is ""HORST"" - but S is excluded.

Realizing the only possible combination is ""PORTY"" but P,O,R,T,Y - checking positions:
P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
- O is correctly in position 2
- R is in 3 (allowed)
- T is in 4 (allowed)
- All letters are from allowed set (P,Y are allowed)
- No excluded letters
