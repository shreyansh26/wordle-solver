For the first guess, since we have no information about the secret word, we should choose a word that covers a variety of common letters. This helps maximize the information we gain from the feedback. 

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a very common consonant
- A: a very common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback.

- has R in the 2nd slot

A (showed up as “-” twice, so it is somewhere except positions 3 and 4)

Remaining common letters we have not yet tried: D, I, L, T, U, O, Y, B, F, H, K, M, V, W, etc.

We need a five-letter word:
- 2nd letter must be R
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 and 4
- Does NOT contain any of C, N, E, G, S, P
- Uses additional new letters to maximize information

The only positions left for A are positions 1 or 5.

Candidate words:

- MURAL – M,U,L new, A in pos 4 (forbidden from grasp feedback)
- ULTRA – U,L,T new, A in pos 5 allowed, R in pos 4 (position 2 is R; would conflict)

From the new feedback we now know:

- Position 2 is definitely R.
- The word contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1, 3 or 4 (from the three guesses it has always been “-”).
  Therefore A must be in position 5.
- The word contains I, but I is NOT in position 4 (from the last guess it is “-”).
- The word does NOT contain C, N, E, G, S, P, O, D (all received x at least once).

So the hidden word has the pattern:
_ R _ _ A

with I somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 5 is A).

We still need to test additional common consonants. Remaining unused letters include B, F, H, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- has R in position 2
- has A in position 5
- has I in position 3 or 4
- contains none of the forbidden letters (C,N,E,G,S,P,O,D)

Possible candidates:
- BRIAR – A in 5, R in 2, I in 3; B and new letters B, I (I already known)
- TRIAL – A in 5, R in 2, I in 4; T new
- CRIER – C forbidden
- FRIAR – F new, I in 3
- PRIAM – P forbidden
- URIAL – U new, I in 4
- BRIAR fits perfectly and introduces the new consonant B.

BRIAR satisfies every constraint:
- B(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) A(5) – wait, that’s 6 letters? No, positions are 1-5.
Word spelling: B-R-I-A-R → 5 letters, A is in 4, but we decided A must be in 5.

Oops – my candidate BRIAR has A in 4 which is forbidden. Let me correct.

Correct candidates with A in 5:
- TRIAL – T(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) L(5) – but A must be in 5, so A(5) is correct, but then I can’t be in 4 if A is in 5. Let me re-correct pattern.

Pattern we need: _ R _ _ A
And I must appear in one of the blanks.

So:
- positions 1,3,4 are to be filled with I and two new consonants.

Candidate words:
- TRIAL → pattern T R I A L → A in 4, but A must be in 5 – not valid
- BRIAR → pattern B R I A R → A in 4 – not valid
- CRIBS → C forbidden
- FRIAR → A in 4 – not valid

We need a word ending in A with R in position 2 and I somewhere in 3 or 4. Examples:
- TRINA – ends in A, R in 2, I in 4 – but N forbidden
- PRIMA – P forbidden
- BRIDA – D forbidden
- URIAL – ends in A, R in 2, I in 3 – but U, I, A, L, R – all allowed

Correct pattern must be _ R _ _ A.

So:

Searching common words:

- BRAVA has two As – invalid.
- CRURA – C forbidden
- PRANA – P forbidden
- ORIBA – O forbidden
- FRISA – S forbidden
- URIAL – A in 4 – not 5
- TRIBA – B new, I in 4, A in 5 – valid.

TRIBA:

- R in 2 ✓
- A in 5 ✓
- I in 3 (allowed) ✓
- Letters T, B are new and allowed ✓

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,FRIAR,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since we have no information about the secret word, we should choose a word that covers a variety of common letters. This helps maximize the information we gain from the feedback. 

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a very common consonant
- A: a very common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback.

So the hidden word:
- has R in the 2nd slot  
- contains A somewhere except slot 3  
- does NOT contain C, N, E  

We still need to test additional common consonants and vowels.  
Good next candidates should keep R in slot 2, avoid C/N/E, and place A in a different position.  
The word “GRASP”:
- G, S, P are frequent consonants we haven’t tried  
- Puts A into slot 4 (different from position 3)  
- Keeps R in slot 2  
- Avoids C, N, E  

This should give new information while respecting all constraints.

A (showed up as “-” twice, so it is somewhere except positions 3 and 4)

Remaining common letters we have not yet tried: D, I, L, T, U, O, Y, B, F, H, K, M, V, W, etc.

- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 and 4
- Does NOT contain any of C, N, E, G, S, P
- Uses additional new letters to maximize information

The only positions left for A are positions 1 or 5.

Candidate words:

Current constraints derived from all feedback:

1. Position 2 is R (✓ in every guess).
2. Position 5 cannot be A (A received “-” in guess 4).
3. Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4 (it has appeared “-” in every other position).
4. Position 3 is now known to be I (✓ in guess 4).
5. So the hidden word pattern is: _ R I _ _
6. Position 5 must be the remaining spot for A: _ R I _ A
   (A cannot be in 1,2,3,4,5 has been seen as “-” only in 5, so 5 is the only spot left; contradiction?)
   Wait: let’s list every forbidden position for A:
   - Guess 1: A in 3 (-) → A ≠ 3
   - Guess 2: A in 3 (-) → A ≠ 3
   - Guess 3: A in 1 (-) → A ≠ 1
   - Guess 4: A in 5 (-) → A ≠ 5
   - Guess 3: A in 4 (-) from aroid (a r o i d → A(-) means A is not in 4)
   Therefore A can only be in position 2, but position 2 is R.  
   This appears impossible — but we also have to remember that the feedback “-” means “in the word but wrong position,” not “not in that position forever.”  
   Re-examining guess 4: triba → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) B(x) A(-)
   The “A(-)” tells us A is in the word but not in position 5.  
   That leaves positions 1,3,4 for A.  
   From earlier:
   - A was “-” in position 3 (crane & grasp) → A ≠ 3  
   - A was “-” in position 1 (aroid) → A ≠ 1  
   - Therefore A must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ R I A _

Letters already confirmed/eliminated:
- present: R (pos 2), I (pos 3), A (pos 4)
- impossible letters: C, N, E, G, S, P, O, D, T, B

Remaining unused common consonants for position 1 and 5: F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since we have no information about the secret word, we should choose a word that covers a variety of common letters. This helps maximize the information we gain from the feedback. 

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a very common consonant
- A: a very common vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback.

- R is in the word and is in position 2  
- A is in the word but is NOT in position 3  
- The letters C, N, E are not in the word at all  

So the hidden word:
- has R in the 2nd slot  
- contains A somewhere except slot 3  
- does NOT contain C, N, E  

We still need to test additional common consonants and vowels.  
Good next candidates should keep R in slot 2, avoid C/N/E, and place A in a different position.  
The word “GRASP”:
- G, S, P are frequent consonants we haven’t tried  
- Puts A into slot 4 (different from position 3)  
- Keeps R in slot 2  
- Avoids C, N, E  

This should give new information while respecting all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Position information:
- Pos 2 is certainly R (✓)
- Pos 3 cannot be A (from two different guesses we got A(-))

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
C, N, E, G, S, P (all received x)

Letters we know ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:
A (showed up as “-” twice, so it is somewhere except positions 3 and 4)

Remaining common letters we have not yet tried: D, I, L, T, U, O, Y, B, F, H, K, M, V, W, etc.

We need a five-letter word:
- 2nd letter must be R
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 3 and 4
- Does NOT contain any of C, N, E, G, S, P
- Uses additional new letters to maximize information

The only positions left for A are positions 1 or 5.

Candidate words:
If A is position 1: AR…
If A is position 5: …RA

Checking common 5-letter patterns:

- ARDOR – contains D,O,R twice; D & O new info
- ARBOR – contains B,O; B & O new info
- BRAID – B & I & D new, A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- TRAIL – T & I & L new, A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- AROMA – A again in pos 3 (forbidden)
- FRAIL – F new, but A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- BRAVO – B,V,O new, A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- DRAFT – D,F,T new, A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- RATIO – T,I,O new, but R is pos 1, not 2
- DRAIN – D,I new, but A in pos 3 (forbidden)
- TRAMP – T,M new, but P forbidden
- MURAL – M,U,L new, A in pos 4 (forbidden from grasp feedback)
- ULTRA – U,L,T new, A in pos 5 allowed, R in pos 4 (position 2 is R; would conflict)

Wait – word must have R in position 2 exactly. So pattern: _ R _ _ _

Best next guess fitting all constraints: _ R _ _ _ with A in pos 1 or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Valid candidate:  
DRAFT – but A in pos 3 is forbidden  
BRAVO – A in pos 3 forbidden  
CRASH – C,S forbidden  
FARAD – A twice, but A in pos 3 forbidden  
AROID – A pos 1 allowed, R pos 2 allowed, O,I,D new letters, no forbidden letters present.

Let me double-check AROID:
- A pos 1 allowed  
- R pos 2 required ✓  
- O, I, D not yet tested  
- Does not contain C,N,E,G,S,P  
- 5 letters  

AROID satisfies every rule.

Guess 3: aroid -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback we now know:

- Position 2 is definitely R.
- The word contains A, but A is NOT in positions 1, 3 or 4 (from the three guesses it has always been “-”).
  Therefore A must be in position 5.
- The word contains I, but I is NOT in position 4 (from the last guess it is “-”).
- The word does NOT contain C, N, E, G, S, P, O, D (all received x at least once).

So the hidden word has the pattern:
_ R _ _ A

with I somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 5 is A).

We still need to test additional common consonants. Remaining unused letters include B, F, H, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- has R in position 2
- has A in position 5
- has I in position 3 or 4
- contains none of the forbidden letters (C,N,E,G,S,P,O,D)

Possible candidates:
- BRIAR – A in 5, R in 2, I in 3; B and new letters B, I (I already known)
- TRIAL – A in 5, R in 2, I in 4; T new
- CRIER – C forbidden
- FRIAR – F new, I in 3
- PRIAM – P forbidden
- URIAL – U new, I in 4
- BRIAR fits perfectly and introduces the new consonant B.

BRIAR satisfies every constraint:
- B(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) A(5) – wait, that’s 6 letters? No, positions are 1-5.
Word spelling: B-R-I-A-R → 5 letters, A is in 4, but we decided A must be in 5.

Oops – my candidate BRIAR has A in 4 which is forbidden. Let me correct.

Correct candidates with A in 5:
- TRIAL – T(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) L(5) – but A must be in 5, so A(5) is correct, but then I can’t be in 4 if A is in 5. Let me re-correct pattern.

Pattern we need: _ R _ _ A
And I must appear in one of the blanks.

So:
- positions 1,3,4 are to be filled with I and two new consonants.

Candidate words:
- TRIAL → pattern T R I A L → A in 4, but A must be in 5 – not valid
- BRIAR → pattern B R I A R → A in 4 – not valid
- CRIBS → C forbidden
- FRIAR → A in 4 – not valid
- FRAIL → A in 4 – not valid

We need a word ending in A with R in position 2 and I somewhere in 3 or 4. Examples:
- TRINA – ends in A, R in 2, I in 4 – but N forbidden
- PRIMA – P forbidden
- BRIDA – D forbidden
- URIAL – ends in A, R in 2, I in 3 – but U, I, A, L, R – all allowed
- URIAL is 5 letters: U R I A L – pattern U(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) L(5) – but A must be in 5, so A(5) is correct and I(3) is allowed.

Wait, U R I A L has A in 4, not 5.

Correct pattern must be _ R _ _ A.

So:
- positions 1,3,4 are the remaining letters.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ R _ _ A with I in either 3 or 4.

Searching common words:
- BRAVA – V new, A in 5, but A is already confirmed in 5, but V new – but B R A V A – A in 3 and 5 – not possible (only 1 A)
- BRAVA has two As – invalid.
- CRURA – C forbidden
- PRANA – P forbidden
- ORIBA – O forbidden
- FRISA – S forbidden
- URIAL – A in 4 – not 5
- TRIBA – B new, I in 4, A in 5 – valid.

TRIBA:

- A in 5 ✓
- I in 3 (allowed) ✓

   That leaves positions 1,3,4 for A.  
   From earlier:
   - A was “-” in position 3 (crane & grasp) → A ≠ 3  
   - A was “-” in position 1 (aroid) → A ≠ 1  
   - Therefore A must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ R I A _

Letters already confirmed/eliminated:
- present: R (pos 2), I (pos 3), A (pos 4)
- impossible letters: C, N, E, G, S, P, O, D, T, B

Remaining unused common consonants for position 1 and 5: F, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? R I A ? using only the remaining letters.

Common English words matching _ R I A _:
- FRIAR – but ends with R which is already at pos 2 → impossible (no double R)
- URIAL – ends with L, but A in 4 already used
- PRIAL – P forbidden
- CRIAL – C forbidden
- URIAS – S forbidden
- FRIAL – not a valid word
- HRIAL – not valid
- MRIAL – not valid
- WRIAL – not valid
- URIAH – H allowed, valid word

URIAH:
U(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) H(5)
- R in 2 ✓
- I in 3 ✓
- A in 4 ✓
- Letters U and H are new and allowed
- Contains no forbidden letters

This seems the only valid candidate left.
