For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess often has a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) covering multiple vowels and consonants, which should provide good feedback on letter presence and positions.

From the first guess AROSE:

- A(-): the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): none of R, O, S, E appear in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A (but not in the first position).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Now we need a new 5-letter English word that:
- Contains A.
- Does not have R, O, S, E.
- Does not have A in the first position.

Looking for common letters that haven't been ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

A good next guess is one that introduces many new common letters while placing A in a new spot. Let’s try ""UNLIT"" – it contains U, N, L, I, T and places A is not here, so we can test new letters. But ""UNLIT"" doesn't have A.

We need a word with A. How about ""TALON""? But 'O' is excluded. 

Next, ""PAINT"" – P, A, I, N, T. All letters are allowed (no R, O, S, E), and A is in position 2.

""PAINT"" is valid and should give us good info.

B(x) → B is NOT in the word.  
A(-) (again) → same as above.  
L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Summary of allowed letters:
- Must contain: A (positions 3 or 5 only, since 1,2,4 are ruled out)
- Must contain: L (positions 1,2,3,4 only, since 5 is ruled out)
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, B

Unused common letters that are still legal: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and L exactly once each (because they each show up once in feedback).
2. A can only be in position 3 or 5.
3. L can be in positions 1-4.
4. All other letters must come from the remaining legal set.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ L  (A in 3, L in 5) — but L cannot be in 5 (ruled out).
- L _ A _ _  (L in 1, A in 3)
- _ L A _ _  (L in 2, A in 3)
- _ _ _ A L  (A in 4, L in 5) — both positions are ruled out for A and L.
- L _ _ _ A  (L in 1, A in 5)
- _ L _ _ A  (L in 2, A in 5)
- _ _ L _ A  (L in 3, A in 5)
- _ _ _ L A  (L in 4, A in 5)

Let’s list a few valid English words that fit:

- LAMDA – invalid, contains D and A but D is allowed, however it has A in 4 (illegal).
- HALVA – has H, A, L, V but A is in 4 (illegal).
- KALAM – has K, A, L, M but A is in 4 (illegal).
- JAWAL – has J, A, W, L but A is in 3, L in 5 (illegal L in 5).
- MALDA – A in 4 (illegal).
- GULAG – has G, U, L, A, G – but A is in 4 (illegal).
- LADYA – has L, A, D, Y – A in 3, L in 1 – this seems valid: L A D Y A – but it has A twice (once in 3 and once in 5), and feedback implies only one A in the word (since only one A appears in CABAL, and we got ""-"" for both). So double A is probably not correct.

Another approach: single A and single L, other letters unique.

Looking at positions:
- A must be in 3 or 5.
- L must be in 1-4.

Best pattern: L _ A _ _ (L in 1, A in 3)
Need 3 more unique letters from remaining set: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible word: LYDIA – but I is excluded.
LAKKA – K is allowed, A in 3, but double K is fine? But we don't know if double letters are possible.

Another candidate: LAMDA – but A is in 4 (illegal).

Another: LUGAL – A in 4 (illegal).

Another: GULAG – A in 4 (illegal).

Let’s try A in 5, L in 3:
_ _ L _ A → need 3 letters: positions 1,2,4 from remaining set.

Possible word: HULYA – has H, U, L, Y, A – L in 3, A in 5. All letters unused so far. This seems valid.

Another: MUDLA – but not a valid English word.

Another: FUDGY – but doesn’t contain A or L.

Another: HUMID – no A, no L.

Wait, ""HUDLA"" – doesn’t seem valid.

Best valid word I can find that fits all constraints is:
KHYAL – K, H, Y, A, L – A in 4 (illegal), so not this.

Next: ""JUMLA"" – A in 5, L in 4 – this fits:
- J, U, M, L, A  
- A in 5 (allowed)  
- L in 4 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters.

""JUMLA"" is a word (chiefly South Asian for ""phrase"" or ""saying"", but it's in English dictionaries).

Alternatively, ""LUMHA"" – not a word.

Another: ""LUMMA"" – invalid.

So ""JUMLA"" is the best valid choice I can find that meets all constraints.

However, ""JUMLA"" might be obscure. Let's see if there's a more common word.

Looking again: ""HUMID"" – no A.
""KHULA"" – A in 5, but K, H, U, L, A – this is valid and more common (Khula is a term in Islamic law for divorce initiated by the wife).

So:
KHULA – K, H, U, L, A  
- A in 5 (allowed)  
- L in 4 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters.

This appears to be the most straightforward valid word that satisfies all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good first guess often has a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) covering multiple vowels and consonants, which should provide good feedback on letter presence and positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE:

- A(-): the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): none of R, O, S, E appear in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A (but not in the first position).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Now we need a new 5-letter English word that:
- Contains A.
- Does not have R, O, S, E.
- Does not have A in the first position.

Looking for common letters that haven't been ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

A good next guess is one that introduces many new common letters while placing A in a new spot. Let’s try ""UNLIT"" – it contains U, N, L, I, T and places A is not here, so we can test new letters. But ""UNLIT"" doesn't have A.

We need a word with A. How about ""TALON""? But 'O' is excluded. 

Next, ""PAINT"" – P, A, I, N, T. All letters are allowed (no R, O, S, E), and A is in position 2.

""PAINT"" is valid and should give us good info.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on PAINT:

- P(x), I(x), N(x), T(x) → none of P, I, N, T appear in the word at all.
- A(-) → the letter A is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (and we already knew it is not in position 1).

So the current constraints are:
- Word must contain A.
- Word must NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies these constraints and places A in position 3, 4, or 5.

Looking for possibilities:
- A in position 3: _ _ A _ _
- A in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Candidate words:
- CABAL (has B and L, both allowed, A in 3rd position)
- LAMDA (A in 4th, but D and M allowed)
- GAMMA (A in 5th, but M and G allowed)
- BAGGY (A in 3rd, G and Y allowed)
- CABBY (A in 3rd, C, B, Y allowed)

I’ll choose CABAL because:
- It uses C, B, L – all allowed letters.
- A appears in position 3 (new position).
- It’s a common word unlikely to contain ruled-out letters.

2. A can only be in position 3 or 5.
3. L can be in positions 1-4.
4. All other letters must come from the remaining legal set.

Possible patterns:

Let’s try ""UNLIT"" – it contains U, N, L, I, T and places A is not here, so we can test new letters. But ""UNLIT"" doesn\'t have A.\n\nWe need a word with A. How about ""TALON""? But \'O\' is excluded. \n\nNext, ""PAINT"" – P, A, I, N, T.

So double A is probably not correct.\n\nAnother approach: single A and single L, other letters unique.\n\nLooking at positions:\n- A must be in 3 or 5.\n- L must be in 1-4.\n\nBest pattern: L _ A _ _ (L in 1, A in 3)\nNeed 3 more unique letters from remaining set: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible word: LYDIA – but I is excluded.\nLAKKA – K is allowed, A in 3, but double K is fine? But we don\'t know if double letters are possible.\n\nAnother candidate: LAMDA – but A is in 4 (illegal).\n\nAnother: LUGAL – A in 4 (illegal).\n\nAnother: GULAG – A in 4 (illegal).\n\nLet’s try A in 5, L in 3:\n_ _ L _ A → need 3 letters: positions 1,2,4 from remaining set.\n\nPossible word: HULYA – has H, U, L, Y, A – L in 3, A in 5. All letters unused so far. This seems valid.\n\nAnother: MUDLA – but not a valid English word.\n\nAnother: FUDGY – but doesn’t contain A or L.\n\nAnother: HUMID – no A, no L.\n\nWait, ""HUDLA"" – doesn’t seem valid.\n\nBest valid word I can find that fits all constraints is:\nKHYAL – K, H, Y, A, L – A in 4 (illegal), so not this.\n\nNext: ""JUMLA"" – A in 5, L in 4 – this fits:\n- J, U, M, L, A  \n- A in 5 (allowed)  \n- L in 4 (allowed)  \n- No excluded letters.\n\n""JUMLA"" is a word (chiefly South Asian for ""phrase"" or ""saying"", but it\'s in English dictionaries).\n\nAlternatively, ""LUMHA"" – not a word.\n\nAnother: ""LUMMA"" – invalid.\n\nSo ""JUMLA"" is the best valid choice I can find that meets all constraints.\n\nHowever, ""JUMLA"" might be obscure. Let\'s see if there\'s a more common word.\n\nLooking again: ""HUMID"" – no A.\n""KHULA"" – A in 5, but K, H, U, L, A – this is valid and more common (Khula is a term in Islamic law for divorce initiated by the wife).\n\nSo:\nKHULA – K, H, U, L, A  \n- A in 5 (allowed)  \n- L in 4 (allowed)  \n- No excluded letters.\n\nThis appears to be the most straightforward valid word that satisfies all constraints.\n\n<guess>KHULA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CABAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) B(x) A(-) L(-)\nGuess 4: KHULA -> FEEDBACK: K(x) H(x) U(x) L(-) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Summary of all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. PAINT → P(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
3. CABAL → C(x) A(-) B(x) A(-) L(-)
4. KHULA → K(x) H(x) U(x) L(-) A(✓)

Key deductions:

- A is now confirmed in position 5 (from A(✓) in KHULA).
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from L(-) in CABAL and KHULA).
- Forbidden letters (never appear): R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, B, K, H, U.
- Allowed letters left (from the alphabet excluding all the above): D, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we already know we need L and A (with A fixed in position 5).

We are looking for a 5-letter word of the form:
_ _ _ _ A
where the first four letters must include an L somewhere in positions 1–3 (since L cannot be in 4 or 5) and must only use the remaining allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
L _ _ _ A
_ L _ _ A
_ _ L _ A

Valid English words that fit:
- FLAMA  → uses F, L, A, M (M allowed)
- GLAMA  → uses G, L, A, M
- LLAMA  → double L is fine and uses L, A, M
- GLOAM  → uses O, which is forbidden
- LAGAN  → uses N, forbidden
- LLAMA is the only one with all letters allowed and fits constraints perfectly.

Therefore, LLAMA is the logical next guess.
