For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes several common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Common starting words like CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU are popular, but I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word.
- It has two common consonants (R, S) in positions where they frequently appear.
- All letters are relatively common in 5-letter words.

This should give good coverage to eliminate many possibilities in one go.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – none of these letters appear in the secret word.
- R(-) – the letter R is in the word but not in the second position.

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E
- DOES contain R somewhere other than the second position

Now we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R
2. Does NOT include A, O, S, E
3. Has R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

Looking for common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y):
A good choice is ""TRIUM"" but that's 5 letters with U, I and M. However, I want to test common letters that haven't been used yet. A better guess might be ""BRICK"" – but that has C and K, and vowel I.

Another good option is ""DRINK"" – it has R, I, N, K, D. It uses common unused consonants (D, N, K) and the vowel I.

Let's verify:
- R is in position 2 here, but feedback said R is in wrong position in AROSE (so R cannot be in position 2 in the secret word). So DRINK is not valid for testing R position.

Next option: ""FRUIT"" – has U, I, but O is already excluded.

Better: ""CRIMP"" – but P is less common.

""PRICK"" – P, R, I, C, K – R is position 2 again (invalid).

""BRINY"" – B, R, I, N, Y – R is position 2 (invalid).

""GRIND"" – R is position 2 (invalid).

""CURRY"" – U, R, R, Y – but R is position 2 and 3 (invalid).

Best option seems ""RIGHT"" – R, I, G, H, T. R is position 1 here, which is allowed.
- Contains R (position 1)
- Doesn't contain A, O, S, E
- Uses new consonants G, H, T and vowel I.

This seems optimal.

From the latest feedback on BURIN:

- Allowed consonants left: C, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So the word pattern is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Common starting words like CRANE, SLATE, or ADIEU are popular, but I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word.
- It has two common consonants (R, S) in positions where they frequently appear.
- All letters are relatively common in 5-letter words.

This should give good coverage to eliminate many possibilities in one go.

- A(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – none of these letters appear in the secret word.
- R(-) – the letter R is in the word but not in the second position.

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E
- DOES contain R somewhere other than the second position

Now we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R
2. Does NOT include A, O, S, E

Another good option is ""DRINK"" – it has R, I, N, K, D. It uses common unused consonants (D, N, K) and the vowel I.

Let's verify:
- R is in position 2 here, but feedback said R is in wrong position in AROSE (so R cannot be in position 2 in the secret word). So DRINK is not valid for testing R position.

Next option: ""FRUIT"" – has U, I, but O is already excluded.

Better: ""CRIMP"" – but P is less common.

""PRICK"" – P, R, I, C, K – R is position 2 again (invalid).

""GRIND"" – R is position 2 (invalid).

""CURRY"" – U, R, R, Y – but R is position 2 and 3 (invalid).

Best option seems ""RIGHT"" – R, I, G, H, T. R is position 1 here, which is allowed.
- Contains R (position 1)

G, H, T are absent.

From Guess 3 (BURIN):  
R is in position 3.  
I is in position 4.  
B, U, N are absent.

From Guess 4 (CRIMP):  
C is present but not in position 1.  
R is present but not in position 2.  
I is present but not in position 3.  
M, P are absent.

Combining these facts:

1. Word structure: _ _ R I _
2. Letters already placed: R(3), I(4)
3. Forbidden letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, B, U, N, M, P
4. Available letters: C, D, F, K, L, V, W, Y, (I and R already placed)

From CRIMP feedback:
- C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 5 (position 3 is R, 4 is I).

Possible positions for C: position 2 or 5.

Let's list possible words fitting _ C R I _ or _ _ R I C:

- FCRIC - invalid (F not tested, but not a word)
- DCRIC - invalid
- LCRIC - invalid

Valid dictionary words:
- SCRIB - but S is forbidden
- PRICY - but P is forbidden
- TRICE - but T and E are forbidden
- DURIC - but U is forbidden
- LURID - but U is forbidden
- DRILY - but Y is allowed, and this fits _ R I _ but R is position 2, which is invalid (from AROSE R not in position 2)

Actually, looking at the pattern _ _ R I _ and constraints:
- Position 1 and 5 must be from allowed letters: C, D, F, K, L, V, W, Y
- C must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible candidates:
1. If C is in position 2: _ C R I _
   - First letter: D, F, K, L, V, W, Y
   - Fifth letter: same set
   - Possible words: DCRIF (invalid), FCRID (invalid), LCRID (invalid) - none seem valid
   - Actually, no standard words fit this pattern with remaining letters.

2. If C is in position 5: _ _ R I C
   - Then positions 1 and 2 must be from allowed letters: D, F, K, L, V, W, Y
   - Possible words:
     - D R I C ? - but R is position 2, which is invalid (from AROSE R not in position 2)
     - F R I C ? - same issue
     - V R I C ? - same
     - So R cannot be in position 2, so first letter must be non-R, second letter must be non-R.

Wait, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine:

Current word structure: _ ? R I _

From CRIMP, C is in word but not position 1, so C could be:
- position 2 (second letter)
- position 5 (last letter)

Option 1: C in position 2: _ C R I _
   - Then remaining letters for positions 1 and 5 must be from D, F, K, L, V, W, Y
   - Possible words: F C R I D, D C R I F, etc. - but these don't seem valid English words.

Option 2: C in position 5: _ _ R I C
   - Then positions 1 and 2 must be from allowed letters: D, F, K, L, V, W, Y
   - Possible words:
     - D F R I C - invalid
     - Actually, no valid words come to mind here.

Maybe I'm missing a word. Let me think differently - perhaps C is in position 2:

Looking for _ C R I _ words with allowed letters:
- Valid English word: ""LYRIC"" - but Y is allowed, L is allowed, C is allowed in position 2.
   - L Y R I C
   - Check letters:
     - L - allowed
     - Y - allowed
     - R - position 3 (correct)
     - I - position 4 (correct)
     - C - allowed (and from CRIMP we know C is in word but not position 1 - here C is position 5, which is allowed)
   - All letters are from allowed set: L, Y, R, I, C
   - No forbidden letters used.

""LYRIC"" seems to be the most promising valid word fitting all constraints.
</think>

The current known structure is _ _ R I _ with:
- C present but not in position 1 (so C must be in position 2 or 5)
- Available letters for other positions: D, F, K, L, V, W, Y (excluding already used and forbidden letters)

After evaluating possible combinations, ""LYRIC"" fits perfectly:
- R in position 3 (confirmed)
- I in position 4 (confirmed)
- C in position 5 (allowed since CRIMP showed C is present but not in position 1)
- L and Y are both allowed and unused
- No forbidden letters are used
