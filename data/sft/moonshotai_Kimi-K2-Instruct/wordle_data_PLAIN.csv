This is the first guess, so there's no feedback yet. A good first guess should contain common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

I want a word that uses some of these common letters while avoiding repeats. Possible good options:
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)
- ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E)
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)

""AROSE"" seems particularly strong as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters with good vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(-): The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so A must be in positions 2-5).
2. R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): These four letters (R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere (positions 2-5)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
- Has 4 other letters not in AROSE

- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Common remaining letters (avoiding R,O,S,E): T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, B, G, etc.

- ""MOUNT"" (contains M,N,U,T - but O is excluded)
- ""ADULT"" (A is in position 1 here, but we know A can't be position 1 - so this is invalid)

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   • A exists somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1 ⇒ positions 2,3,4,5 for A.
   • R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. CHANT → C(x) H(x) A(✓) N(-) T(x)
   • A is in position 3 (✓).
   • N exists in the word, but NOT in position 4 ⇒ positions 1,2,5 for N.
   • C, H, T are NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- has A in position 3.
- contains N somewhere (positions 1,2,5).
- does NOT contain C, H, T, R, O, S, E.

Letters still allowed and fairly common: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have two positions left to fill (positions 1,2,4,5 combined, but 3 is locked as A).
We also know N must appear once (but not in position 4).

A good third guess should:
- put N in one of positions 1,2,5.
- introduce new common letters to maximize information.
- avoid the seven forbidden letters above.

Candidate words that fit:
- PLAN (but needs 5 letters, so extend)
- P, L, A, N, plus one more allowed letter → “PLANK” (K allowed, fits all constraints)
- “PLANK” has N in position 4, which is forbidden (N cannot be in position 4) → reject
- “PLAIN” → I is allowed, N in position 5 (okay)
- “GLAND” → D allowed, N in position 4 → forbidden
- “BRAND” → R forbidden
- “FLANK” → N in position 4 → forbidden
- “ULNAR” → R forbidden
- “UNLIT” → T forbidden
- “PLANU” → not a valid word
- “PLANK” again → N position 4 still bad
- “PIVAN” – not a word
- “VINAL” – N in position 4 bad
- “INLAY” – N in position 2 (allowed), letters I,N,L,A,Y all allowed, 5 letters, valid word.

“INLAY”
- A is in position 3 ✓

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   • A exists somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1 ⇒ positions 2,3,4,5 for A.
   • R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. CHANT → C(x) H(x) A(✓) N(-) T(x)
   • A is in position 3 (✓).
   • N exists in the word, but NOT in position 4 ⇒ positions 1,2,5 for N.
   • C, H, T are NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- has A in position 3.
- contains N somewhere (positions 1,2,5).
- does NOT contain C, H, T, R, O, S, E.

Letters still allowed and fairly common: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have two positions left to fill (positions 1,2,4,5 combined, but 3 is locked as A).
We also know N must appear once (but not in position 4).

A good third guess should:
- put N in one of positions 1,2,5.
- introduce new common letters to maximize information.
- avoid the seven forbidden letters above.

Candidate words that fit:
- PLAN (but needs 5 letters, so extend)
- P, L, A, N, plus one more allowed letter → “PLANK” (K allowed, fits all constraints)
- “PLANK” has N in position 4, which is forbidden (N cannot be in position 4) → reject
- “PLAIN” → I is allowed, N in position 5 (okay)
- “GLAND” → D allowed, N in position 4 → forbidden
- “BRAND” → R forbidden
- “FLANK” → N in position 4 → forbidden
- “ULNAR” → R forbidden
- “UNLIT” → T forbidden
- “PLANU” → not a valid word
- “PLANK” again → N position 4 still bad
- “PIVAN” – not a word
- “VINAL” – N in position 4 bad
- “INLAY” – N in position 2 (allowed), letters I,N,L,A,Y all allowed, 5 letters, valid word.

“INLAY”
- A is in position 3 ✓
- N is in position 2 ✓ (allowed positions 1,2,5)
- letters I, L, Y are new and allowed.

So INLAY looks safe and informative.

Let’s list all the constraints we have so far.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A exists, but **not** in position 1.

2. CHANT → C(x) H(x) A(✓) N(-) T(x)
   - A is in **position 3** (fixed).
   - N exists, but **not** in position 4.

3. INLAY → I(-) N(-) L(-) A(-) Y(x)
   - I exists, but **not** in position 1.
   - N exists, but **not** in position 2.
   - L exists, but **not** in position 3 (but 3 is already A, so irrelevant).
   - A exists, but **not** in position 4 (but 3 is already A, so irrelevant).
   - Y is **not** in the word.

Additional facts:
- Forbidden letters: C, H, T, R, O, S, E, Y
- Allowed letters so far include A (fixed at 3), N, I, L, plus unexplored common letters: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Current word skeleton:
_ _ A _ _

Constraints on each position:
- Position 1: not A, not C, H, T, R, O, S, E, Y. Possible: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.
- Position 2: not A, not C, H, T, R, O, S, E, Y. Additionally, N cannot be here (from INLAY feedback N(-) in position 2). Same list as position 1 minus N.
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: not A, not C, H, T, R, O, S, E, Y. Additionally, N cannot be here (from CHANT feedback N(-) in position 4). Same list as position 1 minus N.
- Position 5: not A, not C, H, T, R, O, S, E, Y. Same list as position 1.

Additional placement constraints:
- N must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions are 1 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded for N).
- I must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions are 2, 4, 5 (since 1 and 3 are excluded).
- L must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions are 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is excluded).

So we have three letters already fixed to appear: A (position 3), N, I, L. That’s four letters for five positions. Therefore, one letter will be repeated (but that’s unlikely in Wordle) OR one of the constraints is misinterpreted. Actually, it’s possible that N, I, L are just required to appear somewhere, not all necessarily. Let me re-read:

The feedback symbols:
- A(✓) means A is in position 3.
- N(-) means N is in the word but not in that position.
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in that position.
- L(-) means L is in the word but not in that position.

So we have:
- A in position 3.
- N somewhere in positions 1 or 5.
- I somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- L somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
- One more letter from {B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W}.

So the word must contain A, N, I, L plus one more distinct letter. That’s five letters, so all four (N, I, L) must be present plus one more. Thus the five letters must be A, N, I, L, plus one more allowed letter.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Possible positions for N: 1 or 5.
Possible positions for I: 2, 4, 5.
Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We need to assign N, I, L to positions 1,2,4,5 without conflict, plus the fifth letter from remaining.

Case 1: N in position 1
Then positions left: 2,4,5 for I, L, and the fifth letter.
I cannot be in 1 (already), and must be in 2,4,5.
L must be in 2,4,5.
We need to place I, L, and one more letter in 2,4,5.

Possible assignments:
- I in 2, L in 4, then fifth letter in 5.
- I in 2, L in 5, then fifth letter in 4.
- I in 4, L in 2, then fifth letter in 5.
- I in 4, L in 5, then fifth letter in 2.
- I in 5, L in 2, then fifth letter in 4.
- I in 5, L in 4, then fifth letter in 2.

Let’s pick fifth letter as D (common and unused).
Then possible words:
- N, I, A, L, D → N I A L D → NIALD – but NIALD is not a valid word.
- N, I, A, D, L → N I A D L → NIADL – invalid.
- N, L, A, I, D → N L A I D – invalid.
- N, D, A, I, L → N D A I L – invalid.

This suggests we need to find a valid word where A is in position 3, N in 1 or 5, and I, L placed appropriately, plus one more allowed letter.

Let me try a systematic approach:
We need a word of the form:
N _ A _ _
or
_ _ A _ N

And must include I and L in the remaining positions, plus one more letter.

Let’s try N in position 1:
N _ A _ _
Need to place I and L in positions 2,4,5, plus one more letter.
Since we have five positions and already N, A, I, L are four letters, the fifth letter must be distinct.
The word must be N ? A ? ? with letters N, A, I, L, plus one more.

Possible words:
- N I A L ? – but need five letters, e.g., NIAL? – none valid.
- N I A ? L: N I A D L – NIADL – invalid.
- N L A I ? – N L A I ? – NLAI? – none.
- N ? A I L: N D A I L – NDAIL – invalid.

This path seems hard. Maybe N in position 5:

_ _ A _ N
Then positions 1,2,4 need I, L, and one more letter.
We need to place I and L in 1,2,4, plus one more.

Possible combinations:
- I L A _ N: I L A ? N – need a letter in position 4, but we already have I, L, A, N – so the word would be I L A _ N, but we’re missing a letter. Wait, we have five letters: A, N, I, L, plus one more. So the fifth letter must be in one of the remaining slots.

Actually, the word must contain A, N, I, L, plus one more distinct letter. So the five letters are A, N, I, L, plus one more.

Let me list valid English words that have A in position 3, include N, I, L, plus one more allowed letter, and satisfy placement constraints.

Possible word: PLAIN – but P, L, A, I, N – but P is allowed, L, A, I, N are all in the word.
Check constraints:
- A in position 3 ✓
- N is in position 5 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 (allowed)
- L is in position 2 (allowed)
- P is the extra letter in position 1 (allowed)

Does PLAIN use any forbidden letters? No – it uses P, L, A, I, N – none are forbidden.
Does it satisfy all placement constraints?
- A in position 3: yes.
- N: in position 5 – allowed (positions 1 or 5 for N).
- I: in position 4 – allowed (positions 2,4,5 for I).
- L: in position 2 – allowed (positions 1,2,4,5 for L).

Thus PLAIN seems valid.

Another candidate: BLAIN – but B, L, A, I, N – same structure, but BLAIN is a valid word (a skin sore). Check:
- A in 3 ✓
- N in 5 ✓
- I in 4 ✓
- L in 2 ✓
- B in 1 ✓
Valid.

Between PLAIN and BLAIN, both fit. Let’s choose PLAIN as it’s more common.
