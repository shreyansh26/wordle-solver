For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most statistically effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains the three most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and where they might be located. 

If this guess doesn't yield enough clues, we can adjust based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain R, O, or S. It does contain A, but A is not in position 1.

Next, I want to test other common consonants and place A in a new position (not first). Good candidates: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc. I’ll use a word with T and N (very common consonants) and place A in position 2 or 3.

A word like ""TALEN"" fits:
- T, L, N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- E is locked in position 5.

But ""TALEN"" isn't a valid word, so I'll adjust to a valid word: ""TABLE"" uses T (new), B (new), A (new position), L (new), and keeps E in position 5. However, ""ABATE"" uses A in position 1 again (which we know is wrong), so that's bad.

""ENATE"" has E in position 1 (but E is already confirmed in position 5), so that's no good.

""PLANE"" is valid:
- P, L, N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1, so valid for feedback).
- E is in position 5 (matches feedback).

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the feedback:

- E is locked in at position 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PLANE).
- P is in position 1.
- L is in position 2.
- N is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Positions:  
1 = P  
2 = L  
3 = ? (but NOT A)  
4 = ?  
5 = E  

Letters still to determine: positions 3 and 4, avoiding A, N, R, O, S.

Common remaining consonants: T, D, G, B, C, M.

Common vowels left: I, U (E and A already used).

Let’s spell out possible letters:

Position 3: must be a consonant (since we already have vowels A and E).
Position 4: could be vowel or consonant, but we need a valid 5-letter word.

Considering P L _ _ E, candidate letters: T, D, G, B, C, M, I, U.

Possible words: PLUTE (valid), PLITE (valid), PLUME (but M is okay), PLACE (but C is okay), PLATE (T is okay).

PLATE: P(✓) L(✓) A(-) T(?) E(✓). But A is already known to be in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PLANE), so A cannot be in position 3. So PLATE is invalid.

PLUME: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) M(?) E(✓). This looks promising. U is a vowel not yet tested, M is a consonant not yet tested.

PLITE: T is in position 4, but I is in position 3. This is also valid.

But PLUME seems better because U is a new vowel and M is a new consonant.

Another option: PLEBE (but B and E are already used, and E is locked at 5).

PLEAT: A is known to be in the word but not in position 3, so A in position 4 is okay. However, A has not been placed in position 4 yet. Wait, in PLANE, A was in position 3, so A is not in position 3, but could be in 4. So PLEAT is valid.

But PLUME keeps A out entirely, which might be safer.

But we know A is in the word, so A must appear somewhere. From PLANE, A is not in position 3, so A must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be P L _ A E.

But position 3 must be a consonant. Possible consonants left: T, D, G, B, C, M.

Looking for PL?AE:

PLTAE – no such word.

PLBAE – no.

PLDAE – no.

PLGAE – no.

PLCAE – no.

PLMAE – no.

Hmm, none seem valid. Maybe A is in position 4 and position 3 is another consonant.

Wait, the only valid word seems to be PLATE, but as noted A cannot be in position 3. So PLATE is invalid because A is in position 3 in PLATE.

Rechecking: PLATE has A in position 3, but from PLANE, A is not in position 3. So PLATE is invalid.

Next, consider A must be in position 4, making the pattern P L _ A E.

But no 5-letter word fits P L ? A E.

Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 2 or 4, but:

- Position 1 is P, so A not there.
- Position 2 is L, so A not there.
- Position 3: A is not allowed (from PLANE feedback: A is in word but not in position 3).
- Position 4: A could be here.
- Position 5 is E.

So the word must be P L _ A E.

But as noted, no such valid word exists. This implies my earlier assumption may be flawed.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words ending in E with P L in positions 1-2:

Possible: PLACE, PLATE, PLEBE, PLEAT, PLUME, PLUTE.

From these:

- PLACE: P(✓) L(✓) A(x) C(?) E(✓) – but A is known to be in the word, so A cannot be absent. Thus PLACE is invalid.
- PLATE: P(✓) L(✓) A(x) T(?) E(✓) – same issue, A is present in word but marked as x here, so invalid.
- PLEAT: P(✓) L(✓) E(?) A(?) T(?) E(✓) – but E is already in position 5, and this would have E twice, which may be allowed, but PLEAT is P-L-E-A-T, which ends with T, not E. So invalid.
- PLUME: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) M(?) E(✓) – this does not contain A, but A must be in the word. So invalid.
- PLUTE: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) T(?) E(✓) – also lacks A, invalid.

This seems like a contradiction. Re-examining:

From PLANE feedback: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓). This means:

- P, L, A, E are all in the word and in these exact positions? No, the symbols are:
  P(✓) – P is correct and in position 1.
  L(✓) – L is correct and in position 2.
  A(✓) – A is correct and in position 3.
  N(x) – N is not in the word.
  E(✓) – E is correct and in position 5.

Thus the word is P L A _ E.

Now we need a 5-letter word P L A ? E.

The only common word is PLACE or PLANE, but PLANE has N (excluded), and PLACE has C as the fourth letter.

So the word must be PLACE, but A is in position 3 (from PLANE feedback A(✓)), which matches. But from AROSE, A was marked as (-) meaning A is in word but not position 1. A in position 3 is allowed.

But from PLANE, N is not in word, so PLACE is possible. However, from PLANE feedback, A is in position 3 (✓), so word is P L A _ E. The only valid word is PLACE.

But we must verify: is PLACE possible given all feedback?

AROSE: A(-) – A is in word but not position 1. In PLACE, A is in position 3, so ok.
R, O, S not in word – PLACE has none, ok.
E in position 5 – matches.

PLANE: P(✓), L(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓) – matches PLACE except N not present, so ok.

Thus the word is PLACE.

But wait, the feedback from PLANE says A is in position 3 (✓), so the word must be P L A _ E. The only such word is PLACE (P-L-A-C-E), which fits all feedback.

Therefore, I should guess PLACE.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with P, has L in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.
- The only valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is PLACE.

- E is locked in at position 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PLANE).

PLITE: T is in position 4, but I is in position 3. This is also valid.

But PLUME seems better because U is a new vowel and M is a new consonant.

PLEAT: A is known to be in the word but not in position 3, so A in position 4 is okay. However, A has not been placed in position 4 yet. Wait, in PLANE, A was in position 3, so A is not in position 3, but could be in 4. So PLEAT is valid.

- PLUTE: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) T(?) E(✓) – also lacks A, invalid.

This seems like a contradiction. Re-examining:

From PLANE feedback: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓). This means:

- P, L, A, E are all in the word and in these exact positions? No, the symbols are:
  P(✓) – P is correct and in position 1.
  L(✓) – L is correct and in position 2.
  A(✓) – A is correct and in position 3.
  N(x) – N is not in the word.
  E(✓) – E is correct and in position 5.

Thus the word is P L A _ E.

Now we need a 5-letter word P L A ? E.

The only common word is PLACE or PLANE, but PLANE has N (excluded), and PLACE has C as the fourth letter.

So the word must be PLACE, but A is in position 3 (from PLANE feedback A(✓)), which matches. But from AROSE, A was marked as (-) meaning A is in word but not position 1. A in position 3 is allowed.

But from PLANE, N is not in word, so PLACE is possible. However, from PLANE feedback, A is in position 3 (✓), so word is P L A _ E. The only valid word is PLACE.

But we must verify: is PLACE possible given all feedback?

AROSE: A(-) – A is in word but not position 1. In PLACE, A is in position 3, so ok.
R, O, S not in word – PLACE has none, ok.
E in position 5 – matches.

PLANE: P(✓), L(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓) – matches PLACE except N not present, so ok.

Thus the word is PLACE.

But wait, the feedback from PLANE says A is in position 3 (✓), so the word must be P L A _ E. The only such word is PLACE (P-L-A-C-E), which fits all feedback.

Therefore, I should guess PLACE.Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with P, has L in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5.
- The only valid 5-letter word matching this pattern is PLACE.",Guess 3: PLACE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) C(x) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PLATE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most statistically effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains the three most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and where they might be located. 

If this guess doesn't yield enough clues, we can adjust based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain R, O, or S. It does contain A, but A is not in position 1.

Next, I want to test other common consonants and place A in a new position (not first). Good candidates: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc. I’ll use a word with T and N (very common consonants) and place A in position 2 or 3.

A word like ""TALEN"" fits:
- T, L, N are common consonants.
- A is in position 2 (new position).
- E is locked in position 5.

But ""TALEN"" isn't a valid word, so I'll adjust to a valid word: ""TABLE"" uses T (new), B (new), A (new position), L (new), and keeps E in position 5. However, ""ABATE"" uses A in position 1 again (which we know is wrong), so that's bad.

""ENATE"" has E in position 1 (but E is already confirmed in position 5), so that's no good.

""PLANE"" is valid:
- P, L, N are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1, so valid for feedback).
- E is in position 5 (matches feedback).

This seems like a strong next guess.

<guess>PLANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLANE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- E is locked in at position 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PLANE).
- P is in position 1.
- L is in position 2.
- N is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Positions:  
1 = P  
2 = L  
3 = ? (but NOT A)  
4 = ?  
5 = E  

Letters still to determine: positions 3 and 4, avoiding A, N, R, O, S.

Common remaining consonants: T, D, G, B, C, M.

Common vowels left: I, U (E and A already used).

Let’s spell out possible letters:

Position 3: must be a consonant (since we already have vowels A and E).
Position 4: could be vowel or consonant, but we need a valid 5-letter word.

Considering P L _ _ E, candidate letters: T, D, G, B, C, M, I, U.

Possible words: PLUTE (valid), PLITE (valid), PLUME (but M is okay), PLACE (but C is okay), PLATE (T is okay).

PLATE: P(✓) L(✓) A(-) T(?) E(✓). But A is already known to be in the word but NOT in position 3 (from PLANE), so A cannot be in position 3. So PLATE is invalid.

PLUME: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) M(?) E(✓). This looks promising. U is a vowel not yet tested, M is a consonant not yet tested.

PLITE: T is in position 4, but I is in position 3. This is also valid.

But PLUME seems better because U is a new vowel and M is a new consonant.

Another option: PLEBE (but B and E are already used, and E is locked at 5).

PLEAT: A is known to be in the word but not in position 3, so A in position 4 is okay. However, A has not been placed in position 4 yet. Wait, in PLANE, A was in position 3, so A is not in position 3, but could be in 4. So PLEAT is valid.

But PLUME keeps A out entirely, which might be safer.

But we know A is in the word, so A must appear somewhere. From PLANE, A is not in position 3, so A must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be P L _ A E.

But position 3 must be a consonant. Possible consonants left: T, D, G, B, C, M.

Looking for PL?AE:

PLTAE – no such word.

PLBAE – no.

PLDAE – no.

PLGAE – no.

PLCAE – no.

PLMAE – no.

Hmm, none seem valid. Maybe A is in position 4 and position 3 is another consonant.

Wait, the only valid word seems to be PLATE, but as noted A cannot be in position 3. So PLATE is invalid because A is in position 3 in PLATE.

Rechecking: PLATE has A in position 3, but from PLANE, A is not in position 3. So PLATE is invalid.

Next, consider A must be in position 4, making the pattern P L _ A E.

But no 5-letter word fits P L ? A E.

Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 2 or 4, but:

- Position 1 is P, so A not there.
- Position 2 is L, so A not there.
- Position 3: A is not allowed (from PLANE feedback: A is in word but not in position 3).
- Position 4: A could be here.
- Position 5 is E.

So the word must be P L _ A E.

But as noted, no such valid word exists. This implies my earlier assumption may be flawed.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words ending in E with P L in positions 1-2:

Possible: PLACE, PLATE, PLEBE, PLEAT, PLUME, PLUTE.

From these:

- PLACE: P(✓) L(✓) A(x) C(?) E(✓) – but A is known to be in the word, so A cannot be absent. Thus PLACE is invalid.
- PLATE: P(✓) L(✓) A(x) T(?) E(✓) – same issue, A is present in word but marked as x here, so invalid.
- PLEAT: P(✓) L(✓) E(?) A(?) T(?) E(✓) – but E is already in position 5, and this would have E twice, which may be allowed, but PLEAT is P-L-E-A-T, which ends with T, not E. So invalid.
- PLUME: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) M(?) E(✓) – this does not contain A, but A must be in the word. So invalid.
- PLUTE: P(✓) L(✓) U(?) T(?) E(✓) – also lacks A, invalid.

This seems like a contradiction. Re-examining:

From PLANE feedback: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓). This means:

- P, L, A, E are all in the word and in these exact positions? No, the symbols are:
  P(✓) – P is correct and in position 1.
  L(✓) – L is correct and in position 2.
  A(✓) – A is correct and in position 3.
  N(x) – N is not in the word.
  E(✓) – E is correct and in position 5.

Thus the word is P L A _ E.

Now we need a 5-letter word P L A ? E.

The only common word is PLACE or PLANE, but PLANE has N (excluded), and PLACE has C as the fourth letter.

So the word must be PLACE, but A is in position 3 (from PLANE feedback A(✓)), which matches. But from AROSE, A was marked as (-) meaning A is in word but not position 1. A in position 3 is allowed.

But from PLANE, N is not in word, so PLACE is possible. However, from PLANE feedback, A is in position 3 (✓), so word is P L A _ E. The only valid word is PLACE.

AROSE: A(-) – A is in word but not position 1. In PLACE, A is in position 3, so ok.
R, O, S not in word – PLACE has none, ok.
E in position 5 – matches.

PLANE: P(✓), L(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓) – matches PLACE except N not present, so ok.

Thus the word is PLACE.

But wait, the feedback from PLANE says A is in position 3 (✓), so the word must be P L A _ E. The only such word is PLACE (P-L-A-C-E), which fits all feedback.

Therefore, I should guess PLACE.Based on the feedback:
