For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter distribution to maximize information gain. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some popular starting choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Let’s synthesize everything we know after the two guesses.

1. Letter inventory so far  
   – O was ✓ in 3rd position in AROSE, yet became – in ROUST.  
     This is impossible under normal Wordle rules: once a letter is marked ✓, it must stay ✓ in that same position in every later guess.  
     The only way the feedback above is consistent is if the feedback “O(-)” for ROUST really meant the second-letter O, while the 3rd position remains ✓.  
     In other words, the slot-by-slot feedback is:  
       R(-)  O(-)  U(x)  S(-)  T(✓)

2. Therefore we now know:
   - Position 3 must be O (from Guess 1).  
   - Position 5 must be T (from Guess 2).  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (it was – in both guesses).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 2 (it was – in both guesses).  
   - U and A and E are out.  
   - Still open letters (common ones not yet ruled out): I, N, C, H, L, Y, M, P, D, K, etc.

3. Construct a new candidate that
   - keeps _ _ O _ T  
   - places R somewhere besides 1st or 2nd (so 3rd is taken by O, leaving 4th or 5th, but 5th is T, hence 4th must be R)  
   - places S somewhere besides 2nd or 4th (so 1st, 3rd, or 5th; 5th is T, 3rd is O, so 1st must be S)  
   - fills the remaining 2nd position with an allowed, common letter that has not been eliminated.

   That forces the pattern:  
   S _ O R T  
   Only the 2nd slot is free.  A good high-frequency letter not used yet is I.

   Hence: S I O R T

   - fills the remaining 2nd position with an allowed, common letter that has not been eliminated.

   That forces the pattern:

   Only the 2nd slot is free.  A good high-frequency letter not used yet is I.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some popular starting choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in 2nd position (-).
- O is correctly placed in 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but not in 4th position (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
1. _ _ O _ _ (O is fixed in 3rd place)
2. R must appear somewhere other than 2nd place.
3. S must appear somewhere other than 4th place.
4. A and E are eliminated. No other vowels ruled out yet.

Possible positions for R and S:
- R could be 1st, 3rd (but O is there), 4th or 5th.
- S could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd (O), or 5th.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in 3rd position
- Places R in a new spot (e.g., 1st)
- Places S in a new spot (e.g., 2nd)
- Uses new letters for remaining positions

Candidate: R S O _ _
But we need 5 letters: R S O U T (common letters not yet eliminated)

Check: R(1st), S(2nd), O(3rd) – satisfies feedback constraints.

ROUST seems valid – uses R in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 3rd, and introduces new letters U and T.

Guess 2: ROUST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) S(-) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s synthesize everything we know after the two guesses.

1. Letter inventory so far  
   – O was ✓ in 3rd position in AROSE, yet became – in ROUST.  
     This is impossible under normal Wordle rules: once a letter is marked ✓, it must stay ✓ in that same position in every later guess.  
     The only way the feedback above is consistent is if the feedback “O(-)” for ROUST really meant the second-letter O, while the 3rd position remains ✓.  
     In other words, the slot-by-slot feedback is:  
       R(-)  O(-)  U(x)  S(-)  T(✓)

2. Therefore we now know:
   - Position 3 must be O (from Guess 1).  
   - Position 5 must be T (from Guess 2).  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (it was – in both guesses).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 2 (it was – in both guesses).  
   - U and A and E are out.  
   - Still open letters (common ones not yet ruled out): I, N, C, H, L, Y, M, P, D, K, etc.

3. Construct a new candidate that
   - keeps _ _ O _ T  
   - places R somewhere besides 1st or 2nd (so 3rd is taken by O, leaving 4th or 5th, but 5th is T, hence 4th must be R)  
   - places S somewhere besides 2nd or 4th (so 1st, 3rd, or 5th; 5th is T, 3rd is O, so 1st must be S)  
   - fills the remaining 2nd position with an allowed, common letter that has not been eliminated.

   That forces the pattern:  
   S _ O R T  
   Only the 2nd slot is free.  A good high-frequency letter not used yet is I.
