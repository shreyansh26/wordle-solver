2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I should use a word that incorporates as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage.

Good options include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with STARE because it contains 5 of the most common letters (S, T, A, R, E) without repeating any letters, giving maximum information about letter presence and possible positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. There is an R somewhere in the word except the 4th position.
3. The letters S, T, A are not in the word at all.

- Ends with E
- Contains R but not in the 4th position
- Does not contain S, T, or A

Other common letters to try next: I, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

- BRIER (but ends in -IER which might not fit)
- DRIER (same issue)
- CRIER (same)
- FRIER

So far we know:

- Position 5: E ✓
- Position 4: M ✓ (from CRIME feedback)
- Position 3: I was marked x → not I

Letters already ruled out: S, T, A, O, N, I.

We need a consonant or vowel for position 3 that has not been excluded.
Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The most common ones are B, D, F, G, L, P, U.

Trying each quickly to see which forms a valid 5-letter word:
- CR _ M E with letters B, D, F, G, L, P, U:
  - CRBME – no
  - CRDME – no
  - CRFME – no
  - CRGME – no
  - CRLME – no
  - CRPME – no
  - CRUME – no
  - CRULE – positions wrong
  - CRUVE – no E
  - CRUDE – but D is ok
  - CRVME – no
  - CRXME – no
  - CRYME – yes, CRYME (variant spelling of “crime”, but standard word)
  - CRULE – no
  - CRUDE – doesn’t fit
  - CRISP – has S
  - CRUMP – no E

Wait, CRYME is an alternate spelling recognized in some dictionaries, but may not be ideal.
Next best: CRUDE – but then position 4 must be D, yet we have M confirmed in position 4.

Actually we have CR _ M E. So possible:
- CRBME – no
- CRDME – no
- CRGME – no
- CRUME – no
But C R _ M E:
- CRIME – already tried
- CRUME – no
- CRGME – no
- CROME – has O
- CRAME – has A
- CREME – has E twice
- CRIKE – has I
- CRUDE – has D in wrong spot
- CROUP – has O, P
- CRUSE – has S
- CRWTH – has W, T

The only common valid word seems to be CREME, but it repeats E.
Wait, let me list all valid English words matching C R _ M E:
- CRIME – tried
- CROME – O excluded
- CRAME – A excluded
- CRUME – U is allowed
- CREME – E is allowed but repeats

Checking valid words:
- CRUME – obscure but valid (a type of pastry)
- CREME – valid (as in “crème”)
Between these, CREME is more common.

But repeating E is okay if the word allows it.
CREME is a valid 5-letter word.

So next guess: CREME.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,creme,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This means picking a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I should use a word that incorporates as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage.

Good options include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with STARE because it contains 5 of the most common letters (S, T, A, R, E) without repeating any letters, giving maximum information about letter presence and possible positions.

Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word and in the correct position (✓)

So we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. There is an R somewhere in the word except the 4th position.
3. The letters S, T, A are not in the word at all.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R but not in the 4th position
- Does not contain S, T, or A

Other common letters to try next: I, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I'll look for a word that ends in E, has R not in position 4, and uses other common letters. Possible candidates:
- BRIER (but ends in -IER which might not fit)
- DRIER (same issue)
- CRIER (same)
- FRIER
- GRIER
- PRIER

But these are too similar. Let's think of others:
- CRONE (but ends with -ONE, and has R in 2nd position)
- PRONE (same)
- GROPE
- GRIPE
- GLOBE
- GRIKE
- GRAVE (but has A)
- GROVE
- GRISE (but has S)
- GRIEE (invalid)

Let me try ""CRONE"":
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains R in position 2 (not 4) (✓)
- No S, T, A (✓)
- Uses common letters C, R, O, N, E

This seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback that the word ends with E, contains an R (but not in the 4th position), and excludes S, T, A, I'll try a new word incorporating other common letters.

The only common valid word seems to be CREME, but it repeats E.
Wait, let me list all valid English words matching C R _ M E:
