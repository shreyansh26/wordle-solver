For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters in English words
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is also a very common letter.

The first guess “AROSE” received all x’s, so every one of its five letters (A, R, O, S, E) is **not** in the secret word at all.

That means:
- None of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the word.
- We therefore need a new candidate that avoids these five letters entirely.

Popular consonants we still have available include T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.
Popular vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

A strong starting word that uses only the still-available letters and covers several high-frequency ones is “UNTIL”:
U, N, T, I, L – all are allowed and hit a good spread of vowels and consonants.

(Alternate valid choices could be “BUILD”, “UNITY”, “THUMP”, etc., but “UNTIL” is concise and common.)

So I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

Summary of what we know:

Letters that do **not** appear in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y

Letters that **do** appear in the word:  
T, I, H

Positions we have ruled out:

- I cannot be in position 2 (from ITCHY feedback).
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 2 (from UNTIL and ITCHY feedback).
- H is in position 4 (✓), so H is fixed there.

So the word structure is:  
_ _ _ H _  
with the remaining letters being chosen from {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z} plus the known letters T, I.

We still need to place T and I somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) with the constraints above.

Possibilities:
- I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
- T can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 3 already ruled out earlier, but wait: from UNTIL we know T is in the word but not in position 3. From ITCHY we know T is in the word but not in position 2. So T can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is H, so T must be in 1 or 5.)

Thus:
- T is in position 1 or 5
- I is in positions 1, 3, or 5 (and must be distinct from T)

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: T in position 1
Word looks like: T _ _ H _
I must be in 3 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- T I _ H _  → ""TI_H_"" but need valid English word. ""TITCH"" is invalid (double T), ""TIDHY"" not valid.
- T _ I H _  → ""T I"" in positions 1 and 3. Candidates: ""TIMID"" – but D is allowed, no forbidden letters. Let's check: T I M I D → has D (OK), M (OK), I already placed. Seems valid.

Case 2: T in position 5
Word looks like: _ _ _ H T
I must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Candidates:
- I _ _ H T → ""I _ _ H T"" → ""IMBHT"" not valid.
- _ I _ H T → ""_ I _ H T"" → ""BIGHT"" – but G is allowed, B is allowed. Check letters: B, I, G, H, T – none forbidden. Valid word.

Between ""TIMID"" and ""BIGHT"":
- ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, but we know from ITCHY that I cannot be in position 2 (wait no: ITCHY showed I in position 1 as ""-"", meaning I not in position 1, but can be in 3 or 5. Actually ITCHY's I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", so I cannot be in position 1. So in Case 1, I must be in position 3. So ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, which is not ruled out yet (only positions 1 and 4 ruled out for I). So ""TIMID"" is possible.
- ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2, which is also not ruled out.

But let's check if any of these have forbidden letters: 
- ""TIMID"" uses T, I, M, I, D – all allowed.
- ""BIGHT"" uses B, I, G, H, T – all allowed.

Both are valid, but ""BIGHT"" seems more informative as it introduces G. Let's go with ""BIGHT"".

Wait, but ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2. From ITCHY, I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", meaning I is not in position 1, but can be in 2,3,5. Similarly from UNTIL, I was in position 4 marked as ""-"", but position 4 is H, so that doesn't constrain I further. So ""BIGHT"" is valid.

But let me verify ""BIGHT"" has all allowed letters: B, I, G, H, T – none are in the forbidden list. Yes.

So the guess is ""BIGHT"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters in English words
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is also a very common letter.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess “AROSE” received all x’s, so every one of its five letters (A, R, O, S, E) is **not** in the secret word at all.

That means:
- None of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the word.
- We therefore need a new candidate that avoids these five letters entirely.

Popular consonants we still have available include T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.
Popular vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

A strong starting word that uses only the still-available letters and covers several high-frequency ones is “UNTIL”:
U, N, T, I, L – all are allowed and hit a good spread of vowels and consonants.

(Alternate valid choices could be “BUILD”, “UNITY”, “THUMP”, etc., but “UNTIL” is concise and common.)

So I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

   ⇒ keep T and I in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Letters known to be in the word: T and I  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any of the vowels still allowed (only Y remains as a vowel-like letter).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains T and I somewhere (but T not in position 3 and I not in position 4)
- does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- is a valid English word

Let’s try “ITCHY”:
- I is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 2 (allowed)
- C, H, Y are all allowed letters
- no forbidden letters appear
- valid word

But before finalizing, let’s also consider possible T and I placements to maximize information. Another candidate is “TWIXT”:
- T starts in position 1 (allowed)
- W, X are allowed
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- Final T in position 5

“TWIXT” is valid and places T in two positions and I in one, but uses X which is less common. Between the two, “ITCHY” provides coverage of C, H, Y, and places I and T.

I’ll go with “ITCHY”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters in English words
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- This combination can quickly help identify which letters are in the word and their positions

Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is also a very common letter.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess “AROSE” received all x’s, so every one of its five letters (A, R, O, S, E) is **not** in the secret word at all.

That means:
- None of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the word.
- We therefore need a new candidate that avoids these five letters entirely.

Popular consonants we still have available include T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.
Popular vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

A strong starting word that uses only the still-available letters and covers several high-frequency ones is “UNTIL”:
U, N, T, I, L – all are allowed and hit a good spread of vowels and consonants.

(Alternate valid choices could be “BUILD”, “UNITY”, “THUMP”, etc., but “UNTIL” is concise and common.)

So I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(x)

   ⇒ keep T and I in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Letters known to be in the word: T and I  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any of the vowels still allowed (only Y remains as a vowel-like letter).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains T and I somewhere (but T not in position 3 and I not in position 4)
- does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- is a valid English word

Let’s try “ITCHY”:
- I is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 2 (allowed)
- C, H, Y are all allowed letters
- no forbidden letters appear
- valid word

But before finalizing, let’s also consider possible T and I placements to maximize information. Another candidate is “TWIXT”:
- T starts in position 1 (allowed)
- W, X are allowed
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- Final T in position 5

“TWIXT” is valid and places T in two positions and I in one, but uses X which is less common. Between the two, “ITCHY” provides coverage of C, H, Y, and places I and T.

I’ll go with “ITCHY”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know:

Letters that do **not** appear in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, C, Y

Letters that **do** appear in the word:  
T, I, H

Positions we have ruled out:

- I cannot be in position 2 (from ITCHY feedback).
- T cannot be in positions 3 or 2 (from UNTIL and ITCHY feedback).
- H is in position 4 (✓), so H is fixed there.

So the word structure is:  
_ _ _ H _  
with the remaining letters being chosen from {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z} plus the known letters T, I.

We still need to place T and I somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) with the constraints above.

Possibilities:
- I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
- T can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 3 already ruled out earlier, but wait: from UNTIL we know T is in the word but not in position 3. From ITCHY we know T is in the word but not in position 2. So T can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is H, so T must be in 1 or 5.)

Thus:
- T is in position 1 or 5
- I is in positions 1, 3, or 5 (and must be distinct from T)

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: T in position 1
Word looks like: T _ _ H _
I must be in 3 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- T I _ H _  → ""TI_H_"" but need valid English word. ""TITCH"" is invalid (double T), ""TIDHY"" not valid.
- T _ I H _  → ""T I"" in positions 1 and 3. Candidates: ""TIMID"" – but D is allowed, no forbidden letters. Let's check: T I M I D → has D (OK), M (OK), I already placed. Seems valid.

Case 2: T in position 5
Word looks like: _ _ _ H T
I must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Candidates:
- I _ _ H T → ""I _ _ H T"" → ""IMBHT"" not valid.
- _ I _ H T → ""_ I _ H T"" → ""BIGHT"" – but G is allowed, B is allowed. Check letters: B, I, G, H, T – none forbidden. Valid word.

Between ""TIMID"" and ""BIGHT"":
- ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, but we know from ITCHY that I cannot be in position 2 (wait no: ITCHY showed I in position 1 as ""-"", meaning I not in position 1, but can be in 3 or 5. Actually ITCHY's I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", so I cannot be in position 1. So in Case 1, I must be in position 3. So ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, which is not ruled out yet (only positions 1 and 4 ruled out for I). So ""TIMID"" is possible.
- ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2, which is also not ruled out.

But let's check if any of these have forbidden letters: 
- ""TIMID"" uses T, I, M, I, D – all allowed.
- ""BIGHT"" uses B, I, G, H, T – all allowed.

Both are valid, but ""BIGHT"" seems more informative as it introduces G. Let's go with ""BIGHT"".

Wait, but ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2. From ITCHY, I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", meaning I is not in position 1, but can be in 2,3,5. Similarly from UNTIL, I was in position 4 marked as ""-"", but position 4 is H, so that doesn't constrain I further. So ""BIGHT"" is valid.

But let me verify ""BIGHT"" has all allowed letters: B, I, G, H, T – none are in the forbidden list. Yes.

So the guess is ""BIGHT"".

But position 4 is H, so T must be in 1 or 5.)\n\nThus:\n- T is in position 1 or 5\n- I is in positions 1, 3, or 5 (and must be distinct from T)\n\nLet’s consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: T in position 1\nWord looks like: T _ _ H _\nI must be in 3 or 5.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- T I _ H _  → ""TI_H_"" but need valid English word. ""TITCH"" is invalid (double T), ""TIDHY"" not valid.\n- T _ I H _  → ""T I"" in positions 1 and 3. Candidates: ""TIMID"" – but D is allowed, no forbidden letters. Let\'s check: T I M I D → has D (OK), M (OK), I already placed. Seems valid.\n\nCase 2: T in position 5\nWord looks like: _ _ _ H T\nI must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nCandidates:\n- I _ _ H T → ""I _ _ H T"" → ""IMBHT"" not valid.\n- _ I _ H T → ""_ I _ H T"" → ""BIGHT"" – but G is allowed, B is allowed. Check letters: B, I, G, H, T – none forbidden. Valid word.\n\nBetween ""TIMID"" and ""BIGHT"":\n- ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, but we know from ITCHY that I cannot be in position 2 (wait no: ITCHY showed I in position 1 as ""-"", meaning I not in position 1, but can be in 3 or 5. Actually ITCHY\'s I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", so I cannot be in position 1. So in Case 1, I must be in position 3. So ""TIMID"" has I in position 2, which is not ruled out yet (only positions 1 and 4 ruled out for I). So ""TIMID"" is possible.\n- ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2, which is also not ruled out.\n\nBut let\'s check if any of these have forbidden letters: \n- ""TIMID"" uses T, I, M, I, D – all allowed.\n- ""BIGHT"" uses B, I, G, H, T – all allowed.\n\nBoth are valid, but ""BIGHT"" seems more informative as it introduces G. Let\'s go with ""BIGHT"".\n\nWait, but ""BIGHT"" has I in position 2. From ITCHY, I was in position 1 marked as ""-"", meaning I is not in position 1, but can be in 2,3,5. Similarly from UNTIL, I was in position 4 marked as ""-"", but position 4 is H, so that doesn\'t constrain I further. So ""BIGHT"" is valid.\n\nBut let me verify ""BIGHT"" has all allowed letters: B, I, G, H, T – none are in the forbidden list.

The BIGHT feedback showed I, G, H, T already in their correct positions (2-5), leaving only the first letter unknown.  
FIGHT was our only remaining common candidate, but its first letter F was rejected (F(x)), so F is **not** in the word.

The still-allowed consonants for position 1 are all letters not yet tried and not in the banned list:  
{D, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z} (plus any others never used or ruled out).

The only valid English word matching _IGHT with those consonants is “MIGHT”.

So the secret word must be MIGHT.
