For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, and ideally excluding rare letters like Q, X, or Z. Good starting words often contain common vowels and consonants.

Some popular first guesses include:
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of letters)
- ROAST (includes S and T which are very common)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words. It contains:
- S: very common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means we need a completely fresh set of letters.

To maximize information on the second guess, I’ll pick a word that:
- avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely
- uses other very common English letters (R, N, I, O, C, U, D, etc.)
- gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants

A strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- R and N are high-frequency consonants
- O and U are the next most common vowels after A and E
- D is also common
- No overlap with the eliminated letters from SLATE

From the new feedback we now know:

2. Letters IN the word but not in the positions shown:
   - U is somewhere other than position 3  
   - D is somewhere other than position 5

- Vowels left: I, (Y)  
- Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (though we’ll stick to common ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses U and D somewhere (but U not in 3rd place, D not in 5th)  
- Contains none of the letters S L A T E R O N  
- Ideally tests additional common consonants and at least one new vowel

A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- Uses U (not in 3rd position) and D is not needed here; instead it gives us C, H, M, P which are all common consonants plus the vowel U.  
Wait — “CHUMP” lacks D; we actually need to keep D in the guess because we know D is in the word somewhere. Let’s revise.

Better: “CUBID”  
- Contains U (position 2) and D (position 5) — but feedback for ROUND said D cannot be in position 5. So D must be in 1-4.  
Therefore choose “DUMPY”  
- D in position 1 (allowed), U in position 2, plus M, P, Y.

- Letters IN:
  – U is in the word AND already in the correct 2nd position (U=✓ at position 2)
  – D is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (D=- at position 5)

Therefore the secret word pattern is:  
_ U _ _ _  
and it must contain a D somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining letters to consider (from frequent English consonants/vowels not yet eliminated) include:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowel Y (only remaining vowel besides U).

We want a word that:
- Has U in position 2  
- Contains D in position 1, 3, or 4  
- Uses only non-eliminated letters  
- Avoids any letters we know are absent

Candidate words satisfying these constraints:
- DUMMY – letters ok, but repeats M and Y; might be useful
- BUDDY – repeats D, repeats Y
- GUMMY – no D
- HUMID – letters H,U,M,I,D but I is already eliminated (from Guess 3 feedback: I=x)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words, and ideally excluding rare letters like Q, X, or Z. Good starting words often contain common vowels and consonants.

Some popular first guesses include:
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of letters)
- ROAST (includes S and T which are very common)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words. It contains:
- S: very common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means we need a completely fresh set of letters.

To maximize information on the second guess, I’ll pick a word that:
- avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely
- uses other very common English letters (R, N, I, O, C, U, D, etc.)
- gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants

A strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- R and N are high-frequency consonants
- O and U are the next most common vowels after A and E
- D is also common
- No overlap with the eliminated letters from SLATE

2. Letters IN the word but not in the positions shown:
   - U is somewhere other than position 3  
   - D is somewhere other than position 5  

So far the alphabet of available letters is:
- Vowels left: I, (Y)  
- Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (though we’ll stick to common ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses U and D somewhere (but U not in 3rd place, D not in 5th)  
- Contains none of the letters S L A T E R O N  
- Ideally tests additional common consonants and at least one new vowel

A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- Uses U (not in 3rd position) and D is not needed here; instead it gives us C, H, M, P which are all common consonants plus the vowel U.  
Wait — “CHUMP” lacks D; we actually need to keep D in the guess because we know D is in the word somewhere. Let’s revise.

Better: “CUBID”  
- Contains U (position 2) and D (position 5) — but feedback for ROUND said D cannot be in position 5. So D must be in 1-4.  
Therefore choose “DUMPY”  
- D in position 1 (allowed), U in position 2, plus M, P, Y.  
But Y is acceptable as a sometimes-vowel. Common letters, good coverage.

Another option: “BUDDY”  
- D appears twice, which is wasteful; let’s avoid double letters for now.

“MUDDY” same issue.

“DUMBO” has O (eliminated).

“CUPID”  
- C, U, P, I, D  
- U isn’t in 3rd, D isn’t in 5th — fits perfectly.  
- Adds new vowel I and consonants C, P.

2. _ U D _ Y

3. _ U _ D Y

The most straightforward valid word that fits constraints is DUMMY (D U M M Y), which:
- Puts D in position 1 (allowed)  
- Keeps U in 2 and Y in 5 (matches ✓ feedback)  
- Uses only allowed letters (M isn’t eliminated)  
- No conflicts with prior feedback
