- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common English letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A common and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three vowels: A, O, E (which are very common in 5-letter words)
- Two common consonants: R, S
- These letters appear frequently in many English words, making it likely to get some hits or near-hits.

This approach balances vowel coverage and consonant diversity, which is a good starting strategy for Wordle-like games.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct final position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct final position.

So the word ends in “SE”.  
Letters known to be absent: A, R.  
Letter known to be present but not in position 3: O.

We want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and E in positions 4 and 5.
2. Moves O to a different slot (1, 2, or 5 is impossible; it must be 1 or 2).
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R).

Choosing a word that satisfies these rules, I’ll pick “HOUSE”:
- Uses O in position 2 (moving it from position 3).
- Keeps S and E in positions 4 and 5.
- Uses H and U, which haven’t been tested yet.

   – O is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – U is in the word but not in position 3.

Known pattern so far:

Letters still allowed: any except A, R, H.  
U must appear somewhere in one of the remaining open slots (positions 1 or 3), because it cannot stay in position 3.

Position 3 can be any letter except the ones already eliminated and except those we’ve placed. To maximize information, a good next guess would test U in position 1 and throw in two new common consonants for positions 1 and 3.

Let’s try “MOUSE”:
- M and U are new test letters.  
- Puts U in position 1 (safe) and keeps the known O, S, E.  
- M tests a new consonant in position 1.  
- Covers additional high-frequency letters.
