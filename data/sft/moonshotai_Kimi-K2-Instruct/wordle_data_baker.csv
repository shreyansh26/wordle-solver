The first guess in Wordle is often chosen to maximize the information gained by using common letters. A good starting word includes several vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.). 

Popular choices include words like ""stone"", ""audio"", or ""slate"". Among these, ""slate"" is particularly effective because:
- S is a very common starting or ending letter
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T)
- No letter is repeated, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on “slate”:

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively).
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T.

A good next guess should:
- Re-use the letters that we now know are in the word (A and E) but in different positions.
- Introduce several new common consonants that haven’t been tried yet (R, N, C, M, etc.).
- Avoid S, L, T entirely.
- Place A and E in different spots than before.

A candidate word satisfying these constraints is “crane”:
- C, R, N are all new high-frequency consonants.
- A is now in position 2 (previously was at 3).
- E is now in position 5 (previously was at 4).  
This keeps both known letters while shifting their positions and adds fresh information.

Current state after three guesses:

Letters ruled OUT: S, L, T, C, N, H, D  
Letters confirmed IN (but positions unknown): A, E, R  

Position constraints so far:
- A ≠ 2, 3  
- E ≠ 2, 4, 5  
- R ≠ 2, 4  

We still need to test A in 1st, 4th or 5th, E in 1st or 3rd, R in 1st, 3rd or 5th.  
We also need two new consonants (from the remaining high-frequency set: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.) to form a valid 5-letter English word that uses each of A, E, R exactly once.

A word that satisfies all constraints is “rearm”:
- R in 1st position (never tested yet)  
- E in 2nd position — wait, E cannot be in 2nd (feedback from heard: E(-) means E is NOT in position 2).  
Oops, scratch that.

Let’s try “repay”:
- R in 1st (new)  
- E in 2nd (still invalid) – also uses P and Y.  
Still violates E≠2.

Next, look for words with:
- E in 3rd (allowed)  
- A in 4th or 5th (allowed)  
- R in 1st or 5th (allowed)

Good candidate: “realm”
letters: R, E, A, L, M  
But L is already ruled out (from slate: L(x)).

Next candidate: “freak” – uses F, K (new)  
Positions:
- F new
- R 2nd – already known bad (crane: R(-) at 2)  
Skip.

Next: “gamer”
letters: G, A, M, E, R  
Check positions:
- G new

A=1 (never tried), E=4 (feedback only said E≠2,4,5 from previous, but from heard E≠2,4,5. Wait, in heard E is in position 2 and feedback was E(-) – meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can still be in 1,3. Position 4 is NOT ruled out for E. Let me recheck.

From previous:
- slate: E(-) at 5 → E≠5  
- crane: E(-) at 5 → same  
- heard: E(-) at 2 → E≠2  

So E can be at 1 or 3 or 4.  
Likewise A:  
- slate: A(-) at 3 → A≠3  
- crane: A(-) at 2 → A≠2  
- heard: A(-) at 3 → same  
So A can be at 1,4,5.

R:  
- crane: R(-) at 2 → R≠2  
- heard: R(-) at 4 → R≠4  
So R can be at 1,3,5.

Therefore a valid word meeting all constraints: “aerob” – but not common.

Better common word that fits: “peach” – but H is out.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,baker,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess in Wordle is often chosen to maximize the information gained by using common letters. A good starting word includes several vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.). 

Popular choices include words like ""stone"", ""audio"", or ""slate"". Among these, ""slate"" is particularly effective because:
- S is a very common starting or ending letter
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T)
- No letter is repeated, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “slate”:

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively).
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T.

A good next guess should:
- Re-use the letters that we now know are in the word (A and E) but in different positions.
- Introduce several new common consonants that haven’t been tried yet (R, N, C, M, etc.).
- Avoid S, L, T entirely.
- Place A and E in different spots than before.

A candidate word satisfying these constraints is “crane”:
- C, R, N are all new high-frequency consonants.
- A is now in position 2 (previously was at 3).
- E is now in position 5 (previously was at 4).  
This keeps both known letters while shifting their positions and adds fresh information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now have the following definitive knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word (✗): S, L, T, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓) but whose exact positions are unknown: A, E, R  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in 3rd or 2nd position (from slate and crane).  
- E cannot be in 5th or 4th position (from slate and crane).  
- R cannot be in 2nd position (from crane).  

We still lack information about letters like D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
A good next guess should:  
1. Include A, E, R in new, permissible positions.  
2. Introduce two new, high-frequency consonants that have not yet been used.  
3. Avoid all letters already ruled out.

One word that fits these criteria is “heard”:
- H and D are new letters that are common.  
- E is placed in the 2nd position (previously unseen for E).  
- A is placed in the 3rd position (disallowed before, but 1st and 4th are still open).  
- R is placed in the 4th position (a new spot for R).  

This tests R in a new position, places E and A in permissible spots, and adds H and D for maximum new information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess in Wordle is often chosen to maximize the information gained by using common letters. A good starting word includes several vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.). 

Popular choices include words like ""stone"", ""audio"", or ""slate"". Among these, ""slate"" is particularly effective because:
- S is a very common starting or ending letter
- L, A, T, E are all high-frequency letters
- It covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T)
- No letter is repeated, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

<guess>slate</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “slate”:

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively).
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T.

A good next guess should:
- Re-use the letters that we now know are in the word (A and E) but in different positions.
- Introduce several new common consonants that haven’t been tried yet (R, N, C, M, etc.).
- Avoid S, L, T entirely.
- Place A and E in different spots than before.

A candidate word satisfying these constraints is “crane”:
- C, R, N are all new high-frequency consonants.
- A is now in position 2 (previously was at 3).
- E is now in position 5 (previously was at 4).  
This keeps both known letters while shifting their positions and adds fresh information.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now have the following definitive knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word (✗): S, L, T, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓) but whose exact positions are unknown: A, E, R  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in 3rd or 2nd position (from slate and crane).  
- E cannot be in 5th or 4th position (from slate and crane).  
- R cannot be in 2nd position (from crane).  

We still lack information about letters like D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.  
A good next guess should:  
1. Include A, E, R in new, permissible positions.  
2. Introduce two new, high-frequency consonants that have not yet been used.  
3. Avoid all letters already ruled out.

One word that fits these criteria is “heard”:
- H and D are new letters that are common.  
- E is placed in the 2nd position (previously unseen for E).  
- A is placed in the 3rd position (disallowed before, but 1st and 4th are still open).  
- R is placed in the 4th position (a new spot for R).  

This tests R in a new position, places E and A in permissible spots, and adds H and D for maximum new information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current state after three guesses:

Letters ruled OUT: S, L, T, C, N, H, D  
Letters confirmed IN (but positions unknown): A, E, R  

Position constraints so far:
- A ≠ 2, 3  
- E ≠ 2, 4, 5  
- R ≠ 2, 4  

We still need to test A in 1st, 4th or 5th, E in 1st or 3rd, R in 1st, 3rd or 5th.  
We also need two new consonants (from the remaining high-frequency set: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.) to form a valid 5-letter English word that uses each of A, E, R exactly once.

A word that satisfies all constraints is “rearm”:
- R in 1st position (never tested yet)  
- E in 2nd position — wait, E cannot be in 2nd (feedback from heard: E(-) means E is NOT in position 2).  
Oops, scratch that.

Let’s try “repay”:
- R in 1st (new)  
- E in 2nd (still invalid) – also uses P and Y.  
Still violates E≠2.

Next, look for words with:
- E in 3rd (allowed)  
- A in 4th or 5th (allowed)  
- R in 1st or 5th (allowed)

Good candidate: “realm”
letters: R, E, A, L, M  
But L is already ruled out (from slate: L(x)).

Next candidate: “freak” – uses F, K (new)  
Positions:
- F new
- R 2nd – already known bad (crane: R(-) at 2)  
Skip.

Next: “gamer”
letters: G, A, M, E, R  
Check positions:
- G new
- A 2nd – ruled out (crane: A(-) at 2)  
Skip.

Next: “grape”
- G 1st (new)
- R 2nd – ruled out  
Skip.

Next: “wreak”
- W 1st (new)
- R 2nd – ruled out  
Skip.

Next: “baker”
- B 1st (new)
- A 2nd – ruled out  
Skip.

Next: “frame”
- F 1st (new)
- R 2nd – ruled out  
Skip.

Next: “pearl” – contains L (ruled out)  
Skip.

Next: “amber”
- A 1st (allowed)
- M 2nd (new)
- B 3rd (new)
- E 4th (allowed – not yet ruled out for E)
- R 5th (allowed)

A=1 (never tried), E=4 (feedback only said E≠2,4,5 from previous, but from heard E≠2,4,5. Wait, in heard E is in position 2 and feedback was E(-) – meaning E is in word but not at 2. So E can still be in 1,3. Position 4 is NOT ruled out for E. Let me recheck.

From previous:
- slate: E(-) at 5 → E≠5  
- crane: E(-) at 5 → same  
- heard: E(-) at 2 → E≠2  

So E can be at 1 or 3 or 4.  
Likewise A:  
- slate: A(-) at 3 → A≠3  
- crane: A(-) at 2 → A≠2  
- heard: A(-) at 3 → same  
So A can be at 1,4,5.

R:  
- crane: R(-) at 2 → R≠2  
- heard: R(-) at 4 → R≠4  
So R can be at 1,3,5.

Therefore a valid word meeting all constraints: “aerob” – but not common.

Better common word that fits: “peach” – but H is out.

Next: “pager”
- P new
- A 1st (allowed)
- G new
- E 4th (allowed)

All constraints satisfied, no reused letters, new consonants P and G.

Current known facts:

- Positions locked in:
  2 = A, 4 = E, 5 = R  → pattern _ A _ E R

- Letters already ruled out:
  S, L, T, C, N, H, D, P, G, M, K

- Still allowed consonants for positions 1 and 3:
  B, F, I (vowel, but usable), O (vowel), U (vowel), V, W, Y, etc.

We need a single 5-letter word that matches _ A _ E R using only allowed letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible remaining valid English words:
- B A B E R   (B twice, but B is allowed—yet uncommon word)
- B A I E R   (not a standard word)
- F A I E R   (not a standard word)
- F A V E R   → F A V O R is standard, but not _ A _ E R.
- W A I E R   (not standard)
- W A V E R   → W A V E R is a common English word ending in “-AVER”.

The only common word left that fits _ A _ E R with allowed letters is:
- F A V E R   (F and V are both still allowed)

Therefore, the correct, unique remaining word must be “FAVER”, but that’s a rare spelling. The standard spelling is “FAVOR” which does not fit the pattern (4th letter is O). The pattern demands E in position 4, so “W A V E R” is the only common English word that fits _ A _ E R with unused consonants. “W A V E R” is valid.

So the guess is “WAVER”.
