For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is considered one of the best starting words in Wordle because it includes highly frequent letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers multiple vowels and consonants. This can help quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters in the secret word.

The first guess CRANE gave us the feedback:  
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

- E appears in the word but is NOT in the 5th position.  
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So the secret word must:
- contain the letter E somewhere except the 5th spot;  
- contain none of C, R, A, N;  
- use other letters that were not tried yet.

Good next starting letters that avoid C,R,A,N and use high-frequency consonants and vowels could be:  
S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced word that keeps E and introduces four new high-frequency letters while avoiding the eliminated ones is:

STOLe → but the e is at the end again (disallowed).  
Shift e to the 3rd spot: STELE (not great, double E).

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, O, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, T, E  
Positions ruled out so far:
- 1st: S (from STOLE feedback S(-))
- 2nd: T (from STOLE feedback T(-))
- 4th: E (from STOLE feedback E(-))
- 5th: E (from CRANE feedback E(-))

So E must be in position 3.
S cannot be 1st.
T cannot be 2nd.

The pattern so far is: _ _ E _ _

Letters remaining to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A balanced next guess should place S and T in allowed slots while introducing new consonants.

Possible constructions:
- S in 2nd or 3rd (but 3rd is E) → S in 2nd: _ S E _ _
- T in 1st, 3rd (3rd is E), 4th or 5th → T in 1st or 4th or 5th.

Let’s try:
T in 1st, S in 2nd, E in 3rd: T S E _ _  → need two more letters avoiding C,R,A,N,O,L.

Good choices: T S E _ _ → T S E D ?  (D is common), U (another vowel) → T S E D U (not a word).  
Try D and Y → TSEDY (invalid).

Try M and U → TSEM U (invalid).

Instead, put S in 4th (allowed) and T in 5th (allowed), but then we have _ _ E S T.  
That uses S and T in 4,5. First two slots need new letters.  
Good letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Pick common ones: U and M → U M E S T (UMEST invalid).  
D and I → D I E S T (invalid).  
B and U → B U E S T (invalid).

Alternative: use S in 4th and another consonant.  
B, I, E, S, T → BIEST (not a word).  
D, I, E, S, T → DIEST (not common).  
M, I, E, S, T → MIEST (not a word).  
G, I, E, S, T → GIEST (no).  
H, I, E, S, T → HIEST (variant spelling of ""highest"" but usually not accepted).

Try shifting S to 5th, T to 1st: T _ E _ S  
T I E D S → TIEDS (no).  
T U E S S (no).  
T H E M S (no).  
T U E S Y (no).

Reset: pattern _ _ E _ _ with S and T somewhere.  
Let’s try I as 1st, S as 4th, T as 5th but that’s I _ E S T.  
Need a consonant for 2nd: I B E S T → IBEST (no).  
I D E S T → IDEST (no).  
I M E S T → IMEST (no).

Another pattern: S in 2nd, E in 3rd, _ S E _ _  
Need 1st and 4th,5th letters.  
D I S E T → DISET (no).  
B I S E T → BISET (no).  

Try S in 4th: _ _ E S _  
T in 1st: T _ E S _  
Need 2nd and 5th letters.  
T I E S Y → TIESY (no).  
T H E S E → THE SE (invalid).  
T U E S Y → TUESY (no).  
T H E S E → THESE (good word, uses E in 3rd, S in 4th, T in 1st, but E is already in 3rd and allowed in 5th? Wait, E cannot be 5th (from CRANE). So THESE has E in 3rd and 5th (5th E is invalid). So skip.

Next try: S in 4th, E in 3rd, T in 5th: _ _ E S T  
Need 1st and 2nd letters.  
D U E S T → DUEST (no).  
B U E S T → BUEST (no).  
G U E S T → GUEST (valid word).

GUEST uses G, U, E, S, T.  
- No banned letters (C,R,A,N,O,L).  
- E is in 3rd (allowed).  
- S is in 4th (allowed).  
- T is in 5th (allowed).  
- G and U are new letters.

This seems like a strong third guess.

Positions ruled out so far:
- 1st: S (from STOLE feedback S(-))
- 2nd: T (from STOLE feedback T(-))
- 4th: E (from STOLE feedback E(-))
- 5th: E (from CRANE feedback E(-))

So E must be in position 3.
S cannot be 1st.
T cannot be 2nd.

The pattern so far is: _ _ E _ _

Letters remaining to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A balanced next guess should place S and T in allowed slots while introducing new consonants.

Possible constructions:
- S in 2nd or 3rd (but 3rd is E) → S in 2nd: _ S E _ _
- T in 1st, 3rd (3rd is E), 4th or 5th → T in 1st or 4th or 5th.

Let’s try:
T in 1st, S in 2nd, E in 3rd: T S E _ _  → need two more letters avoiding C,R,A,N,O,L.

Good choices: T S E _ _ → T S E D ?  (D is common), U (another vowel) → T S E D U (not a word).  
Try D and Y → TSEDY (invalid).

Try M and U → TSEM U (invalid).

Instead, put S in 4th (allowed) and T in 5th (allowed), but then we have _ _ E S T.  
That uses S and T in 4,5. First two slots need new letters.  
Good letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Pick common ones: U and M → U M E S T (UMEST invalid).  
D and I → D I E S T (invalid).  
B and U → B U E S T (invalid).

Alternative: use S in 4th and another consonant.  
B, I, E, S, T → BIEST (not a word).  
D, I, E, S, T → DIEST (not common).  
M, I, E, S, T → MIEST (not a word).  
G, I, E, S, T → GIEST (no).  
H, I, E, S, T → HIEST (variant spelling of ""highest"" but usually not accepted).

Try shifting S to 5th, T to 1st: T _ E _ S  
T I E D S → TIEDS (no).  
T U E S S (no).  
T H E M S (no).  
T U E S Y (no).

Reset: pattern _ _ E _ _ with S and T somewhere.  
Let’s try I as 1st, S as 4th, T as 5th but that’s I _ E S T.  
Need a consonant for 2nd: I B E S T → IBEST (no).  
I D E S T → IDEST (no).  
I M E S T → IMEST (no).

Another pattern: S in 2nd, E in 3rd, _ S E _ _  
Need 1st and 4th,5th letters.  
D I S E T → DISET (no).  
B I S E T → BISET (no).  

Try S in 4th: _ _ E S _  
T in 1st: T _ E S _  
Need 2nd and 5th letters.  
T I E S Y → TIESY (no).  
T H E S E → THE SE (invalid).  
T U E S Y → TUESY (no).  
T H E S E → THESE (good word, uses E in 3rd, S in 4th, T in 1st, but E is already in 3rd and allowed in 5th? Wait, E cannot be 5th (from CRANE). So THESE has E in 3rd and 5th (5th E is invalid). So skip.

Next try: S in 4th, E in 3rd, T in 5th: _ _ E S T  
Need 1st and 2nd letters.  
D U E S T → DUEST (no).  
B U E S T → BUEST (no).  
G U E S T → GUEST (valid word).

GUEST uses G, U, E, S, T.  
- No banned letters (C,R,A,N,O,L).  
- E is in 3rd (allowed).  
- S is in 4th (allowed).  
- T is in 5th (allowed).  
- G and U are new letters.

This seems like a strong third guess.

Let's summarize what we know so far from the three guesses:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5

2. STOLE → S(-) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, O, L (from previous and new info)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 2
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known) or position 4

3. GUEST → G(x) U(x) E(-) S(-) T(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, O, L, G, U
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from this feedback)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5

From all this:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, O, L, G, U
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, T, E
- Position constraints:
  - E: cannot be 3, 4, or 5 → must be position 1 or 2
  - S: cannot be 1 or 4 → must be position 2, 3, or 5
  - T: cannot be 2 or 5 → must be position 1, 3, or 4

Possible positions for E:
- If E is 1st: _ E _ _ _
- If E is 2nd: _ _ E _ _

Let's explore E in position 2 first (more common):
Pattern: _ E _ _ _
With S and T needing to go in remaining positions (1,3,4,5), with constraints:
- S can be 3 or 5
- T can be 1,3, or 4

Trying S in 3rd and T in 1st or 4th:
- T E S _ _ → But S is in 3rd (allowed)
  Need two more letters for 4th and 5th, avoiding banned letters (C,R,A,N,O,L,G,U)
  Available: B, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y
  Possible word: T E S T _ → TEST_ but already have T in 1st and 3rd
  T E S T Y → TESTY (but Y is allowed)
  Check letters: T, E, S, T, Y - all allowed positions and letters
  However, we already have T in 1st (allowed) and S in 3rd (allowed), E in 2nd (allowed)

E in position 1 is also possible:
E _ _ _ _
But then we'd need to place S and T in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
- S can be 2,3,5
- T can be 3,4
This seems less likely as we'd have fewer constraints.

TESTY seems to satisfy all constraints:
- Contains T, E, S
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- T is in position 1 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (T,E,S,T,Y - Y hasn't been eliminated)
