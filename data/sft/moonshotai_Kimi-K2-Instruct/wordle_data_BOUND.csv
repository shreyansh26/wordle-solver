Since this is our first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy for the first guess in Wordle is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English language
2. Maximizes the chance of getting hits (letters in the word) and correct positions
3. Typically includes vowels and common consonants

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAINE (R, A, I, N, E)
- ADIEU (for vowel-heavy approach)

I'll choose CRANE because it includes 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (C, R, N), giving us good coverage of frequent English letters while being a valid word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and already correctly placed in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word is _ _ _ N _ (fourth letter is N).
- The letters C, R, A, E are completely absent.
- We need 4 new consonants and a vowel that is not A or E.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.
Common consonants left that haven’t been ruled out: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s look for a word that:
1. Has N as the fourth letter.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters and possibly a fresh vowel.

Candidates that fit:
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) – but N is in position 4, so _ _ _ N _; SOUND has N in position 4, so fits perfectly.
- POUND – similar.
- MOUNT – similar.

I’ll choose SOUND because it covers three new vowels (O, U) and two fresh consonants (S, D).
