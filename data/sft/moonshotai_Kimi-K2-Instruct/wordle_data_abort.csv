For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word. A good starting word should contain common letters that appear in many 5-letter English words. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A strategic first guess would use a combination of these letters to test as many common letters as possible. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us feedback on which of these highly common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Other good alternatives could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' and 'S' which are very frequent.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and O are both in the word and in the exact positions 1 and 3, respectively.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So the word must be in the form:
A _ O _ _

Letters we now know are present: A, O, R
Letters we know are absent: S, E

Since R cannot be in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5. Let's try to fill the remaining slots with common letters that haven't been ruled out. The most common remaining consonants are D, N, T, L, M, C, etc. Vowels we haven't ruled out are I and U (since A and O are already used).

A good next guess would be something like A D O R N. This places R in position 4 (not position 2), keeps A and O in the correct positions, and uses common letters D and N. 

Another possibility is A C O R N, but let's go with A D O R N first as it uses common letters and positions R correctly.

Remaining possible consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining possible vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used)

- A C O R D (but D is already ruled out)
- A L O R D (D is out)
