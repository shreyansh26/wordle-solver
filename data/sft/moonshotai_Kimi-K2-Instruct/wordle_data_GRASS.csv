Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. A good first guess typically includes:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gained

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) covering both common and medium-frequency vowels
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This will give information about 5 different common letters, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the new feedback on TRASH:
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still confirmed in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is now confirmed in position 3.
- S(✓) → S is still confirmed in position 4.
- H(x) → H is NOT in the word.

So the word pattern is now: _ R A S _

Letters definitely used so far: R, A, S (all in correct positions)
Letters confirmed OUT: O, E, T, H
Letters still possibly in play: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

Only the first and fifth slots remain open. A good next word should test common consonants in those positions. The most common initial consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P.

A strong candidate is ""BRASS"", but it repeats S, so it won't give new information. ""CRASS"" does the same. Instead, let's pick a word that introduces two new letters while keeping the locked R-A-S pattern.

""GRASP"" is valid but reuses P which isn’t yet confirmed. ""DRAWS"" uses W/S, but S is already locked. The best pick is ""CRANK"" but it changes positions.

Wait – positions are locked: _ R A S _

So possible words:
- B R A S _
- C R A S _
- D R A S _
- F R A S _
- G R A S _
- etc.

Looking at common English words, ""GRASP"" fits but uses P. ""BRAS_"" needs a fifth letter. Common 5-letter words fitting _ R A S _:
- CRASH – but H is out.
- BRASS – repeats S.
- GRASP – uses P.
- DRAST – not valid.
- FRASS – obscure.

The most promising valid word is ""GRASP"", even though it introduces P, because it uses G (common initial consonant) and P (common final consonant). It tests new letters while keeping the locked pattern.

However, we have no information about G or P yet, so this is a good exploratory move.

But we can do better. Let’s look for other valid _ R A S _ words:
- ""BRISK"" – but K is rare, and we’d lose the locked S (no, S is locked at position 4).
Wait, _ R A S _ must end with any letter except O, E, T, H. So possible ends: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Common options:
- CRASS – repeats S, not helpful.
- FRASS – obscure.
- BRAST – invalid (T is out).
- GRASP – valid, introduces G and P.

Another option: ""DRAWS"" – but W isn’t confirmed, and D is good to test.

But ""DRAWS"" doesn’t fit _ R A S _ – it’s D R A W S, which would be D R A W S, but positions would be:
D (1), R (2), A (3), W (4), S (5) – but S is locked at 4, so this is invalid.

Thus, the only common valid _ R A S _ words are:
- BRAS_ – needs a letter, e.g., BRASK (invalid), BRASM (invalid), etc.
- CRASS – repeats S.
- GRASP – valid.

So ""GRASP"" seems best.

But let’s double-check: are there other valid _ R A S _ words? SCRABBLE lists:
- CRASS – repeats S.
- FRASS – obscure.
- GRASP – valid.
- TRASH – T is out.

Thus, ""GRASP"" is the best next guess to test new letters (G and P) in the open slots.
</think>

The pattern is now fixed as _ R A S _, with R, A, and S locked in positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The first and fifth letters are still unknown, and we have eliminated O, E, T, and H. A common word fitting this pattern is ""GRASP,"" which tests the new letters G and P in the remaining open positions.

- BRAST – invalid (T is out).
- GRASP – valid, introduces G and P.

Another option: ""DRAWS"" – but W isn’t confirmed, and D is good to test.

But ""DRAWS"" doesn’t fit _ R A S _ – it’s D R A W S, which would be D R A W S, but positions would be:
D (1), R (2), A (3), W (4), S (5) – but S is locked at 4, so this is invalid.

Thus, the only common valid _ R A S _ words are:

- A(✓) → A is now confirmed in position 3.
- S(✓) → S is still confirmed in position 4.
- H(x) → H is NOT in the word.

So the word pattern is now: _ R A S _

Letters definitely used so far: R, A, S (all in correct positions)
Letters confirmed OUT: O, E, T, H
Letters still possibly in play: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

Only the first and fifth slots remain open. A good next word should test common consonants in those positions. The most common initial consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P.

A strong candidate is ""BRASS"", but it repeats S, so it won't give new information. ""CRASS"" does the same. Instead, let's pick a word that introduces two new letters while keeping the locked R-A-S pattern.

""GRASP"" is valid but reuses P which isn’t yet confirmed. ""DRAWS"" uses W/S, but S is already locked. The best pick is ""CRANK"" but it changes positions.

Wait – positions are locked: _ R A S _

So possible words:
- B R A S _
- C R A S _
- D R A S _
- F R A S _
- G R A S _
- etc.

Looking at common English words, ""GRASP"" fits but uses P. ""BRAS_"" needs a fifth letter. Common 5-letter words fitting _ R A S _:
- CRASH – but H is out.
- BRASS – repeats S.
- GRASP – uses P.
- DRAST – not valid.
- FRASS – obscure.

The most promising valid word is ""GRASP"", even though it introduces P, because it uses G (common initial consonant) and P (common final consonant). It tests new letters while keeping the locked pattern.

However, we have no information about G or P yet, so this is a good exploratory move.

But we can do better. Let’s look for other valid _ R A S _ words:
- ""BRISK"" – but K is rare, and we’d lose the locked S (no, S is locked at position 4).
Wait, _ R A S _ must end with any letter except O, E, T, H. So possible ends: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Common options:
- CRASS – repeats S, not helpful.
- FRASS – obscure.
- BRAST – invalid (T is out).
- GRASP – valid, introduces G and P.

Another option: ""DRAWS"" – but W isn’t confirmed, and D is good to test.

But ""DRAWS"" doesn’t fit _ R A S _ – it’s D R A W S, which would be D R A W S, but positions would be:
D (1), R (2), A (3), W (4), S (5) – but S is locked at 4, so this is invalid.

Thus, the only common valid _ R A S _ words are:
- BRAS_ – needs a letter, e.g., BRASK (invalid), BRASM (invalid), etc.
- CRASS – repeats S.
- GRASP – valid.

So ""GRASP"" seems best.

But let’s double-check: are there other valid _ R A S _ words? SCRABBLE lists:
- CRASS – repeats S.
- FRASS – obscure.
- GRASP – valid.
- TRASH – T is out.

Thus, ""GRASP"" is the best next guess to test new letters (G and P) in the open slots.The pattern is now fixed as _ R A S _, with R, A, and S locked in positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The first and fifth letters are still unknown, and we have eliminated O, E, T, and H. A common word fitting this pattern is ""GRASP,"" which tests the new letters G and P in the remaining open positions.
