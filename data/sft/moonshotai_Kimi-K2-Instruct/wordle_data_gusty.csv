Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, my strategy should be to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters in English. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (especially E, A) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L.

A good starting word should cover these common letters efficiently. Some popular choices among Wordle players include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) plus two other common consonants (S, T), giving good coverage for the first guess.

The feedback from STARE is:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The secret word contains both S and T, but neither is in its current position (1st and 2nd letters respectively).
2. The secret word does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. The remaining letters to consider must come from the pool of unused letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), while including S and T in new positions.

Possible positions for S and T:
- S cannot be in position 1 (currently there)
- T cannot be in position 2 (currently there)
They could be anywhere else (positions 2-5 for S, positions 1,3-5 for T).

Next guess should:
- Include both S and T in new positions
- Exclude A, R, E
- Use other common letters to maximize info

Good candidates:
- STOIC (but has an O and I, which are vowels, but O and I might be useful)
- SHUNT (but has H, U, N - but U is vowel)
- SLUMP (but has L, U, M, P - and includes S and T? Wait no, this doesn't have T)

Better approach: Find a word that contains S and T, with them in different positions from before, and uses other common letters not yet tested.

Looking at common 5-letter patterns with S and T, and avoiding A/R/E:
Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but this repeats S and T in same positions which is bad since we know they're wrong there.

Alternative: ""SHIST"" - no, that's 6 letters.

Better: ""STINK"" - has S and T, with S in position 2 (new) and T in position 3 (new). Uses I, N, K which are untested. This seems good.

Another option: ""STONY"" - S in 1 (bad), T in 2 (bad) - no, positions are same.

""STICKS"" - too long.

""STUMP"" - S in 1 (bad), T in 3 (ok), U, M, P - but S is in wrong position 1.

What we now know:

1. Both S and T are definitely in the word (they were marked “-” twice) but  
   - S is NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
   - T is NOT in positions 2 or 3.

2. The letters A, R, E, I, N, K are definitely NOT in the word.

3. Remaining letters we haven’t tried at all yet include:  
   B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a 5-letter word that  
   - contains both S and T once each,  
   - places S in positions 3, 4, or 5,  
   - places T in positions 1, 4, or 5,  
   - uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible placements for S and T:
- S in 3rd position → T can be 1st, 4th, or 5th.  
- S in 4th position → T can be 1st or 5th (it cannot share 4th).  
- S in 5th position → T can be 1st or 4th.

Looking for common words that fit:

- T in 1st, S in 3rd: T _ S _ _ ⇒ “TUSKS” fails (K already excluded), “TOAST” has A, “TRUST” has R, “TWIST” has I.  
- T in 1st, S in 4th: T _ _ S _ ⇒ “TOOLS” has O twice, “TOLLS” has L twice, “TOPOS” has O twice.  
- T in 1st, S in 5th: T _ _ _ S ⇒ “TOPHS” too obscure, “TOMBS” has B.  
- S in 4th, T in 1st: same as above.  
- S in 5th, T in 4th: _ _ _ T S → uncommon.  

A cleaner pattern is T _ S _ _ or _ T _ S _.

Scanning for real words that satisfy:

- “TOAST” – invalid (A).  
- “TRUST” – invalid (R,U).  
- “THOSE” – invalid (E).  
- “TOLLS” – has L twice, but L still allowed.  

Found candidate: “TOLLS”  
- T in 1st (allowed), O (new), L (new), L (new), S in 5th (allowed).  
- No banned letters.  

Another candidate: “TOMBS”  
- T in 1st, O, M, B, S in 5th – all letters new and allowed.

Between “TOLLS” and “TOMBS”, “TOMBS” gives three fresh consonants (O, M, B) where “TOLLS” repeats L. So I’ll choose “TOMBS”.

Check positions:  
- S is in 5th (never tried there).  
- T is in 1st (never tried there).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,gusty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, my strategy should be to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters in English. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are often vowels (especially E, A) and consonants like R, T, N, S, L.

A good starting word should cover these common letters efficiently. Some popular choices among Wordle players include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it includes three of the five most common letters (E, A, R) plus two other common consonants (S, T), giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from STARE is:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. The secret word contains both S and T, but neither is in its current position (1st and 2nd letters respectively).
2. The secret word does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. The remaining letters to consider must come from the pool of unused letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), while including S and T in new positions.

Possible positions for S and T:
- S cannot be in position 1 (currently there)
- T cannot be in position 2 (currently there)
They could be anywhere else (positions 2-5 for S, positions 1,3-5 for T).

Next guess should:
- Include both S and T in new positions
- Exclude A, R, E
- Use other common letters to maximize info

Good candidates:
- STOIC (but has an O and I, which are vowels, but O and I might be useful)
- SHUNT (but has H, U, N - but U is vowel)
- SLUMP (but has L, U, M, P - and includes S and T? Wait no, this doesn't have T)

Better approach: Find a word that contains S and T, with them in different positions from before, and uses other common letters not yet tested.

Looking at common 5-letter patterns with S and T, and avoiding A/R/E:
Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but this repeats S and T in same positions which is bad since we know they're wrong there.

Alternative: ""SHIST"" - no, that's 6 letters.

Better: ""STINK"" - has S and T, with S in position 2 (new) and T in position 3 (new). Uses I, N, K which are untested. This seems good.

Another option: ""STONY"" - S in 1 (bad), T in 2 (bad) - no, positions are same.

""STICKS"" - too long.

""STUMP"" - S in 1 (bad), T in 3 (ok), U, M, P - but S is in wrong position 1.

""STINK"" seems best - S in 2, T in 3, with I, N, K as new test letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

1. Both S and T are definitely in the word (they were marked “-” twice) but  
   - S is NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
   - T is NOT in positions 2 or 3.

2. The letters A, R, E, I, N, K are definitely NOT in the word.

3. Remaining letters we haven’t tried at all yet include:  
   B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a 5-letter word that  
   - contains both S and T once each,  
   - places S in positions 3, 4, or 5,  
   - places T in positions 1, 4, or 5,  
   - uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible placements for S and T:
- S in 3rd position → T can be 1st, 4th, or 5th.  
- S in 4th position → T can be 1st or 5th (it cannot share 4th).  
- S in 5th position → T can be 1st or 4th.

Looking for common words that fit:

- T in 1st, S in 3rd: T _ S _ _ ⇒ “TUSKS” fails (K already excluded), “TOAST” has A, “TRUST” has R, “TWIST” has I.  
- T in 1st, S in 4th: T _ _ S _ ⇒ “TOOLS” has O twice, “TOLLS” has L twice, “TOPOS” has O twice.  
- T in 1st, S in 5th: T _ _ _ S ⇒ “TOPHS” too obscure, “TOMBS” has B.  
- S in 4th, T in 1st: same as above.  
- S in 5th, T in 4th: _ _ _ T S → uncommon.  

A cleaner pattern is T _ S _ _ or _ T _ S _.

Scanning for real words that satisfy:

- “TOAST” – invalid (A).  
- “TRUST” – invalid (R,U).  
- “THOSE” – invalid (E).  
- “TOLLS” – has L twice, but L still allowed.  

Found candidate: “TOLLS”  
- T in 1st (allowed), O (new), L (new), L (new), S in 5th (allowed).  
- No banned letters.  

Another candidate: “TOMBS”  
- T in 1st, O, M, B, S in 5th – all letters new and allowed.

Between “TOLLS” and “TOMBS”, “TOMBS” gives three fresh consonants (O, M, B) where “TOLLS” repeats L. So I’ll choose “TOMBS”.

Check positions:  
- S is in 5th (never tried there).  
- T is in 1st (never tried there).  

Satisfies all constraints.

What we now know after three guesses:

1. The word must contain both S and T exactly once each (they have always been marked “-” not “✓”).
2. Current positional eliminations:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   - T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, E, I, N, K, O, M, B.

4. Remaining unused English letters that could appear (besides the already-known S & T):
   C, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that
   - includes S and T,
   - places S only in positions 3 or 4 (because 1,2,5 are forbidden),
   - places T only in positions 4 or 5 (because 1,2,3 are forbidden),
   - uses only the still-allowed letters.

That leaves two mutually exclusive possibilities for S and T positions:
   Case 1: S in 3rd, T in 4th   →  _ _ S T _
   Case 2: S in 4th, T in 5th   →  _ _ _ S T

Let’s list common English words that fit either pattern, using only the allowed letters.

Case 1 pattern: _ _ S T _
   - Must have three fresh consonants/vowels in spots 1,2,5.
   - Possible candidate: “DUSTY” (but Y is allowed, U is allowed, D & S & T are allowed).  However, S is in 3rd, T in 4th – fits exactly.  No forbidden letters.  (I’ll check: D, U, S, T, Y – all still allowed.)

Case 2 pattern: _ _ _ S T
   - Needs three fresh letters in spots 1,2,3.
   - Possible candidate: “GHOST” – but O is banned.
   - “WURST” – U, R, S, T – R is banned.
   - “WELST” – E, L – E banned.
   - “FUSTY” – F, U, S, T, Y – all letters allowed.

Both “DUSTY” (case 1) and “FUSTY” (case 1) are valid.  Between them, “DUSTY” gives a new letter D first, followed by U then Y; it’s a common English word and gives us three fresh letters to test.

Therefore, I’ll guess DUSTY.

Between “TOLLS” and “TOMBS”, “TOMBS” gives three fresh consonants (O, M, B) where “TOLLS” repeats L. So I’ll choose “TOMBS”.

Check positions:  
- S is in 5th (never tried there).  
- T is in 1st (never tried there).  

Satisfies all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know after three guesses:

1. The word must contain both S and T exactly once each (they have always been marked “-” not “✓”).
2. Current positional eliminations:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   - T cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, E, I, N, K, O, M, B.

4. Remaining unused English letters that could appear (besides the already-known S & T):
   C, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that
   - includes S and T,
   - places S only in positions 3 or 4 (because 1,2,5 are forbidden),
   - places T only in positions 4 or 5 (because 1,2,3 are forbidden),
   - uses only the still-allowed letters.

That leaves two mutually exclusive possibilities for S and T positions:
   Case 1: S in 3rd, T in 4th   →  _ _ S T _
   Case 2: S in 4th, T in 5th   →  _ _ _ S T

Let’s list common English words that fit either pattern, using only the allowed letters.

Case 1 pattern: _ _ S T _
   - Must have three fresh consonants/vowels in spots 1,2,5.
   - Possible candidate: “DUSTY” (but Y is allowed, U is allowed, D & S & T are allowed).  However, S is in 3rd, T in 4th – fits exactly.  No forbidden letters.  (I’ll check: D, U, S, T, Y – all still allowed.)

Case 2 pattern: _ _ _ S T
   - Needs three fresh letters in spots 1,2,3.
   - Possible candidate: “GHOST” – but O is banned.
   - “WURST” – U, R, S, T – R is banned.
   - “WELST” – E, L – E banned.
   - “FUSTY” – F, U, S, T, Y – all letters allowed.

Both “DUSTY” (case 1) and “FUSTY” (case 1) are valid.  Between them, “DUSTY” gives a new letter D first, followed by U then Y; it’s a common English word and gives us three fresh letters to test.

Therefore, I’ll guess DUSTY.

That fits perfectly.
