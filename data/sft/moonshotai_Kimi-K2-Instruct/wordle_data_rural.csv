For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, I, S, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters, so I can get feedback on multiple letters at once.

One such word is ""AROSE"", which contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This should provide good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the first feedback (AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)) we know:

1. A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R (but A not in position 1, R not in position 2)

A good second guess should use as many untested common letters as possible while still keeping A and R somewhere. One such word is TRAIN:

   - T and I and N are NOT in the word.
   - R is still present but NOT in position 2 or 4.
   - A is still present but NOT in position 1 or 3.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Next step is to pick a word that uses A and R in allowed spots and also tests new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good untested consonants include D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, etc.

Let’s choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
- Avoids all disallowed letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).
- Tests as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate is “DRAUL”:
- D and U and L are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 5 (new letter).

However, “DRAUL” is not a common English word. Instead, let’s use “DRAUL” but check a valid dictionary word like “DRAUB” or “DURAL”. Better yet, a common word like “DURAL” (a real word meaning related to the dura mater).

Wait, let’s think of a more common word: “CRADLE” is 6 letters. Need 5 letters. “DRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRAMP” has M and P (both new). But P and M are new letters.

Actually, better: “CRAMP” has C, R, A, M, P. But M and P are new letters. Let’s check positions:
- C (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So “CRAMP” is invalid.

Next thought: “GRAFT” has F and G (new) but T is invalid. “GRAFT” invalid due to T.

“FRAIL” has I (invalid). “FRANK” has N (invalid). “GRAVY” has V and Y (new) and G. Let’s check “GRAVY”:
- G (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

“BRAVO” has O (invalid). “BRAND” has N (invalid). “CRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRUMB” has U, M, B (new) but C, R, U, M, B. R in position 2 – invalid.

“FRUMP” has U, M, P (new) but F (new) and P (new). “FRUMP” has R in position 2 – invalid.

Need A and R in allowed spots. Let’s list possible positions:

A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick A in 4 and R in 3: word like “_ _ R A _”. Need two more letters not in {O, S, E, T, I, N}.

Possible letters left: D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, M, P, etc.

However, “DRAUL” is not a common English word. Instead, let’s use “DRAUL” but check a valid dictionary word like “DRAUB” or “DURAL”. Better yet, a common word like “DURAL” (a real word meaning related to the dura mater).

Wait, let’s think of a more common word: “CRADLE” is 6 letters. Need 5 letters. “DRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRAMP” has M and P (both new). But P and M are new letters.

Actually, better: “CRAMP” has C, R, A, M, P. But M and P are new letters. Let’s check positions:
- C (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So “CRAMP” is invalid.

Next thought: “GRAFT” has F and G (new) but T is invalid. “GRAFT” invalid due to T.

“FRAIL” has I (invalid). “FRANK” has N (invalid). “GRAVY” has V and Y (new) and G. Let’s check “GRAVY”:
- G (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

“BRAVO” has O (invalid). “BRAND” has N (invalid). “CRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRUMB” has U, M, B (new) but C, R, U, M, B. R in position 2 – invalid.

“FRUMP” has U, M, P (new) but F (new) and P (new). “FRUMP” has R in position 2 – invalid.

Need A and R in allowed spots. Let’s list possible positions:

A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick A in 4 and R in 3: word like “_ _ R A _”. Need two more letters not in {O, S, E, T, I, N}.

Possible letters left: D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, M, P, etc.

A good word: “DURAL”
- D, U, L (new letters)
- R (position 3, allowed)
- A (position 4, allowed)
- L (position 5, allowed)

“DURAL” is valid.

   - A is still present but NOT in position 1 or 3.

So we know:

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Next step is to pick a word that uses A and R in allowed spots and also tests new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good untested consonants include D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, etc.

Let’s choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
- Avoids all disallowed letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).
- Tests as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate is “DRAUL”:
- D and U and L are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 5 (new letter).

However, “DRAUL” is not a common English word. Instead, let’s use “DRAUL” but check a valid dictionary word like “DRAUB” or “DURAL”. Better yet, a common word like “DURAL” (a real word meaning related to the dura mater).

- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So “CRAMP” is invalid.

Next thought: “GRAFT” has F and G (new) but T is invalid. “GRAFT” invalid due to T.

“FRAIL” has I (invalid). “FRANK” has N (invalid). “GRAVY” has V and Y (new) and G. Let’s check “GRAVY”:

“BRAVO” has O (invalid). “BRAND” has N (invalid). “CRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRUMB” has U, M, B (new) but C, R, U, M, B. R in position 2 – invalid.

“FRUMP” has U, M, P (new) but F (new) and P (new). “FRUMP” has R in position 2 – invalid.

A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick A in 4 and R in 3: word like “_ _ R A _”. Need two more letters not in {O, S, E, T, I, N}.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,rural,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, I, S, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters, so I can get feedback on multiple letters at once.

One such word is ""AROSE"", which contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This should provide good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback (AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)) we know:

1. A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we are looking for a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R (but A not in position 1, R not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E

Next, I should test other common letters like T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.  
A good second guess should use as many untested common letters as possible while still keeping A and R somewhere. One such word is TRAIN:

- It uses T, I, N (three new common consonants)  
- It places A in position 3 (allowed, since A is known to be in the word but not in position 1)  
- It places R in position 4 (allowed, since R is known to be in the word but not in position 2)

This gives feedback on T, R, A, I, N.

<guess>TRAIN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1-2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are NOT present.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T and I and N are NOT in the word.
   - R is still present but NOT in position 2 or 4.
   - A is still present but NOT in position 1 or 3.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Next step is to pick a word that uses A and R in allowed spots and also tests new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good untested consonants include D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, etc.

Let’s choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains both A and R in allowed positions.
- Avoids all disallowed letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).
- Tests as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate is “DRAUL”:
- D and U and L are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 5 (new letter).

However, “DRAUL” is not a common English word. Instead, let’s use “DRAUL” but check a valid dictionary word like “DRAUB” or “DURAL”. Better yet, a common word like “DURAL” (a real word meaning related to the dura mater).

Wait, let’s think of a more common word: “CRADLE” is 6 letters. Need 5 letters. “DRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRAMP” has M and P (both new). But P and M are new letters.

Actually, better: “CRAMP” has C, R, A, M, P. But M and P are new letters. Let’s check positions:
- C (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE feedback). So “CRAMP” is invalid.

Next thought: “GRAFT” has F and G (new) but T is invalid. “GRAFT” invalid due to T.

“FRAIL” has I (invalid). “FRANK” has N (invalid). “GRAVY” has V and Y (new) and G. Let’s check “GRAVY”:
- G (new)
- R (position 2) – but R cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

“BRAVO” has O (invalid). “BRAND” has N (invalid). “CRAFT” has T (invalid). “CRUMB” has U, M, B (new) but C, R, U, M, B. R in position 2 – invalid.

“FRUMP” has U, M, P (new) but F (new) and P (new). “FRUMP” has R in position 2 – invalid.

Need A and R in allowed spots. Let’s list possible positions:

A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
R can be in 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick A in 4 and R in 3: word like “_ _ R A _”. Need two more letters not in {O, S, E, T, I, N}.

Possible letters left: D, L, C, U, B, G, F, Y, M, P, etc.

A good word: “DURAL”
- D, U, L (new letters)
- R (position 3, allowed)
- A (position 4, allowed)
- L (position 5, allowed)

“DURAL” is valid.

<guess>DURAL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: DURAL -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) R(✓) A(✓) L(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the newest feedback (DURAL → D(x) U(✓) R(✓) A(✓) L(✓)) we now know:

- U is in position 2.
- R is in position 3.
- A is in position 4.
- L is in position 5.
- D is NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ U R A L

Letters definitely in the word: U, R, A, L (and we already knew R and A were present from earlier clues).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D.

We need to find the first letter. It must be a consonant (since the pattern is _ U R A L) and cannot be any of the disallowed letters above. Possible consonants left include: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in URAL:

- BURIAL (but this has I which is disallowed)
- CURAL (not a valid word)
- FURAN (but ends in N which is invalid)
- FURCA (not a word)
- MURAL (valid word meaning wall painting)

""MURAL"" fits perfectly:
- M is a new letter we haven't tested
- Pattern: M U R A L

Let's check constraints:
- Contains U, R, A, L (all required)
- Doesn't use any disallowed letters (O, S, E, T, I, N, D)
- M is a new letter to test

This seems like the most logical next guess.
