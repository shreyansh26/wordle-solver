For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best starting words in Wordle typically have common vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words with good letter distribution, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains all the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). However, since I need to provide a guess without any prior information, I'll go with another strong starting word that has good letter coverage.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which gives us several common consonants and a very common vowel. This should help me identify which letters are present in the word and where they might be positioned.

Feedback recap:
S – not in word  
L – not in word  
A – correct position (position 3)  
T – not in word  
E – not in word  

So we know:
- The word has an A in the third position.
- The letters S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.
- Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out) include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need 4 more letters with no repeats. I’ll pick a mix of common consonants and vowels, avoiding the excluded letters and placing A in position 3.

A good candidate is “CRANK” – it uses common consonants C, R, N, K and keeps the known A in the center.

N must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5).

Summary from all feedback:

- Position 1: D ✓
- Position 2: R ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: I x (I is not in the word)
- Position 5: N ✓

So the secret word is: D R A _ N

The only remaining position to fill is position 4. Letters already used (and confirmed) are D, R, A, N, so we cannot repeat any of these.

Letters ruled out so far (from all guesses): S, L, T, E, C, K, I.

Common, unused, allowed consonants for position 4: B, F, G, H, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The most common English letters among these are B, F, G, H, M.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching the pattern DRA_N:

- DRABN? Not a word.
- DRAFN? Not a word.
- DRAGN? No.
- DRAHN? No.
- DRAMN? No.
- DRAPN? No.
- DRAVN? No.
- DRAWN? Yes, ""DRAWN"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Checking letters:

- D (used, ok)
- R (used, ok)
- A (used, ok)
- W (not yet used, allowed)
- N (used, ok)

""DRAWN"" fits perfectly.
