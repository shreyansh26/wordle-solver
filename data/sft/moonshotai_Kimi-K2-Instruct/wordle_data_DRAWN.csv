For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with five distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" comes to mind as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help identify which of these 5 popular letters (if any) are in the secret word.

From the feedback, we know:

- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _.
We also know it contains A somewhere but not in position 1.

Let's pick a word that uses R in position 2, includes A in another position, and avoids O, S, E. Common remaining letters to try: T, I, N, L, C, H, D, etc.

A good candidate is TRAIN:
- R is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (could be correct or just present).
- T, I, N are new letters to test.

- A is correctly in position 3.

So far the word looks like: _ R A N _
The letters T, I, S, O, E are eliminated, and A is already used in position 3, so A can’t appear again elsewhere.

Remaining common consonants and vowels to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Current deductions:

1. Pattern so far: _ R A _ _  
   (R is fixed in position 2, A is fixed in position 3)

2. Letters we now know:
   - G is NOT in the word (from GRAND feedback).
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from GRAND feedback).
     Since position 5 is the only other open spot, N must be at position 5.
   
   Therefore the word ends with N: _ R A _ N

3. Eliminated letters: O, S, E, T, I, G  
   Still usable: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, plus A and R already placed.

4. We need a single letter for position 1 and position 4, both from the usable set.

5. Possible English words fitting _ R A _ N:
   - BRAIN  → but I is eliminated.
   - CRA_N  → CRAGN (invalid), CRA_N only CRANK is valid.
   - DRAWN  → D is still usable, W is usable.
   - FRANC  → ends with C, not N.
   - PRANK  → K is usable; P and K are still allowed.
   - TRAWN  → T is eliminated.

6. Candidate words:
   - CRANK  (C, R, A, N, K)
   - DRAWN  (D, R, A, W, N)
   - PRANK  (P, R, A, N, K)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good strategy is to pick a word with five distinct common letters to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" comes to mind as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help identify which of these 5 popular letters (if any) are in the secret word.

- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _.
We also know it contains A somewhere but not in position 1.

Let's pick a word that uses R in position 2, includes A in another position, and avoids O, S, E. Common remaining letters to try: T, I, N, L, C, H, D, etc.

A good candidate is TRAIN:
- R is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (could be correct or just present).
- T, I, N are new letters to test.

This gives us new letters (T, I, N) while respecting the constraints.

So far the word looks like: _ R A N _
The letters T, I, S, O, E are eliminated, and A is already used in position 3, so A can’t appear again elsewhere.

Remaining common consonants and vowels to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need to pick a 5-letter English word that fits the pattern _ R A N _ with the remaining letters. Candidate endings for the last position (5) and the first position (1) are:

Letters already ruled out:

Remaining unused letters that can appear in positions 1 & 4 (from the still-allowed set):

We need a legitimate 5-letter English word of the form ? R A ? N where the two ?’s are chosen only from the still-allowed letters.
