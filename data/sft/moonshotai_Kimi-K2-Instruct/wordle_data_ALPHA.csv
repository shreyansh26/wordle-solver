This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal strategy for the first Wordle guess is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Classic strong starting words include options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" - these use very common letters and cover vowels that appear in many English words.

Among these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A: Most common vowel
- R: Very common consonant
- O: Common vowel
- S: Most common consonant in English
- E: Most common letter overall

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

The feedback from AROSE shows:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

This tells us:
1. The word starts with A
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
3. Since we have 4 letters eliminated, we need to focus on other common letters not yet used

Good next letters to try would be common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. and the remaining vowels I and U.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _

Let's think of 5-letter words starting with A that don't use R, O, S, or E. Some options:
- AIDED
- ALIGN
- ALIKE
- ANGEL (but has E)
- ANGRY (but has R)
- APPLY
- AHEAD

The word ""AHEAD"" seems like a good choice because:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct)
- Uses H (common letter not yet tried)
- Uses E, but we know E is eliminated - let me reconsider...

Actually, since E is eliminated, let's try ""ALARM"" - but R is eliminated...

Better options without R,O,S,E:
- APHID
- AGING
- ADMIT
- ADULT

I'll go with ""ADULT"" as it uses common letters D, U, L, T and fits all constraints.

So L must appear in slot 2, 3, or 4, and the remaining three slots must be filled only from the still-allowed letters C, G, H, M, P, Y (and must include L).

Looking for common patterns:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The optimal strategy for the first Wordle guess is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Classic strong starting words include options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" - these use very common letters and cover vowels that appear in many English words.

Among these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A: Most common vowel
- R: Very common consonant
- O: Common vowel
- S: Most common consonant in English
- E: Most common letter overall

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE shows:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

This tells us:
1. The word starts with A
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E
3. Since we have 4 letters eliminated, we need to focus on other common letters not yet used

Good next letters to try would be common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. and the remaining vowels I and U.

Possible structure: A _ _ _ _

Let's think of 5-letter words starting with A that don't use R, O, S, or E. Some options:
- AIDED
- ALIGN
- ALIKE
- ANGEL (but has E)
- ANGRY (but has R)
- APPLY
- AHEAD

The word ""AHEAD"" seems like a good choice because:
- Starts with A (confirmed correct)
- Uses H (common letter not yet tried)
- Uses E, but we know E is eliminated - let me reconsider...

Actually, since E is eliminated, let's try ""ALARM"" - but R is eliminated...

Better options without R,O,S,E:
- APHID
- AGING
- ADMIT
- ADULT

I'll go with ""ADULT"" as it uses common letters D, U, L, T and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback showing A is correct in position 1 and R, O, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word starting with A that uses different letters.

So the pattern is A _ _ _ _ and the word must contain L somewhere after the first letter.  
Remaining common, unused consonants: C, G, H, M, N, P, Y  
Remaining vowel: I

Good possibilities (starting with A, containing L, avoiding R O S E D U T):
- A L _ _ _  ⇒ but L is not in position 2, so skip
- A _ L _ _
- A _ _ L _
- A _ _ _ L
