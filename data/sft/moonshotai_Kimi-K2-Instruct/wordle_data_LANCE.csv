For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE.""

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- T is NOT in the word (x).  
- E is in the word AND correctly in position 5 (✓).

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. Must include L and A somewhere other than positions 2 and 3 respectively.
3. Cannot contain S or T.

Good letters to keep using: L, A, E  
Good positions to test: L not in 2, A not in 3, E locked in 5.

Next guess should introduce new common consonants and place L & A in different spots. “CRANE” is popular but uses T (already ruled out). “PLANE” uses P (not yet used), keeps L and A, and moves them to 1 & 3 respectively. This satisfies all constraints.

Alternative check: PLANE  
P – new letter  
L – in word but not in 2 (now in 1) ✓  
A – in word but not in 3 (now in 3) ✗, but feedback said A not in 3, so this is ruled out.  
Need A not in 3.

Instead, try “LEMON”:  
L – now in 1  
E – fixed in 5, so if we place E in 5, E in 1 conflicts.  
Therefore word must be _ _ _ _ E with L and A placed somewhere.

Try “FLAME”:  
F – new letter  
L – in 1 (allowed)  
A – in 3 (not allowed, feedback had A not in 3)

Current known facts:

2. A is in the word and in the correct position 2 (from BALER: A(✓) in 2).
3. L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SLATE: L(-) not in 2, and from BALER: L(-) not in 3 – so L must be in 1 or 4).
4. Cannot contain S, T, B, or R (all marked x so far).
5. Must include A (position 2) and L somewhere else (positions 1 or 4).

Possible structure so far:
_ A _ _ E, with L in 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ E (L in 1)
- _ A _ L E (L in 4)

We need to test new letters in positions 3 and (if L is in 1) 4, or (if L is in 4) 1.

Good remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2 and E in 5,
- Places L in 1 or 4,
- Introduces new common letters.

Option 1: L A C E _
But position 5 must be E, so L A _ _ E. Try L A N C E – but C is in 3 and N in 4. This fits: L(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). L is in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (✓), E in 5 (✓), and introduces C and N.
