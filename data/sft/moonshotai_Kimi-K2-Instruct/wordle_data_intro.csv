For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular choices are words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common vowels: E, A, O, I
- Most common consonants: R, T, N, S, L, C, D, P, M

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains the five most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage. This will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) - A is not in the word.

- O(-) - O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) - S is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, S, or E.
2. The word DOES contain R and O, but they are in different positions than in AROSE.
3. R cannot be in position 2.
4. O cannot be in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:

- Doesn't have R in position 2 or O in position 3
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are partially known)

I'll try ""TRIOL"":
- T, R, I, O, L
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2, so this would violate the constraint)
Oops, that would be invalid.

Let me try ""FRONT"":
- F, R, O, N, T
- R is in position 2 - again invalid.

Let me try ""FORGE"":
- F, O, R, G, E
- E is eliminated, so can't use this.
