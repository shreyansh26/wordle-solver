For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in 5-letter words are vowels (especially E, A, O, I) and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. 

A good strategy is to choose a word that contains multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(–) → A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.  
- S(–) → S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E  
- Letters in the word somewhere: A, S  
- A is not first; S is not fourth.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and S (so they stay in play).  
2. Avoid R, O, E, and the known-bad positions for A and S.  
3. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down further.

Let’s try a word that uses A and S in new positions and introduces T, I, L, or N.  
""SAINT"" fits: it contains S and A, places them in new spots, and brings in common consonants T and N plus the vowel I.

Check positions:
- S will be in position 1 (allowed, since we only know S isn’t in position 4).  
- A will be in position 2 (allowed, since we only know A isn’t in position 1).  
- I, N, T are new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in 5-letter words are vowels (especially E, A, O, I) and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. 

A good strategy is to choose a word that contains multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(–) → A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.  
- S(–) → S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E  
- Letters in the word somewhere: A, S  
- A is not first; S is not fourth.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and S (so they stay in play).  
2. Avoid R, O, E, and the known-bad positions for A and S.  
3. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down further.

Let’s try a word that uses A and S in new positions and introduces T, I, L, or N.  
""SAINT"" fits: it contains S and A, places them in new spots, and brings in common consonants T and N plus the vowel I.

Check positions:
- S will be in position 1 (allowed, since we only know S isn’t in position 4).  
- A will be in position 2 (allowed, since we only know A isn’t in position 1).  
- I, N, T are new letters.

This should give good information.
