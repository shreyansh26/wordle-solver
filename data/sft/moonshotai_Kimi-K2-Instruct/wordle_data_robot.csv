For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. Good starter words often include multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Looking at some popular starting words:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E (but A might be less common in 5th position)
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ARISE: covers A, R, I, S, E
- ADIEU: covers all vowels but lacks consonants

I think ""ARISE"" is a strong first choice because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which will help determine vowel presence
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words
3. The letters are all very common in English words

This should give good information about which letters are present while being a valid English word.

- Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S, E, F, N
- Letters definitely in the word: R (wrong spot) and T (correct spot at position 5).
- Letters in the word but wrong spot: O (somewhere, but not position 3)

So:
1. Word ends with T (position 5).
2. Contains R (but not position 2).
3. Contains O (but not position 3).
4. No A, I, S, E, F, N.

Possible vowels left: O, U (and Y sometimes). Since O is already confirmed, let’s consider O and U.

Structure so far:
_ _ _ _ T
with R somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4 and O somewhere among positions 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try R in position 1 and O in position 2 to test placements:
- R O _ _ T

Valid letters left (excluding known misses): B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters. Good candidates are common consonants like C, L, M, P, D, B, G, H.

Let’s try R O U _ T (using U as the other vowel):
But we need a 5-letter word. ""ROU_T"" – possible words: ROUTT is invalid, ROUT is 4 letters. ""ROU_T"" needs another letter.

Wait, 5-letter word ending in T with R somewhere and O somewhere.

Let me list possible words meeting the criteria:
- Words ending in T, with R and O, no A, I, S, E, F, N.

Possible candidates:
- COURT: but has U, O, R, T. Check letters: C, O, U, R, T. None in the miss list. R is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), T in 5 (correct). No forbidden letters.
- DROPT: but P is allowed, but D,R,O,P,T. O is in 3 (forbidden from FRONT feedback), so no.
- GROUT: G, R, O, U, T. O is in 3 (forbidden), so no.
- BROTH: H is allowed, but ends with H, not T.
- PORTY: ends with Y, not T.
- BORTY: same issue.

COURT seems valid:
- C (new letter), O (in position 2, allowed), U (new), R (in position 4, allowed), T (correct spot).
- No forbidden letters.
  
Let me check:
C O U R T
- C: new
- O: in word (from FRONT), not in position 3 (here 2) – allowed.
- U: new vowel.
- R: in word (from ARISE), position 4 (not 2) – allowed.
- T: correct position 5.
All constraints satisfied.

Current information:

Letters definitely in the word and their status:
- O: correct position (position 2)
- T: correct position (position 5)

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
- R (not position 2, 3, 4, or 1 based on previous guesses)

Wait, let me re-express this:

From COURT feedback:
C(x) - C not in word
O(✓) - O is correct at position 2
U(x) - U not in word
R(-) - R is in word but wrong position (currently position 4)
T(✓) - T is correct at position 5

Also from previous feedback:
From ARISE: R is in word but not position 2
From FRONT: R is in word but not position 2, O is in word but not position 3
From COURT: R is in word but not position 4

So R must be in position 1 or 3, but:
- Position 1: possible
- Position 3: possible, but from FRONT feedback O is not in position 3 (which is irrelevant here)

Wait, let me re-express the word structure:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: O (from COURT feedback)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: T (from COURT feedback)

Letters known to be in word:
- O (position 2)
- R (somewhere, not position 2, 4)
- T (position 5)

Letters known NOT in word:
A, I, S, E, F, N, C, U

So possible letters left:
Consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: already have O, and A, I, E, U are out, so only Y possible as vowel-sound

R must be in position 1 or 3.

Let's consider possibilities:

If R is in position 1:
R O _ _ T

We need two more letters from remaining pool (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z), with no repeats.

Possible common words:
- R O B _ T → ROBOT - but O is already at position 2, and this would have O at 2 and 3 which seems valid
- R O D _ T → RODET - not a word
- R O P _ T → ROPET - not a word
- R O L _ T → ROLE T - not a word
- R O G _ T → ROGUE - but ends with E which is not allowed
- R O B O T → ROBOT - let's check this

ROBOT:
R O B O T
- R at 1: allowed (R must be somewhere, and position 1 is open)
- O at 2: matches required O at 2
- B: new letter, not in forbidden list
- O at 4: but O is already confirmed at position 2, and no restrictions prevent O appearing again
- T at 5: matches required T at 5

This seems valid.

If R is in position 3:
_ O R _ T

Possible words:
- H O R S T - but S is forbidden
- M O R T _ - but needs 5 letters
- B O R _ T - BORAT - but A is forbidden
- P O R _ T - PORT_ - PORTS - S forbidden
- D O R _ T - DORT_ - not common
- G O R _ T - GORT_ - not common

ROBOT seems the most plausible word fitting all constraints.

Based on the latest feedback:
- O is correctly placed at position 2
- T is correctly placed at position 5
- R is in the word but not at positions 2 or 4 (from previous guesses)
- Eliminated letters: A, I, S, E, F, N, C, U

The only remaining position for R is 1 or 3. Testing common 5-letter words:
- ROBOT fits perfectly: R(1) O(2) B(3) O(4) T(5)
- No eliminated letters are used
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- O appears twice (position 2 is confirmed, position 4 is acceptable)
