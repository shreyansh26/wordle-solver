For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the target word, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

The only confirmed letter so far is A, and it cannot be in the 3rd position.

Therefore, in my next guess I should:
1. Keep the letter A but move it to a different spot.
2. Use entirely new letters for the other four positions, avoiding C, R, N, E.
3. Choose common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., S, T, L, D, O, U, I, M, P, etc.).

A balanced word that satisfies these criteria and uses frequently occurring letters is:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,salsa,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the target word, helping narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

The only confirmed letter so far is A, and it cannot be in the 3rd position.

Therefore, in my next guess I should:
1. Keep the letter A but move it to a different spot.
2. Use entirely new letters for the other four positions, avoiding C, R, N, E.
3. Choose common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., S, T, L, D, O, U, I, M, P, etc.).

A balanced word that satisfies these criteria and uses frequently occurring letters is:
- SALTY (S, A, L, T, Y) – contains A in the 2nd position instead of 3rd, and introduces S, L, T, Y.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- L is confirmed somewhere in the last three positions (-) – it must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Letters to avoid so far: C, R, N, E, T, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S A
2. Has an L in position 3, 4, or 5
3. Uses only new letters (besides S, A, L) that have not yet been ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Z
Common remaining vowels: I, O, U

Some candidate words:
- SALON (L is in position 3, but N has already been ruled out)
- SALVO (L is in position 3, V and O are new letters)
- SALAD (repeats A, and D is new)
- SALMI (M and I are new, L is in position 3)

""SALVO"" looks good: it keeps S, A, L, uses new letters V and O, and places L in position 3 (which we haven’t checked yet).

Still-unused letters that can appear in positions 4-5:

We need a legitimate 5-letter word that starts with S A L and ends with two of these letters.

Visibly valid words:

- SALIX – X not yet used, but I is banned  
- SALKS – double S? not valid  
- SALPS – S again, invalid

SALAD is invalid (D is fine but A repeats).
SALEP invalid (E banned).
SALKY – K & Y (Y banned).

Another candidate: SALGA (G & A) – A repeats.
SALDU – not valid.
SALFY – F & Y (Y banned).

Only remaining simple choice is:
SALPA – P & A (A repeats), still not ideal.

Wait—there’s “SALKS” doesn’t exist, but “SALUK” isn’t valid either.

Recheck the lists carefully:
- SALDA – not found
- SALGA – not common

Actually, the only remaining real word that fits is:
SALAD – even though A is duplicated, the duplicate must be allowed in the word (e.g. SALAD has two A’s, but our feedback only said the 2nd position A is correct, not that duplicates are forbidden).

But earlier feedback only banned letters from appearing at all if marked x. The duplicate A itself is fine (it was only marked – in Guess 1, not x).

So SALAD is valid: positions 4-5 use D and another A.

Let’s verify letters used:
S, A, L, A, D
All letters:
- D and the extra A are new in positions 4-5.
- No banned letters appear.

So SALAD satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

- Pattern known: S A L _ _
- Letters in positions 4-5 must not include any of the already-eliminated letters:
  – globally banned: C, R, N, E, T, Y, V, O, M, I, D
  – position 4 specifically cannot be A (it was marked “-” in Guess 5; A is correct only in position 2)
- Thus, the only still-allowed letters for positions 4-5 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, U, W, Z.

We need a valid English 5-letter word that begins S A L and ends with two of those remaining letters.

Candidate endings:
- SB, SF, SG, SH, SJ, SK, SP, SU, SW, SZ
...that actually form a dictionary word.

Real words:
- SALKS – not valid
- SALPA – P & A (A repeats and is ruled out for position 4)
- SALUK – not recognized
- SALSA – repeated SA; S already fixed in position 1
- SALPS – P & S (S already fixed in position 1)

The only remaining common word is:
SALSA – but S repeats (position 1 and 5), which is allowed as long as the extra S is not ruled out.  However, we have no evidence that S is repeated, and we prefer a word with two *new* letters.

Next valid choice:
SALKS – invalid.

Another word found: SALUK (name of an Afghan hound breed) – but not in standard dictionaries.

Another: SALKS – still invalid.

The only remaining legitimate English word meeting all constraints is:
SALSA (even though it repeats S).

Let’s use that, knowing the only repeated letter is S (already confirmed in position 1) and both A and L are in their correct spots.
