- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For a first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants

Some common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- S, L, T are very common consonants
- A, E are the two most common vowels
- It tests 5 unique letters, giving maximum feedback

From the feedback on SLATE:  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the exact 2nd position.  
- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- T(x) → T is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E appears somewhere in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Word is _ L _ _ _  
- Contains the letter E, but not at the end.  
- Does not contain S, A, T.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps L fixed in the 2nd position.
2. Places E in one of the remaining positions (1st, 3rd, or 4th).
3. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (R, I, N, C, H, O, etc.).

Possible candidates:  
- FLARE (F, L, A, R, E) – but A is already ruled out.  
- CLERK (C, L, E, R, K) – E is in 3rd spot, checks new letters.  
- OLDEN (O, L, D, E, N) – E is in 4th spot, good letters.  

I’ll go with CLERK:
- L is locked in 2nd position.

Current confirmed facts after two guesses:
1. Position 2 is L (✓ from both guesses).
2. Position 3 is E (✓ from guess 2).
3. Position 5 is K (✓ from guess 2).
4. Position 1: C(-) – C is in the word but not at position 1.
5. R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
6. From guess 1 we also know letters NOT present: S, A, T.

So the pattern we have so far is: _ L E _ K

Known letters that must appear: C, L, E, K  
Known letters that cannot appear: S, A, T, R  
Remaining plausible consonants: N, D, M, G, B, H, P, F, etc.
Remaining plausible vowels: Only E is already placed; no other vowels are yet locked in, but we have no negative info on U, I, O. However, the word pattern already has E, so we need to fill positions 1 and 4.

For position 1: C appeared in guess 2 at position 1 but was marked (-), meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. Therefore, C must be at position 4.

This gives us: _ L E C K

The only letter left is position 1. We’ve ruled out S, A, T, R. We can test common consonants that haven’t been used yet. The word must start with a consonant (since we’ve not seen a vowel at position 1 and common 5-letter words don’t usually have two vowels next to each other in positions 1-2).

Looking at common words ending in “LECK” or similar:  
- BLECK → no, “BLECK” is not a standard word.  
- FLECK → yes, “FLECK” is a valid word meaning a small patch of color or light.  
- GLECK → not a word.  
- PLECK → not a word.  

“FLECK” fits perfectly:  
- Position 1: F (new letter, not ruled out)  
- Position 2: L (confirmed)  
- Position 3: E (confirmed)  
- Position 4: C (must be here, since it was “-” at position 1 in CLERK)  
- Position 5: K (confirmed)  

No conflicts with previous feedback.
