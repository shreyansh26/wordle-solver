For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants that might be in the target word. A good first guess often includes a mix of common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common consonant, often starts words
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—are marked with “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

So I need to pick a completely fresh set of letters.  
I’ll focus on other high-frequency consonants and vowels:  
- Consonants left worth testing: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, P  
- Vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced word that uses five of these unused letters is “CHORD”:  
C, H, O, R, D.  
None of these were in SLATE, and they give good positional coverage (two vowels, three consonants, different positions).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good first guess often includes a mix of common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common consonant, often starts words
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to quickly narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—are marked with “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

So I need to pick a completely fresh set of letters.  
I’ll focus on other high-frequency consonants and vowels:  
- Consonants left worth testing: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, P  
- Vowels left: I, O, U  

A balanced word that uses five of these unused letters is “CHORD”:  
C, H, O, R, D.  
None of these were in SLATE, and they give good positional coverage (two vowels, three consonants, different positions).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHORD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Key take-aways from the feedback:
1. O is in the correct position (position 3, 1-based indexing).
2. R is in the word but not in position 4.
3. We have eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, D (and R is known to be present but elsewhere).
4. So far, we know: _ _ O _ _ and R is somewhere else in the word.

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: I, N, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Keeps O fixed in position 3.
- Uses R in a different position (to confirm where R can go).
- Introduces several new common consonants and possibly a new vowel.

A good candidate is ""BRING"":
- B: new consonant.
- R: moves to position 2.
- I: new vowel.
- N: new consonant.
- G: new consonant.
- Keeps O fixed in position 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- Word pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters already confirmed in the word: R (position 2), O (position 3), N (position 4), G (position 5).
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, D, B, I.

That leaves: F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any other unused consonants.

The pattern is _ R O N G.

The only letter missing is the first one. Common first letters not yet ruled out include F, P, M, V.

A very common word that matches _ R O N G is “FRONG” — but “FRONG” is not a valid English word. The actual valid word that matches is “FRONG” not valid, but “PRONG” is.

“PRONG” is a valid 5-letter English word: P-R-O-N-G. It uses P, which has not been eliminated.

Therefore, the correct next guess is:

- Positional certainty:  
  – Position 2 = R (✓)  
  – Position 3 = O (✓)  
  – Position 4 = N (✓)  
  – Position 5 = G (✓)

- That fixes the last four letters: **R-O-N-G** in spots 2-5.

- The only unknown is the very first letter (spot 1).

- Eliminated initial letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, D, B, I, P.  

- Remaining common first letters that form real 5-letter words ending in RONG include: F, W.

- The valid dictionary words are **WRONG** and **FRONG**; “FRONG” is not a recognized English word, so **WRONG** is the only possibility left.

Therefore, the next guess must be **WRONG**.
