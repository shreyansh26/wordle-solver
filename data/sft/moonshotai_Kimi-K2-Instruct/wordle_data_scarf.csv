For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Confirmed letters that must appear somewhere: A, R, S  
Confirmed absent letters: O, E  

No letters are in their correct positions yet, so none of A, R, S are in spots 1, 2, 4 respectively.

A good next guess should try to:
- Place A, R, S in new positions they haven’t occupied yet.
- Use other common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A strong candidate is “RAINS”:
- R is in position 1 (was in position 2 before).
- A is in position 2 (was in position 1 before).
- I is a new vowel.
- N is a common consonant not yet tested.
- S is in position 5 (was in position 4 before).

From the two rounds of feedback:

Positions ruled out so far:

- S: cannot be in positions 4 or 5

Thus the remaining open positions for A, R, S are:
- A: 3, 4, 5
- R: 3, 4, 5
- S: 1, 2, 3

We still need two more letters that haven’t been used or eliminated.

Common unused vowel: U (only vowel left that hasn’t been tried)

Let’s try to place the three required letters in allowed slots and add two new ones that are frequent.  
A decent pattern is S _ A _ R, but that would put S in 1, A in 3, R in 5 and leave 2 and 4 open.  
Fill those with common letters T and U → “STARS” – but S is already in the word, we don’t need it twice.  
Try “STRAY”: duplicates none of the known letters, uses S, T, R, A, Y.

Let’s check the positions:

From the three guesses so far:

Known letters that must appear: S, A, R  
Known letters that must NOT appear: O, E, I, N, T, Y  

Fixed positions:
- S is definitely in position 1 (✓).

Forbidden positions for the other two known letters:
- A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4
- R: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (because it was in 2 in guess 1, 1 in guess 2, 3 in guess 3)

Therefore:
- A can only be in position 3 or 5.
- R can only be in position 4.

That gives us:
S _ _ R _

The remaining two letters must be:
- Not yet used or eliminated: from the alphabet, unused & not forbidden consonants/vowels are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.
- We need a vowel; the only vowel left untried is U.

So the word structure is S _ A R _ or S _ U R _ or S _ _ R A.

But A can be in 3 or 5, R must be in 4.
So possible patterns:
1. S _ A R _
2. S _ _ R A  (but then A is in 5, and we need a letter in 3)

Let’s pick pattern S _ A R _:
We need a letter for position 2 that is common and unused. Good candidates: C, L, M, B, D, G.

The simplest word that fits is S C A R _ – but we need a 5th letter, so SCARF, SCARS, SCARY, but Y is eliminated, S is already used, F is possible.

SCARF: S C A R F
- S (position 1) ✓
- C new
- A position 3 (allowed)
- R position 4 ✓
- F new

Letters used: S, C, A, R, F – none forbidden, all fit constraints.

So SCARF seems perfect.
