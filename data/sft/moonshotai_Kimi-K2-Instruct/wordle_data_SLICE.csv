For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and helps me quickly narrow down possibilities. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with several of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - 5 very common letters)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (has A, U, D, I, O - covers many vowels)
- RAISE (has R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose SLATE because it uses 5 of the most common letters, including both common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter)
- L is in the correct position (second letter)
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter)
- A and T are not in the word at all

So the pattern is: S L _ _ E

Now I need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters that are not A or T. The remaining common letters are among: R, I, N, C, O, U, D, etc.

I’ll look for a word that fits the pattern S L _ _ E and uses other common letters to maximize information gain. Possible candidates:
- SLIDE (I, D)
- SLICE (I, C)
- SLIME (I, M)
- SLONE (O, N) – but ""SLONE"" is not a valid word
- SLING (but needs five letters, so SLING doesn’t end with E)

""SLIDE"" seems like a good choice: common letters I and D, and it fits the pattern.

We have the pattern S L I _ E and know the following letters are **not** in position 4:
- From SLATE: A, T (already ruled out because A(x) and T(x))
- From SLIDE: D (because D(x))
- From SLIME: M (because M(x))

So the 4th letter must be something we haven’t tried yet. Common 5-letter English words that fit S L I _ E:

- SLICE (C in 4th position)
- SLIVE (V in 4th position)
- SLIPE (P in 4th position)

Among these, SLICE is the most common and uses C, another high-frequency letter that hasn’t been tested yet.
