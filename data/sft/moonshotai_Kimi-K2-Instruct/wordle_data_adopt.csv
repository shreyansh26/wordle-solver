For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently appearing letters in English and avoid repeating letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular first guess because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, E, which are all among the most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all (all marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).

Since A is somewhere in the word but not in the middle, and all other letters from CRANE are eliminated, I need a word that:
1. Contains A but not in the 3rd position.
2. Contains none of C, R, N, E.

I’ll pick a fresh set of common letters to test. The word ""PLAID"" fits: it has A in position 2 (a different spot), and introduces L, P, I, D, none of which have been tested yet.

Current facts:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, I  
2. Letter A is in the word but NOT at position 3 (from CRANE) and NOT at position 3 (from PLAID).  
   - In PLAID the A is again at position 3, so the feedback is still “-” (wrong position), confirming it is NOT at 3.  
   - Therefore A must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
3. Letters P and D are somewhere in the word but in wrong positions (both marked “-”).  
4. Every new guess must be a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains A (not in position 3)  
   - Contains P and D (positions unknown)  
   - Contains none of the disqualified letters: C, R, N, E, L, I

I need a word that satisfies these constraints. Let’s build it:

- Allowed letters: A, P, D, plus any other letters not on the banned list (so far allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

- To maximize information, pick a word that places P and D in new positions and tests additional common letters.

A quick scan of candidates:
- PADMA – contains M which is allowed, but M hasn’t been tested.
- SPADO – contains S and O, both allowed.
- ADOPT – contains O and T, both allowed, and places D and P in new positions.

Let’s use ADOPT:
- A at position 1 (new spot for A, satisfies “not 3”).
- D at position 2 (new spot for D).
- P at position 4 (new spot for P).
- Adds O and T, both fresh letters.

This seems like the best next probe.
