For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with as many of these as possible, while avoiding repeating letters to test more unique letters. 

Words like ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular opening guesses because they contain common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters without any repeats.

From the first feedback:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Since we’ve eliminated these four common consonants and are left with A, we need a word that includes A and avoids S, L, T, E. To maximize information, we should try a word with new common consonants like R, N, C, D, etc., while placing A in a different position.

A good second guess would be ""RADIO"":
- R is common and hasn’t been tested.
- A is included, now in the 2nd position (different from SLATE’s placement).
- D, I, O are also common letters not yet tested.

Let’s check:
- R: new
- A: in the word, now in 2nd position
- D: new
- I: new
- O: new

This gives us 5 new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
2. RADIO → R(x) A(✓) D(✓) I(x) O(x)  
3. CANDY → C(x) A(✓) N(x) D(-) Y(x)  

Combining the information:

- Second letter is A (confirmed by ✓ in both RADIO and CANDY).  
- Word contains D, but D is NOT in position 4 (from CANDY feedback).  
- Eliminated letters so far (from all guesses): S, L, T, E, R, I, O, C, N, Y.

Allowed letters left (excluding the ones above): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
Also must contain D somewhere, and pattern is: _ A _ _ _.

Good candidates with pattern _ A _ _ _ and including D:

- B A D G E (BADGE) – second letter A, D in 3rd, G and E unused (E is eliminated, so skip).  
- G A D G E (GADGE) – not a valid English word.  
- B A D G E – E eliminated.  
- F A D G E – E eliminated.  
- M A D G E – E eliminated.  
- H A D G E – E eliminated.  

Wait, most of these have E. We need words without any of the eliminated letters.

Valid English words fitting _ A _ _ _ with D:

- BADGE (E eliminated)  
- GADGE (invalid)  
- FADDY (Y eliminated)  
- MADGE (E eliminated)  
- WADDY (Y eliminated)  

Hmm. Maybe a word without D in the first 3 letters? Let me think differently: we have _ A _ _ _ and D must appear somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 4). Also no S,L,T,E,R,I,O,C,N,Y.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Words with _A_D_ or _A__D:

- B A D _ _ : BADGE (E eliminated), BADLY (L,Y eliminated), BADGE is out.  
- H A D _ _ : HADAL (invalid), HADED (invalid).  
- _ A _ D _ :  
  - F A J D _ (invalid)  
  - G A M D _ (invalid)  
  - M A J D _ (invalid)  
  - V A M D _ (invalid)  
  - W A Z D _ (invalid)  
  - Actually, looking at valid words:  
      - J A D E D (but E and D are there, E eliminated – no).  
      - G A D I D (invalid).  
      - H A D J I (invalid).  
      - M A D G E (E eliminated).  
      - B A D G E (E eliminated).  
      - F A D G E (E eliminated).  
      - W A D D Y (Y eliminated).  

This seems hard, but let me check:  

Valid words:  
- G A D I D – no.  
- G A D J A – no.  
- H A D J A – no.  
- J A D E D – no.  
- B A D G E – no.  
- F A D G E – no.  
- M A D G E – no.  

Wait, another angle: maybe D is in position 1 or 5?  

- D A _ _ _ : e.g., D A M P S (S,P eliminated), D A M P S invalid.  
- _ A _ _ D : e.g., F A M I D (invalid), H A M I D (invalid), B A M B D (invalid).  

Let me list allowed letters in each position:

Positions:  
1: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
2: A (fixed)  
3: any allowed except D (since D is in word but not in 4th, and could be here), but must contain D somewhere.  
4: any allowed except D (from feedback).  
5: any allowed.  

Word must include D.  

Possible word: B A D G E (E eliminated).  
Possible word: M A D G E (E eliminated).  
Possible word: B A D L Y (L,Y eliminated).  
Possible word: M A D L Y (L,Y eliminated).  
Possible word: B A D G E – E eliminated.  
Possible word: M A D G E – E eliminated.  

Another valid word: B A D M A (invalid).  

Realizing the constraints are tight, another word: K A T C H (but T and C eliminated).  

Wait, let me think of: J A M B D (invalid).  

Actually, looking through valid 5-letter words with _ A _ _ _ and containing D, avoiding eliminated letters:

- G A D I D – no.  
- J A D E D – no.  
- V A D E R – no (R eliminated).  
- M A D D A – invalid.  
- The only valid candidate seems: B A D G E (E eliminated).  

But E is eliminated.  

Another candidate: F A D G E (E eliminated).  

This suggests no valid word with current constraints – likely I missed something.  

Rechecking eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, R, I, O, C, N, Y.  

Allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  

Valid word: G A U G D (invalid).  
Valid word: B A D G U (invalid).  

Actually, a real word: M A D A M – but M is allowed, A is allowed, D is allowed, A is allowed, M is allowed.  

Check:  
- M A D A M →  
  - M allowed,  
  - A fixed at 2,  
  - D at 3 (allowed, since feedback only said D not in 4),  
  - A at 4 (allowed, though A is already placed at 2 – repetition allowed).  
  - M at 5 (allowed).  

But A is already confirmed at position 2, so A at 4 would be extra info – but feedback only said A is in word and at position 2, didn’t say only once. So MADAM is possible.  

Another word: B A D G E – E eliminated.  
Another word: H A M A D (invalid).  
Another word: M A D A M – valid English word.  

Let me choose MADAM.
