2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly gather information about what's in the word. A good starting word uses vowels and common consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Therefore:
- The word contains the letters O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.
- We know A, R, S are absent.

Good letters to keep: O, E
Good positions to explore: 1,2,4,5 (since 3 and 5 are ruled out for O and E respectively)

We should choose a word that includes O and E, avoids A,R,S, and places O and E in new positions. Common consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong candidate is ""T O E N D"" but that's not a valid word. Let's try ""T O N E D"" or ""D O N E T"" – neither are valid. 

Next idea: use common consonants with O and E. Good options include: ""O U T E R"" (but R is out), ""D O W E L"" (but L is okay), ""P O E T S"" (S is out), ""L O D G E"" (G isn't common), ""C O M E T"" (M is okay), etc. 

""COMET"" seems good – includes O and E in new spots and uses common letters, avoiding the banned ones.

Let's check:
- C – allowed.
- O – in word.
- M – allowed.
- E – in word.
- T – allowed.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, C, M, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (now fixed in position 2) and E (fixed in position 4)

Remaining letters (common ones still available): B D F G H I J K L N P Q U V W X Y Z

We need a consonant in slot 1, 3, and 5.  
Good consonants left: N, L, D, G, K, P, B, F…  
We also want to test new letters quickly.  
A good next guess would be:  
B O N E D  – but we already know E is in position 4, and D is untested.  
H O N E Y – H, N, Y are all untested and still possible.  
L O V E D – D is untested, but V is less common.
