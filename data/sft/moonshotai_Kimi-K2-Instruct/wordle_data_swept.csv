Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, I should choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate possibilities effectively. A good first word typically contains multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Common starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants that could appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C – not in the word (x)
- R – not in the word (x)
- A – not in the word (x)
- N – not in the word (x)
- E – is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

What I now know:
- Letters not in the word at all: C, R, A, N
- Letter E is somewhere in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

A good next guess should:
1. Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
2. Include E but in a different position (positions 1-4).
3. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.) to maximize new information.

Possible candidates:
- DOUSE (E in 5th, so skip)
- SLOPE (E in 5th, skip)
- STEEL (E appears twice, but positions 3 and 5 – 5th invalid)
- TUBES (E in 5th, skip)
- BLOKE (E in 5th, skip)
- STILE (E in 5th, skip)
- TOILE (E in 5th, skip)

A word that avoids the banned letters and has E in a safe spot (like 2nd or 3rd):
- BUILT – but no E
- STONE – uses S, T, O, N (N banned), E

Actually, E can't be in 5th. Let's try:
- ETHOS – E in 1st, good letters S, T, H, O
- EXIST – but X is rare, and S repeats
- STEAM – but A is banned
- ELOPE – but P is less common, and O, L are okay

A balanced choice: ""STOLE""
- Uses S, T, O, L, E
- E is in 4th position (not 5th, so valid)
- All other letters are unbanned and common.

But let me double-check: S, T, O, L, E – none are banned, and E is in 4th. Good.

Alternative: ""STOLE"" or ""BLOKE"" – but BLOKE has E in 5th (invalid). ""STOLE"" works.

Another option: ""POISE"" – but E in 5th is invalid.

""STOLE"" seems best.
