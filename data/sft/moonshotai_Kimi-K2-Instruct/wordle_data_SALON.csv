Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting some hits. Good starting words often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like T, N, S, R, L).

Some popular first guesses include words like ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". These cover a good mix of common letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, which gives maximum information gain
- It's a valid English word

Positions we now know:
- Position 1: not A, not R
- Position 2: not R
- Position 3: not O, not E
- Position 4: not S
- Position 5: not E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, and S
- Does NOT contain R or E
- A is NOT in position 1
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4

Looking for words with these constraints:
Possible candidates: SALON, SONAR, SOLAN, TALOS, COAST, BOAST, TOAST

Let me check:
- SALON: has A (position 1 - but A can't be in position 1) ❌
- SONAR: has R (but R is not in word) ❌
- SOLAN: has R (but R is not in word) ❌
- TALOS: has A (position 2), O (position 3 - but O can't be here) ❌

- TOAST: has A (position 3), O (position 2), S (position 4 - but S can't be here) ❌

Hmm, let me think differently. The letters A, O, S must appear, but in different positions.

Looking at word lists:
- SPOON: has O (position 2), O (position 3), S (position 1) - but O is repeated and we only have one O confirmed
- SALON: A is in position 1 which is invalid
- SOLAR: has R which is invalid
- SOAPY: has A (position 3), O (position 2), S (position 1) - but Y is extra

Wait, let me reconsider. We know the word contains A, O, S - but they might appear only once each.

Good candidates would be:
- SOAPY: S(1), O(2), A(3), P(4), Y(5) - has A, O, S in positions 1,2,3. A is not in position 1 (it was in position 1 in AROSE and marked -), but actually in AROSE A was in position 1 and marked ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 is possible for other letters. Similarly O was in position 3 and marked -, so it's not in position 3, and S was in position 4 and marked -, so it's not in position 4.

SOAPY positions:
- S in position 1 (ok, since S was marked - in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5)

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (SOAPY):
- S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- P is NOT in the word.
- Y is NOT in the word.

Combining these facts:
- S is definitely the first letter (position 1).
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 3).
- O must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3).
- R, E, P, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _
with A and O somewhere in the last three positions, and no R/E/P/Y.

Possible letters left: A, O, S, plus other consonants like T, N, L, etc.

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and O and no R/E/P/Y:
- SLOAT (but O can’t be in position 3, and A can’t be in position 3)
- SALON (but A is in position 2, O in position 4 - this could fit)
- SONAR (but R is invalid)
- SOLAR (R is invalid)
- SALVO (V is allowed, but A is in position 2, O in position 5 - could fit)
- SAMOA (A in position 2 and 5, O in position 4 - but A is repeated and we don’t know if A appears twice)
- SANTO (T and N are allowed, A in position 2, O in position 5 - could fit)

The most straightforward candidate seems to be SALON:
- S (✓) position 1
- A (must be somewhere, position 2 is allowed)
- L (new letter, allowed)
- O (must be somewhere, position 4 is allowed)
- N (new letter, allowed)

Check constraints:
- S is correctly in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 1 or 3).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 2 or 3).
- L and N are new letters, and none of R/E/P/Y are present.

<guess>SALON</guess>",SALON,"From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (SOAPY):
- S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- P is NOT in the word.
- Y is NOT in the word.

Combining these facts:
- S is definitely the first letter (position 1).
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 3).
- O must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3).
- R, E, P, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _
with A and O somewhere in the last three positions, and no R/E/P/Y.

Possible letters left: A, O, S, plus other consonants like T, N, L, etc.

Let’s list some 5-letter words starting with S that contain both A and O and no R/E/P/Y:
- SLOAT (but O can’t be in position 3, and A can’t be in position 3)
- SALON (but A is in position 2, O in position 4 - this could fit)
- SONAR (but R is invalid)
- SOLAR (R is invalid)
- SALVO (V is allowed, but A is in position 2, O in position 5 - could fit)
- SAMOA (A in position 2 and 5, O in position 4 - but A is repeated and we don’t know if A appears twice)
- SANTO (T and N are allowed, A in position 2, O in position 5 - could fit)

The most straightforward candidate seems to be SALON:
- S (✓) position 1
- A (must be somewhere, position 2 is allowed)
- L (new letter, allowed)
- O (must be somewhere, position 4 is allowed)
- N (new letter, allowed)

Check constraints:
- S is correctly in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 1 or 3).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since it can’t be in 2 or 3).
- L and N are new letters, and none of R/E/P/Y are present.",Guess 3: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
