This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters in English. Among the most frequent letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to choose a word that includes as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding repetition. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains five distinct very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), which will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. It also has no repeating letters, which further maximizes information gain.

Therefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – the first letter is A and is in the correct spot.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. Must contain R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively).
3. Must not contain S or E.

A good next step is to try placing R and O in new positions while using fresh common letters. The remaining common consonants are L, N, T, C, etc.; common vowels left are I, U. 

Let’s test a word that places R in position 3 and O in position 4, and uses new common letters: C and I. The word ""ACORN"" fits (A C O R N).

- A(✓) – first letter is A.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R(-) only excluded position 2).
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O(-) only excluded position 3).
- C and N are new letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – A is locked in position 1.
   – R and O are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
   – S and E are completely absent.

2. ACORN: A(✓) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x)
   – A is still correct in position 1.
   – O is still somewhere, but not in position 3 (already known from AROSE).
   – R is still somewhere, but now we also know it’s not in position 4.
   – C and N are absent.

So the current picture:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Must include: R, O (and the same set of letters cannot contain C, N, S, E).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.

Possible positions for R: 3, 5  
Possible positions for O: 4, 5

But O cannot go in position 3 (already excluded) and R cannot go in position 2 or 4, so we have to place them together in the remaining slots.

Let’s list a few candidates that fit A _ _ _ _, contain R and O, none of the forbidden letters (C, N, S, E), and respect the positional exclusions:

- A D O R T  → “ADORT” – but ‘T’ is fine, yet ‘D’ is a new letter.
- A R M O D  → “ARMOR” – but R is in position 2, which is forbidden.
- A P O R T  → “APORT” – R in 4, forbidden.
- A R O M A  → “AROMA” – R in 2, forbidden; O in 3, forbidden.
- A D R O P  → “ADROP” – R in 3 (ok), O in 4 (ok). Letters: A, D, R, O, P – none of C, N, S, E. Looks valid.

The goal is to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters in English. Among the most frequent letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. \n\nA good strategy is to choose a word that includes as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding repetition. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains five distinct very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), which will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. It also has no repeating letters, which further maximizes information gain.\n\nTherefore, my first guess will be ""AROSE"".\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(✓) – the first letter is A and is in the correct spot.\n- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n1.

From the new feedback on ADROP:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- R(✓) – now confirmed in position 3.
- D(x), P(x) – both letters are not in the word at all.
- O(-) – still somewhere, but still not in position 4 (and earlier not in 3).

So we now have:
1. Pattern: A _ R _ _
2. Must include: O (but O not in 3 or 4, so only possible in 2 or 5).
3. Letters already eliminated: C, D, E, N, P, S.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, having R in position 3, containing O (in 2 or 5), and using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible O positions:
- If O is in 2: A O R _ _
- If O is in 5: A _ R _ O

Let’s list some valid common words fitting these patterns, using the remaining allowed letters (basically any letters except the excluded ones).

For A O R _ _:
- AORAL – contains A twice, might be acceptable.
- AORTA – contains A twice and T (T is allowed).
- AORIC – less common.

For A _ R _ O:
- A B R I O – not common.
- A F R I O – not a word.
- A M R I O – not a word.
- A G R I O – not common.
- A T R I O – not a word.
- A B R O O – not a word.

Better candidates seem to be “AORTA” (A O R T A) – fits A O R _ _ pattern, uses allowed letters. 

Let’s check:
- A(✓) in 1, O in 2 (allowed), R(✓) in 3, T (new, allowed), A in 5 (allowed, no restriction).
- No excluded letters.

Thus, “AORTA” is a solid next guess.
