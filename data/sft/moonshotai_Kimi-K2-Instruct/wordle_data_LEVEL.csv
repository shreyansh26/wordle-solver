For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that tests common letters and letter positions. The ideal first word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to identify which vowels might be present.
2. Use common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to test for their presence.
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

A popular and effective choice for the first guess is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) in different positions.
- It includes 2 very common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique.
- The letters are arranged to test common patterns like the ""OSE"" ending or ""AR"" beginning.

This will give us good feedback on which vowels and consonants are in the word and their approximate positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that tests common letters and letter positions. The ideal first word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to identify which vowels might be present.
2. Use common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to test for their presence.
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

A popular and effective choice for the first guess is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) in different positions.
- It includes 2 very common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique.
- The letters are arranged to test common patterns like the ""OSE"" ending or ""AR"" beginning.

This will give us good feedback on which vowels and consonants are in the word and their approximate positions.

- E (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (it was last; so E is not the 5th letter).

Letters still unknown: the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (all except A, R, O, S).
We know E is somewhere in positions 1–4.

To maximize coverage, pick a word that:
1. Uses E in a new position (not last).
2. Introduces other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.).
3. Avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, O, S.

A good candidate: ""UNTIE""
- U and I are new vowels.

Consequently:

Letters confirmed in the word:

- L somewhere, but NOT at position 3 or 4 (from guess 3 and 4).  
  So L must be at 1 or 5.

Still-unused common letters:  
F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the fact we still need three more letters (positions 1,3,4,5 with E fixed at 2 and L at 1 or 5).

Since L must be first or last, two cases:

Case 1: L _ E _ _  
Case 2: _ E _ _ L

Among plausible English patterns, “FLECK” (L in 2 is impossible, so rewrite)  
We need L in 1 or 5.

Candidate word that fits:  
FLECK → but that puts L in position 1, E in 2, and introduces F, K, none of which have been tried.

Check conflicts: none of F, L, E, C, K have been ruled out except C, which was already used and marked x in BELCH (so C is out).  
So C is out.  

Next candidate:  
GLEEK → but we don’t know about G, L, E, E, K. Double E is risky and G unknown.  
Better:  
FLESH → but H already out.

Try:  
FLEWK – nonsense.

Take simpler route: use L at position 1.

Pattern: L E _ _ _

Candidate: L E G G Y – has Y (out).  
Candidate: L E G U M – U out.

But K was in BELCH? No, BELCH had C, H out; K not tested.

Also BELCH had B, C, H out, but K never tried.

F E K E L – valid word? No.

K E P L – no.

G E L P – no.

Eventually:

Real word: “GELLY” – Y out.

“GELID” – I out.

“GECKO” – O out.

Eventually valid unused word:

“KEFIR” – I, R out.

“KEFAL” – A out.

“KEVEL” – V, L good, E 2nd – and all letters new.

KEVEL – dictionary word (a nautical cleat).

Letters: K, E, V, E, L  
But we have E fixed at 2, so we’d have:

K E V _ L – but E already at 2.

KEVEL is K-E-V-E-L, positions: 1-2-3-4-5.

E at 2 exactly matches.  
L at 5 is allowed.  
K, V are new.  
E appears twice – but feedback only told us E is in word, not quantity. So possible.

No conflicts.

Therefore KEVEL is a valid next guess.

Eventually:

Valid word: G E L P S – S out.

Valid word: G E L P Y – Y out.

Valid word: G E L P – no.

Another approach: use word list.

Common word: “GELID” – I out.

“GELDS” – S out.

“GELLY” – Y out, double L.

Real word: “GELLY” – Y out.

“GELID” – I out.

“GELTS” – T, S out.

“GELID” – I out.

“GECKO” – O out.

Eventually valid unused word:

“KEFIR” – I, R out.

“KEFAL” – A out.

“KEVEL” – V, L good, E 2nd – and all letters new.

KEVEL – dictionary word (a nautical cleat).

Letters: K, E, V, E, L  
But we have E fixed at 2, so we’d have:

K E V _ L – but E already at 2.

KEVEL is K-E-V-E-L, positions: 1-2-3-4-5.

E at 2 exactly matches.  
L at 5 is allowed.  
K, V are new.  
E appears twice – but feedback only told us E is in word, not quantity. So possible.

No conflicts.

Therefore KEVEL is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: KEVEL -> FEEDBACK: K(x) E(✓) V(✓) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LEVEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that tests common letters and letter positions. The ideal first word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to identify which vowels might be present.
2. Use common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to test for their presence.
3. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

A popular and effective choice for the first guess is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) in different positions.
- It includes 2 very common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique.
- The letters are arranged to test common patterns like the ""OSE"" ending or ""AR"" beginning.

This will give us good feedback on which vowels and consonants are in the word and their approximate positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word.
- R (x) – not in the word.
- O (x) – not in the word.
- S (x) – not in the word.
- E (-) – in the word but in the wrong position (it was last; so E is not the 5th letter).

Letters still unknown: the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (all except A, R, O, S).
We know E is somewhere in positions 1–4.

To maximize coverage, pick a word that:
1. Uses E in a new position (not last).
2. Introduces other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (like T, N, L, I, U, etc.).
3. Avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, O, S.

A good candidate: ""UNTIE""
- U and I are new vowels.
- T and N are high-frequency consonants we haven’t tested.
- E moves to position 4 (safe, since it can’t be 5th).
- All letters are unique and none are A, R, O, S.

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know:
1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I (from both guesses).
2. Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5 (it appeared in both guesses as “-” and was tried in positions 4 and 5).

Consequently:
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels not yet used (only Y is left among vowels).

Pick a word that:
- Uses E in a new spot (1, 2, or 3).
- Introduces several other high-frequency untested letters (such as L, D, Y, M).
- Avoids all the ruled-out letters.

Candidate: “MEDLY”
- E in position 2 (new).
- New letters: M, D, L, Y (none have been tested).
- Letters not used: none of A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I appear.

Guess 3: MEDLY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know after three guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   - E is fixed in position 2 (✓ at guess 3).

3. Additional positional hints:  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (- at guess 3).  
   - Therefore L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5, but NOT 4.

We still need three more letters.  
Available (unused) letters among the common ones:  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Aim for a word that:
- keeps E in slot 2,  
- uses L in one of the remaining slots (not slot 4),  
- adds new, high-frequency unused consonants (C, H, K, G, B, F, P, etc.),  
- avoids all letters already ruled out.

A good candidate: “BELCH”
- E is in slot 2.  
- L is in slot 3 (allowed, because it can’t be in 4).  
- B, C, H are all new, frequent consonants.

No conflicts with prior feedback.

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D, Y, B, C, H

Letters confirmed in the word:  
- E at position 2.  
- L somewhere, but NOT at position 3 or 4 (from guess 3 and 4).  
  So L must be at 1 or 5.

Still-unused common letters:  
F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the fact we still need three more letters (positions 1,3,4,5 with E fixed at 2 and L at 1 or 5).

Since L must be first or last, two cases:

Case 1: L _ E _ _  
Case 2: _ E _ _ L

Among plausible English patterns, “FLECK” (L in 2 is impossible, so rewrite)  
We need L in 1 or 5.

Candidate word that fits:  
FLECK → but that puts L in position 1, E in 2, and introduces F, K, none of which have been tried.

Check conflicts: none of F, L, E, C, K have been ruled out except C, which was already used and marked x in BELCH (so C is out).  
So C is out.  

Next candidate:  
GLEEK → but we don’t know about G, L, E, E, K. Double E is risky and G unknown.  
Better:  
FLESH → but H already out.

Try:  
FLEWK – nonsense.

Take simpler route: use L at position 1.

Pattern: L E _ _ _

We need three new consonants from remaining pool: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Good common combination: L E G _ _  
Need two more unused consonants not ruled out.

Candidate: L E G G Y – has Y (out).  
Candidate: L E G U M – U out.  
Candidate: L E G A – A out.

So try L E G P _ – L E G P W – does not exist.

Better to use remaining consonants symmetrically.

Actually, simpler and valid: L E G E T – T out.

Eventually: L E F K G – invalid.

Rather, look for real word:

LEFSE – has S out.

LEFTE – not a word.

LEGGY – Y out.

LEPER – uses P, R is out.

LEVEN – N out.

LEWIS – S out.

LEZES – S out.

Switch to L at position 5:

_ E _ _ L

Common pattern:  
G E E K L – double E, K ok.  
But K was in BELCH? No, BELCH had C, H out; K not tested.

Also BELCH had B, C, H out, but K never tried.

GEEKL – nonsense.

HEKEL – H out.

FEKEL – F ok, K ok, L at 5.

F E K E L – valid word? No.

FEEL – too short.

F E E L – too short.

FEELZ – not real.

Instead, try:  
P E K E L – not a word.

Real word: P E K E L – no.

Actually F E K E L is not a word.

But “KEPEL” – not a word.

“PEKEL” – no.

Real word in Webster: F E K E L not found.

Wait – “PEKEL” is obsolete Dutch, not in common list.

Instead, simpler valid word:  
K E P E L – no.

Let me list known positions:

E is 2nd.  
L is 1 or 5.

And remaining untested high-frequency consonants: F, G, K, P, V, W.

Look for common English 5-letter words with E 2nd and L at 1 or 5 and using new letters.

Example:  
V E G L – no.

K E P L – no.

G E L P – no.

Eventually:

Valid word: G E L P S – S out.

Valid word: G E L P Y – Y out.

Valid word: G E L P – no.

Another approach: use word list.

Common word: “GELID” – I out.

“GELDS” – S out.

“GELLY” – Y out, double L.

Real word: “GELLY” – Y out.

“GELID” – I out.

“GELTS” – T, S out.

“GELID” – I out.

“GECKO” – O out.

Eventually valid unused word:

“KEFIR” – I, R out.

“KEFAL” – A out.

“KEVEL” – V, L good, E 2nd – and all letters new.

KEVEL – dictionary word (a nautical cleat).

Letters: K, E, V, E, L  
But we have E fixed at 2, so we’d have:

K E V _ L – but E already at 2.

KEVEL is K-E-V-E-L, positions: 1-2-3-4-5.

E at 2 exactly matches.  
L at 5 is allowed.  
K, V are new.  
E appears twice – but feedback only told us E is in word, not quantity. So possible.

No conflicts.

Therefore KEVEL is a valid next guess.

So the word is exactly: _ E V E L

We need to find the first letter. From previous guesses, letters ruled out include:
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, D, Y, B, C, H, K

Remaining unused common letters: F, G, J, P, Q, W, X, Z

Looking for 5-letter words ending in E V E L:
- FEVEL – not a word.
- GEVEL – not a word.
- JEVEL – not a word.
- PEVEL – not a word.
- QEVEL – not a word.
- WEVEL – not a word.
- XEVEL – not a word.
- ZEVEL – not a word.

The only valid English word that fits the pattern _ E V E L is ""LEVEL"".

Let's check:
- L – not previously ruled out (only L(-) in MEDLY and L(✓) in KEVEL, so L is confirmed at position 5, but position 1 could also be L).
- E – confirmed at position 2.
- V – confirmed at position 3.
- E – confirmed at position 4.
- L – confirmed at position 5.

""LEVEL"" fits perfectly.",Guess 6: LEVEL -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) V(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
