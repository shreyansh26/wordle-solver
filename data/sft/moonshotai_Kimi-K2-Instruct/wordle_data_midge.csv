For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. Ideally, it should contain common vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

Popular first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

After considering these, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct last position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. Letters S, L, A, T are excluded from the entire word.

Now I need a new first-guess word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Good vowels/consonants left: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, H, M, etc.

Some possibilities:
- NERVE (but V is less common; R, N are good).
- CHIME (good consonants C, H, M; vowels I, E).
- PRICE (but P is less common; R, I, C are good).
- CRONE (but O is a vowel; C, R, N are good).

""CRIME"" looks strong: uses C, R, I, M, E. C and R are common, M is a good consonant, I is a common vowel, and E is already confirmed at the end. Also avoids S, L, A, T.

Let me check: CRIME - no S, L, A, T; ends with E. Good candidate.

Current knowledge:
1. Word ends with E (E is in position 5).
2. Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.
3. Letters C, R are not in the word at all.
4. Letters I and M are in the word but are in the wrong positions.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ E
And must contain I and M somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they appeared in CRIME (I not in 3, M not in 4).

Also exclude: S, L, A, T, C, R.

Remaining frequent letters to test: N, D, H, G, B, K, V, O, U, Y.

We need a word with:
- E in position 5.
- Both I and M somewhere in positions 1-4, but not in 3 or 4 respectively.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, R).

Let’s try to place:
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is taken by M if it moves there).
- M could be in positions 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is taken by I if it moves there).

Possible patterns:
- I in 1, M in 2, 3: M _ I _ E, I M _ _ E
- I in 1 or 2, M in 3: I _ M _ E or _ I M _ E

Let’s think of words that fit:
- M I N E _ → but needs 5 letters ending in E, like ""MINED"" (but D is new)
- I N M E → but INME_ isn’t a valid pattern
- M I N E → but MINED is 5 letters ending in E.

Wait, ""MINED"":
- M in 1 (new), I in 2 (new), N in 3 (new), E in 4 (but E must be in 5), so no.
Hmm.

Alternative: ""MIDGE"":
- M, I, D, G, E → but D and G are new, and positions: M in 1 (new), I in 2 (new), D in 3 (new), G in 4 (new), E in 5 (correct). Also, no forbidden letters (S,L,A,T,C,R).

Check if M and I are not in positions 3 and 4 from CRIME feedback: yes, they’re in new positions (1 and 2). This seems valid.

""MIDGE"" is a valid English word meaning a small fly.

Also, it introduces new common letters D and G to test.
