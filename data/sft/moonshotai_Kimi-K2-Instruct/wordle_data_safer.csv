For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. If none of these letters are present, we can quickly eliminate them and focus on other letters in subsequent guesses. If any letters are present (✓ or -), we can use that information to refine our next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1

- O(x) → O is NOT in the word at all  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know the secret word contains:
A, R, S, E (each at least once) and does NOT contain O.

None of these letters are in their guessed positions, so:
- A is not at position 1  
- R is not at position 2  
- S is not at position 4  
- E is not at position 5  

We still need a 5th letter. A common consonant that hasn’t been tried yet is T. Let’s form a word that places:
- A somewhere other than position 1  
- R somewhere other than position 2  
- S somewhere other than position 4  
- E somewhere other than position 5  
- and introduces T.

The word “STARE” fits these constraints:
1. S (not in position 4) is at position 1 ✓  
2. T (new letter) ✓  
3. A (not in position 1) ✓  
4. R (not in position 2) ✓

   - A must be somewhere other than 1,3 → position 2 is OK
   - R must be somewhere other than 2,4 → position 3 is OK
   - E must be somewhere other than 5 → position 4 is OK
   - D is a new letter to test

Therefore, “SARED” is a valid guess.

Summary of everything we know after three guesses:

Letters in the word:
- S (fixed at position 1)
- A (fixed at position 2)
- E (in the word but not at 4 or 5 ⇒ must be at 3)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
- O, T, D

Letters that must still appear somewhere:
- R is in the word but NOT at 3 or 4 ⇒ must be at 5

So the only remaining slot is position 4, and we need a new letter that we have not yet tried.
The known pattern is:
1: S
2: A
3: E
4: ?
5: R

Unused common letters include L, N, C, H, etc.  Let’s pick L.

Word formed: S A E L R → “SAELR” is not valid English.
Next consonant: N → “SAENR” invalid.
Next consonant: C → “SAECR” invalid.
Next consonant: H → “SAEHR” invalid.

Let’s look at words that fit the pattern S A E _ R.
The only common English 5-letter word following this pattern is “SAFER”.

Check:
S(1) A(2) E(3) F(4) R(5)
- F is new (hasn’t been tested) and satisfies all constraints.
