For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gained from the feedback. 

A common and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E), which are frequent in English words.
- 2 common consonants (R, S), which are also very frequent.

This gives us a broad initial scan of the alphabet and positions, increasing the chances of hitting at least some correct letters or positions to guide subsequent guesses.

Position 4 needs a consonant (since O is already a vowel and only U remains for vowels if used, but we can use any consonant left).
Let’s list examples:
- B L O W S → B, L, W are allowed, no forbidden letters, O 3rd, S 5th. Valid word.
- F L O W S → likewise valid.
- G L O W S → valid.
- P L O W S → valid.

Among these, BLOWS is a common word and fits all constraints.

Verify:
- BLOWS: B L O W S  
  - O 3rd (✓)  
  - S 5th (allowed since S can’t be 1 or 4)  
  - No A, R, E, T, I, C.  

Looks good.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This helps maximize information gained from the feedback. 

A common and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E), which are frequent in English words.
- 2 common consonants (R, S), which are also very frequent.

This gives us a broad initial scan of the alphabet and positions, increasing the chances of hitting at least some correct letters or positions to guide subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th); it must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Does not contain A, R, or E.

Let’s think of words with O in the 3rd spot and S elsewhere. A few candidates:
- S _ O _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S O _ _ (S in 2nd)
- _ _ O _ S (S in 5th)

Possible words:
- STOOL (S 1st, O 3rd, but has T and L; no A/R/E)
- SCOUR (S 1st, O 3rd, but R is invalid)
- SPOON (S 1st, O 3rd, but N is fine, no A/R/E)

- MISTY (O missing)
- TOAST (A invalid)

""STOIC"" fits:
- S in 1st (allowed since S must move from 4th).
- O in 3rd (matches feedback).
- T, I, C are new letters, no A/R/E.

Let’s go with STOIC.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (pos 3), S (not pos 1 or 4).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).
3. Contains none of A, R, E, T, I, C.

Possible patterns:
- _ S O _ _  → e.g., B S O N D (but B S O N D isn’t a word)
- _ _ O _ S  → e.g., F L O U S → FLOUS isn’t valid English

Looking at usable letters left (avoiding the six excluded ones):
B D F G H J K L M N P Q U V W X Y Z

Try filling the blanks:
Pattern _ S O _ _  
We need vowels for other positions: only U remains (A, E, I are out).
So: _ S O U _  → B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for 1st and 5th.

Real words:
- B S O U N → BSO UN isn’t a word.
- P S O U N → PSO UN isn’t.
- G S O U P → GSO UP isn’t.

Pattern _ _ O _ S  
We need letters for positions 1, 2, 4.
Position 4 needs a consonant (since O is already a vowel and only U remains for vowels if used, but we can use any consonant left).
Let’s list examples:
- B L O W S → B, L, W are allowed, no forbidden letters, O 3rd, S 5th. Valid word.
- F L O W S → likewise valid.
- G L O W S → valid.
- P L O W S → valid.

GLOMS checks:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gained from the feedback. 

A common and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E), which are frequent in English words.
- 2 common consonants (R, S), which are also very frequent.

This gives us a broad initial scan of the alphabet and positions, increasing the chances of hitting at least some correct letters or positions to guide subsequent guesses.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th); it must be in 1st, 2nd, or 5th.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Does not contain A, R, or E.

Let’s think of words with O in the 3rd spot and S elsewhere. A few candidates:
- S _ O _ _  (S in 1st)
- _ S O _ _ (S in 2nd)
- _ _ O _ S (S in 5th)

Possible words:
- STOOL (S 1st, O 3rd, but has T and L; no A/R/E)
- SCOUR (S 1st, O 3rd, but R is invalid)
- SPOON (S 1st, O 3rd, but N is fine, no A/R/E)
- MASON (S 2nd, O 3rd, but A is invalid)
- MISTY (O missing)
- TOAST (A invalid)
- STOIC (C is fine, no A/R/E, S 1st, O 3rd)

""STOIC"" fits:
- S in 1st (allowed since S must move from 4th).
- O in 3rd (matches feedback).
- T, I, C are new letters, no A/R/E.

Let’s go with STOIC.

<guess>stoic</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: stoic -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on STOIC:
- S is confirmed in the word but is NOT in position 1 (-).
- O is still locked in position 3 (✓).
- T, I, C are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (pos 3), S (not pos 1 or 4).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, T, I, C.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Contains S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).
3. Contains none of A, R, E, T, I, C.

Possible patterns:
- _ S O _ _  → e.g., B S O N D (but B S O N D isn’t a word)
- _ _ O _ S  → e.g., F L O U S → FLOUS isn’t valid English

Looking at usable letters left (avoiding the six excluded ones):
B D F G H J K L M N P Q U V W X Y Z

Try filling the blanks:
Pattern _ S O _ _  
We need vowels for other positions: only U remains (A, E, I are out).
So: _ S O U _  → B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z for 1st and 5th.

Real words:
- B S O U N → BSO UN isn’t a word.
- P S O U N → PSO UN isn’t.
- G S O U P → GSO UP isn’t.

Pattern _ _ O _ S  
We need letters for positions 1, 2, 4.
Position 4 needs a consonant (since O is already a vowel and only U remains for vowels if used, but we can use any consonant left).
Let’s list examples:
- B L O W S → B, L, W are allowed, no forbidden letters, O 3rd, S 5th. Valid word.
- F L O W S → likewise valid.
- G L O W S → valid.
- P L O W S → valid.

Among these, BLOWS is a common word and fits all constraints.

Verify:
- BLOWS: B L O W S  
  - O 3rd (✓)  
  - S 5th (allowed since S can’t be 1 or 4)  
  - No A, R, E, T, I, C.  

Looks good.

Remaining possible letters:
For position 1 and 4: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need real 5-letter words matching pattern: _ L O _ S

Quick scan:
- F L O U S → FLOUS (not a valid word)
- G L O U S → GLOUS (not standard)
- P L O U S → PLOUS (no)
- F L O P S → FLOPS (valid word)
- G L O B S → GLOBS (but B is excluded)
- P L O D S → PLODS (valid word)
- P L O W S → PLOWS (but W is excluded)
- S L O G S → SLOG S (invalid)
- S L O P S → SLOPS (valid, but S repeats, and S is already fixed at 5)
- H L O P S → HLOPS (invalid)

Valid candidates: FLOPS, PLODS

Between these, FLOPS fits better because:
- F is allowed
- O in 3, L in 2, S in 5 all correct
- P is allowed in position 4

PLODS also fits, but let's pick FLOPS as it's more common.

We now have the pattern _ L O _ S (positions 1-5) and the feedback from GLOMS tells us:

- G is correct in position 1 (✓).
- L, O, S are still correct in positions 2, 3, 5 (✓).
- M is not in position 4 (x).

So the secret word must be:

G L O ? S

where the missing letter in position 4 is **not** any of the previously excluded letters: A, R, E, T, I, C, B, W, F, P, M.

Looking at the remaining alphabet for position 4 (after eliminating all the known-absent letters):

D, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that is G L O _ S.

The only standard English word that fits is **GLOSS**.

Check:
- GLOSS:
  - G, L, O, S positions are all correct per feedback.
  - S in position 4 is allowed (S is known to be in the word and not restricted to any position except that it cannot be in 1 or 4 in earlier guesses – but now we know it must appear at least once in positions 1-5 and we already have S in 5; double letters are allowed).
