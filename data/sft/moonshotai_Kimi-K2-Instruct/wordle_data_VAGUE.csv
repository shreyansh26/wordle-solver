For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as early as possible. 

A strong first guess typically includes:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Looking at frequency analysis, some of the best starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel after A)

This should give me good information about the presence/absence of these letters and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and L are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (✓), so the word ends with E.

We know:
- Fifth letter is E.
- A is somewhere among positions 1–4.
- Letters S, L, T are excluded entirely.

Good next guess should:
1. Retain A in a new position (but not position 3).
2. Include high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, D, etc.).
3. Not repeat S, L, T.

Common consonants still available: R, N, C, D, B, M, G, etc.
Common vowels still available: I, O, U (since E is already placed and A is known to appear).

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 1 or 2.
- Uses new consonants like R, N, C.

Option: CRANE – but T was already ruled out and CRANE has no T, but it has N and R, and places A in position 2. However, E is already confirmed in position 5, so CRANE has E in position 5 which is perfect.

This gives us:
- C and R (new consonants).
- A in position 2 (new position).
- N (new consonant).
- E in position 5 (correct).

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down further.

Key deductions:
- E is definitely in the 5th position.
- A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd or 4th positions, so it must be in position 1 or 2.
- Letters completely ruled out so far: S, L, T, C, R, N.
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.
- Remaining vowels: I, O, U may appear (but E is already placed and A is known to appear).

- Ends in E.
- Has A in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only unruled-out letters.

Possible starting patterns:

- _ A _ _ E

- “AGAPE” – A in position 1, G and P are new.
- “AMBLE” – A in position 1, M, B, L are okay (but L is ruled out).
- “BARGE” – A in position 2, but R and G are okay (though R is ruled out).
- “FABLE” – A in position 2, F, B, L are okay (L ruled out).
- “GAMER” – A in position 2, but R is ruled out.
- “HASTE” – A in position 2, but S and T are ruled out.
- “PAYEE” – A in position 2, but Y is less common and double E is redundant.
- “WAFER” – A in position 2, but R is ruled out.

Good candidates:
- “ABODE” – uses A in position 1, O and D are new.
- “AGAPE” – uses A in position 1, G and P are new.

Between these, “ABODE” seems slightly better because it introduces O and D, which are high-frequency remaining consonants/vowels.

- _ A _ _ E

Let’s brainstorm some valid words under these constraints:
- “ABODE” – A in position 1, but D and E are okay; E is fixed. O is new.
- “AGAPE” – A in position 1, G and P are new.
- “AMBLE” – A in position 1, M, B, L are okay (but L is ruled out).
- “BARGE” – A in position 2, but R and G are okay (though R is ruled out).
- “FABLE” – A in position 2, F, B, L are okay (L ruled out).
- “GAMER” – A in position 2, but R is ruled out.
- “HASTE” – A in position 2, but S and T are ruled out.
- “PAYEE” – A in position 2, but Y is less common and double E is redundant.
- “WAFER” – A in position 2, but R is ruled out.

Good candidates:
- “ABODE” – uses A in position 1, O and D are new.
- “AGAPE” – uses A in position 1, G and P are new.

Between these, “ABODE” seems slightly better because it introduces O and D, which are high-frequency remaining consonants/vowels.

Let’s go with ABODE.

From the three previous guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
2. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
3. ABODE → A(-) B(x) O(x) D(x) E(✓)

Key facts accumulated:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4. The only remaining position for A is 2.
  Therefore the pattern must be: _ A _ _ E
- Ruled-out letters so far: S, L, T, C, R, N, B, O, D.
- Still allowed consonants (that are common): F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.
- Allowed vowels: I, U (E is used, A is used in position 2).

Possible patterns: ? A ? ? E where each ? is from the allowed letters.

Let’s look for common 5-letter English words that fit _ A _ _ E with none of the banned letters. Examples:
- F A K E ? (needs 4th letter) → “FAKER” but R is banned.
- G A M E ? → “GAMER” but R is banned.
- H A V E ? → “HAVEN” but N is banned.
- P A V E ? → “PAVER” R banned.
- M A P L E → but L is banned.
- M A G I C → not ending in E.
- G A M E S → not ending in E.
- V A P E ? → “VAPED” D banned.
- W A V E ? → “WAVED” D banned.
- W A G E ? → “WAGER” R banned.
- Y A K E ? → “YAKED” D banned.

A promising one: M A G I E – though uncommon, it’s valid and uses only allowed letters (M, A, G, I, E). Another is M A G U E (type of plant) but also uncommon.

However we want a common word that people would list. Another common word: P A G E ? → “PAGED” D banned.

Wait, “H A G E ?” → “HAGEN” N banned.

Let me scan allowed letters again and look for common words:
Allowed consonants: F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: I, U (for positions 1 and 3)

Let’s list valid patterns:

- F A I K E – not a word.
- G A I K E – not a word.
- H A I K E – not a word.
- M A I K E – not a word.
- P A I K E – not a word.
- V A I K E – not a word.
- W A I K E – not a word.
- Y A I K E – not a word.

How about:
- M A G I E – valid word (archaic variant of “magus” or “magpie” but recognized).
- P A V I E – not a word.
- V A G U E – yes, that’s a common word! Letters used: V, A, G, U, E. None are banned, and it fits _ A _ _ E with A in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, “VAGUE” is a valid and common word that fits all constraints.
