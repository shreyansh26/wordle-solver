For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
2. Common vowels (E, A, I, O)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering several high-frequency letters while being a valid word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 1, so it could be 2-5).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 3, so it could be 1,2,4,5).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally position 5, so it could be 1-4).

Letters confirmed OUT: R, S.
Letters confirmed IN (but wrong position): A, O, E.
We still need to test other common letters not yet used: T, N, L, I, C, etc.

I should avoid repeating R and S, and move A, O, E to new positions. A good next guess would use new common letters while repositioning the known ones. ""OCEAN"" comes to mind, but it repeats A and E in positions they were already marked wrong for. Instead, ""TALON"" uses new letters T, L, N while repositioning A and O.

However, let's try ""OCEAN"" might be better because:
- O moves from position 3 to 1 (new position)
- C, N are new common letters
- E moves from position 5 to 3 (new position)
- A moves from position 1 to 2 (new position)

But A was at position 1 and marked wrong, so position 2 is new. E was at 5 and marked wrong, so 3 is new. O was at 3 and marked wrong, so 1 is new. This seems good.

Wait, ""OCEAN"" has A at position 4, E at 3, O at 1 - all new positions for these letters. Let me verify:
- O: was at 3, now at 1 (ok)
- C: new
- E: was at 5, now at 3 (ok)
- A: was at 1, now at 4 (ok)
- N: new

This seems optimal.

From the feedback so far:

Letters known:
- O is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE and OCEAN).
- R, S, C, N are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
O _ E _ _

A must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 1-3 or 5).

Thus the word looks like: O _ E A _

We need a letter for position 2 and 5, and we know:
- Letters used so far and their status: A, O, E (in), R, S, C, N (out).
- Remaining common letters: T, L, I, D, G, etc.

Position 2 and 5 must be from unused letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates: T, L, I, D, G, etc.

Let’s try to find a valid word that fits O _ E A _. Possible words:
- OTEAD (not valid)
- OLEAG (not valid)
- ODEAL (not valid)
- OREAD (but R is out)
- OCEAN (already used, C and N out)
- OBEAH (B, H not tested but word is valid)
- OPERA (R is out)
- ODEAL (D and L are candidates)

Alternatively, OTEAD is not a word, but OTE is a prefix. Let’s think of valid 5-letter words: OBEAH (but B and H are untested), OTELA (not valid), OMEGA (M and G untested, valid word), OBEAH, OMEGA.

Let me check: OMEGA fits O _ E A _ with G in position 5 and M in position 2. M and G have not been used or ruled out yet.

Another candidate: OBEAH - but B and H are untested. However, OMEGA seems better because M and G are common letters.

But we need to ensure all letters fit: O, M, E, G, A - none are ruled out except A, O, E are confirmed, and G, M are new.

Thus, OMEGA is a valid guess that fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- O at 1: ✓ confirmed
- M at 2: new letter
- E at 3: ✓ confirmed
- A at 4: must be here (only position left for A)
