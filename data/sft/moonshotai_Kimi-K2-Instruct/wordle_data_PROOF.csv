Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. According to English letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A strong starting word should use multiple of these common letters while avoiding rare letters like Q, X, Z. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives good coverage for eliminating or confirming letters in the first round.

From the feedback on GUESS 1 (AROSE):
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 3.  
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The pattern is ? R O ? ?
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E
- Still-allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We now want a word that keeps R in position 2 and O in position 3, uses only the still-allowed letters, and ideally introduces new high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Good candidates:
- B R O N Z – but Z is low-frequency.
- C R O W N – good consonants C, W, N.
- G R O U T – uses U, T.
- P R O N G – N, G.
- F R O N T – N, T are both common and haven’t appeared yet.

I’ll go with FRONT because:
1. It satisfies the locked-in RO in positions 2-3.
2. Uses F, N, T, three new common consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – Pattern so far: _ R O _ _  
   – Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, N, T  
   – Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F (was in word but not at pos-1), G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

2. FRONT → F(-) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) T(x)  
   – F is in the word but NOT at position 1.  
   – Positions 4 and 5 remain unknown, but N and T are now excluded.

We therefore know:
- Exact pattern: _ R O _ _  
- R and O are fixed.  
- F must appear somewhere in positions 2-5, but position 2 is already R, so F must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  – Yet position 3 is locked to O, so F must be in position 4 OR 5.  
- Still need three new letters (for positions 1, 4, 5) chosen only from the remaining allowed set.

High-frequency letters not yet used: C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U.

Let’s pick position 1 as a consonant that often starts words: C, D, G, P…  
Pick position 4 and 5 to place F (once) plus another common consonant/vowel.

Candidate words that fit:
- C R O W F – but W hasn’t been tested yet, seems reasonable.  
- G R O U F – U is a vowel we haven’t tried.  
- P R O U F – same idea.  
- D R O I F – I is also available.

Among these, CROWF is not a valid English word.  
GROUF, PROUF, DROIF also aren’t valid.

We must stick to real words.  
Let’s list valid English words with pattern _ R O _ _ and containing F somewhere:

- PROUD – but U is fine, D is fine, but no F.  
- GROVE – has V, E is banned.  
- CROFT – C, R, O, F, T… but T is banned.  
- GROUF not valid.  
- FROUF not valid.  

Wait, F must be IN the word but not at position 1.  
Let’s list real words with F in position 4:

- CROFT – T banned.  
- GROUF – invalid.  
- TROFF – T banned.  
- PROFS – S banned.  

F in position 5:

- CROUF – invalid.  
- PROOF – O already fixed at 3 (can’t have another O unless it’s allowed).  
  – Actually, nothing forbids duplicate letters yet; only the letters shown x are banned.  
  – So PROOF is valid English, uses P, F, and repeats O.  
  – However, we have no evidence that duplicate letters are needed.  
  – Still, it’s legal.

- GROOF – also valid.  
- DROOF – not a word.

Among these, “PROOF” is a legitimate and common 5-letter word:
- P (new)  
- R (fixed)  
- O (fixed)  
- O (allowed)  
- F (must be in word, and fits at 5)  

It satisfies every constraint so far.
