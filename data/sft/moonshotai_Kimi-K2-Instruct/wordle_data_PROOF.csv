For a first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel/consonant balance to maximize information gained. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) 
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (C, R, N). This gives good coverage of common letters while being a valid word.

From both guesses we now know:

We still need to test new vowels. The vowels we have not tried are O and U (since A, E, I are out).

Good candidates that fit:
- DROOL (has O twice, might be wasteful)
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T – but S is already known to be out)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – introduces two new vowels O and U)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – also introduces O and U)
- TROOP (but has O twice and P, and we've seen T is still available)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) 
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel heavy
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (C, R, N). This gives good coverage of common letters while being a valid word.

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So the word structure is: _ R _ _ _
Letters to avoid: C, A, N, E

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position
2. Does not contain C, A, N, E
3. Is a valid 5-letter word

Good consonants to try: S, T, L, B, D, M, P, H
Good vowels to try (since A and E are out): I, O, U

Possible candidates:
- TROOP (but has two O's, might be too specific)
- TRIAL (but has A which is forbidden)
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K - looks good)
- DRIFT (D, R, I, F, T - also good)
- PRISM (P, R, I, S, M - also good)

We still need to test new vowels. The vowels we have not tried are O and U (since A, E, I are out).

Good candidates that fit:
- DROOL (has O twice, might be wasteful)
- FROST (F, R, O, S, T – but S is already known to be out)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T – introduces two new vowels O and U)
- PROUD (P, R, O, U, D – also introduces O and U)

From the five clues we now know the exact pattern:

P R O _ _

and we know every letter that has ever appeared in guesses 1-5:

C, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, G, U, T, W, L, X, Y are all **excluded**.

The only consonants not yet tried (and still legal) are:

D, F, H, J, M, V, Z (plus Q, but nothing starts PROQ-).

We need a real 5-letter word of the form “PRO??” using only those remaining consonants.

Possible endings:
- PRO**F** – PROF is only four letters.
- PRO**D** – PROD is only four letters.
- PRO**M** – PROM is only four letters.
- PRO**F** + one more consonant: PROFs? No 5-letter singular form.
- PRO**D** + one more consonant: PRODD? Not a valid word.
- PRO**M** + one more consonant: PROMP? Not a word.
- PRO**F** + D → PROFD? No.
- PRO**F** + M → PROFM? No.
- PRO**V** – PROV is four letters.
- PRO**J** – PROJ is four letters.
- PRO**D** + J? PRODJ? No.
- PRO**M** + J? PROMJ? No.

The only remaining possibility is to test the single valid word that exists:

PRO**F** + D → “PROFD” isn’t valid.
PRO**F** + F → “PROFF” – this *is* a rare but valid variant spelling of “prof”.

So the only remaining candidate is PROFF.

Let me verify: PROFF is listed in some dictionaries as a noun meaning “a professor.” It’s accepted in Scrabble and in most Wordle clones.

That is our last untested combination that fits the pattern and the remaining constraints.
