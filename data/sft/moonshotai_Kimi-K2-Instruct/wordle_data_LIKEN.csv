Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. My goal is to choose a word that can give me the most useful information. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters (especially vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid duplicate letters (to maximize feedback coverage)
3. Be a common word that's likely to be the answer

From the feedback:
- C, R, A are NOT in the word (marked x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked -).

So the secret word:
- does not contain C, R, or A.
- contains N and E somewhere, but definitely NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

I need to avoid C, R, A and place N and E in different spots. I’ll choose a word that incorporates N and E in new positions while using other common letters. A good candidate is ""STONE"" because:
- It has S, T, O, N, E.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- N is now in position 4 (moved from 4 to avoid same position, but that was already the issue—actually, N was in position 4 in CRANE, so I need to move it elsewhere).
Wait, in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got ""-"", so N cannot be in position 4. Similarly, E was in position 5 and got ""-"", so E cannot be in position 5.

Let me try ""TENOR"":
- T, E, N, O, R: but R is excluded (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Let’s synthesize the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
   → Letters excluded: C, R, A
   → Letters present but wrong position: N (not in 4), E (not in 5)

2. LINED → L(✓) I(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)
   → Correct positions: L(1), I(2), E(4)
   → N is still in the word but wrong position (it was in 3, so N ≠ 3)
   → D is not in the word

So we now know:
- Exact pattern so far: L I _ E _
- Letters still needed: N must appear, and it cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from Guess 1 & 2)
- Available positions for N: 3 or 5. But N is known not to be in 3 (from Guess 2), so N must be in position 5.
- Therefore the word structure is: L I _ E N
- The blank (position 3) must be a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, and that hasn’t been placed.

Letters we haven’t tried or ruled out for position 3:
- Common letters still available: S, T, O, G, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Avoid C, R, A, D (from earlier exclusions)
- Check if any obvious 5-letter word fits L I _ E N:
  - Likely candidates: LINEN (but N is already used in 5, and duplicate N would have been noticed if disallowed)
  - LIBEN – not valid
  - LIVEN – valid word, uses V
  - LIGEN – not valid
  - LIPEN – not valid
  - LISEN – not valid
  - LITEN – not valid
  - LIGNE – not valid
  - LIVEN seems the only valid choice here.

Therefore, the best next guess is LIVEN.

- Exact pattern so far: L I _ E _
- Letters still needed: N must appear, and it cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from Guess 1 & 2)
- Available positions for N: 3 or 5. But N is known not to be in 3 (from Guess 2), so N must be in position 5.
- Therefore the word structure is: L I _ E N
- The blank (position 3) must be a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, and that hasn’t been placed.

Letters we haven’t tried or ruled out for position 3:
- Common letters still available: S, T, O, G, P, U, V, Y, etc.
- Avoid C, R, A, D (from earlier exclusions)
- Check if any obvious 5-letter word fits L I _ E N:
  - Likely candidates: LINEN (but N is already used in 5, and duplicate N would have been noticed if disallowed)
  - LIBEN – not valid
  - LIVEN – valid word, uses V
  - LIGEN – not valid
  - LIPEN – not valid
  - LISEN – not valid
  - LITEN – not valid
  - LIGNE – not valid
  - LIVEN seems the only valid choice here.

Therefore, the best next guess is LIVEN.

Let’s update what we know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
   – Letters absent: C, R, A
   – Letters present but misplaced: N (not in pos 4), E (not in pos 5)

2. LINED → L(✓) I(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)
   – Fixed letters so far: L(1), I(2), E(4)
   – N is still present but not in pos 3 (and already not in 4 or 5 from step 1)
   – D is not in the word

3. LIVEN → L(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(✓)
   – Now we also know V is not in the word
   – The fifth letter (position 5) is confirmed to be N

Thus the word has the fixed pattern:

L I _ E N

The only missing letter is at position 3.  
We must pick a letter that:
- has not been ruled out (i.e., not C, R, A, V, D)  
- allows a valid English 5-letter word.

Common unused consonants for position 3: S, T, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Scanning possibilities that make real words:

- L I S E N  → LISTEN without a T?  “LISEN” isn’t a word.  
- L I T E N  → “LITEN” also isn’t standard.  
- L I G E N  → no  
- L I M E N  → yes: “LIMEN” is an anatomical term (plural of limen).  
- L I K E N  → “LIKEN” (to compare) – valid word.  
- L I B E N  → no  
- L I P E N  → no  
- L I F E N  → no  
- L I H E N  → no  
- L I U E N  → no  
- L I Y E N  → no  

Between “LIKEN” and “LIMEN,” “LIKEN” is far more common in everyday English, so it’s the safer choice.

Therefore the next guess is LIKEN.
