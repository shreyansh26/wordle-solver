This is my first guess, so I don't have any prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. In Wordle-style games, it's generally best to start with a word that has common letters and good letter coverage. The most frequently used letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.

A good strategy is to use a word that covers multiple vowels and common consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular starting choices because they include common letters. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about the presence and positions of these common letters.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, F, N, G, C, H.
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, I, R — but none of them are in their guessed positions (L not 2,3,5; I not 3; R not 4).

Let’s map the forbidden positions:

Position 1: C(x), F(x), S(x) — none of these are in the word.
Position 2: L(-) — L is in word but not here.
Position 3: I(-) — I is in word but not here.
Position 4: R(-) — R is in word but not here.
Position 5: L(-) — L is in word but not here.

We have three required letters: L, I, R.  
They must appear in the remaining valid positions:

- L may be in 1 or 4.
- I may be in 1,2,4,5.
- R may be in 1,2,3,5.

Overlap constraints:
- L only in 1 or 4.
- R cannot be in 4 (because if R were in 4, L would have to be in 1).

Let’s list possible distributions:

Case A: L in 1
  - Pattern: L _ _ _ _
  - I and R must go in 2,3,4,5 with no overlap:
      I not in 3, R not in 4, L already in 1.
  - Viable placements:
      I must be in 2,4,5; R must be in 2,3,5 avoiding conflicts.

Case B: L in 4
  - Pattern: _ _ _ L _
  - Then R must be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4). And I must go in 1,2,5 (not 3).
  - Example: R _ I L _ (R in 1, I in 3 — but I cannot be in 3) — invalid.
  - Example: _ R I L _ — I in 3 invalid.
  - Example: _ _ R L I — I in 5 is OK, R in 3 is OK.
  - Example: R _ _ L I — I in 5 OK, R in 1 OK.

So possible patterns:
- L I _ R _
- L _ I R _
- L _ R I _
- L R _ I _
- L _ _ I R
- L _ _ R I
- _ _ R L I
- R _ _ L I
- R _ I L _
- etc.

But we need to pick a valid English word using only allowed letters: the allowed set now is every letter except S,A,T,E,F,N,G,C,H.

Common allowed letters left: D, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, B, etc.

Let me look for a word with L, I, R and two more allowed letters that fits the constraints.

Candidate: ""BRIOL"" — invalid (no such word)
Candidate: ""BROIL"" — B R O I L
  - B: allowed
  - R: required and allowed
  - O: allowed
  - I: required and allowed
  - L: required and allowed
  - Check positions:
      R in 2: allowed (R was not excluded from 2)
      I in 4: allowed (I was only excluded from 3)
      L in 5: allowed (L was excluded from 2,3,5 in previous guesses? Wait, L was excluded from 2,3,5? Let's re-check:

From SLATE: L(-) means L is in word but not in 2.
From FLING: L(-) means L is not in 3.
From CHIRL: L(-) means L is not in 5.
So L must be in 1 or 4.

Thus BROIL has L in 5 — invalid.

Next: ""DROIL"" — invalid word.
Next: ""DRILL"" — L in 5 (invalid)
Next: ""DILOR"" — invalid
Next: ""PILAR"" — P I L A R — A is excluded.

Try ""PRILL"" — L in 4, I in 2, R in 3.
  - L in 4: OK
  - I in 2: OK (was only excluded from 3)
  - R in 3: OK (was only excluded from 4)
  - P: allowed
  - Second L: but we only have 5 letters, can't have two L's? Actually words can have duplicate letters, but the original word is 5 distinct? Not necessarily. However PRILL is a valid English word (a small fish or to ripple).

Let me check dictionary: PRILL is accepted.

So:
P R I L L
- L in 4: allowed
- I in 3: wait, I was excluded from 3 (FLING feedback I(-) in position 3). So I cannot be in 3 in this word. Thus PRILL is invalid because it puts I in 3.

Next option: ""PILAR"" — but A is excluded.

Next: ""PURIL"" — invalid.

Next: ""URIAL"" — A excluded.

Next: ""BURLY"" — L in 3: excluded.

Next: ""WORLD"" — O, R, L, D: W is allowed, O allowed, R required, L in 4 allowed, D allowed. Check positions:
W O R L D
- L in 4: OK
- R in 3: OK
- I is missing — but we know I is in word. So invalid.

Next: ""VOILA"" – A excluded.

Next: ""ROILY"" – R O I L Y
- R in 1: OK
- O: allowed
- I in 3: excluded (I cannot be in 3)
Invalid.

Next: ""RIVAL"" – R I V A L – A excluded.

Next: ""RIGID"" – missing L.

Next: ""RIGOL"" – L in 4: OK, I in 2: OK, R in 1: OK, O in 3: OK, G is excluded.

Next: ""RIVOL"" – invalid.

Next: ""RIPAL"" – A excluded.

Next: ""RIPLY"" – R I P L Y
- R in 1: OK
- I in 2: OK
- P: allowed
- L in 4: OK
- Y: allowed
This seems valid.

Check RIPLY in dictionary: yes, it's a real word (archaic for quickly, but accepted).

So RIPLY is a valid next guess.

Positions:
R: 1 (allowed)
I: 2 (allowed, only excluded from 3)
P: allowed
L: 4 (allowed)
Y: allowed

And it contains all required letters: R, I, L.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I don't have any prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. In Wordle-style games, it's generally best to start with a word that has common letters and good letter coverage. The most frequently used letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.

A good strategy is to use a word that covers multiple vowels and common consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular starting choices because they include common letters. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should give me good information about the presence and positions of these common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x), T(x), E(x) → A, T, and E are NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- contains L somewhere (but not in position 2),
- does NOT contain S, A, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- includes L (not in position 2),
- avoids S, A, T, E,
- and ideally brings in fresh common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to test: R, N, D, C, H, M, B, F, G, K, P, V, Y.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

I’ll choose “FLING”:
- F, L, I, N, G are all allowed,
- L is in position 3 (safe, because original feedback only ruled out L in position 2),
- introduces F, I, N, G which are all common and new to the search.

<guess>FLING</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Known facts about the secret word:
- It contains L (but not in position 2 or 3).
- It contains I (but not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain: S, A, T, E, F, N, G.

Remaining allowed letters (common ones in bold):  
Vowels: O, U, Y (sometimes vowel)  
Consonants: B, C, D, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible L positions: 1, 4, 5.

I want a word that:
1. Uses one of those L positions.
2. Uses the letter I in a new position.
3. Brings in other fresh common consonants.

Candidate L positions:
- If L is 1st: L _ _ _ _
- If L is 4th: _ _ _ L _
- If L is 5th: _ _ _ _ L

Let's try L in 5th. A common pattern ending in ‑L is “-ORL-” or “-IRL-” but we need 5 letters.  
Testing “CHIRL” (C, H, I, R, L):  
- L is 5th (permitted).  
- I is 3rd (new position).  
- C, H, R are fresh common consonants.  
All letters are still allowed.

So CHIRL is my next guess.

- Letters that ARE in the word: L, I, R — but none of them are in their guessed positions (L not 2,3,5; I not 3; R not 4).

Let’s map the forbidden positions:

Position 1: C(x), F(x), S(x) — none of these are in the word.
Position 2: L(-) — L is in word but not here.
Position 3: I(-) — I is in word but not here.
Position 4: R(-) — R is in word but not here.
Position 5: L(-) — L is in word but not here.

We have three required letters: L, I, R.  
They must appear in the remaining valid positions:

- L may be in 1 or 4.
- I may be in 1,2,4,5.
- R may be in 1,2,3,5.

Overlap constraints:
- L only in 1 or 4.
- R cannot be in 4 (because if R were in 4, L would have to be in 1).

Let’s list possible distributions:

Case A: L in 1
  - Pattern: L _ _ _ _
  - I and R must go in 2,3,4,5 with no overlap:
      I not in 3, R not in 4, L already in 1.
  - Viable placements:
      I must be in 2,4,5; R must be in 2,3,5 avoiding conflicts.

Case B: L in 4
  - Pattern: _ _ _ L _
  - Then R must be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4). And I must go in 1,2,5 (not 3).
  - Example: R _ I L _ (R in 1, I in 3 — but I cannot be in 3) — invalid.
  - Example: _ R I L _ — I in 3 invalid.
  - Example: _ _ R L I — I in 5 is OK, R in 3 is OK.
  - Example: R _ _ L I — I in 5 OK, R in 1 OK.

So possible patterns:
- L I _ R _
- L _ I R _
- L _ R I _
- L R _ I _
- L _ _ I R
- L _ _ R I
- _ _ R L I
- R _ _ L I
- R _ I L _
- etc.

But we need to pick a valid English word using only allowed letters: the allowed set now is every letter except S,A,T,E,F,N,G,C,H.

Common allowed letters left: D, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O, B, etc.

Let me look for a word with L, I, R and two more allowed letters that fits the constraints.

Candidate: ""BRIOL"" — invalid (no such word)
Candidate: ""BROIL"" — B R O I L
  - B: allowed
  - R: required and allowed
  - O: allowed
  - I: required and allowed
  - L: required and allowed
  - Check positions:
      R in 2: allowed (R was not excluded from 2)
      I in 4: allowed (I was only excluded from 3)
      L in 5: allowed (L was excluded from 2,3,5 in previous guesses? Wait, L was excluded from 2,3,5? Let's re-check:

From SLATE: L(-) means L is in word but not in 2.
From FLING: L(-) means L is not in 3.
From CHIRL: L(-) means L is not in 5.
So L must be in 1 or 4.

Thus BROIL has L in 5 — invalid.

Next: ""DROIL"" — invalid word.
Next: ""DRILL"" — L in 5 (invalid)
Next: ""DILOR"" — invalid
Next: ""PILAR"" — P I L A R — A is excluded.

Try ""PRILL"" — L in 4, I in 2, R in 3.
  - L in 4: OK
  - I in 2: OK (was only excluded from 3)
  - R in 3: OK (was only excluded from 4)
  - P: allowed
  - Second L: but we only have 5 letters, can't have two L's? Actually words can have duplicate letters, but the original word is 5 distinct? Not necessarily. However PRILL is a valid English word (a small fish or to ripple).

Let me check dictionary: PRILL is accepted.

So:
P R I L L
- L in 4: allowed
- I in 3: wait, I was excluded from 3 (FLING feedback I(-) in position 3). So I cannot be in 3 in this word. Thus PRILL is invalid because it puts I in 3.

Next option: ""PILAR"" — but A is excluded.

Next: ""PURIL"" — invalid.

Next: ""URIAL"" — A excluded.

Next: ""BURLY"" — L in 3: excluded.

Next: ""WORLD"" — O, R, L, D: W is allowed, O allowed, R required, L in 4 allowed, D allowed. Check positions:
W O R L D
- L in 4: OK
- R in 3: OK
- I is missing — but we know I is in word. So invalid.

Next: ""VOILA"" – A excluded.

Next: ""ROILY"" – R O I L Y
- R in 1: OK
- O: allowed
- I in 3: excluded (I cannot be in 3)
Invalid.

Next: ""RIVAL"" – R I V A L – A excluded.

Next: ""RIGID"" – missing L.

Next: ""RIGOL"" – L in 4: OK, I in 2: OK, R in 1: OK, O in 3: OK, G is excluded.

Next: ""RIVOL"" – invalid.

Next: ""RIPAL"" – A excluded.

Next: ""RIPLY"" – R I P L Y
- R in 1: OK
- I in 2: OK
- P: allowed
- L in 4: OK
- Y: allowed
This seems valid.

Check RIPLY in dictionary: yes, it's a real word (archaic for quickly, but accepted).

So RIPLY is a valid next guess.

Positions:
R: 1 (allowed)
I: 2 (allowed, only excluded from 3)
P: allowed
L: 4 (allowed)
Y: allowed

And it contains all required letters: R, I, L.

Let’s consolidate all the facts so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, A, T, E, F, N, G, C, H, P, Y.

Letters that ARE in the word:
- L (must appear once, and cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- I (must appear once, and cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5)
- R (must appear once, and cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5)

Positions ruled out:
L: 2,3,4,5 ⇒ L must be in position 1.
I: 2,3,5     ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 4.
R: 1,4,5     ⇒ R must be in position 2 or 3.

But L must be in position 1, so position 1 is already taken by L. Therefore I cannot be in position 1; it must be in position 4.
That leaves positions 2 and 3 for R.

So the word must be:
L _ _ _ _
with I at 4, and R at 2 or 3.

Candidate patterns:
- L R _ I _
- L _ R I _

Now we need two more consonants that:
- are 5-letter long,
- are not in the forbidden set (S,A,T,E,F,N,G,C,H,P,Y),
- form a valid English word.

Allowed letters: B, D, K, M, U, V, W, O, etc.

For the pattern L R _ I _:
Possible 3rd and 5th letters from allowed set.
Try: L R U I D → “LRUID” – no such word.
     L R O I D → “LROID” – no.
     L R K I D – no.

For the pattern L _ R I _:
3rd letter must be R (already), so 2nd and 5th letters are the blanks.
Possible: L D R I M – invalid word.
     L B R I M – invalid.
     L K R I M – invalid.
     L O R I D – invalid.
     L V R I D – invalid.
     L W R I M – invalid.

Wait, let’s search a dictionary for words that fit L _ R I _ or L R _ I _.

Pattern L _ R I _:
- L U R I D – yes, “LURID” is a valid word.
- L D R I B – no.
- L B R I D – no.

Pattern L R _ I _:
- L R U I D – not a word.

So the only candidate is LURID.

Check letters in LURID:
L – required, allowed, must be in 1 ✓
U – allowed
R – required, allowed, in 3 (R was excluded only from 1,4,5) ✓
I – required, allowed, in 4 (I was excluded from 2,3,5) ✓
D – allowed

Thus LURID satisfies all constraints.
