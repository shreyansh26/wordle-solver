For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The word ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination covers several high-frequency letters and should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of which letters are in the secret word.

From the two guesses so far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions uncertain): U, N, I  

Therefore the secret word must contain the letters U, N, I in some order and not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, L.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (i.e., excludes A,R,O,S,E,T,L)
- must include U, N, I

The remaining common letters we can draw from are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to pick a word that fixes one of the known letters in a specific position to test placement, while also introducing another letter from the valid pool.

A simple pattern is U _ N _ I, but we need to check if any valid word matches. Another pattern could be _ U N I _, etc.

Looking through the letters, a word that fits all constraints is ""fungi"":
F and G are still allowed, and the word contains U, N, I in positions 2-4.

Let's check:
- Letters in ""fungi"": F, U, N, G, I
- All of them are allowed (not excluded).
- Contains U, N, I as required.

So a good next guess is ""fungi"".

Current known facts:

Allowed letters (not yet ruled-out):  
B C D H J K M P Q V W X Y Z  
plus the three confirmed letters U, N, I.

Positions:  
- U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from fungi feedback: U(-)).  
- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (N(-)).  
- I is in the word, but not in position 5 (I(-)).  

So the secret word has the multiset {U,N,I,?,?} arranged in a 5-letter word, with the constraints above on their positions.

A useful next guess tries to place U, N, I in new positions while introducing only one additional letter (to maximize positional information).

Looking at remaining consonants, common ones are B, D, H, M, P, V, etc.

I’ll try a pattern that places U in position 1, N and I in positions 4 and 2 respectively, and add a new consonant in position 3, and another in position 5.  A simple word that fits is “munch”, but H is allowed and we already have N as the fourth letter, U first, etc.  Alternatively, ""quirk"" is invalid because Q is usually followed by U and we already have U elsewhere.  Another candidate is “punch” but again H is allowed and fits.  However, we know T, L, G, F, A, R, O, S, E are out, so punch uses P, U, N, C, H – all allowed.  Let me check if C and H are allowed – yes.  And it puts U in position 2 (but we already know U is NOT in position 2 from fungi feedback), so that’s no good.

Instead, let’s try ""unhip"":
U N H I P  
- U in position 1 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- N in position 2 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- I in position 4 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- H and P are still allowed letters.

""unhip"" is a valid 5-letter word, and this arrangement tests new positions for U, N, I while introducing two new allowed letters.

Hence, the next guess is “unhip”.

plus the three confirmed letters U, N, I.

Positions:  
- U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from fungi feedback: U(-)).  
- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (N(-)).  
- I is in the word, but not in position 5 (I(-)).  

So the secret word has the multiset {U,N,I,?,?} arranged in a 5-letter word, with the constraints above on their positions.

A useful next guess tries to place U, N, I in new positions while introducing only one additional letter (to maximize positional information).

Looking at remaining consonants, common ones are B, D, H, M, P, V, etc.

I’ll try a pattern that places U in position 1, N and I in positions 4 and 2 respectively, and add a new consonant in position 3, and another in position 5.  A simple word that fits is “munch”, but H is allowed and we already have N as the fourth letter, U first, etc.  Alternatively, ""quirk"" is invalid because Q is usually followed by U and we already have U elsewhere.  Another candidate is “punch” but again H is allowed and fits.  However, we know T, L, G, F, A, R, O, S, E are out, so punch uses P, U, N, C, H – all allowed.  Let me check if C and H are allowed – yes.  And it puts U in position 2 (but we already know U is NOT in position 2 from fungi feedback), so that’s no good.

Instead, let’s try ""unhip"":
U N H I P  
- U in position 1 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- N in position 2 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- I in position 4 (allowed, not tested yet).  
- H and P are still allowed letters.

""unhip"" is a valid 5-letter word, and this arrangement tests new positions for U, N, I while introducing two new allowed letters.

Hence, the next guess is “unhip”.",Guess 4: unhip -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) H(x) I(✓) P(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions uncertain): U, N, I  

Therefore the secret word must contain the letters U, N, I in some order and not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, L.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (i.e., excludes A,R,O,S,E,T,L)
- must include U, N, I

The remaining common letters we can draw from are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to pick a word that fixes one of the known letters in a specific position to test placement, while also introducing another letter from the valid pool.

A simple pattern is U _ N _ I, but we need to check if any valid word matches. Another pattern could be _ U N I _, etc.

Looking through the letters, a word that fits all constraints is ""fungi"":
F and G are still allowed, and the word contains U, N, I in positions 2-4.

Let's check:
- Letters in ""fungi"": F, U, N, G, I

What we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, L, F, G, H, P  

Allowed remaining letters: B, C, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus the three required letters U, N, I).

Position constraints (from feedback):
- U is not in position 2 (from fungi) and is in position 1 (from unhip), so U is at position 1.  
- N is not in positions 2 or 3 (from unhip and fungi) and is at position 2 in unhip, but that contradicts the earlier ‘-’ feedback, so we must reinterpret the unhip feedback. Actually, the unhip feedback shows: U(✓) N(✓) H(x) I(✓) P(x). This means:

U is in correct position 1.  
N is in the word but not in position 2 (feedback N(✓) means correct position, but since N is in position 2 and marked ✓, that implies N is in position 2. However, this contradicts the previous fungi feedback. Let me re-read the feedback formats carefully.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: fungi -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) N(-) G(x) I(-)
Guess 4: unhip -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) H(x) I(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but positions unknown): U, N, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, L, F, G, H, P  

Allowed remaining letters: B, C, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus the three required letters U, N, I).

Position constraints (from feedback):
- U is not in position 2 (from fungi) and is in position 1 (from unhip), so U is at position 1.  
- N is not in positions 2 or 3 (from unhip and fungi) and is at position 2 in unhip, but that contradicts the earlier ‘-’ feedback, so we must reinterpret the unhip feedback. Actually, the unhip feedback shows: U(✓) N(✓) H(x) I(✓) P(x). This means:

U is in correct position 1.  
N is in the word but not in position 2 (feedback N(✓) means correct position, but since N is in position 2 and marked ✓, that implies N is in position 2. However, this contradicts the previous fungi feedback. Let me re-read the feedback formats carefully.

Looking back:

Guess 4: unhip -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) H(x) I(✓) P(x)

This means:
- U is in the word and in correct position 1.  
- N is in the word and in correct position 2.  
- H is not in the word.  
- I is in the word and in correct position 4.  
- P is not in the word.  

Therefore, the secret word has:
- U in position 1  
- N in position 2  
- I in position 4  

The blanks are at positions 3 and 5, using remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word of the form U N _ I _.  
Looking at common consonants left: C, D, M, V, etc.

Possible combinations:
- UNCID, UNMID, UNVID, UNCIV, UNMIX, etc.  
Checking valid words:
""uncid"" – not a valid English word.  
""uncit"" – invalid (T is out).  
""unciv"" – invalid.  
""unmix"" – valid English word meaning to undo mixing.  

Check letters: U, N, M, I, X – all allowed and positions fit.  
So ""unmix"" fits perfectly.The feedback from ""unhip"" tells us the secret word starts with U-N and has I in the fourth spot: U N _ I _. The only remaining letters allowed are B, C, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. A valid English word matching this pattern is ""unmix"".

From all feedback:

- U is in position 1.  
- N is in position 2.  
- I is in position 4.  
- Letters already ruled-out: A, R, O, S, E, T, L, F, G, H, P, M, X.  

Remaining unused letters that are still allowed: B, C, D, J, K, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form U N _ I _.  
The only missing spot is position 3; position 5 must also be filled from the allowed set.

A quick scan of the dictionary gives one clear candidate:

UNBID  →  U N B I D  (B and D are both still allowed and fit the pattern).

That satisfies all constraints.
