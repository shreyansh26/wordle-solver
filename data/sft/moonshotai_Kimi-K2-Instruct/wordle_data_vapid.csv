For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and gives good information about the secret word. The best starting words in Wordle typically include the most frequent English letters (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C). I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and uses different positions for vowels which could help identify both the presence and position of vowels in the secret word.

This choice should provide maximum information about which of these common letters are in the word and their possible positions.

The feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So we know:
- No R, O, S, E
- A exists somewhere else (not 1st position)

Remaining common letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

Since A is confirmed present, I should include it in a new position. I'll try a word that also covers new common letters. A good candidate would be ""UNAID"" (U, N, I, D, A), but D is less common. Instead, ""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L - all common letters not yet tested. However, this doesn't include A. 

Better choice: ""TULIP"" - T, U, L, I, P - but still lacks A. 

Alternative: ""TAINT"" - T, A, I, N, T - but repeats T. 

Better: ""FAINT"" - F, A, I, N, T - covers new letters and moves A to position 2. This seems optimal as it tests 4 new common letters and relocates A.

   - I must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).

2. Letters known **NOT** to be in the word:

3. Letters known **to be** in the word (but we still need exact positions):

4. Still-untested common letters (from the rest of the alphabet):
   B, C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z   (we’ll pick ones that form valid words).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A in position 2,
- contains both D and I,
- places I somewhere other than position 3,
- uses none of the excluded letters.

Possible skeletons:
- _ A _ _ _  (position 2 = A)
- D must appear once, and I once (somewhere 1,4,5).

Let’s list valid English words satisfying these constraints.

- B A D I ?  – no.
- G A D I ?  – no.
- H A D I ?  – no.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- A exists somewhere else (not 1st position)

Remaining common letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, H, G, B, F, K, etc.

Since A is confirmed present, I should include it in a new position. I'll try a word that also covers new common letters. A good candidate would be ""UNAID"" (U, N, I, D, A), but D is less common.

Letters left to test that are common and haven’t been used: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Structure so far: _ A _ _ _

We need to place I somewhere not in position 3, and fill the other three slots with new letters. Using C and L (both high-frequency), and H (also common), we can try:

C A I L _  → but I must be somewhere else.
_ A I L _  → doesn’t help.
C A L I _  → I now in position 4.
C A L I K → 5th letter K too rare.
D A L I K → same issue.
H A C K → only 4 letters.
H A I L → uses H, A, I, L – only 4 letters.

Best 5-letter word: C A L I M  → word “CALIM” is invalid.
“C A L I D” → invalid.
“C A L I B” → invalid.
“C A L I P” → invalid.

Wait, valid words: “M A I L Y” – but Y is less common and M used already? No, M not yet used.

The feedback from VACID gives us the exact pattern:

V(✓) A(✓) I(✓) D(✓) with C(x)

So the secret word has the form:

V A _ I D

and the missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant that has **not** already been ruled out.

Letters already **ruled out** (from all prior guesses):
R, O, S, E, F, N, T, L, Y, C

Therefore the only remaining common consonants for the 3rd position are:
B, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, X, Z

Among these, the most common that yield real 5-letter words are:

- G → VAGID (rare, but listed in some dictionaries)
- H → VAHID (proper name, not standard)
- M → VAMID (not a word)
- B → VABID (not a word)
- K → VAKID (not a word)
- P → VAPID (a common English word meaning “dull, lifeless”)

“VAPID” is the only well-known, valid choice that fits the pattern and uses an allowable letter.

Hence the secret word is VAPID.
