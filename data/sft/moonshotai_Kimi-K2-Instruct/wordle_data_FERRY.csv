Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me a good spread of common letters to help narrow down possibilities. I'll use a word with common vowels and consonants like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". Let me go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This should provide good initial information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback for AROSE:

- O is **not in the word** (x).
- S is **not in the word** (x).

So we know:

- Letters we must use: R (but not in position 2) and E (but not in position 5).

We need a new word that includes R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in positions different from 2 and 5 respectively. A good strategy is to keep the consonants and vowels mixed while testing new positions.

Summary of constraints so far:

1. Letters confirmed and in the correct positions:
   - Position 2 must be E
   - Position 3 must be R
   - Position 5 must be Y

2. Letters eliminated and cannot appear anywhere:
   - A, O, S, M, I, T, D, B

3. Positions still unknown:
   - Position 1: any remaining letter except the eliminated ones
   - Position 4: any remaining letter except the eliminated ones

Remaining letters to choose from (excluding the eliminated set and keeping letters that are common in English):
C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two consonants for spots 1 and 4. Common English consonants still allowed: C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, V, W.

Testing ""F"" and ""N"" gives us: F E R N Y. This is a valid English word.

Check:
- F is not eliminated.
- E at position 2 is correct.
- R at position 3 is correct.
- N is not eliminated and fits position 4.
- Y at position 5 is correct.

So ""FERNY"" is a good candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me a good spread of common letters to help narrow down possibilities. I'll use a word with common vowels and consonants like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"". Let me go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters in English 5-letter words. This should provide good initial information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- A is **not in the word** (x).
- R is **in the word but not in position 2** (-).
- O is **not in the word** (x).
- S is **not in the word** (x).
- E is **in the word but not in position 5** (-).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid entirely: A, O, S.
- Letters we must use: R (but not in position 2) and E (but not in position 5).

We need a new word that includes R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in positions different from 2 and 5 respectively. A good strategy is to keep the consonants and vowels mixed while testing new positions.

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.
Possible vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try ""MERIT"":
- M – not yet tested.
- E – must be included and is now in position 2 (allowed, since it wasn’t in position 5 before).
- R – must be included and is now in position 3 (allowed, since it wasn’t in position 2 before).
- I – not yet tested.
- T – not yet tested.
This covers new letters and new positions for R and E.

3. Remaining unknown positions: 1, 4, 5
4. Possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three **new** letters for positions 1, 4, 5.  
To maximize information, pick common consonants not yet tested.  
I’ll test B, N, D in one word: **B R E N D** → but that would put R in position 2 (invalid).  
A valid template: [?] E R [?] [?].  
Good candidate: **B E R T H**? (T already eliminated).

Next: **D E R B Y**? (Y not yet eliminated).

Simplest common letters: **D E R B Y**.

Check:
- D, E, R, B, Y: none are in the eliminated list.
- E at 2, R at 3 exactly satisfies feedback.
- Tests new letters D, B, Y.
