Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy in Wordle is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of possibilities. 

Good starting words often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently occurring consonants like R, T, N, S, L. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common initial letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word contains L, A, and T somewhere, and does not contain S or E.

A good next guess should:
1. Include the known letters L, A, T in new positions.
2. Avoid S and E.
3. Incorporate new common letters to maximize information.

I’ll rearrange L, A, T and add two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet. Common consonants like R or N are useful. Let’s try incorporating R and I (a new vowel).

A candidate is “TRAIL”:
- T is repositioned from position 4 to 1.
- R and I are new letters.
- A is repositioned from position 3 to 2.
- L is repositioned from position 2 to 5.

This tests new positions for L, A, T and introduces R and I.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, R, I  
Letters that ARE in the word: T (1st position is correct), L (somewhere else), A (somewhere else)  

Known pattern: T _ _ _ L  (because L is in 5th position in TRAIL and that spot is marked correct, so the L must be here)  
Remaining letters to place: A (must go in position 2, 3, or 4)  
We still need two more consonants. Common ones we haven’t used yet: N, M, C, K, D, B, H, etc.

Let’s try to use A in the second position: T A _ _ L  
We still need two consonants. Popular choices that haven’t been dismissed: N and M give “TANML” – but that’s not a word.  
Next try: C and H → “TACHL” – not a word.

Try N and G → “TANGL” – no.

Try “TACAL” – no.  
Try “TABAL” – no.  
Try “TAPIR” – but R is out.  
Try “TAMAL” – no.  
Try “TAXAL” – X hasn’t been tried, but “TAXAL” is uncommon.  
Try “TAPAL” – no.  
Try “TAFAL” – no.  
Try “TAWAL” – no.

Try “TABAL” – no.  
Try “TAPIR” – but R is out.

Try “TACET” – E is out.  
Try “TACIT” – I is out.  
Try “TACKY” – K and Y are new. Valid word: T A C K L – no, needs to be 5-letter.

Try “TAZEL” – Z and E – E is out.  
Try “TAUTL” – no.  
Try “TAVAL” – no.  
Try “TAWNY” – but L is missing.  

Let’s list possible 5-letter words that fit T _ _ _ L and contain A somewhere in 2-4, without S, E, R, I.

Valid English words:  
- TUBAL – U, B, A  
- TUBAL: positions T U B A L – but A must be in 2, 3, or 4. Here A is 4th, L is 5th – that fits.  
Letters used: T (correct), A (must be present), L (correct). New letters: U, B (both untested). So this is a good candidate.

Another: TUBAL is the only common word that fits T _ _ _ L with A in 4th, and remaining letters U, B.

Hence, guess: TUBAL

So far we know:

- Pattern: T _ _ A L  
- Letters not in the word: S, E, R, I, U, B  
- Still need two letters in the 2nd and 3rd positions from the remaining unused consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels O is still possible, since O has not been tested yet, but A is already placed).

Possible consonants + vowel combos fitting T _ _ A L:

Try common consonants first.  
- T O W A L – “towal” isn’t a word.  
- T O C A L – “tocal” isn’t a word.  
- T O N A L – “tonal” is valid.  
- T O M A L – “tomal” isn’t.  
- T O P A L – “topal” isn’t.  
- T O G A L – “togal” isn’t.  
- T H A A L – “thaal” isn’t.  
- T H O A L – “thoal” isn’t.  
- T O D A L – “todal” isn’t.  
- T O M A L – nope.  
- T O N A L – yes, valid word.  
- T O C A L – nope.  
- T O K A L – nope.  
- T O W A L – nope.  

The only valid common word fitting T _ _ A L with the remaining letters is TONAL. Let’s verify letters: T, O, N, A, L. None of these were eliminated except U and B in the last step. O and N are new letters that have not been tested yet. So this is a very good candidate.
