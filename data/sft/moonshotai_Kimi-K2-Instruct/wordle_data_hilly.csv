For my first guess, I want to use a word that has common letters and good coverage to maximize information gain. Common starting words often use vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE - contains S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE - contains C, R, A, N, E
- ROAST - contains R, O, A, S, T
- AUDIO - covers many vowels
- RAISE - has R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many words, giving good information about what's in the secret word.

Feedback tells me:

- S is not in the word at all (x).  
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).  
- A, T, E are not present (x).

So the unknown word:
- contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- does not contain S, A, T, E.

Next guess should:
- keep L but move it.  
- use all-new letters except L.  
- choose common letters that are still allowed.

A good candidate set of letters left: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, K, M, P, D, G, B, F, Y, W, V, J, Q, X, Z.

A balanced word with high-frequency remaining letters could be “CHIRL” (C, H, I, R, L).  
All letters are fresh except L, which we know must move.  
L is now in position 5 instead of 2, satisfying the feedback.

Current constraints gathered from the two guesses:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x from both guesses):
   S, A, T, E, C, R

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown (– from both guesses):
   L, H, I

   - In SLATE, L was in position 2 (–) → L is not in position 2.
   - In CHIRL, L was in position 5 (–) → L is not in position 5.
   - Therefore, L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

   - In CHIRL, H was in position 2 (–) → H is not in position 2.
   - In CHIRL, I was in position 3 (–) → I is not in position 3.

3. Allowed letters (not yet used and not ruled out):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - uses only allowed letters plus at least one each of L, H, I.
   - respects all positional exclusions.
   - is a valid English word.

Looking for such a word:

- L can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- H can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Possible combinations:

- L _ I _ H → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""H"" is fifth → ""LI _ _ H"" → need two more allowed letters between I and H. But ""L I _ _ H"" would require positions 3 and 4 to be filled with allowed letters, but we need I in position 3 which is excluded (I cannot be in position 3). So this is invalid.

- _ H I _ L → ""H"" is second, but H cannot be second (from CHIRL). Invalid.

- _ I _ H L → ""I"" is second, ""H"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- H I _ _ L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is second, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- _ H _ I L → ""H"" is second (invalid), ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth (invalid). Invalid.

- L _ H _ I → ""L"" is first, ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fifth. This seems valid:
   - L in position 1 (allowed).
   - H in position 3 (allowed).
   - I in position 5 (allowed).
   - Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.

We need to pick from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting this pattern is ""LUMPI"" but ""U"" and ""M"" and ""P"" are allowed, but ""I"" is already used in position 5, and ""L"" in 1, ""H"" in 3. But ""LUMPI"" doesn't contain H. So this isn't correct.

Wait, we're constrained to use L, H, I and fill the rest with allowed letters. So the word must contain all three of L, H, I.

Let me re-express:

We know the word contains L, H, I and does not contain S, A, T, E, C, R.

Possible positions:

- L: 1, 3, 4
- H: 1, 3, 4, 5
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let's try to construct:

1. L _ _ H I → ""L"" is first, ""H"" is fourth, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 3.
   Example: ""L U N H I"" → ""LUNHI"" – not a valid word.

2. H _ L _ I → ""H"" is first, ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.
   Example: ""H U L K I"" → ""HULKI"" – not valid.

3. _ H L _ I → ""H"" is second, ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 4.
   Example: ""B H L O I"" – but ""BHL OI"" not a word.

4. _ _ H L I → ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fourth, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.
   Example: ""D O H L I"" – ""DOHLI"" – not a word.

5. H _ I _ L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

6. _ H I _ L → ""H"" is second, ""I"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

7. I _ H _ L → ""I"" is first, ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

8. I _ _ H L → ""I"" is first, ""H"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

9. _ I H _ L → ""I"" is second, ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

10. L I _ H _ → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is second, ""H"" is fourth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 3 and 5.
    Example: ""L I N H O"" – ""LINHO"" – not a word.

11. L _ I H _ → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""H"" is fourth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 2 and 5.
    Example: ""L U I H D"" – ""LUIHD"" – not a word.

12. _ L I H _ → ""L"" is second, but L cannot be second (from SLATE). Invalid.

13. _ _ L I H → ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fourth, ""H"" is fifth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.
    Example: ""B U L I H"" – ""BULIH"" – not a word.

14. _ L _ I H → ""L"" is second (invalid). Skip.

15. H _ _ I L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

16. _ H _ I L → ""H"" is second, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

17. _ _ H I L → ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

From this exhaustive check, the only plausible valid words seem elusive. Maybe we need to look for a word that uses L, H, I plus other allowed letters that form a real word.

Let me think of actual English words that use L, H, I without S, A, T, E, C, R.

Possible remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words fitting:
- ""BLIMP"" – contains B, L, I, M, P. But no H. Invalid.
- ""FLING"" – contains F, L, I, N, G. No H. Invalid.
- ""PLUMB"" – contains P, L, U, M, B. No H or I. Invalid.
- ""GULCH"" – contains G, U, L, C, H. But C is excluded. Invalid.
- ""PHLOX"" – contains P, H, L, O, X. No I. Invalid.
- ""HUMID"" – contains H, U, M, I, D. No L. Invalid.
- ""HOULD"" – not a word.
- ""PHILO"" – P, H, I, L, O. This contains P, H, I, L, O. All are allowed except we need to check if O is allowed (it is). And positions:

""PHILO"":
- P: allowed (new)
- H: position 2 – but from CHIRL, H was position 2 (–), so H cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

- ""HILUM"" – H, I, L, U, M. Valid positions:
   - H: position 1 (allowed)
   - I: position 2 (allowed)
   - L: position 3 (allowed, L cannot be 2 or 5)
   - U: allowed (new)
   - M: allowed (new)

""HILUM"" is a valid anatomical term (the scar on a seed). It fits all constraints:
- Letters: H, I, L, U, M – all allowed.
- H not in position 2 (it's 1).
- I not in position 3 (it's 2).
- L not in 2 or 5 (it's 3).

Thus, ""HILUM"" is a valid next guess.

   - In SLATE, L was in position 2 (–) → L is not in position 2.

But ""L I _ _ H"" would require positions 3 and 4 to be filled with allowed letters, but we need I in position 3 which is excluded (I cannot be in position 3). So this is invalid.

- _ H I _ L → ""H"" is second, but H cannot be second (from CHIRL). Invalid.

- _ I _ H L → ""I"" is second, ""H"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- H I _ _ L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is second, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- _ H _ I L → ""H"" is second (invalid), ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth (invalid). Invalid.

- L _ H _ I → ""L"" is first, ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fifth. This seems valid:
   - L in position 1 (allowed).
   - H in position 3 (allowed).
   - I in position 5 (allowed).
   - Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.

We need to pick from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting this pattern is ""LUMPI"" but ""U"" and ""M"" and ""P"" are allowed, but ""I"" is already used in position 5, and ""L"" in 1, ""H"" in 3. But ""LUMPI"" doesn't contain H. So this isn't correct.

Wait, we're constrained to use L, H, I and fill the rest with allowed letters. So the word must contain all three of L, H, I.

Let me re-express:

We know the word contains L, H, I and does not contain S, A, T, E, C, R.

Possible positions:

- L: 1, 3, 4
- H: 1, 3, 4, 5
- I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let's try to construct:

1. L _ _ H I → ""L"" is first, ""H"" is fourth, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 3.
   Example: ""L U N H I"" → ""LUNHI"" – not a valid word.

2. H _ L _ I → ""H"" is first, ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.
   Example: ""H U L K I"" → ""HULKI"" – not valid.

3. _ H L _ I → ""H"" is second, ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 4.
   Example: ""B H L O I"" – but ""BHL OI"" not a word.

4. _ _ H L I → ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fourth, ""I"" is fifth.
   Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.
   Example: ""D O H L I"" – ""DOHLI"" – not a word.

5. H _ I _ L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

6. _ H I _ L → ""H"" is second, ""I"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

7. I _ H _ L → ""I"" is first, ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

8. I _ _ H L → ""I"" is first, ""H"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

9. _ I H _ L → ""I"" is second, ""H"" is third, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

10. L I _ H _ → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is second, ""H"" is fourth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 3 and 5.
    Example: ""L I N H O"" – ""LINHO"" – not a word.

11. L _ I H _ → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""H"" is fourth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 2 and 5.
    Example: ""L U I H D"" – ""LUIHD"" – not a word.

12. _ L I H _ → ""L"" is second, but L cannot be second (from SLATE). Invalid.

13. _ _ L I H → ""L"" is third, ""I"" is fourth, ""H"" is fifth.
    Need allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.
    Example: ""B U L I H"" – ""BULIH"" – not a word.

14. _ L _ I H → ""L"" is second (invalid). Skip.

15. H _ _ I L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

16. _ H _ I L → ""H"" is second, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

17. _ _ H I L → ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

From this exhaustive check, the only plausible valid words seem elusive. Maybe we need to look for a word that uses L, H, I plus other allowed letters that form a real word.

Let me think of actual English words that use L, H, I without S, A, T, E, C, R.

Possible remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words fitting:
- ""BLIMP"" – contains B, L, I, M, P. But no H. Invalid.
- ""FLING"" – contains F, L, I, N, G. No H. Invalid.
- ""PLUMB"" – contains P, L, U, M, B. No H or I. Invalid.
- ""GULCH"" – contains G, U, L, C, H. But C is excluded. Invalid.
- ""PHLOX"" – contains P, H, L, O, X. No I. Invalid.
- ""HUMID"" – contains H, U, M, I, D. No L. Invalid.
- ""HOULD"" – not a word.
- ""PHILO"" – P, H, I, L, O. This contains P, H, I, L, O. All are allowed except we need to check if O is allowed (it is). And positions:

""PHILO"":
- P: allowed (new)
- H: position 2 – but from CHIRL, H was position 2 (–), so H cannot be in position 2. Invalid.

- ""HILUM"" – H, I, L, U, M. Valid positions:
   - H: position 1 (allowed)
   - I: position 2 (allowed)
   - L: position 3 (allowed, L cannot be 2 or 5)
   - U: allowed (new)
   - M: allowed (new)

""HILUM"" is a valid anatomical term (the scar on a seed). It fits all constraints:
- Letters: H, I, L, U, M – all allowed.
- H not in position 2 (it's 1).
- I not in position 3 (it's 2).
- L not in 2 or 5 (it's 3).

Thus, ""HILUM"" is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: HILUM -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) U(x) M(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,hilly,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to use a word that has common letters and good coverage to maximize information gain. Common starting words often use vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good starting word should contain several of these. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE - contains S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE - contains C, R, A, N, E
- ROAST - contains R, O, A, S, T
- AUDIO - covers many vowels
- RAISE - has R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many words, giving good information about what's in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback tells me:

- S is not in the word at all (x).  
- L is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).  
- A, T, E are not present (x).

So the unknown word:
- contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- does not contain S, A, T, E.

Next guess should:
- keep L but move it.  
- use all-new letters except L.  
- choose common letters that are still allowed.

A good candidate set of letters left: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, K, M, P, D, G, B, F, Y, W, V, J, Q, X, Z.

A balanced word with high-frequency remaining letters could be “CHIRL” (C, H, I, R, L).  
All letters are fresh except L, which we know must move.  
L is now in position 5 instead of 2, satisfying the feedback.

Other possibilities like “WORLD”, “FLING”, “GRILL” also fit, but let’s pick “CHIRL” for broad coverage.

<guess>CHIRL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHIRL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) I(-) R(x) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints gathered from the two guesses:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x from both guesses):
   S, A, T, E, C, R

2. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown (– from both guesses):
   L, H, I

   - In SLATE, L was in position 2 (–) → L is not in position 2.
   - In CHIRL, L was in position 5 (–) → L is not in position 5.
   - Therefore, L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

   - In CHIRL, H was in position 2 (–) → H is not in position 2.
   - In CHIRL, I was in position 3 (–) → I is not in position 3.

3. Allowed letters (not yet used and not ruled out):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - uses only allowed letters plus at least one each of L, H, I.
   - respects all positional exclusions.
   - is a valid English word.

Looking for such a word:

- L can be in 1, 3, or 4.
- H can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Possible combinations:

- L _ I _ H → ""L"" is first, ""I"" is third, ""H"" is fifth → ""LI _ _ H"" → need two more allowed letters between I and H. But ""L I _ _ H"" would require positions 3 and 4 to be filled with allowed letters, but we need I in position 3 which is excluded (I cannot be in position 3). So this is invalid.

- _ H I _ L → ""H"" is second, but H cannot be second (from CHIRL). Invalid.

- _ I _ H L → ""I"" is second, ""H"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- H I _ _ L → ""H"" is first, ""I"" is second, ""L"" is fifth. But L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

- _ H _ I L → ""H"" is second (invalid), ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth (invalid). Invalid.

- L _ H _ I → ""L"" is first, ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fifth. This seems valid:
   - L in position 1 (allowed).
   - H in position 3 (allowed).
   - I in position 5 (allowed).
   - Need two allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.

We need to pick from remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting this pattern is ""LUMPI"" but ""U"" and ""M"" and ""P"" are allowed, but ""I"" is already used in position 5, and ""L"" in 1, ""H"" in 3. But ""LUMPI"" doesn't contain H. So this isn't correct.

17. _ _ H I L → ""H"" is third, ""I"" is fourth, ""L"" is fifth. L cannot be fifth. Invalid.

Invalid.\n- ""PHLOX"" – contains P, H, L, O, X. No I. Invalid.\n- ""HUMID"" – contains H, U, M, I, D. No L. Invalid.\n- ""HOULD"" – not a word.\n- ""PHILO"" – P, H, I, L, O. This contains P, H, I, L, O. All are allowed except we need to check if O is allowed (it is). And positions:\n\n""PHILO"":\n- P: allowed (new)\n- H: position 2 – but from CHIRL, H was position 2 (–), so H cannot be in position 2. Invalid.\n\n- ""HILUM"" – H, I, L, U, M. Valid positions:\n   - H: position 1 (allowed)\n   - I: position 2 (allowed)\n   - L: position 3 (allowed, L cannot be 2 or 5)\n   - U: allowed (new)\n   - M: allowed (new)\n\n""HILUM"" is a valid anatomical term (the scar on a seed).

From the new feedback:

HILUM → H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) U(x) M(x)

This immediately tells us:
- The secret word is H I L _ _ (first three letters are H, I, L in order).  
- Neither U nor M appear anywhere else in the word.  
- The remaining two positions must be filled with letters that:
  – have not yet been ruled out (not S, A, T, E, C, R, U, M).  
  – are not H, I, L again (no repeats).  

Letters still allowed for positions 4 and 5:
B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We now need a 5-letter word that begins with “HIL” + any two of the allowed letters.  
Looking through English vocabulary, the only common 5-letter word starting with HIL is:

HILDO (obsolete variant of “hild”) – but this is rare.  
More likely: HILLY – but it repeats L, and we already have L in position 3, so it would be H I L L Y. A repeated letter is allowed unless the game explicitly forbids it. However, the original rules don’t prohibit repeating letters, and Y is still allowed.

Another candidate: HILUS – but S is excluded.

The only reasonably common word is HILLY. Let’s check it:
- Letters: H, I, L, L, Y  
- H, I, L are confirmed correct positions.  
- Y is allowed (hasn’t been used or ruled out).  
- L is allowed to repeat.  

Thus, HILLY fits all constraints.

A less common alternative is HILLO, but O is allowed and two Ls are fine. However, HILLY is more likely.

Given the constraints, HILLY is the best next guess.
