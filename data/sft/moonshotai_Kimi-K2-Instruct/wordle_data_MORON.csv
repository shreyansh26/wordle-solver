Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a starting word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback.

Some good starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (covers 4 vowels)
- RAISE (common letters)
- SLATE (common letters)
- CRANE (common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and includes both common vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the first feedback:
- C (1st letter) – NOT in word  
- R (2nd letter) – IN word but wrong position  
- A (3rd letter) – NOT in word  
- N (4th letter) – IN word but wrong position  
- E (5th letter) – NOT in word  

Rules deduced:
- Word does NOT contain C, A, E.  
- Word contains R and N, but neither is in the positions guessed.  
- Therefore:
  – R is not in position 2.  
  – N is not in position 4.  

Next guess should:
1. Keep letters R and N (but move them to new positions).
2. Avoid letters C, A, E.
3. Introduce new, high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet.

Good remaining vowel: I, O, U (A and E already ruled out).  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, H, M, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these:  
- Uses R and N, places them in allowed positions.  
- Uses one new vowel (I or O) and new consonants.  

Candidate: “DRINK”
- Letters: D, R, I, N, K  
- R is in position 2 → NOT allowed (feedback said R wrong at 2).

- R not in position 2 (now 2nd is R again) – still invalid.

Consolidating the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - Letters excluded: C, A, E
   - Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong positions: R, N

2. RUNTS → R(-) U(x) N(-) T(x) S(x)
   - Additional letters excluded: U, T, S
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1
   - N is still in the word but not in position 3

Confirmed facts:
- The word contains R and N (each appearing exactly once based on feedback)
- Excluded letters: C, A, E, U, T, S
- Remaining common consonants to try: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels to try: I, O

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 1 (from RUNTS)
- N cannot be in positions 4 (from CRANE) or 3 (from RUNTS)

Possible positions:
- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but must avoid 3 and 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and N exactly once each, in allowed positions
- Uses only letters from remaining pool (I, O, plus new consonants)
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, E, U, T, S)

Looking at common patterns:
- If N is in position 1, possible structures: N _ _ R _ or N _ _ _ R
- If N is in position 2: _ N _ R _ or _ N _ _ R
- If N is in position 5: _ _ _ _ N (but then R must be in 3,4)

Testing possibilities:
- N R _ _ _ → R would be in position 2 (invalid from CRANE)
- _ N R _ _ → R in position 3, N in 2 - valid
- _ N _ R _ → R in 4, N in 2 - valid
- _ N _ _ R → R in 5, N in 2 - valid
- N _ _ _ R → R in 5, N in 1 - valid

We need to pick a valid word. Let's try:
- _ N _ R _ → looking for word like _ N _ R _
- Possible letters: consonants B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y and vowels I, O
- Example: ""DINER"" - but contains E (excluded)
- ""MINOR"" - contains O, R, N. Let's check:
  - M I N O R: positions N=3 (invalid from RUNTS), R=5 - N cannot be 3
- ""FROND"" - contains O, R, N, but D might be acceptable
  - F R O N D: R=2 (invalid from CRANE)
- ""BRING"" - but G is acceptable
  - B R I N G: R=2 (invalid)
- ""GRIND"" - R=2 (invalid)
- ""PRONG"" - O=3, N=4, R=2 - R=2 invalid
- ""WRING"" - W R I N G: R=2 invalid
- Trying N in position 1:
  - N _ _ _ R: possible word ""NIGER"" - but contains E
  - ""NIDOR"" - but D and O are acceptable, but this seems rare
- Trying N in position 2:
  - _ N _ _ R: ""B N _ _ R"" - ""BONER"" - E excluded
  - ""F N _ _ R"" - ""FINER"" - E excluded
  - ""P N _ _ R"" - ""PINER"" - E excluded
  - ""M N _ _ R"" - ""MINER"" - E excluded
- Trying N in position 5:
  - _ _ _ _ N: then R must be in 3 or 4
  - _ _ R _ N: R=3, N=5 - valid
  - Possible words: ""BRION"" - but O and I together unlikely
  - ""DRAIN"" - A excluded, I included
  - ""GRAIN"" - A excluded
  - ""BRINK"" - K acceptable
    - B R I N K: R=2 (invalid from CRANE)
  - ""DRINK"" - R=2 invalid
  - ""FRISK"" - S excluded
  - ""PRIMO"" - O=4, but M acceptable
  - ""PRION"" - O=4, I=2, N=5, R=1 (invalid from RUNTS)
  
After careful consideration, a valid candidate is ""BRING"":
- Letters: B, R, I, N, G
- B - new consonant
- R - position 2 (invalid from CRANE feedback)
Oops, that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""FROND"":
- F, R, O, N, D
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""DRINK"":
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""PRONG"":
- P, R, O, N, G
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""WRONG"":
- W, R, O, N, G
- R=2 - invalid

Realizing issue: R cannot be in position 2, and in most common words R appears early. Need words with R not in 1 or 2.

Let's try N in position 1:
- N _ _ _ R: possible ""NIGOR"" - but seems obscure
- ""NIDOR"" - obscure
- Not ideal

Alternative approach: look for R in position 3,4
- R=3: _ _ R _ N
  - Possible: ""BRORN"" - invalid
  - ""MORON"" - O=2, R=3, O=4, N=5 - valid, but uses O twice
  - ""LORAN"" - A excluded
  - ""GORAN"" - no
  - ""HORAN"" - no
- R=4: _ _ _ R N
  - Possible: ""BURIN"" - U excluded
  - ""MORIN"" - valid word
    - M O R I N: positions:
      - M - new
      - O - new vowel
      - R - position 3 (valid from previous feedback)
      - I - new
      - N - position 5 (valid from previous feedback)
    - Excluded letters: C,A,E,U,T,S not present
    - This seems valid

Therefore, ""MORIN"" is a good next guess.

- R can be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but must avoid 3 and 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and N exactly once each, in allowed positions
- Uses only letters from remaining pool (I, O, plus new consonants)
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, E, U, T, S)

Looking at common patterns:
- If N is in position 1, possible structures: N _ _ R _ or N _ _ _ R
- If N is in position 2: _ N _ R _ or _ N _ _ R
- If N is in position 5: _ _ _ _ N (but then R must be in 3,4)

Testing possibilities:
- N R _ _ _ → R would be in position 2 (invalid from CRANE)
- _ N R _ _ → R in position 3, N in 2 - valid
- _ N _ R _ → R in 4, N in 2 - valid
- _ N _ _ R → R in 5, N in 2 - valid
- N _ _ _ R → R in 5, N in 1 - valid

We need to pick a valid word. Let's try:
- _ N _ R _ → looking for word like _ N _ R _
- Possible letters: consonants B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y and vowels I, O
- Example: ""DINER"" - but contains E (excluded)
- ""MINOR"" - contains O, R, N. Let's check:
  - M I N O R: positions N=3 (invalid from RUNTS), R=5 - N cannot be 3
- ""FROND"" - contains O, R, N, but D might be acceptable
  - F R O N D: R=2 (invalid from CRANE)
- ""BRING"" - but G is acceptable
  - B R I N G: R=2 (invalid)
- ""GRIND"" - R=2 (invalid)
- ""PRONG"" - O=3, N=4, R=2 - R=2 invalid
- ""WRING"" - W R I N G: R=2 invalid
- Trying N in position 1:
  - N _ _ _ R: possible word ""NIGER"" - but contains E
  - ""NIDOR"" - but D and O are acceptable, but this seems rare
- Trying N in position 2:
  - _ N _ _ R: ""B N _ _ R"" - ""BONER"" - E excluded
  - ""F N _ _ R"" - ""FINER"" - E excluded
  - ""P N _ _ R"" - ""PINER"" - E excluded
  - ""M N _ _ R"" - ""MINER"" - E excluded
- Trying N in position 5:
  - _ _ _ _ N: then R must be in 3 or 4
  - _ _ R _ N: R=3, N=5 - valid
  - Possible words: ""BRION"" - but O and I together unlikely
  - ""DRAIN"" - A excluded, I included
  - ""GRAIN"" - A excluded
  - ""BRINK"" - K acceptable
    - B R I N K: R=2 (invalid from CRANE)
  - ""DRINK"" - R=2 invalid
  - ""FRISK"" - S excluded
  - ""PRIMO"" - O=4, but M acceptable
  - ""PRION"" - O=4, I=2, N=5, R=1 (invalid from RUNTS)
  
After careful consideration, a valid candidate is ""BRING"":
- Letters: B, R, I, N, G
- B - new consonant
- R - position 2 (invalid from CRANE feedback)
Oops, that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""FROND"":
- F, R, O, N, D
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""DRINK"":
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""PRONG"":
- P, R, O, N, G
- R=2 - invalid

Next: ""WRONG"":
- W, R, O, N, G
- R=2 - invalid

Realizing issue: R cannot be in position 2, and in most common words R appears early. Need words with R not in 1 or 2.

Let's try N in position 1:
- N _ _ _ R: possible ""NIGOR"" - but seems obscure
- ""NIDOR"" - obscure
- Not ideal

Alternative approach: look for R in position 3,4
- R=3: _ _ R _ N
  - Possible: ""BRORN"" - invalid
  - ""MORON"" - O=2, R=3, O=4, N=5 - valid, but uses O twice
  - ""LORAN"" - A excluded
  - ""GORAN"" - no
  - ""HORAN"" - no
- R=4: _ _ _ R N
  - Possible: ""BURIN"" - U excluded
  - ""MORIN"" - valid word
    - M O R I N: positions:
      - M - new
      - O - new vowel
      - R - position 3 (valid from previous feedback)
      - I - new
      - N - position 5 (valid from previous feedback)
    - Excluded letters: C,A,E,U,T,S not present
    - This seems valid

Therefore, ""MORIN"" is a good next guess.",Guess 3: MORIN -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,MORON,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a starting word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback.

Some good starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (covers 4 vowels)
- RAISE (common letters)
- SLATE (common letters)
- CRANE (common letters)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and includes both common vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback:
- C (1st letter) – NOT in word  
- R (2nd letter) – IN word but wrong position  
- A (3rd letter) – NOT in word  
- N (4th letter) – IN word but wrong position  
- E (5th letter) – NOT in word  

Rules deduced:
- Word does NOT contain C, A, E.  
- Word contains R and N, but neither is in the positions guessed.  
- Therefore:
  – R is not in position 2.  
  – N is not in position 4.  

Next guess should:
1. Keep letters R and N (but move them to new positions).
2. Avoid letters C, A, E.
3. Introduce new, high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven't tried yet.

Good remaining vowel: I, O, U (A and E already ruled out).  
Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, P, H, M, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these:  
- Uses R and N, places them in allowed positions.  
- Uses one new vowel (I or O) and new consonants.  

Candidate: “DRINK”
- Letters: D, R, I, N, K  
- R is in position 2 → NOT allowed (feedback said R wrong at 2).  
  So “DRINK” is invalid.

Candidate: “PRION”
- Letters: P, R, I, O, N  
- R not in position 2 (now 2nd is R again) – still invalid.

Candidate: “TRUNK”
- Letters: T, R, U, N, K  
- R is in position 2 – again invalid.

Candidate: “IRONS”
- Uses I, R, O, N, S  
- R is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “FRONT”
- Letters: F, R, O, N, T  
- R is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “TURNS”
- Does NOT contain R – invalid (we must include R).

Candidate: “RUNTS”
- R in 1st position (allowed), N in 3rd position (allowed).  
- Contains U (new vowel) and T, S (new consonants).  
- No C, A, E.  
- Valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, “RUNTS” is a good next guess.

2. RUNTS → R(-) U(x) N(-) T(x) S(x)

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (from CRANE) or 1 (from RUNTS)

- MORON – but second O is already fixed in position 2, and we’d need a different vowel or consonant in position 4.  
Wait – “MORON” has O in position 4, but we already have O fixed in position 2. That’s impossible because a letter can’t appear twice with such specific placement.  
Ah – but “MORON” has O twice (positions 2 and 4). However, the feedback for position 4 (I) was marked “x”, meaning I is not in the word at all. It doesn’t preclude O appearing again, but since position 2 is already O, position 4 must be a different letter.  

Valid English 5-letter word matching M O R _ N:

- MORPH – but ends with H, not N.  
- MORAL – ends with L, not N.  
- MORON – ends with N, has O in position 2 and 4 – but O is allowed to appear twice.  
""MORON"" is the only common word fitting M O R _ N.  

Therefore, the next guess must be MORON.
