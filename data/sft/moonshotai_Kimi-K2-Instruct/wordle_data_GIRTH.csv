This is my first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a 5-letter word that can help me gather maximum information about the letters in the secret word. 

A good strategy for the first guess is to pick a word that:
1. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Is a valid 5-letter word

Some good candidates would be words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""SLATE"" stands out because:
- It has 5 unique letters
- It includes common vowels A and E
- It includes common consonants S, L, T
- It's a common word that's easy to remember

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (5th letter): _ _ _ _ T
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in T and does not contain S, L, A, or E.  
Next I need to test a new set of 5 unique letters, avoiding S, L, A, E, and keeping T in the 5th spot. Good consonants to test next would be R, N, C, D, etc., and vowels I, O, U, Y.

A word like “PRINT” would test P, R, I, N while keeping T fixed at the end—but T is already confirmed as the 5th letter, and we don’t care about the 5th position any further. However, “PRINT” would use P, R, I, N, T, all untested so far except T. Another option is “BRING” but G hasn’t been tested either.

A simpler high-information word that fits the constraints is “TORCH” – but it has H which is moderately common. Or “RIGHT” – but again H. 

Looking for a word that:
- Has T last
- Uses 5 distinct letters, none of S, L, A, E
- Uses common remaining vowels (I, O, U)

A good candidate is “FRUIT”: F, R, U, I, T. This tests F, R, U, I while keeping T fixed.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

   - R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4.
   - T is already fixed at position 5.

So our pattern is: _ _ _ _ T

- contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (not 2),
- contains I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5),

Looking for common 5-letter words meeting these constraints:
- R must appear once (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- I must appear once (positions 1, 2, or 3)
- No repeats and no forbidden letters

Possible candidates:
– RIGHT: H not yet ruled out, but I would be in position 4 (forbidden).  
– DIRTY: uses D, I, R, T, Y.  D, R, I, Y all still possible.  I in position 2 is allowed, R in position 3 is allowed.  Y is still allowed.  
– BRISK: S and K ruled out/in question, plus B.  
– GRIT_: need 5th letter T, so GRITT invalid (double T).  
– TRICK: C, K still allowed, but I in position 3, R in position 2 (position 2 for R is forbidden).

DIRTY seems to fit all constraints:
- ends with T ✓  
- letters D, I, R, T, Y — none of S, L, A, E, F, U ✓  
- R is in position 3 (allowed) ✓

Possible candidates:
– RIGHT: H not yet ruled out, but I would be in position 4 (forbidden).  
– DIRTY: uses D, I, R, T, Y.  D, R, I, Y all still possible.  I in position 2 is allowed, R in position 3 is allowed.  Y is still allowed.  
– BRISK: S and K ruled out/in question, plus B.  
– GRIT_: need 5th letter T, so GRITT invalid (double T).  
– TRICK: C, K still allowed, but I in position 3, R in position 2 (position 2 for R is forbidden).

DIRTY seems to fit all constraints:
- ends with T ✓  
- letters D, I, R, T, Y — none of S, L, A, E, F, U ✓  
- R is in position 3 (allowed) ✓  
- I is in position 2 (allowed) ✓

Hence DIRTY is the next best informative guess.

Let's digest the new feedback from DIRTY:

- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is now in the correct position (2nd letter).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is now in the correct position (3rd letter).
- T(✓) → T is in the correct position (5th letter).
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

So the secret word pattern so far is: _ I R _ T, and we have already excluded the letters:
S, L, A, E, F, U, D, Y.

We now need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters that have not been excluded.
Remaining available consonants include: B, C, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, Z (and possibly others), but we should pick common ones first.

We are looking for a 5-letter English word of the form ? I R ? T.

Possible candidates:
- BIRTH → fits pattern and uses only allowed letters.
- CIVET → but V is still allowed, but second letter I is correct, third letter R is correct, fifth letter T is correct, so CIVET would be C I R E T, but E is already excluded. So CIVET is invalid due to E.
- GIRTH → fits pattern and letters are all allowed (G, I, R, T, H).
- MIRTH → same as GIRTH but with M.
- THIRD → but H is allowed, but the pattern would be T H I R D, but D is excluded. So THIRD is invalid due to D.
- VIRTU → but U is excluded.

Between GIRTH and MIRTH, both fit. GIRTH seems slightly more common as a word, so I'll choose that.
