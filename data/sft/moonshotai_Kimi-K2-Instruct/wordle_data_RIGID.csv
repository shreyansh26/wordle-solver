For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they contain frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Current confirmed facts:
- Letters that must appear: I (in position 4), D (in position 5)
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R (from previous “-” marks)
- Letters that are not in the word at all: A, O, S, E, P, N, T, U
- So far we have the pattern: _ _ _ I D with R still to place.

Positions that remain open: 1, 2, 3  
R has never been tried in position 3; let’s try it there first, and pick two fresh letters from the remaining pool (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A simple, common word that fits _ _ R I D is “C R I E D”, but E is already out.  
Another is “B R I D _” but we already have D at 5.  
A valid option that keeps R in position 3, introduces two new letters, and keeps the known I-D ending is “FRIGID” — but that’s 6 letters.  

Next best: “GRID_” — but we need 5 letters.  
A 5-letter word that places R in position 3, uses only as-yet untested letters, and completes the pattern _ _ R I D is “HURID” but U is out.  

Instead, use R in position 3 and choose new consonants for 1 and 2.  
A clean candidate is “BRIGID” (again too long).  

Let’s try “GRIND” – but N is already out.  
“GRAID” – A and U are out.  
“FRIED” – E is out.  

A workable 5-letter pattern: C R I _ D → “CRIED” (E out).  

We need a fresh consonant pair for positions 1 and 2, while keeping R in 3 and I-D fixed in 4-5.  
A valid word fitting _ _ R I D: “HORID” – O and U out.  

Next thinkable word: “LURID” – U out.  

“MIRID” – real word? Not common.  
“TRIED” – T out.  

We must accept R cannot be in position 3 after all, because every 5-letter _ _ R I D tried uses a banned letter.  
Move R to position 1 instead, since it has never been tried there:

Pattern: R _ _ I D  
A real word: “RABID” – A is out.  
“RIGID” – G and I: I already placed, G is new.  
“RIGID” is 5 letters, uses R in position 1 (never tested), G in 2, I fixed in 4, D fixed in 5, and only introduces G and the second I (but I is already known).  

This satisfies the constraints and tests R in position 1.

<guess>RIGID</guess>",RIGID,"Current confirmed facts:
- Letters that must appear: I (in position 4), D (in position 5)
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R (from previous “-” marks)
- Letters that are not in the word at all: A, O, S, E, P, N, T, U
- So far we have the pattern: _ _ _ I D with R still to place.

Positions that remain open: 1, 2, 3  
R has never been tried in position 3; let’s try it there first, and pick two fresh letters from the remaining pool (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A simple, common word that fits _ _ R I D is “C R I E D”, but E is already out.  
Another is “B R I D _” but we already have D at 5.
