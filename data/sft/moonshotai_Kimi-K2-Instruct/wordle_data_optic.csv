For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters. Since I have no prior information, a good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 3 vowels and common consonants)
- SLATE (common letters)
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Let’s decode the feedback:

C(-) – the letter C is in the word but in a different position (not position 1)
R(x) – the letter R is NOT in the word at all
A(x) – the letter A is NOT in the word at all
N(x) – the letter N is NOT in the word at all
E(x) – the letter E is NOT in the word at all

So the hidden word contains the letter C somewhere, but definitely lacks R, A, N, E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- uses C somewhere other than first position
- does NOT contain R, A, N, E
- is still composed of common letters to maximize information

Good consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y  
Good vowel left: I, O, U (A and E are excluded)

Let’s try a word that keeps C and introduces new common letters.  
Option 1: STOIC – but it doesn’t use C.  
Option 2: CLOUD – uses C and common letters, positions C in spot 1 (but C must NOT be in spot 1).  
Option 3: STOCK – C is in spot 4, does not use R, A, N, E. Looks good.

So my next guess is STOCK.

Let's break down all constraints so far:

Letters we KNOW are in the word (and their clues):
- C must appear somewhere (from CRANE and STOCK) — but not in position 1, 4, 5 (because in CRANE it was in 1 and marked “-”, in STOCK it was in 4 and marked “-”, and in TOPIC it’s in 5 and marked “✓”).  
  Therefore C is in position 5.

- T must appear (from STOCK and TOPIC) — not in position 2 (STOCK) and not in position 1 (TOPIC), so T must be in position 3 or 4.

- O must appear — not in position 3 (STOCK) and not in position 2 (TOPIC), so O must be in position 1 or 4.

- I is confirmed in position 4 (from TOPIC feedback I(✓)).

- P is in the word (from TOPIC feedback P(-)) but not in position 3, so P must be in position 1 or 2.

Letters banned entirely: R, A, N, E, S, K, plus any letter never guessed yet that we have no evidence for.

Current skeleton (positions 1-5):

_ _ _ I C   (because C is fixed in 5)

We still need:
- T must be placed in 3 or 4, but 4 is I, so T must be in 3.

- O must be placed in 1 or 4, but 4 is I, so O must be in 1.

- P must be placed in 1 or 2, but 1 is O, so P must be in 2.

That gives: O P T I C

All constraints satisfied:
- C in 5 ✓
- T in 3 ✓
- O in 1 ✓
- I in 4 ✓
- P in 2 ✓
- No banned letters used.
