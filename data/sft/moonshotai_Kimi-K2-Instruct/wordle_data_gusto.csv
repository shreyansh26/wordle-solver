For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word, as well as some common consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, L, N.

Common words for first guesses include:
- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- SLATE (uses common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (balanced with common letters)
- AUDIO (uses 4 vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st letter).
- L, A, and E are NOT in the word.
- T is in the word and in the correct 4th position ( _ _ _ T _ ).

We now know:
- The word has no L, A, or E.
- It has an S, but S is not in position 1.
- T is fixed in position 4.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps T in position 4.
- Includes S in a different position (positions 2, 3, or 5).
- Uses new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like R, O, I, N, C, U, etc.).

A good candidate that fits the pattern _ _ _ T _ and includes S in a new position (e.g., 2nd or 3rd) is ""ROUST"":
- R (new letter)
- O (new vowel)
- U (new vowel)
- S (already confirmed in word, not in position 1)
- T (fixed in position 4)

However, ""ROUST"" would place S in position 5, which is valid since we know S is not in position 1. Alternatively, ""CRUST"" or ""TRUST"" could work, but ""TRUST"" would put S in position 5 and T in position 1 (which isn't ruled out yet, though T is already fixed in position 4). 

""ROUST"" seems like a strong choice because it introduces new letters (R, O, U) while repositioning S and maintaining T in position 4.

Another option is ""BURST"" or ""CRUST"", but ""ROUST"" covers more new letters. 

I’ll go with ""ROUST"".
