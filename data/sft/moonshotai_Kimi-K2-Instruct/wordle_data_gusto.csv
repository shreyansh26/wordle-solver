Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. 

Among 5-letter words, those that include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) are good starting points. A very popular first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination of letters gives us good coverage to potentially reveal multiple letters or their positions in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(x) – L is not in the word  
- A(x) – A is not in the word  
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in position 4  
- E(x) – E is not in the word  

So we know:
1. The word contains S and T (T definitely in position 4).  
2. Letters L, A, E are excluded.  
3. S is not the first letter.  
4. We still need 3 more letters (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) chosen from remaining common consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.

A good next guess will:
- Keep T in position 4  
- Re-use S in a different spot (not first)  
- Introduce new common consonants/vowels like I, O, R, N, C, H, etc.

The word “STORM” immediately comes to mind:
- S placed in position 1: but feedback says S is not at position 1, so that slot is bad.  
Instead, try shifting S: e.g., “ROIST” is invalid because T isn’t in position 4.  
Better: choose a word with T fixed at position 4, S not at position 1, and new letters to test.

Possible candidates: “FIRST”, “BURST”, “WORST”, “CRUST”, etc. They all keep T at position 4, place S elsewhere, and test new letters.

Among these, “CRUST” introduces C, R, U – all frequent letters we haven’t tested yet, and keeps T at position 4 while placing S in position 5 (allowed since S is not excluded from position 5).

Let’s catalog the information we now have:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (from SLATE: S(-) and CRUST: S(-))
- T (from SLATE: T(✓) → T is in the word and is in position 4)
- U (from CRUST: U(-))
- S (from CRUST: S(-) confirms S is not in position 5; earlier S(-) in SLATE confirms S is not in position 1)
- T(-) in CRUST is impossible (T was already ✓ in SLATE), so the only possibilities are that the feedback was mis-typed or that the CRUST feedback is actually: C(x), R(x), U(-), S(-), T(✓). Since the problem statement says T(-), I will assume it's a typo and it should be T(✓). Therefore, T is in position 4.

Letters known NOT in the word:
- L, A, E (from SLATE)
- C, R (from CRUST)

Positions:
- T is in position 4 (from SLATE: T(✓))
- S is not in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE and CRUST)
- So S must be in position 2 or 3
- U is in the word but not in position 3 (from CRUST: U(-)), so U must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 3). We also know T is in 4. So possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 5.

We need a word that:
- has T in position 4
- has S in position 2 or 3
- has U somewhere (not position 3, and not conflicting with S or T)
- avoids letters L, A, E, C, R
- is a valid 5-letter English word

Let's brainstorm:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ T _
  - U must go in 1 or 5
  - Try U _ S T _ → but we have only 3 letters left. Need to fill positions 1, 3, 5. But U must be in 1 or 5. Let's try U in 1:

    - US_T_ → USIT_? Not a word. USNT_? Not a word. USOT_? Not a word.
    - US_T_ is hard to form. Maybe USHT_ → USHT? Not a word.
  - Try U in 5: _ S _ T U

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters. This maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. 

Among 5-letter words, those that include vowels (especially A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) are good starting points. A very popular first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination of letters gives us good coverage to potentially reveal multiple letters or their positions in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(x) – L is not in the word  
- A(x) – A is not in the word  
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in position 4  
- E(x) – E is not in the word  

So we know:
1. The word contains S and T (T definitely in position 4).  
2. Letters L, A, E are excluded.  
3. S is not the first letter.  
4. We still need 3 more letters (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) chosen from remaining common consonants/vowels not yet ruled out.

A good next guess will:
- Keep T in position 4  
- Re-use S in a different spot (not first)  
- Introduce new common consonants/vowels like I, O, R, N, C, H, etc.

The word “STORM” immediately comes to mind:
- S placed in position 1: but feedback says S is not at position 1, so that slot is bad.  
Instead, try shifting S: e.g., “ROIST” is invalid because T isn’t in position 4.  
Better: choose a word with T fixed at position 4, S not at position 1, and new letters to test.

Possible candidates: “FIRST”, “BURST”, “WORST”, “CRUST”, etc. They all keep T at position 4, place S elsewhere, and test new letters.

Among these, “CRUST” introduces C, R, U – all frequent letters we haven’t tested yet, and keeps T at position 4 while placing S in position 5 (allowed since S is not excluded from position 5).

<guess>CRUST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CRUST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(-) S(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s catalog the information we now have:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (from SLATE: S(-) and CRUST: S(-))
- T (from SLATE: T(✓) → T is in the word and is in position 4)
- U (from CRUST: U(-))
- S (from CRUST: S(-) confirms S is not in position 5; earlier S(-) in SLATE confirms S is not in position 1)
- T(-) in CRUST is impossible (T was already ✓ in SLATE), so the only possibilities are that the feedback was mis-typed or that the CRUST feedback is actually: C(x), R(x), U(-), S(-), T(✓). Since the problem statement says T(-), I will assume it's a typo and it should be T(✓). Therefore, T is in position 4.

Letters known NOT in the word:
- L, A, E (from SLATE)
- C, R (from CRUST)

Positions:
- T is in position 4 (from SLATE: T(✓))
- S is not in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE and CRUST)
- So S must be in position 2 or 3
- U is in the word but not in position 3 (from CRUST: U(-)), so U must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 3). We also know T is in 4. So possible positions for U: 1, 2, or 5.

We need a word that:
- has T in position 4
- has S in position 2 or 3
- has U somewhere (not position 3, and not conflicting with S or T)
- avoids letters L, A, E, C, R
- is a valid 5-letter English word

Let's brainstorm:
- If S is in position 2: _ S _ T _
  - U must go in 1 or 5
  - Try U _ S T _ → but we have only 3 letters left. Need to fill positions 1, 3, 5. But U must be in 1 or 5. Let's try U in 1:
    - U S _ T _ → need letters for 3 and 5. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Common ones: I, N, O, etc.
    - US_T_ → USIT_? Not a word. USNT_? Not a word. USOT_? Not a word.
    - US_T_ is hard to form. Maybe USHT_ → USHT? Not a word.
  - Try U in 5: _ S _ T U
    - _ S _ T U → need letters for 1 and 3. Common: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, etc.
    - Possible: BUST_ already used. O S _ T U → OSPTU? Not a word. H S _ T U? Not a word.
    - Maybe P S _ T U → not a word.
    - D S _ T U → D S I T U → ""DSITU""? Not a word.
    - This path seems hard.

- If S is in position 3: _ _ S T _
  - U must be in 1, 2, or 5
  - T is in 4, S in 3
  - Let's try U in 1: U _ S T _ → need letters for 2 and 5
    - U I S T _ → UIST_? Not common. U N S T _ → UNST_? Not a word.
    - U O S T _ → UOST_? Not a word.
    - U P S T _ → UPST_? Not a word.
    - U B S T _ → UBST_? Not a word.
  - Try U in 2: _ U S T _ → need letters for 1 and 5
    - B U S T _ → BUST_ → BUSTS? But S is already in 3, so BUSTS has two S's. Not likely.
    - D U S T _ → DUST_ → DUSTY? But Y is allowed. DUSTY: D, U, S, T, Y
      - Check constraints: T is in 4 (yes), S is in 3 (yes), U is in 2 (yes), letters not excluded (D, Y are allowed), no L, A, E, C, R. Seems valid.
    - DUSTY meets all criteria:
      - T in position 4
      - S in position 3
      - U in position 2 (not 3, as required)
      - letters D, U, S, T, Y: none are excluded
      - valid English word

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)

   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - L, A, E are not in the word
