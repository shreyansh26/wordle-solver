For the first guess, I should choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Good first guesses often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""STARE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: S, T, R
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about the presence/absence of these five letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- T is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word is S _ _ _ _, and it contains T and A somewhere after the first letter. It does not contain R or E.

My next guess should:
1. Keep S in the first position.
2. Include T and A in new positions (positions 2-5).
3. Avoid R and E completely.
4. Introduce new letters to test.

Possible letters to try next (excluding R, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I need a word that starts with S, uses T and A, and ideally tests new common letters. Looking at options:
- SATIN: S A T I N - but A is in position 2, T in 3
- STAIN: S T A I N - but T is in position 2 (same as before), A in 3
- STAND: S T A N D - same T position issue
- STOAT: S T O A T - T appears twice
- SWATH: S W A T H - looks good, tests W and H

Let's go with SWATH:
- S in correct position 1
- T in new position 4 (was 2)
- A in new position 3 (was 3 - actually same position, not optimal)
Hmm, A would still be in position 3.

Better option: SLANT
- S in correct position 1
- L and N are new letters
- A in position 2 (moved from 3)
- T in position 4 (moved from 2)

This seems better as it moves both T and A to new positions while introducing L and N.

Summary of what we know so far:

Secret word: S _ _ T _

Letters confirmed:
- S is first (position 1) – ✓
- T is fifth (position 5) – ✓

Letters that exist but are misplaced:
- L is somewhere in positions 2-4 – (-)
- A is somewhere in positions 2-4 – (-)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R (from guess 1)
- E (from guess 1)
- N (from guess 2)

So the pattern is S _ _ T _, and the missing letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding R, E, N. We also know L and A must appear in positions 2-4.

We need a word that fits:
- S _ _ T _
- Uses A and L in positions 2-4
- Doesn’t repeat any known wrong letters (R, E, N)
- Uses valid English word

Possible candidates:
- SALTY – but Y is new; check if valid
- SLATE – but E is excluded
- SLANT – already tried, N excluded
- SLOAT – but O and A together, and T already used at position 5
- SPALT – not a common word
- SALTY – S A L T Y – positions: S(1) A(2) L(3) T(5) Y(4) – but T is already at position 5, so this would duplicate T
Wait, the word must have exactly one T at position 5 – so T appears only once.

Instead, SALTY has T at position 4 – no good.

Let me try: SPLAT
- S P L A T – positions: S(1) P(?) L(?) A(?) T(5) – this would imply:
  - P, L, A must occupy positions 2-4
  - T is at 5 – correct
  - L and A are allowed in any of 2-4
  - No R, E, N involved
  - SPLAT is a valid word

This seems like the best next guess.
