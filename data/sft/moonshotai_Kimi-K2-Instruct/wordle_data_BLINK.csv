- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a 5-letter word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback, as these letters are more likely to appear in the secret word. Common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels include E, A, I, O, U. 

A good starting word should have a mix of these common consonants and vowels. One such word is ""AROSE,"" which contains:
- A, a common vowel.
- R, a common consonant.
- O, another common vowel.
- S, a common consonant.
- E, the most common vowel.

This combination covers a broad range of frequently used letters, increasing the chances of hitting some correct letters in the secret word.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.
