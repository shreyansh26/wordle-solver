This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained, which typically means using common letters in strategic positions. Among the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A good starting word should contain several of these common letters to help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at the options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E

- I( x ) – I is NOT in the word.
- S( x ) – S is NOT in the word.

We want a new word that:
- Uses the known letter A (but not in position 2).
- Avoids the eliminated letters R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common consonants (like T, N, L, D, etc.) to gather more information.

A common strategy is to pick a word with new letters while including A in a different position. Possibilities: PLANT, MOUNT, TALON, ADULT, ABOUT, ALOFT, etc.

Let’s choose a word that:
- Keeps A but moves it to position 1.
- Introduces new common consonants (T, L, N, etc.).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R, I, S, E are ruled out.

2. ADULT → A(-) D(x) U(x) L(x) T(x)
   - A is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (it was in position 1 here and marked “-”).
   - D, U, L, T are all ruled out.

Therefore we now know:
- The word must contain A, and it cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- The set of eliminated letters so far: R, I, S, E, D, U, L, T.
- Remaining common consonants to test: N, C, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, etc.
- Vowels left (besides A): O, Y sometimes acts as a vowel.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A at positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Avoids all the 8 letters already ruled out.
- Uses fresh letters to maximize information.

Candidate choices:
- CANNY – C, A, N, N, Y (but N is repeated)
- AMONG – but O and G are allowed, but A is first, which we know is wrong.
- FANCY – F, A, N, C, Y; A is third → possible.
- CABIN – A is second (ruled out).
- COACH – A is third, but D and U ruled out, C and H are fresh.

Let’s pick “COACH” because:

- Uses new letters C, O, H (none disallowed yet).
- Quick to test these new letters.

Current constraints gathered from all feedback:

1. Letters known to be in the word (with positions):
   - A is in position 3 (COACH gave A ✓ in slot 3).

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A is confirmed at slot 3, so earlier “-” for A in slots 1 & 2 is consistent.
   - C appears twice in COACH: first C got “-” (wrong position), second C got “✓” (correct position) → this is impossible for a single word!  
     Realization: the second C must actually be the one in position 4 (since position 5 is H), so position 4 is C.

   Therefore:
   - Word pattern: _ _ A C _
   - C must appear elsewhere, but NOT in position 1 (from first C getting “-”).

3. Eliminated letters (x so far):
   - R, I, S, E, D, U, L, T, O, H.

4. Remaining common letters to test:
   - Vowels: only A is used; Y might act as vowel.
   - Consonants left: N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y, W, X, Z (plus second C which we know exists).

5. We need a 5-letter word fitting: _ _ A C _ , containing C somewhere besides position 4 (already fixed), and avoiding all eliminated letters. Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.

Let’s list possible fits:
- N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y could fill 1,2,5.
- Must also include C somewhere among 1,2,5, but NOT in 1 (from feedback).
   – So C must be in 2 or 5.

Candidate words:
- If C is in 2: _ C A C _ → need one more letter for 1 and 5, but C already used twice – not possible in standard Wordle.
- Therefore C must be in 5: _ _ A C C → but then pattern is _ _ A C C.

Possible words ending in ACC:
- BACCA – archaic, not common.
- MACCA – slang/nickname, not valid.
- YACCA – obscure.
- NACCA – not a word.
- GAMAC – no.
- PANIC – no C in 5.
- Actually, common words ending in ACC: none in standard lists.

Realization: maybe C is only once in word, and the duplicated C interpretation misled us. Re-read:

COACH feedback:
- C(-) in position 1 → C exists but not in 1.
- A(✓) in 3.
- C(✓) in position 4 → so word has C in 4 and another C elsewhere (but impossible in a typical 5-letter word). This contradiction implies I mis-parsed feedback.

Correct parsing: positions are 1-5 left-to-right. In COACH:
- C (1): -
- O (2): x
- A (3): ✓
- C (4): ✓
- H (5): -

Hence pattern: _ _ A C _ (positions 1,2,5 unknown), with constraints:
- C must appear somewhere besides 1 (from first C “-”), and we now know it's in 4.
- So word has at least one C at 4.
- Eliminated letters: R I S E D U L T O H (and A is fixed at 3).

Thus word form: [1] [2] A C [5], avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible consonants for 1,2,5: N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y, W, X, Z.

We need real words fitting _ _ A C _ with those letters.

Examples:
- N and G: NAGAC – none.
- B and N: BANAC – no.
- B and Y: BYACC – no.

- WHACK – W H A C K
- QUACK – Q U A C K (U eliminated)
- SHACK – S, H (both eliminated)
- CHACK – C, H (both eliminated)
- GNASH – no.

From remaining letters:
- B, L, A, C, K: BLACK – all letters allowed (B, L, K not yet eliminated).
- W, H, A, C, K: WHACK – but H is eliminated (feedback: H(-) means H is in word but wrong position, but we have H only in 5 and feedback gave H(-) – meaning H exists but not at 5 → contradiction because only slot 5 left for H. So H must be in word elsewhere, but positions 1-4 rules:
   – H cannot be in 5, must be in 1,2, or 4, but 4 is C. So H must be 1 or 2.
   – Then word would be H _ A C _ or _ H A C _.
   – Possible: H P A C Y – no word.
   – H M A C K – not a word.
   – H N A C K – not a word.
   – H A C C – impossible.

Thus BLACK seems only viable among common words.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" covers A, D, I, E, U

""RAISE"" seems strong because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters without repeating any, giving good coverage. It also tests the positions of these letters efficiently.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
2. The letters R, I, S, E are ruled out entirely.
3. The remaining letters to try should avoid R, I, S, E.

We still have 25 – 5 = 20 letters to consider: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we already know A is present).

We want a new word that:
- Uses the known letter A (but not in position 2).
- Avoids the eliminated letters R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common consonants (like T, N, L, D, etc.) to gather more information.

A common strategy is to pick a word with new letters while including A in a different position. Possibilities: PLANT, MOUNT, TALON, ADULT, ABOUT, ALOFT, etc.

Let’s choose a word that:
- Keeps A but moves it to position 1.
- Introduces new common consonants (T, L, N, etc.).

“ADULT” contains A, D, U, L, T – none of which are eliminated (except A is confirmed). This tests D, U, L, T and keeps A in position 1. If any of D/U/L/T are in the word, we’ll get new hits.

- B and N: BANAC – no.
- B and Y: BYACC – no.
- M and B: MBAC_ – not possible.
- F and Y: FYAC_ – no.

Looking at actual word lists, common words fitting _ _ A C _:
- BLACK – B L A C K
- SNACK – S (eliminated)
- CRACK – C (eliminated), R
- TRACK – T (eliminated), R
- WHACK – W H A C K
- QUACK – Q U A C K (U eliminated)
- SHACK – S, H (both eliminated)
- CHACK – C, H (both eliminated)
- GNASH – no.

From remaining letters:
- B, L, A, C, K: BLACK – all letters allowed (B, L, K not yet eliminated).
- W, H, A, C, K: WHACK – but H is eliminated (feedback: H(-) means H is in word but wrong position, but we have H only in 5 and feedback gave H(-) – meaning H exists but not at 5 → contradiction because only slot 5 left for H. So H must be in word elsewhere, but positions 1-4 rules:
   – H cannot be in 5, must be in 1,2, or 4, but 4 is C. So H must be 1 or 2.
   – Then word would be H _ A C _ or _ H A C _.
   – Possible: H P A C Y – no word.
   – H M A C K – not a word.
   – H N A C K – not a word.
   – H A C C – impossible.

Thus BLACK seems only viable among common words.

Check BLACK:
- B, L, A, C, K – none eliminated except we have no info on B,L,K.
- Fits _ _ A C _ with no conflicts.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word should contain several of these common letters to help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at the options:

- ""ADIEU"" covers A, D, I, E, U

- I( x ) – I is NOT in the word.
- S( x ) – S is NOT in the word.
- E( x ) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in position 2.
2. The letters R, I, S, E are ruled out entirely.
3. The remaining letters to try should avoid R, I, S, E.

We still have 25 – 5 = 20 letters to consider: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we already know A is present).

We want a new word that:
- Uses the known letter A (but not in position 2).
- Avoids the eliminated letters R, I, S, E.
- Uses other common consonants (like T, N, L, D, etc.) to gather more information.

A common strategy is to pick a word with new letters while including A in a different position. Possibilities: PLANT, MOUNT, TALON, ADULT, ABOUT, ALOFT, etc.

Let’s choose a word that:
- Keeps A but moves it to position 1.
- Introduces new common consonants (T, L, N, etc.).

“ADULT” contains A, D, U, L, T – none of which are eliminated (except A is confirmed). This tests D, U, L, T and keeps A in position 1. If any of D/U/L/T are in the word, we’ll get new hits.

2. ADULT → A(-) D(x) U(x) L(x) T(x)
   - A is in the word, but NOT in position 1 (it was in position 1 here and marked “-”).
   - D, U, L, T are all ruled out.

Therefore we now know:
- The word must contain A, and it cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- The set of eliminated letters so far: R, I, S, E, D, U, L, T.
- Remaining common consonants to test: N, C, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, etc.
- Vowels left (besides A): O, Y sometimes acts as a vowel.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A at positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Avoids all the 8 letters already ruled out.
- Uses fresh letters to maximize information.

Candidate choices:
- CANNY – C, A, N, N, Y (but N is repeated)

- FANCY – F, A, N, C, Y; A is third → possible.
- CABIN – A is second (ruled out).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints gathered from all feedback:

1. Letters known to be in the word (with positions):
   - A is in position 3 (COACH gave A ✓ in slot 3).

2. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
   - A is confirmed at slot 3, so earlier “-” for A in slots 1 & 2 is consistent.
   - C appears twice in COACH: first C got “-” (wrong position), second C got “✓” (correct position) → this is impossible for a single word!  
     Realization: the second C must actually be the one in position 4 (since position 5 is H), so position 4 is C.

   Therefore:
   - Word pattern: _ _ A C _
   - C must appear elsewhere, but NOT in position 1 (from first C getting “-”).

3. Eliminated letters (x so far):
   - R, I, S, E, D, U, L, T, O, H.

4. Remaining common letters to test:
   - Vowels: only A is used; Y might act as vowel.
   - Consonants left: N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y, W, X, Z (plus second C which we know exists).

5. We need a 5-letter word fitting: _ _ A C _ , containing C somewhere besides position 4 (already fixed), and avoiding all eliminated letters. Remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.

Let’s list possible fits:
- N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y could fill 1,2,5.
- Must also include C somewhere among 1,2,5, but NOT in 1 (from feedback).
   – So C must be in 2 or 5.

Candidate words:
- If C is in 2: _ C A C _ → need one more letter for 1 and 5, but C already used twice – not possible in standard Wordle.
- Therefore C must be in 5: _ _ A C C → but then pattern is _ _ A C C.

Possible words ending in ACC:
- BACCA – archaic, not common.
- MACCA – slang/nickname, not valid.
- YACCA – obscure.
- NACCA – not a word.
- GAMAC – no.
- PANIC – no C in 5.
- Actually, common words ending in ACC: none in standard lists.

Realization: maybe C is only once in word, and the duplicated C interpretation misled us. Re-read:

COACH feedback:
- C(-) in position 1 → C exists but not in 1.
- A(✓) in 3.
- C(✓) in position 4 → so word has C in 4 and another C elsewhere (but impossible in a typical 5-letter word). This contradiction implies I mis-parsed feedback.

Correct parsing: positions are 1-5 left-to-right. In COACH:
- C (1): -
- O (2): x
- A (3): ✓
- C (4): ✓
- H (5): -

Hence pattern: _ _ A C _ (positions 1,2,5 unknown), with constraints:
- C must appear somewhere besides 1 (from first C “-”), and we now know it's in 4.
- So word has at least one C at 4.
- Eliminated letters: R I S E D U L T O H (and A is fixed at 3).

Thus word form: [1] [2] A C [5], avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible consonants for 1,2,5: N, G, B, M, F, K, P, Y, W, X, Z.

We need real words fitting _ _ A C _ with those letters.

Examples:
- N and G: NAGAC – none.
- B and N: BANAC – no.
- B and Y: BYACC – no.
- M and B: MBAC_ – not possible.
- F and Y: FYAC_ – no.

Looking at actual word lists, common words fitting _ _ A C _:
- BLACK – B L A C K
- SNACK – S (eliminated)
- CRACK – C (eliminated), R
- TRACK – T (eliminated), R
- WHACK – W H A C K
- QUACK – Q U A C K (U eliminated)
- SHACK – S, H (both eliminated)
- CHACK – C, H (both eliminated)
- GNASH – no.

From remaining letters:
- B, L, A, C, K: BLACK – all letters allowed (B, L, K not yet eliminated).
- W, H, A, C, K: WHACK – but H is eliminated (feedback: H(-) means H is in word but wrong position, but we have H only in 5 and feedback gave H(-) – meaning H exists but not at 5 → contradiction because only slot 5 left for H. So H must be in word elsewhere, but positions 1-4 rules:
   – H cannot be in 5, must be in 1,2, or 4, but 4 is C. So H must be 1 or 2.
   – Then word would be H _ A C _ or _ H A C _.
   – Possible: H P A C Y – no word.
   – H M A C K – not a word.
   – H N A C K – not a word.
   – H A C C – impossible.

Thus BLACK seems only viable among common words.

Check BLACK:

BLACK → B(x) L(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓)

So:

- A is in position 3.
- C is in position 4.
- K is in position 5.

And B, L are eliminated.

We now have the exact pattern: _ _ A C K with positions 1 and 2 still unknown.

Previously eliminated letters (x): R, I, S, E, D, U, L, T, O, H, B.

Available letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining alphabet: N, G, M, F, P, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q.

We need a real 5-letter word of the form: [1][2]ACK.

Scanning possible combinations:

- N: NACK – not a word, but SNACK is (but S is eliminated).
- G: GACK – no.
- M: MACK – not a standalone word.
- F: FACK – no.
- P: PACK – yes, a valid word.
- Y: YACK – colloquial but acceptable.
- W: WACK – not standard.
- V: VACK – no.
- Q: Q is unlikely.

Most promising is PACK.

Let's verify:

PACK: P, A, C, K – all allowed (P not eliminated), fits _ _ A C K.
