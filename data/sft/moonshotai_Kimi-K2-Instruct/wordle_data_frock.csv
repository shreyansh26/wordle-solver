For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses include ""AROSE"", ""IRATE"", ""STARE"", or ""CRANE"". I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it uses A, R, O, S, E - covering many high-frequency vowels and consonants. This will give us good feedback on whether these common letters are present or not.

Let me go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).
- O(✓) – O is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, S, E
- Fixed letters: R in position 2, O in position 3
- We still need to find letters for positions 1, 4, and 5.

To maximize information, we should try new common consonants and vowels for those missing positions. Good candidate letters: T, N, I, L, C, D, H, U, Y, etc.

A simple word that fits R O in positions 2-3 and introduces several new common letters is ""FRONT"":
- F (new consonant for position 1)
- R stays
- O stays
- N (new consonant for position 4)
- T (new consonant for position 5)

""FRONT"" uses three new letters (F, N, T) while keeping the confirmed R and O.

2. Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, N, T.

3. Letters already confirmed in the word (in their correct spots): F, R, O.
