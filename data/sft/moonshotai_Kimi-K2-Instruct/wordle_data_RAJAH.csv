- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers a good variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. 

I will go with ""CRANE"" as it includes common letters (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word does NOT contain C, N, or E, but it DOES contain R and A in other positions than 2 and 3 respectively.

Common 5-letter words that contain both R and A (and avoid C, N, E) include:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word:  
- A (in the correct position 2)  
- R (somewhere, but not in position 3)

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  
and R must appear exactly once, NOT in position 3.

Other letters to consider are those not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
- has A in position 2  
- contains R somewhere other than position 3  
- uses as many new, still-possible letters as possible to maximize information

Candidate words:  
- BARDS (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- FARMS (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- HARDY (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- MARCH → contains C (ruled out)  
- BARKS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- GARB → too short  
- HARMS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- WARDS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- MARSH → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- BARON → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- CAROL → contains C (ruled out)  
- FAVOR → R in 4 (allowed), all letters still possible

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,RAJAH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers a good variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. 

I will go with ""CRANE"" as it includes common letters (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback we have:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word does NOT contain C, N, or E, but it DOES contain R and A in other positions than 2 and 3 respectively.

Common 5-letter words that contain both R and A (and avoid C, N, E) include:
- RADIO (but contains D and I, and R is in position 1 which was not ruled out)
- HARPY
- MARCH (contains C, ruled out)
- DRAMA
- PARTY (good candidate: P, A, R, T, Y)
- RAPID (but contains D and I)

""PARTY"" has P, A, R, T, Y - none of C, N, E appear, and it places R in a new position (3 vs 2) and A in a new position (2 vs 3). This seems optimal for maximizing information.

<guess>PARTY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PARTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word:  
- A (in the correct position 2)  
- R (somewhere, but not in position 3)

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _  
and R must appear exactly once, NOT in position 3.

Other letters to consider are those not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
- has A in position 2  
- contains R somewhere other than position 3  
- uses as many new, still-possible letters as possible to maximize information

Candidate words:  
- BARDS (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- FARMS (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- HARDY (R in 3 → ruled out)  
- MARCH → contains C (ruled out)  
- BARKS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- GARB → too short  
- HARMS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- WARDS → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- MARSH → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- BARON → R in 3 (ruled out)  
- CAROL → contains C (ruled out)  
- FAVOR → R in 4 (allowed), all letters still possible  
- FAVOR fits perfectly: A in 2, R in 4, and letters F, V, O haven’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next optimal guess is FAVOR.

2. Where can R be?  
   - It is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (all guesses show “-” or “✓” for A).  
   - Therefore R **must** be in position 1.

   Secret word so far: R A _ A _ .

3. Letters already ruled out (x in at least one guess): C, N, E, P, T, Y, F, V, O, D, M.

4. Remaining valid letters (English alphabet minus above): B, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, S, U, W, X, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word of the form R A ? A ? using only the remaining letters in positions 3 and 5.
