1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback to work with, I should choose a strategic word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong first guess would combine these.

Potential candidates:
- AROSE (uses 5 very common letters)
- RAISE (similar)
- STARE (similar)
- CRANE (good consonant/vowel mix)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage.

From the three feedback rounds:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
2. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
3. SPACE → S(✓) P(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓)

We now know:

- The word pattern is S _ A _ E (positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed).
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: P (from SPACE feedback, P is in word but not position 2), A (from AROSE, A is in word but not position 1 - already placed at 3), S (from AROSE, S is in word but not position 4 - already placed at 1).
- Letters eliminated so far: R, O, L, T, C.
- P is in the word but NOT at position 2, so P must be at position 4.

Therefore, the word must be: S _ A P E.

The only missing letter is for position 2. Available letters (not yet eliminated and not already placed): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common English 5-letter words matching S _ A P E:
- SHAPE (H is allowed)
- SNAPE (N is allowed)
- SWAPE (W is allowed)
- SLAPE (L is eliminated)
- SCAPE (C is eliminated)

The most common and likely word here is SHAPE, as H is a common consonant and SHAPE is a valid English word.
