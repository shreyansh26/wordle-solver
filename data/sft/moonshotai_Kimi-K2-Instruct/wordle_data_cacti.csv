For my first guess in Wordle, I want to pick a word that covers a broad range of common letters to maximize the information gained. Ideally, it should include vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels but might not give enough consonant info)
- AUDIO (heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is excellent because it includes:
- R: very common letter
- A: most common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with for narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- I is in the word, but NOT in the 3rd position (-).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

3. Does NOT contain R, S, E
4. Does NOT contain any of the letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 from RAISE (since they were marked x or - and we already know their positions are wrong)

We need a word that:
- Is 5 letters
- Has A in the 2nd position
- Has I somewhere (but not in 3rd position)
- Doesn’t use R, S, E
- Doesn’t use any letters from the positions that were marked x (R, S, E) or in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 from RAISE (but since A is already in the right place, we can ignore that constraint for A)

Possible letters left for other positions: A (fixed), I, and others like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test a new set of letters. Common letters not yet tested include D, L, N, T, etc. Let me think of words fitting _ A _ _ _ with I present but not in 3rd position.

Examples:
- DAILY (but Y might be too uncommon, and L is okay)
- FAIRY (but R is out)
- GAIN (too short)
- HAIRY (H, A, I, R, Y - R is out)
- LAITY (L, A, I, T, Y - seems okay, but Y is less common)
- MAJOR (but O and J are okay, but doesn’t have I)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Position pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. GAMIN → G(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-) N(x)
   - Confirms A is still in position 2.
   - I is still “somewhere in the word, but not in position 4” (because I(-) means “in the word but wrong spot”).
   - G, M, N are NOT in the word.

So, up-to-date constraints:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain I, but I ≠ 3 and I ≠ 4. That leaves positions 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, G, M, N.
- We have not yet tested letters like B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I can now narrow down the possibilities:

Possible placements for I:
- Position 1: I A _ _ _
- Position 5: _ A _ _ I

Let’s generate candidate words that fit the pattern and have not been ruled out.

Examples:
- I A _ _ _ :  IA… (few common words start with I A and are valid 5-letter words).
- _ A _ _ I : T A C K I (T, A, C, K, I) – fits: A second, I fifth, none of the banned letters used.
- C A P R I → uses R (banned).
- H A Z Y I – uses Y, but is it a valid word? Not in most dictionaries.
- D A T I I – not a word.
- P A C K I – but K is fine, word exists: “PACKI” is not valid; “PACIF” isn’t either.
- C A K I I – invalid.
- F A T I I – invalid.
- T A C K I – “TACKI” is not a word; “TACKY” (but Y is okay, let’s check Y usage so far: not yet tested).

Actually, “TACKY” is a valid 5-letter word:
- T (new), A (✓ position 2), C (new), K (new), Y (new) – fits all constraints:
   – A is in position 2.
   – I is required somewhere; but TACKY does not include I, so it’s invalid.

Back to drawing board. We must have I somewhere (positions 1 or 5).

List of valid 5-letter English words fitting:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must include I in position 1 or 5.
- Must not use R, S, E, G, M, N.

Possible words:
- I A _ _ _ : “I AM” → too short, need 5 letters.
  – “IAMBI” – plural of iambus, but uses B, I (ok), but “IAMBI” is valid, though obscure.
  – “I AM B” – not useful.
  – “I A G O” – not a 5-letter word.
  – “I A T R” – invalid letters.

- _ A _ _ I :
  – C A J U I – not a word.
  – C A B I I – invalid.
  – C A T C H – no I.
  – C A V I I – invalid.
  – C A V I A – invalid.
  – C A V I E – uses E (banned).
  – C A B I N – uses N (banned).
  – F A C I L – uses L, but is 5 letters? “FACIL” is not standard English.
  – F A T I H – invalid.
  – H A C K I – “HACKI” is not valid.
  – H A L I D – but D is okay, and word exists: “HALID” is valid but very rare.
  – J A C K I – uses J, A, C, K, I. “JACKI” is a name (variant of Jackie) but may not be in standard word lists.
  – J A D I I – invalid.
  – P A C K I – invalid.
  – P A C I T – invalid.
  – L A C I N – uses N (banned).
  – T A C H I – “TACHI” is not standard.
  – T A C K I – invalid.
  – V A L I D – uses V, A, L, I, D. This is a valid word: VALID.
  – V A C I D – uses V, A, C, I, D. Also valid: VACID (means tasteless/flat).
  – C A V I D – invalid.
  – L A C I D – invalid.
  – P A C I D – invalid.
  – P A V I D – means timid: PAVID is valid but obscure.

The best common English word among these is “VALID”:
- V (new), A (✓), L (new), I (✓ – in position 4, which is acceptable because earlier feedback only excluded positions 3 and 4 for I in previous guesses, but now feedback says I(-) meaning “in word but wrong spot” – in GAMIN, I was in position 4 and was marked “-”, meaning “in word but not correct spot”. This implies I is NOT in position 4. So in VALID, I is in position 4, which would also be wrong. Thus, VALID is invalid.

Alternative: “VACID” (rare but valid), but I is again in 4 – same issue.

Next best: “HALID” (meaning relating to halide). I is in 4 – again ruled out.

Another word: “CAVIL” – uses C, A, V, I, L. Pattern _ A _ _ _:
- C A V I L → I is in 4 – ruled out.

We need I in 1 or 5.

Words with I in 1:
- I A _ _ _ : “I AM B” – nothing valid.

Words with I in 5:
- _ A _ _ I :
  – C A P I – too short.
  – C A C T I – uses T (ok), I (ok), but “CACTI” fits:
     – C, A, C, T, I.
     – A is in position 2 ✓
     – I is in position 5 ✓ (allowed, since earlier feedback only excluded positions 3 & 4)
     – Letters used: C, A, T, I – none of R, S, E, G, M, N.
     – Word is valid: plural of cactus.

“CACTI” seems perfect.

But check again: CACTI uses C twice; allowed in Wordle.

No conflicts: R, S, E, G, M, N not used; A in 2; I in 5; new letters C, T.

<guess>CACTI</guess>",CACTI,"From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Position pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. GAMIN → G(x) A(✓) M(x) I(-) N(x)
   - Confirms A is still in position 2.
   - I is still “somewhere in the word, but not in position 4” (because I(-) means “in the word but wrong spot”).
   - G, M, N are NOT in the word.

So, up-to-date constraints:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain I, but I ≠ 3 and I ≠ 4. That leaves positions 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, G, M, N.
- We have not yet tested letters like B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I can now narrow down the possibilities:

Possible placements for I:
- Position 1: I A _ _ _
- Position 5: _ A _ _ I

Let’s generate candidate words that fit the pattern and have not been ruled out.

Examples:
- I A _ _ _ :  IA… (few common words start with I A and are valid 5-letter words).
- _ A _ _ I : T A C K I (T, A, C, K, I) – fits: A second, I fifth, none of the banned letters used.
- C A P R I → uses R (banned).
- H A Z Y I – uses Y, but is it a valid word? Not in most dictionaries.
- D A T I I – not a word.
- P A C K I – but K is fine, word exists: “PACKI” is not valid; “PACIF” isn’t either.
- C A K I I – invalid.
- F A T I I – invalid.
- T A C K I – “TACKI” is not a word; “TACKY” (but Y is okay, let’s check Y usage so far: not yet tested).

Actually, “TACKY” is a valid 5-letter word:
- T (new), A (✓ position 2), C (new), K (new), Y (new) – fits all constraints:
   – A is in position 2.
   – I is required somewhere; but TACKY does not include I, so it’s invalid.

Back to drawing board. We must have I somewhere (positions 1 or 5).

List of valid 5-letter English words fitting:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must include I in position 1 or 5.
- Must not use R, S, E, G, M, N.

Possible words:
- I A _ _ _ : “I AM” → too short, need 5 letters.
  – “IAMBI” – plural of iambus, but uses B, I (ok), but “IAMBI” is valid, though obscure.
  – “I AM B” – not useful.
  – “I A G O” – not a 5-letter word.
  – “I A T R” – invalid letters.

- _ A _ _ I :
  – C A J U I – not a word.
  – C A B I I – invalid.
  – C A T C H – no I.
  – C A V I I – invalid.
  – C A V I A – invalid.
  – C A V I E – uses E (banned).
  – C A B I N – uses N (banned).
  – F A C I L – uses L, but is 5 letters? “FACIL” is not standard English.
  – F A T I H – invalid.
  – H A C K I – “HACKI” is not valid.
  – H A L I D – but D is okay, and word exists: “HALID” is valid but very rare.
  – J A C K I – uses J, A, C, K, I. “JACKI” is a name (variant of Jackie) but may not be in standard word lists.
  – J A D I I – invalid.
  – P A C K I – invalid.
  – P A C I T – invalid.
  – L A C I N – uses N (banned).
  – T A C H I – “TACHI” is not standard.
  – T A C K I – invalid.
  – V A L I D – uses V, A, L, I, D. This is a valid word: VALID.
  – V A C I D – uses V, A, C, I, D. Also valid: VACID (means tasteless/flat).
  – C A V I D – invalid.
  – L A C I D – invalid.
  – P A C I D – invalid.
  – P A V I D – means timid: PAVID is valid but obscure.
