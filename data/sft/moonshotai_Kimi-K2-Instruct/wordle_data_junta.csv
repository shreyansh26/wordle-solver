For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get maximum information

Some good starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, or RAISE. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also excellent
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - strong vowel representation

I'll go with CRANE as it's frequently recommended as one of the best starting words due to its combination of very common letters (C, R, N) and common vowels (A, E).

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C (first letter) is not in the word (x)
- R (second letter) is not in the word (x)
- A (third letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N (fourth letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (fifth letter) is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain C, R, or E at all
- We still need to find 3 more letters

Since we have A and N confirmed, and need 3 more letters, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses A and N in different positions (since we know they're in the wrong spots)
2. Introduces new common letters
3. Avoids C, R, E which we know aren't in the word

Good letters to try next might be: S, T, L, O, I, M, D, etc.

I'm considering:
- SLANT: uses S, L, A, N, T - but N is in position 4 again (which we know is wrong)
- PLANT: uses P, L, A, N, T - same issue with N in position 4
- STAND: uses S, T, A, N, D - here N is in position 3 (which is different from position 4)

STAND seems good because:
- Uses known letters A (position 3 originally) and N (position 4 originally) in new positions

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, N, T  
  – In CRANE, A was in position 3 (wrong), N in position 4 (wrong)  
  – In STAND, T was in position 2 (wrong), A in position 3 (wrong again), N in position 4 (wrong again)

Therefore:
- A is in the word but NOT at position 3  
- N is in the word but NOT at position 4  
- T is in the word but NOT at position 2  

We still need two more distinct letters (because we already have A, N, T and need five total).  
Good candidates to try: L, I, O, M, K, B, F, G, H, U, Y, etc.

I’ll choose a word that:
1. Contains A, N, T (but shifts them away from their forbidden positions)  
2. Adds two fresh consonants  
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters

One convenient arrangement is: T, A, N in positions 1-3 and two new consonants after.  
But T cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at position 4.  
So let’s try:

M A N T O – but N would be at position 3 (allowed) and A at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (allowed).  
No forbidden letters used; introduces M and O.

Another quick check:
Positions: 
1: M (new)  
2: A (allowed, not 3)  
3: N (allowed, not 4)  
4: T (allowed, not 2)  
5: O (new)

Let’s tabulate what we now know.

Letters confirmed IN the word:  
A, N, T

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:  
C, R, E, S, D, M, O

Positions ruled out so far:

A: forbidden in position 3 (seen in CRANE and STAND)  
N: forbidden in position 4 (seen in CRANE and STAND)  
T: forbidden in position 2 (seen in STAND)

From Guess 3 (MANTO) we also have:  
- N is in position 3 (✓) ⇒ N must be in position 3.  
- T is in position 4 (✓) ⇒ T must be in position 4.

Hence the word looks like: _ _ N T _

We still need two more distinct letters in positions 1 and 5.  
Allowed candidates (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A, but A still needs another valid position.

However, A is already confirmed in the word, but all we know is it cannot be position 3 (which we now know is N). So A could occupy position 1, 2, or 5.

Therefore possible patterns:

A _ N T _  
_ A N T _  
_ _ N T A

But position 2 cannot be T (already forbidden), and we need fresh letters elsewhere.

We have two empty spots and must pick letters from the still-allowed pool. Good common letters left: L, K, I, B, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try:

- Position 1: a fresh consonant not yet eliminated  
- Position 2: A (because A must go somewhere, and positions 1 and 5 are open)  
- Position 5: another fresh consonant  

A concrete test word:  
B A N T H  (B, H fresh)  
Check: B and H are allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, N and T are locked in positions 3-4.  
So my guess will be BANTH.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get maximum information

Some good starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, or RAISE. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also excellent
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - strong vowel representation

I'll go with CRANE as it's frequently recommended as one of the best starting words due to its combination of very common letters (C, R, N) and common vowels (A, E).

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C (first letter) is not in the word (x)
- R (second letter) is not in the word (x)
- A (third letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N (fourth letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (fifth letter) is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain C, R, or E at all
- We still need to find 3 more letters

Since we have A and N confirmed, and need 3 more letters, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses A and N in different positions (since we know they're in the wrong spots)
2. Introduces new common letters
3. Avoids C, R, E which we know aren't in the word

Good letters to try next might be: S, T, L, O, I, M, D, etc.

I'm considering:
- SLANT: uses S, L, A, N, T - but N is in position 4 again (which we know is wrong)
- PLANT: uses P, L, A, N, T - same issue with N in position 4
- STAND: uses S, T, A, N, D - here N is in position 3 (which is different from position 4)

STAND seems good because:
- Uses known letters A (position 3 originally) and N (position 4 originally) in new positions
- Introduces S, T, D which are good common letters
- Avoids forbidden letters C, R, E

Let's go with STAND.

<guess>STAND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, N, T  
  – In CRANE, A was in position 3 (wrong), N in position 4 (wrong)  
  – In STAND, T was in position 2 (wrong), A in position 3 (wrong again), N in position 4 (wrong again)

Therefore:
- A is in the word but NOT at position 3  
- N is in the word but NOT at position 4  
- T is in the word but NOT at position 2  

We still need two more distinct letters (because we already have A, N, T and need five total).  
Good candidates to try: L, I, O, M, K, B, F, G, H, U, Y, etc.

I’ll choose a word that:
1. Contains A, N, T (but shifts them away from their forbidden positions)  
2. Adds two fresh consonants  
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters

One convenient arrangement is: T, A, N in positions 1-3 and two new consonants after.  
But T cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at position 4.  
So let’s try:

M A N T O – but N would be at position 3 (allowed) and A at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (allowed).  
No forbidden letters used; introduces M and O.

Another quick check:
Positions: 
1: M (new)  
2: A (allowed, not 3)  
3: N (allowed, not 4)  
4: T (allowed, not 2)  
5: O (new)

Looks good.

So the guess is MANTO.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to get maximum information

Some good starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, or RAISE. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E - also excellent
- RAISE has R, A, I, S, E - strong vowel representation

I'll go with CRANE as it's frequently recommended as one of the best starting words due to its combination of very common letters (C, R, N) and common vowels (A, E).

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C (first letter) is not in the word (x)
- R (second letter) is not in the word (x)
- A (third letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N (fourth letter) is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E (fifth letter) is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively
- The word does NOT contain C, R, or E at all
- We still need to find 3 more letters

Since we have A and N confirmed, and need 3 more letters, I want to pick a word that:
1. Uses A and N in different positions (since we know they're in the wrong spots)
2. Introduces new common letters
3. Avoids C, R, E which we know aren't in the word

Good letters to try next might be: S, T, L, O, I, M, D, etc.

I'm considering:
- SLANT: uses S, L, A, N, T - but N is in position 4 again (which we know is wrong)
- PLANT: uses P, L, A, N, T - same issue with N in position 4
- STAND: uses S, T, A, N, D - here N is in position 3 (which is different from position 4)

STAND seems good because:
- Uses known letters A (position 3 originally) and N (position 4 originally) in new positions
- Introduces S, T, D which are good common letters
- Avoids forbidden letters C, R, E

Let's go with STAND.

<guess>STAND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, N, T  
  – In CRANE, A was in position 3 (wrong), N in position 4 (wrong)  
  – In STAND, T was in position 2 (wrong), A in position 3 (wrong again), N in position 4 (wrong again)

Therefore:
- A is in the word but NOT at position 3  
- N is in the word but NOT at position 4  
- T is in the word but NOT at position 2  

We still need two more distinct letters (because we already have A, N, T and need five total).  
Good candidates to try: L, I, O, M, K, B, F, G, H, U, Y, etc.

I’ll choose a word that:
1. Contains A, N, T (but shifts them away from their forbidden positions)  
2. Adds two fresh consonants  
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters

One convenient arrangement is: T, A, N in positions 1-3 and two new consonants after.  
But T cannot be at position 2, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at position 4.  
So let’s try:

M A N T O – but N would be at position 3 (allowed) and A at position 2 (allowed), T at position 4 (allowed).  
No forbidden letters used; introduces M and O.

Another quick check:
Positions: 
1: M (new)  
2: A (allowed, not 3)  
3: N (allowed, not 4)  
4: T (allowed, not 2)  
5: O (new)

Looks good.

So the guess is MANTO.

<guess>MANTO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: MANTO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(✓) T(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s tabulate what we now know.

Letters confirmed IN the word:  
A, N, T

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:  
C, R, E, S, D, M, O

Positions ruled out so far:

A: forbidden in position 3 (seen in CRANE and STAND)  
N: forbidden in position 4 (seen in CRANE and STAND)  
T: forbidden in position 2 (seen in STAND)

From Guess 3 (MANTO) we also have:  
- N is in position 3 (✓) ⇒ N must be in position 3.  
- T is in position 4 (✓) ⇒ T must be in position 4.

Hence the word looks like: _ _ N T _

We still need two more distinct letters in positions 1 and 5.  
Allowed candidates (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus A, but A still needs another valid position.

However, A is already confirmed in the word, but all we know is it cannot be position 3 (which we now know is N). So A could occupy position 1, 2, or 5.

Therefore possible patterns:

A _ N T _  
_ A N T _  
_ _ N T A

But position 2 cannot be T (already forbidden), and we need fresh letters elsewhere.

We have two empty spots and must pick letters from the still-allowed pool. Good common letters left: L, K, I, B, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try:

- Position 1: a fresh consonant not yet eliminated  
- Position 2: A (because A must go somewhere, and positions 1 and 5 are open)  
- Position 5: another fresh consonant  

A concrete test word:  
B A N T H  (B, H fresh)  
Check: B and H are allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, N and T are locked in positions 3-4.  
So my guess will be BANTH.

So the pattern is: _ _ N T _ and A must be in either position 1 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): A, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 5, with A occupying one of them.

Possible patterns:
1. A _ N T _ (A in position 1)
2. _ _ N T A (A in position 5)

Let's try pattern 1: A _ N T _
We need a letter for position 2 (can't be any of C,R,E,S,D,M,O,B,H)
Good candidates: F, G, I, K, L, P, etc.

Let's try F for position 2 and I for position 5:
A F N T I

All letters are allowed:
- A (allowed, position 1)
- F (new, allowed)
- N (position 3, ✓)
- T (position 4, ✓)
- I (new, allowed)

This seems like a good next guess.
