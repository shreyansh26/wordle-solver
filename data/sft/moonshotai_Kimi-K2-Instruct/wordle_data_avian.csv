This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible to narrow down the possibilities for future guesses. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize letter coverage)
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels but less consonant coverage)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding duplicates.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible to narrow down the possibilities for future guesses. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize letter coverage)
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels but less consonant coverage)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding duplicates.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: is in word but wrong spot (-)
- N: is in word but wrong spot (-)
- E: not in word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively
- The letters C, R, E are NOT in the word
- We still need to test other vowels and common consonants

Good second-guess strategy:
- Include the confirmed letters A and N in new positions
- Avoid the eliminated letters C, R, E
- Continue to test high-frequency letters (S, T, L, I, O, etc.)
- Prefer a guess that also tests new consonants and vowels

I'll choose ""SLANT"":
- Contains confirmed letters A and N (in new positions)
- Tests new common consonants S, L, T
- Tests new vowel spot for A (position 2)
- Avoids all eliminated letters

- A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same info).  
- N is still in the word but not in position 4 (same info).

Nothing new about placement, but we’ve now eliminated:  
C, R, E, S, L, T.

Confirmed letters still to place: A, N  

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, Y. We need a 5-letter word that has A and N (in positions 3 and 4 are disallowed) and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s move A to position 2 and N to position 5, and fill the other three slots with new, high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate word: PIANO

Step-by-step deductions:

1. CRANE: C R E ruled out; A and N present but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
2. SLANT: S L T ruled out; still no new positional info for A or N.
3. PIANO: P O ruled out; I is present but NOT in position 2.
4. MANDI: M D ruled out; new info:
   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A can be 1 or 5)
   - N is in word but NOT in position 3 (so N can be 1 or 5)
   - I is in word but NOT in position 5 (so I can be 1, 3, or 4)

Therefore, the word must contain:
- A in position 1 or 5
- N in position 1 or 5
- I in position 1, 3, or 4
- No other letters from the eliminated list (C,R,E,S,L,T,P,O,M,D)

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y, plus A, N, I.

Given that A and N must occupy 1 and 5 in some order, and we need a 5-letter word with I somewhere inside, the only viable positions are:

Case 1: A _ I _ N
Case 2: N _ I _ A

Let’s pick a word that fits Case 2 and introduces new letters.  
Candidate: N I _ _ A → we need two letters in positions 3-4 from allowed set.  
A common combination: N I V A L – but L is ruled out.  
Another: N I K A H – but H and K are allowed.  
However, ""NIKAH"" is valid but uncommon.  

A simpler, commoner pattern: N I _ _ A  
Popular word: N I G H A – but G and H are allowed and untested.  

""NIGHT"" doesn’t work (T ruled out).  
""NIGMA"" – uncommon.  
""VINNA"" – repeats N, and V is allowed.  
""HINGE"" – has E (ruled out).  

Re-examining Case 1: A _ I _ N  
Try: A B I N – but needs 5 letters.  
""AKIN"" – needs 5 letters.  
""AGAIN"" – has A twice, G allowed, but A must be only once.  

Wait – ""AGAIN"" has A twice, but we don’t know if duplicates are allowed. To stay safe, use each letter once.

Best fit: A N I _ _ – but N must be 1 or 5.  
Actually, let’s list possible patterns:

Positions 1-5:

1. A _ _ I N
2. A _ _ N I
3. N _ _ I A
4. N _ _ A I

Among these, the only common word is ""NINJA"" – but N repeats.  
""NAIAD"" – D ruled out.  
""NAIR"" – too short.  
""ANIMA"" – M ruled out.  
""ANIGH"" – uncommon.  
""ANVIL"" – L ruled out.  
""AWING"" – W, G allowed.  
""AWING"" is valid – A in 1, W I N G fill 2-5.  

Check: 
- A in 1 (allowed), N in 4 (allowed, since N not excluded from 4), I in 3 (allowed), W and G new.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible to narrow down the possibilities for future guesses. A good starting word should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like vowels and common consonants)
2. Avoid using the same letter twice (to maximize letter coverage)
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels but less consonant coverage)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), giving good coverage of frequently used letters while avoiding duplicates.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""CRANE"":
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: is in word but wrong spot (-)
- N: is in word but wrong spot (-)
- E: not in word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively
- The letters C, R, E are NOT in the word
- We still need to test other vowels and common consonants

Good second-guess strategy:
- Include the confirmed letters A and N in new positions
- Avoid the eliminated letters C, R, E
- Continue to test high-frequency letters (S, T, L, I, O, etc.)
- Prefer a guess that also tests new consonants and vowels

I'll choose ""SLANT"":
- Contains confirmed letters A and N (in new positions)
- Tests new common consonants S, L, T
- Tests new vowel spot for A (position 2)
- Avoids all eliminated letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (CRANE) we already knew  
- A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
- C, R, E are absent.

Guess 2 (SLANT) gives:  
- S, L, T are not in the word.  
- A is still in the word but not in position 3 (same info).  
- N is still in the word but not in position 4 (same info).

Nothing new about placement, but we’ve now eliminated:  
C, R, E, S, L, T.

Confirmed letters still to place: A, N  

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, Y. We need a 5-letter word that has A and N (in positions 3 and 4 are disallowed) and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s move A to position 2 and N to position 5, and fill the other three slots with new, high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate word: PIANO  
- P, I, O haven’t been tested yet.  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- N is in position 5 (allowed).  

This tests three new letters at once.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Latest feedback recap:

1. CRANE — C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ A and N are in the word, but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
   ⇒ C, R, E are out.

2. SLANT — S(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)  
   ⇒ S, L, T are out; still no new positional info for A or N.

3. PIANO — P(x) I(-) A(-) N(-) O(x)  
   ⇒ P, O are out; I is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Letters ruled out so far: C, R, E, S, L, T, P, O.  
Confirmed letters: A, N, I (each must appear at least once).  
Positions 3 and 4 for A and N are forbidden.

Need a word that:
- contains A, N, I (with I not in position 2, A not in 3, N not in 4).  
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Try to place:
- I in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Among the remaining frequent letters (B, D, G, H, K, M, U, Y) choose ones we haven’t tried. A promising candidate is “MANDI”:

- M (new), A (position 2, allowed), N (position 3, allowed), D (new), I (position 5, allowed).  
- Contains all three required letters in allowed positions.  
- Tests two new consonants (M, D).

Let’s lock it in.

Guess 4: MANDI -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(-) D(x) I(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step deductions:

1. CRANE: C R E ruled out; A and N present but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
2. SLANT: S L T ruled out; still no new positional info for A or N.
3. PIANO: P O ruled out; I is present but NOT in position 2.
4. MANDI: M D ruled out; new info:
   - A is in word but NOT in position 2 (so A can be 1 or 5)
   - N is in word but NOT in position 3 (so N can be 1 or 5)
   - I is in word but NOT in position 5 (so I can be 1, 3, or 4)

Therefore, the word must contain:
- A in position 1 or 5
- N in position 1 or 5
- I in position 1, 3, or 4
- No other letters from the eliminated list (C,R,E,S,L,T,P,O,M,D)

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, Y, plus A, N, I.

Given that A and N must occupy 1 and 5 in some order, and we need a 5-letter word with I somewhere inside, the only viable positions are:

Case 1: A _ I _ N
Case 2: N _ I _ A

Let’s pick a word that fits Case 2 and introduces new letters.  
Candidate: N I _ _ A → we need two letters in positions 3-4 from allowed set.  
A common combination: N I V A L – but L is ruled out.  
Another: N I K A H – but H and K are allowed.  
However, ""NIKAH"" is valid but uncommon.  

A simpler, commoner pattern: N I _ _ A  
Popular word: N I G H A – but G and H are allowed and untested.  

""NIGHT"" doesn’t work (T ruled out).  
""NIGMA"" – uncommon.  
""VINNA"" – repeats N, and V is allowed.  
""HINGE"" – has E (ruled out).  

Re-examining Case 1: A _ I _ N  
Try: A B I N – but needs 5 letters.  
""AKIN"" – needs 5 letters.  
""AGAIN"" – has A twice, G allowed, but A must be only once.  

Wait – ""AGAIN"" has A twice, but we don’t know if duplicates are allowed. To stay safe, use each letter once.

Best fit: A N I _ _ – but N must be 1 or 5.  
Actually, let’s list possible patterns:

Positions 1-5:

1. A _ _ I N
2. A _ _ N I
3. N _ _ I A
4. N _ _ A I

Among these, the only common word is ""NINJA"" – but N repeats.  
""NAIAD"" – D ruled out.  
""NAIR"" – too short.  
""ANIMA"" – M ruled out.  
""ANIGH"" – uncommon.  
""ANVIL"" – L ruled out.  
""AWING"" – W, G allowed.  
""AWING"" is valid – A in 1, W I N G fill 2-5.  

Check: 
- A in 1 (allowed), N in 4 (allowed, since N not excluded from 4), I in 3 (allowed), W and G new.  
Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, L, T, P, O, M, D – none present.  

""AWING"" seems good.

3. N is still in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
4. W and G are not in the word (x).

A _ I _ _

Letters still confirmed to be present: A, I, N (with N not in position 4).

Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, S, L, T, P, O, M, D, W, G.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, H, J, K, U, V, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has I in position 3
- Contains N, but not in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
A _ I N _  (N in position 4 is forbidden, so this is invalid)
A _ I _ N  (N must be in position 5)
A _ I _ _  (but N must be somewhere, so N must be in position 5)

Thus the word must be: A _ I _ N

Looking at remaining letters for positions 2 and 4:

Common combinations:
- B in position 2 and K in position 4: A B I K N → ""ABIKN"" (invalid word)
- B in position 2 and H in position 4: A B I H N → ""ABIHN"" (invalid)
- H in position 2 and B in position 4: A H I B N → ""AHIBN"" (invalid)

- F in position 2 and K in position 4: A F I K N → ""AFIKN"" (invalid)
- H in position 2 and K in position 4: A H I K N → ""AHIKN"" (invalid)

Looking for actual valid words:
- A B I N? Not 5 letters
- A V I N? Not 5 letters
- A F I N? Not 5 letters
- A H I N? Not 5 letters
- A F I N? Not 5 letters
- A K I N? Not 5 letters

Wait, let's think of common English words starting with A, I in 3rd position, ending with N.

Possible valid word: A V I A N → but A repeats and we don't know if duplicates allowed
A F I N? Not 5 letters
A B I N D → D is ruled out
A C I N? C is ruled out
A H I N T → T is ruled out
A F I N G → G is ruled out
A V I N G → G is ruled out
A H I N G → G is ruled out
A F I N N → N repeats
A V I A N (avian) - has A twice but may be acceptable
A F I A N (not valid)
A F I N? Not 5 letters

Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""AVIAN"" (even though it has A twice, it's possible the word has duplicate letters).

Check letters: A, V, I, A, N
- A: confirmed in position 1 (matches ✓)
- V: new, untested
- I: confirmed in position 3 (matches ✓)
- A: allowed to repeat (we don't know)
- N: confirmed in word (position 5 is allowed)

Since no other obvious word fits, and ""AVIAN"" is a valid English word, this is our best final guess.

Check letters: A, V, I, A, N
- A: confirmed in position 1 (matches ✓)
- V: new, untested
- I: confirmed in position 3 (matches ✓)
- A: allowed to repeat (we don't know)
- N: confirmed in word (position 5 is allowed)

Since no other obvious word fits, and ""AVIAN"" is a valid English word, this is our best final guess.",Guess 6: AVIAN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) V(✓) I(✓) A(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
