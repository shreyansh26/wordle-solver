moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,THUMP,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters. Some good options are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This seems like a strong starting point to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

Since none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all, I need a completely new set of letters for my second guess.  
The next most common letters in English that weren’t already tried are: T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.  
A good 5-letter word with 5 distinct common letters (avoiding the eliminated ones) is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
This will give me information about five new, highly frequent letters.

We have:
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L
- Letters in the word but wrong position: U (not position 1), T (not position 3)

Remaining useful common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, Y  
Remaining useful vowels: none left among the most common!  
So we’ll need to use less-common vowels now: only Y is still common among vowel-like letters.

We know:
- U is in the word, but not in position 1  
- T is in the word, but not in position 3

Let’s pick a word that re-uses U and T in new positions and adds fresh letters.  
A good candidate is “DUMPY”:
- D, M, P, Y are new letters  
- U in position 2 (new position compared with previous guess)  
- T is NOT used here; we’ll test it later.  
But that skips T, so let’s instead choose “DUTCH”:
- D, C, H are new letters  
- U in position 2 (new position)  
- T in position 3 (but we already know T is NOT in position 3). Oops, conflict.

Next idea: “THUMP”:
- T in position 1 (new)  
- H, M, P new  
- U in position 3 (new)  
No conflicts; all eliminated letters avoided.

Let’s go with “THUMP”.
