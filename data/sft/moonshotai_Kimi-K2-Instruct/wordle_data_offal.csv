For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - strong common letters
- ""AROSE"" covers all vowels except U, plus S - very vowel-heavy
- ""AUDIO"" covers most vowels but lacks common consonants

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes:
1. C - very common consonant
2. R - one of the most common consonants
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all **not in the word** (x)
- A is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-)

That rules out any word containing C, R, N, or E.  
Since the A is present but not in the second position, we now know the word has an A somewhere else.

We need a word that:
- Contains A
- Does not contain C, R, N, E
- Uses mostly common remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, M, D, G, B  
Good remaining vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U

A strong next guess would be one that tests new common letters while placing the A in a different position. “SLIMY” skips the forbidden letters but lacks an A, so that’s no good. “SALTY” has A in 2nd position (same as before, but we know A isn’t 2nd now). 

Instead, try “SALTY” with A moved to 3rd → “STAMP” has A in 3rd and tests S, T, M, P. But P is less common. How about “SAINT”? Uses I, which is a new vowel, and T/S are common. But N is already ruled out (from CRANE feedback). So “SAINT” is invalid.

Next: “STOMA” – uses A finally, and tests S, T, O, M. S/T are common, O is a new vowel. But A is in 5th position. However, “STOMA” is a bit obscure. A better choice is “STOMA” or “TALON” – but L is okay and O, T, S are good. Wait, N is out.

Let’s pick “STOMA” or “PLAID”. The latter has P, L, A, I, D – P is less common. “STOAD” (but D is less common). 

A better word is “SLAID” – uses S, L, A, I, D. But D is less common. 

The strongest five-letter word with A not in 2nd position, avoiding C/R/N/E, is “STOMA” (though offbeat) or “PLAID” (also offbeat). A more common word is “SLANT” but N is out. 

Actually, “PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D – P and D are less common, but I is new vowel and L is good. 

Alternatively, “STAMP” – but P is less common. 

A balanced choice: “PLAID” – covers new letters while placing A in 3rd position (not 2nd).

But let’s pick a more common word: “STOMA” is valid but obscure. 

Best common word avoiding C/R/N/E and having A not in 2nd: “PLAID” or “STAMP”.

I’ll go with “PLAID” as it introduces I and L, with A in 3rd position.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - strong common letters
- ""AROSE"" covers all vowels except U, plus S - very vowel-heavy
- ""AUDIO"" covers most vowels but lacks common consonants

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes:
1. C - very common consonant
2. R - one of the most common consonants
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all **not in the word** (x)
- A is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-)

That rules out any word containing C, R, N, or E.  
Since the A is present but not in the second position, we now know the word has an A somewhere else.

We need a word that:
- Contains A
- Does not contain C, R, N, E
- Uses mostly common remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, M, D, G, B  
Good remaining vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U

A strong next guess would be one that tests new common letters while placing the A in a different position. “SLIMY” skips the forbidden letters but lacks an A, so that’s no good. “SALTY” has A in 2nd position (same as before, but we know A isn’t 2nd now). 

Instead, try “SALTY” with A moved to 3rd → “STAMP” has A in 3rd and tests S, T, M, P. But P is less common. How about “SAINT”? Uses I, which is a new vowel, and T/S are common. But N is already ruled out (from CRANE feedback). So “SAINT” is invalid.

Next: “STOMA” – uses A finally, and tests S, T, O, M. S/T are common, O is a new vowel. But A is in 5th position. However, “STOMA” is a bit obscure. A better choice is “STOMA” or “TALON” – but L is okay and O, T, S are good. Wait, N is out.

Let’s pick “STOMA” or “PLAID”. The latter has P, L, A, I, D – P is less common. “STOAD” (but D is less common). 

A better word is “SLAID” – uses S, L, A, I, D. But D is less common. 

The strongest five-letter word with A not in 2nd position, avoiding C/R/N/E, is “STOMA” (though offbeat) or “PLAID” (also offbeat). A more common word is “SLANT” but N is out. 

Actually, “PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D – P and D are less common, but I is new vowel and L is good. 

Alternatively, “STAMP” – but P is less common. 

A balanced choice: “PLAID” – covers new letters while placing A in 3rd position (not 2nd).

But let’s pick a more common word: “STOMA” is valid but obscure. 

Best common word avoiding C/R/N/E and having A not in 2nd: “PLAID” or “STAMP”.

I’ll go with “PLAID” as it introduces I and L, with A in 3rd position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(-), A(-), I(x), D(x)  
   - New letters not in the word: P, I, D  
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - A is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

So far we know:
- Must contain A and L.
- A is NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- L is NOT in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, D.

Available letters: A, L, plus the remaining common ones: S, T, M, B, G, H, K, O, U, Y, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- L somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Only allowed letters (no C, R, N, E, P, I, D)
- Common remaining letters to maximize information

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ L
- _ _ A _ L
- _ _ _ A L
- L _ A _ _
- etc.

Let’s pick a common word that fits:
- “SMALL”: but has S, M, A, L, L – valid letters, and all allowed. Uses S and M, both common and untested.

Check:
- S: untested  
- M: untested  
- A: must be in word (positions 1)  
- L: must be in word (positions 3,4)

This word also places A in position 1 (allowed) and L in positions 3/4 (allowed). Good test.

Therefore, “SMALL” is a strong next guess.

From the newest feedback on SMALL:

- L(-) → L is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So we now know the word’s structure ends in L and contains:
- A somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4 allowed)
- L somewhere else besides 4 (already 5 is taken by the final L)
- No C, R, N, E, P, I, D, S, M

The word must be of the form _ _ _ _ L with:
- A in 1, 2, or 4
- One more L in 1, 2, or 3

- A L _ _ L
- A _ L _ L

- _ L _ A L
- _ A L _ L
- _ A _ L L (but that would duplicate L in 4 and 5, and 4 is disallowed for L)
- _ _ A L L (same issue)

Let’s pick the common word that fits: GULLY (but Y is allowed, U is allowed, G is allowed, L appears twice). However GULLY has L in 2 and 3 – but we already have L in 5, and L is allowed in 2 or 3. And A is missing – so not GULLY.

We need a word with A and two L’s, one at 5. Another candidate is “TALLY” but Y is allowed, T is allowed, A is allowed, L appears twice (positions 2 and 5) – but L in position 2 is allowed, A in position 1 is allowed. However, we need to check: is T allowed? Yes (not forbidden). Is A allowed? Yes (must be present). Is L allowed in 2 and 5? Yes (only 4 is forbidden for L).

“TALLY” fits:
- T: allowed
- A: in position 2 (allowed)
- L: in position 2 (allowed)

However, we need to check: is T allowed? Yes (not forbidden). Is A allowed? Yes (must be present). Is L allowed in 2 and 5? Yes (only 4 is forbidden for L).

“TALLY” fits:
- T: allowed
- A: in position 2 (allowed)
- L: in position 2 (allowed)
- L: in position 5 (correct)
- Y: allowed

So “TALLY” is a valid guess adhering to all constraints.

From the latest feedback on TALLY:
- T(x) and Y(x) → T and Y are NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- First L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Second L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- The final L in position 5 was already confirmed as correct (✓) in Guess 3.

So we now know:
1. The word ends in L.
2. It must contain A and one additional L (since the final L is already placed).
3. Allowed positions for A: 1, 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).
4. Allowed positions for the second L: 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4).
5. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, P, I, D, S, M, T, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, G, H, K, O, U, V, W, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in L, containing A and another L, with A in position 1 or 4, and the other L in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ L L (but L cannot be in 4)
- _ A _ _ L (but A cannot be in 2)
- _ _ A _ L (but A cannot be in 3)
- _ _ _ A L (A in 4)
- L _ A _ L (A in 3, but A cannot be in 3)
- L A _ _ L (A in 2, but A cannot be in 2)

The only valid placements for A are:
- Position 1: A _ _ _ L
- Position 4: _ _ _ A L

For the second L:
- If A is in position 1 (A _ _ _ L), the second L must be in 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is forbidden for L (because L(-) in TALLY was for position 4), so L can be in 2 or 3.
- If A is in position 4 (_ _ _ A L), the second L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns:
1. A _ _ _ L with L in 2 or 3:
   - ALLYL (but Y is forbidden)
   - ALGAL (but G, A, L are allowed)
   - ALFAL (not a word)
   - ALGAL is valid: A, L, G, A, L. But it has A twice – allowed if the word has two A's.

2. _ _ _ A L with L in 1, 2, or 3:
   - BAGAL (not a word)
   - HABUL (not a word)
   - GAVEL (but V is allowed, but L is in 3, A in 4, which fits)
   - FOCAL (but O, C are forbidden)
   - GAVEL: G, A, V, E, L – but E is forbidden.
   - HAFAL (not a word)
   - KABAL (but B, A, K, A, L – K is allowed, but does it have a second L? No, only one L at 5)
   - KAGOL (not a word)
   - GAVEL is invalid due to E.

Looking back at ALGAL: A, L, G, A, L. 
- Letters: all allowed (A, L, G)
- A is in positions 1 and 3 (allowed for A)
- L is in positions 2 and 5 (2 is allowed for L)
- No forbidden letters.

Is ALGAL a valid English word? Yes – it means ""of or relating to algae"".

Another candidate: ALKAL (not a word).

Thus, ALGAL seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let me check if there's a more common word:
- A L _ _ L: ALGAL is the only one.
- _ _ A L L: but L cannot be in 4.
- _ L _ A L: L in 2, A in 4, e.g., BLALL (not a word), GLAAL (not a word), FLAAL (not a word).

Thus, ALGAL is the strongest candidate.

For the second L:

Common starting words often include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - strong common letters
- ""AROSE"" covers all vowels except U, plus S - very vowel-heavy
- ""AUDIO"" covers most vowels but lacks common consonants

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes:
1. C - very common consonant
2. R - one of the most common consonants
3. A - most common vowel
4. N - common consonant
5. E - most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all **not in the word** (x)
- A is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-)

That rules out any word containing C, R, N, or E.  
Since the A is present but not in the second position, we now know the word has an A somewhere else.

We need a word that:
- Contains A
- Does not contain C, R, N, E
- Uses mostly common remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, M, D, G, B  
Good remaining vowels: A (already confirmed), I, O, U

A strong next guess would be one that tests new common letters while placing the A in a different position. “SLIMY” skips the forbidden letters but lacks an A, so that’s no good. “SALTY” has A in 2nd position (same as before, but we know A isn’t 2nd now). 

Instead, try “SALTY” with A moved to 3rd → “STAMP” has A in 3rd and tests S, T, M, P. But P is less common. How about “SAINT”? Uses I, which is a new vowel, and T/S are common. But N is already ruled out (from CRANE feedback). So “SAINT” is invalid.

Next: “STOMA” – uses A finally, and tests S, T, O, M. S/T are common, O is a new vowel. But A is in 5th position. However, “STOMA” is a bit obscure. A better choice is “STOMA” or “TALON” – but L is okay and O, T, S are good. Wait, N is out.

Let’s pick “STOMA” or “PLAID”. The latter has P, L, A, I, D – P is less common. “STOAD” (but D is less common). 

A better word is “SLAID” – uses S, L, A, I, D. But D is less common. 

The strongest five-letter word with A not in 2nd position, avoiding C/R/N/E, is “STOMA” (though offbeat) or “PLAID” (also offbeat). A more common word is “SLANT” but N is out. 

Actually, “PLAID” uses P, L, A, I, D – P and D are less common, but I is new vowel and L is good. 

Alternatively, “STAMP” – but P is less common. 

A balanced choice: “PLAID” – covers new letters while placing A in 3rd position (not 2nd).

But let’s pick a more common word: “STOMA” is valid but obscure. 

Best common word avoiding C/R/N/E and having A not in 2nd: “PLAID” or “STAMP”.

I’ll go with “PLAID” as it introduces I and L, with A in 3rd position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses so far:

1. CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(-), A(-), I(x), D(x)  
   - New letters not in the word: P, I, D  
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - A is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

So far we know:
- Must contain A and L.
- A is NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- L is NOT in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, D.

Available letters: A, L, plus the remaining common ones: S, T, M, B, G, H, K, O, U, Y, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- L somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Only allowed letters (no C, R, N, E, P, I, D)
- Common remaining letters to maximize information

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ L
- _ _ A _ L
- _ _ _ A L
- L _ A _ _
- etc.

Let’s pick a common word that fits:
- “SMALL”: but has S, M, A, L, L – valid letters, and all allowed. Uses S and M, both common and untested.

Check:
- S: untested  
- M: untested  
- A: must be in word (positions 1)  
- L: must be in word (positions 3,4)

This word also places A in position 1 (allowed) and L in positions 3/4 (allowed). Good test.

Therefore, “SMALL” is a strong next guess.

- L(✓) → the **second** L is in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the word’s structure ends in L and contains:
- A somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4 allowed)
- L somewhere else besides 4 (already 5 is taken by the final L)
- No C, R, N, E, P, I, D, S, M

We need a word with A and two L’s, one at 5. Another candidate is “TALLY” but Y is allowed, T is allowed, A is allowed, L appears twice (positions 2 and 5) – but L in position 2 is allowed, A in position 1 is allowed. However, we need to check: is T allowed? Yes (not forbidden). Is A allowed? Yes (must be present). Is L allowed in 2 and 5? Yes (only 4 is forbidden for L).

“TALLY” fits:
- T: allowed
- A: in position 2 (allowed)
- L: in position 2 (allowed)
- L: in position 5 (correct)
- Y: allowed

So “TALLY” is a valid guess adhering to all constraints.

<guess>TALLY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: SMALL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) M(x) A(-) L(-) L(✓)
Guess 4: TALLY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(-) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback on TALLY:
- T(x) and Y(x) → T and Y are NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- First L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Second L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- The final L in position 5 was already confirmed as correct (✓) in Guess 3.

So we now know:
1. The word ends in L.
2. It must contain A and one additional L (since the final L is already placed).
3. Allowed positions for A: 1, 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).
4. Allowed positions for the second L: 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4).
5. Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, P, I, D, S, M, T, Y.

Remaining common letters: B, G, H, K, O, U, V, W, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in L, containing A and another L, with A in position 1 or 4, and the other L in position 1, 2, or 3.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ L L (but L cannot be in 4)
- _ A _ _ L (but A cannot be in 2)
- _ _ A _ L (but A cannot be in 3)
- _ _ _ A L (A in 4)
- L _ A _ L (A in 3, but A cannot be in 3)
- L A _ _ L (A in 2, but A cannot be in 2)

The only valid placements for A are:
- Position 1: A _ _ _ L
- Position 4: _ _ _ A L

For the second L:
- If A is in position 1 (A _ _ _ L), the second L must be in 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is forbidden for L (because L(-) in TALLY was for position 4), so L can be in 2 or 3.
- If A is in position 4 (_ _ _ A L), the second L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns:
1. A _ _ _ L with L in 2 or 3:
   - ALLYL (but Y is forbidden)
   - ALGAL (but G, A, L are allowed)
   - ALFAL (not a word)
   - ALGAL is valid: A, L, G, A, L. But it has A twice – allowed if the word has two A's.

2. _ _ _ A L with L in 1, 2, or 3:
   - BAGAL (not a word)
   - HABUL (not a word)
   - GAVEL (but V is allowed, but L is in 3, A in 4, which fits)
   - FOCAL (but O, C are forbidden)
   - GAVEL: G, A, V, E, L – but E is forbidden.
   - HAFAL (not a word)
   - KABAL (but B, A, K, A, L – K is allowed, but does it have a second L? No, only one L at 5)
   - KAGOL (not a word)
   - GAVEL is invalid due to E.

Looking back at ALGAL: A, L, G, A, L. 
- Letters: all allowed (A, L, G)
- A is in positions 1 and 3 (allowed for A)
- L is in positions 2 and 5 (2 is allowed for L)
- No forbidden letters.

Is ALGAL a valid English word? Yes – it means ""of or relating to algae"".

Another candidate: ALKAL (not a word).

Thus, ALGAL seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let me check if there's a more common word:
- A L _ _ L: ALGAL is the only one.
- _ _ A L L: but L cannot be in 4.
- _ L _ A L: L in 2, A in 4, e.g., BLALL (not a word), GLAAL (not a word), FLAAL (not a word).

Thus, ALGAL is the strongest candidate.

Let's break down the new feedback on ALGAL:

1. A(-) → The first A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
2. L(-) → The first L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
3. G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
4. A(✓) → The second A is in the correct position (position 4).
5. L(✓) → The final L is in the correct position (position 5).

From all feedback so far:

- The word ends in ""AL"" (positions 4-5 are A and L).
- It must contain another L (since we have two L's in the word) but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SMALL and TALLY feedback).
- It must contain another A (since we have two A's in the word) but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from CRANE, PLAID, SMALL, TALLY, ALGAL).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, D, S, M, T, Y, G.

So we need a 5-letter word ending in ""AL"" with:
- An A in position 4 (✓)
- An L in position 5 (✓)
- Another A somewhere (but only position 3 is left for it, since positions 1,2,4 are taken or forbidden)
- Another L somewhere (but only position 3 is left for it, since positions 2,3,4,5 are taken or forbidden)

Wait, let's map positions:

- Position 4: A (✓)
- Position 5: L (✓)
- The other A must be in position 3 (since 1,2,4 are forbidden for A)
- The other L must be in position 3 (since 2 is forbidden for L, and 1 is possible)

But we can't have both A and L in position 3. This implies the word must have:
- AA L AL (but that's impossible), or
- A L A L (positions 2,3,4,5) but 2 is forbidden for L, or
- L A A L (positions 1,2,3,4,5) but 2 is forbidden for A

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine:

Actually, we have:
- Two A's: one in position 4 (✓), and one more A must exist but NOT in positions 1,2,3 - but positions 4,5 are taken. This is impossible.

This suggests ALGAL may have been a wrong turn. Let me reconsider:

Looking back at SMALL feedback: the second L is in position 5 (✓), and the first L is somewhere else (not 4). 

From TALLY: L is not in 3 or 4. So L must be in 1,2, or 5 (but 5 is taken), so L must be in 1 or 2.

From ALGAL: The first L is not in position 2. So L must be in position 1.

Thus the word starts with L and ends with AL: L _ _ A L

The middle two letters must be from remaining allowed letters (not C,R,N,E,P,I,D,S,M,T,Y,G) and must include the required A (but we already have A in position 4).

Wait, let's list all constraints:

1. Word ends with AL (positions 4-5)
2. Must contain L in position 1 (from above reasoning)
3. Must contain A somewhere (from CRANE), but A is in position 4 (ALGAL feedback shows A in 4 is correct)
4. No other constraints on middle letters except forbidden letters

Thus the word must be: L _ _ A L

Available letters for positions 2-3: B, F, H, K, O, U, V, W

Looking for common words:
- L O B A L (not a word)
- L U B A L (not a word)
- L O V A L (not a word)
- L U V A L (not a word)
- L O K A L (not standard)
- L O G A L - but G is forbidden
- L O F A L (not a word)
- L O H A L (not a word)

The only recognizable word is LOCAL, but C is forbidden.

However, LOBAL is a valid word (meaning ""relating to a lobe""). Checking letters:
- L, O, B, A, L - all letters are allowed (O and B haven't been ruled out).

Thus the next guess is LOBAL.

<think>Wait, let me double-check:
- LOBAL: L,O,B,A,L
- Forbidden letters: C,R,N,E,P,I,D,S,M,T,Y,G - none of these appear
- Structure: L _ _ A L with A in 4 (confirmed ✓)
- L appears twice (positions 1 and 5) - both positions are allowed
- B and O are untested but allowed letters

This seems correct.</think>

- Forbidden letters: C,R,N,E,P,I,D,S,M,T,Y,G - none of these appear
- Structure: L _ _ A L with A in 4 (confirmed ✓)
- L appears twice (positions 1 and 5) - both positions are allowed
- B and O are untested but allowed letters

This seems correct.",Guess 6: LOBAL -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(-) B(x) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL
