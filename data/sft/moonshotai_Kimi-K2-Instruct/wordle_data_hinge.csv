- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". These words use frequently occurring letters and vowels to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. R A I S E → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is definitely in the 5th position.
   - I is somewhere in the word, but not at position 3.
   - R, A, S are not in the word at all.

2. C H I D E → C(x) H(-) I(-) D(x) E(✓)
   - E is still confirmed at position 5.
   - I is in the word but not at position 3 or 4 (it was in position 3 before, now in position 3 again but still marked “-”, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5. Since 5 is E, it must be 1 or 2.
   - H is in the word but not at position 2 (it was at position 2 and marked “-”, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. 5 is E, so 1, 3, or 4.
   - C and D are not in the word.

Known so far:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains I and H.
- I cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from RAISE and CHIDE feedback).
- H cannot be in position 2 (from CHIDE feedback).
- Letters not in the word: R, A, S, C, D.

Next guess:
- Must end in E.
- Must contain I (at position 1 or 2) and H (at position 1, 3, or 4).
- Should use new common letters to test.

Let’s try “WHITE”:
- W (new letter), H at 2, I at 3, T (new), E at 5.
But I cannot be at 3 (from RAISE feedback), so this is invalid.

Try “WHILE”:
- W (new), H at 2, I at 3, L (new), E at 5.
Again I at 3 is invalid.

Try “WITCH” - but we know H must be in word, and this ends in H, but E must be at 5, so this is invalid (must end in E).

Try “MIXED” - but D is not in word.

Try “THINE”:
- T (new), H at 2, I at 3, N (new), E at 5.
Again I at 3 is invalid.

Try “HINGE”:
- H at 1, I at 2, N (new), G (new), E at 5.
This satisfies:
- I at 2 (valid position)
- H at 1 (valid position)
- Ends in E
- Uses new common letters N and G.

This seems like a good choice.
