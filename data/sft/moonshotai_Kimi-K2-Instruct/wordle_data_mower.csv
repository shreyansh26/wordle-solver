For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants. Some great starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but poor consonants)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes three of the most common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives maximum information about letter presence and position.

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Let’s consolidate what we know after two guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):  
S, L, A, T, C, H, I.

Confirmed letters that ARE in the word:  
E and M (both marked “-”, so they appear somewhere, but not in the positions we used).

Positions ruled out so far:  
- For E: position 5 (from SLATE) and position 4 (from CHIME).  
- For M: position 4 (from CHIME).

So the word must:  
- Contain both E and M.  
- E cannot be 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  
- M cannot be 4th → must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.  
- Use only letters not in {S,L,A,T,C,H,I}.  Remaining frequent consonants and vowels: {B,D,F,G,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} and the vowel O, U, Y.

We still want to test several of these remaining letters quickly.  A good candidate should:  
1. Put E and M in new positions.  
2. Introduce several new consonants/vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
3. Be a valid 5-letter word.

One strong choice is “GROVE”:  
- Uses E in position 5 (but we know E can’t be 5th from SLATE) – discard.  
Another is “BROKE” – uses B, R, O, K, E.  
B, R, O, K are all untested; E is reused but can be in any of positions 1–3.

However, E cannot be 5th, so let’s try “EMBER”:
Positions: 1-E, 2-M, 3-B, 4-E, 5-R  
But E appears twice and we only know the word contains E at least once; double letters are allowed.  
Checks:  
- Valid word  
- Contains both required letters E and M  
- E is in position 1 (new) and 4 (ruled out).  We can avoid double-E by choosing a single-E word.  

Better candidate: “PROBE” – but P is less frequent.  

Let’s choose “ROVER” – uses R, O, V, E; but only one E and one M needed.  We need to include M.  

Balanced choice: “MOVER”
Letters: M, O, V, E, R  
- M is in position 1 (new)  
- E is in position 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VOMER” (anatomy word) – valid.  
Positions: V-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, R-5  
- M in 3 (new)  
- E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VEXER” – uses E twice and X.

“NERVE” – uses N, E, R, V; but only one M.

We must include M.  Let’s try “MERGE”:  
E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“REMEM” – invalid.

A valid word with M and E and fresh consonants: “FEMUR”  
- F, E, M, U, R  
Positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-M, 4-U, 5-R  
E is in 2 (new)  
M is in 3 (new)  
Introduces F, U, R – all untested and common enough.

Therefore, FEMUR is a strong third guess.

B, R, O, K are all untested; E is reused but can be in any of positions 1–3.

However, E cannot be 5th, so let’s try “EMBER”:
Positions: 1-E, 2-M, 3-B, 4-E, 5-R  
But E appears twice and we only know the word contains E at least once; double letters are allowed.  
Checks:  
- Valid word  
- Contains both required letters E and M  
- E is in position 1 (new) and 4 (ruled out).  We can avoid double-E by choosing a single-E word.  

Better candidate: “PROBE” – but P is less frequent.  

Let’s choose “ROVER” – uses R, O, V, E; but only one E and one M needed.  We need to include M.  

Balanced choice: “MOVER”
Letters: M, O, V, E, R  
- M is in position 1 (new)  
- E is in position 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VOMER” (anatomy word) – valid.  
Positions: V-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, R-5  
- M in 3 (new)  
- E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VEXER” – uses E twice and X.

“NERVE” – uses N, E, R, V; but only one M.

We must include M.  Let’s try “MERGE”:  
E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“REMEM” – invalid.

A valid word with M and E and fresh consonants: “FEMUR”  
- F, E, M, U, R  
Positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-M, 4-U, 5-R  
E is in 2 (new)  
M is in 3 (new)  
Introduces F, U, R – all untested and common enough.

Therefore, FEMUR is a strong third guess.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- E, M, R

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- S, L, A, T, C, H, I, F, U

Positions ruled out:
- E: cannot be 4th (from CHIME) or 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from FEMUR) → must be 1st or 3rd
- M: cannot be 4th (from CHIME) or 3rd (from FEMUR) → must be 1st, 2nd or 5th
- R: must be 5th (from FEMUR's ✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ _ R with the constraints:
- Must contain E and M
- E must be in position 1 or 3
- M must be in 1, 2 or 5 (but 5 is already R)

Possible positions:
1st: E or M
2nd: M or other consonant
3rd: E or other consonant
4th: consonant
5th: R (fixed)

Letters still available (not forbidden): B, D, G, J, K, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels O, Y

We need to place E and M while using these letters.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If E is 1st: E M _ _ R
- If E is 3rd: _ M E _ R or M _ E _ R

Looking at E M _ _ R:
We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from available letters.
Possible: EM _ _ R - but we need valid 5-letter words.

Looking at _ M E _ R:
We need a consonant for 1st position and 4th position.

Valid candidates:
- EM B E R → EMBER (but E appears twice - possible)
- G O V E R → but we need M in word
- D E M O R → needs to be valid
- B E M Y R → invalid

Looking for valid words:
- EMBER: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - valid
- DEMUR: D(1), E(2), M(3), U(4), R(5) - but U is forbidden
- OMBER: O(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - but we need E in 1 or 3, this has E in 4
- ERMER → invalid
- B E M E R → invalid

The most promising is EMBER, which uses all required letters (E, M, R) and follows the constraints:
- E is 1st (valid position)
- M is 2nd
- R is 5th (confirmed)
- Uses B (new letter)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants. Some great starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but poor consonants)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes three of the most common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives maximum information about letter presence and position.

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S L A T are all not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does **not** contain: S, L, A, T.
- **Does** contain the letter E, but **not** in the 5th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good candidates would be words like:
- CRONE (but O is common and C, R, N are useful)
- DRIVE (but V is less common)
- MERGE (double E is not efficient)
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E - all useful and avoids forbidden letters)

CHIME seems strong as it introduces C, H, I, M while keeping E in position 4.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after two guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):  
S, L, A, T, C, H, I.

Confirmed letters that ARE in the word:  
E and M (both marked “-”, so they appear somewhere, but not in the positions we used).

Positions ruled out so far:  
- For E: position 5 (from SLATE) and position 4 (from CHIME).  
- For M: position 4 (from CHIME).

So the word must:  
- Contain both E and M.  
- E cannot be 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  
- M cannot be 4th → must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.  
- Use only letters not in {S,L,A,T,C,H,I}.  Remaining frequent consonants and vowels: {B,D,F,G,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} and the vowel O, U, Y.

We still want to test several of these remaining letters quickly.  A good candidate should:  
1. Put E and M in new positions.  
2. Introduce several new consonants/vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
3. Be a valid 5-letter word.

One strong choice is “GROVE”:  
- Uses E in position 5 (but we know E can’t be 5th from SLATE) – discard.  
Another is “BROKE” – uses B, R, O, K, E.  
B, R, O, K are all untested; E is reused but can be in any of positions 1–3.

However, E cannot be 5th, so let’s try “EMBER”:
Positions: 1-E, 2-M, 3-B, 4-E, 5-R  
But E appears twice and we only know the word contains E at least once; double letters are allowed.  
Checks:  
- Valid word  
- Contains both required letters E and M  
- E is in position 1 (new) and 4 (ruled out).  We can avoid double-E by choosing a single-E word.  

Better candidate: “PROBE” – but P is less frequent.  

Let’s choose “ROVER” – uses R, O, V, E; but only one E and one M needed.  We need to include M.  

Balanced choice: “MOVER”
Letters: M, O, V, E, R  
- M is in position 1 (new)  
- E is in position 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VOMER” (anatomy word) – valid.  
Positions: V-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, R-5  
- M in 3 (new)  
- E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VEXER” – uses E twice and X.

“NERVE” – uses N, E, R, V; but only one M.

We must include M.  Let’s try “MERGE”:  
E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“REMEM” – invalid.

A valid word with M and E and fresh consonants: “FEMUR”  
- F, E, M, U, R  
Positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-M, 4-U, 5-R  
E is in 2 (new)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,mower,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants. Some great starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (many vowels but poor consonants)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it includes three of the most common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives maximum information about letter presence and position.

I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S L A T are all not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does **not** contain: S, L, A, T.
- **Does** contain the letter E, but **not** in the 5th position.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere except the last slot.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good candidates would be words like:
- CRONE (but O is common and C, R, N are useful)
- DRIVE (but V is less common)
- MERGE (double E is not efficient)
- CHIME (C, H, I, M, E - all useful and avoids forbidden letters)

CHIME seems strong as it introduces C, H, I, M while keeping E in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CHIME -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) M(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after two guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):  
S, L, A, T, C, H, I.

Confirmed letters that ARE in the word:  
E and M (both marked “-”, so they appear somewhere, but not in the positions we used).

Positions ruled out so far:  
- For E: position 5 (from SLATE) and position 4 (from CHIME).  
- For M: position 4 (from CHIME).

So the word must:  
- Contain both E and M.  
- E cannot be 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  
- M cannot be 4th → must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.  
- Use only letters not in {S,L,A,T,C,H,I}.  Remaining frequent consonants and vowels: {B,D,F,G,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z} and the vowel O, U, Y.

We still want to test several of these remaining letters quickly.  A good candidate should:  
1. Put E and M in new positions.  
2. Introduce several new consonants/vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
3. Be a valid 5-letter word.

One strong choice is “GROVE”:  
- Uses E in position 5 (but we know E can’t be 5th from SLATE) – discard.  
Another is “BROKE” – uses B, R, O, K, E.  
B, R, O, K are all untested; E is reused but can be in any of positions 1–3.

However, E cannot be 5th, so let’s try “EMBER”:
Positions: 1-E, 2-M, 3-B, 4-E, 5-R  
But E appears twice and we only know the word contains E at least once; double letters are allowed.  
Checks:  
- Valid word  
- Contains both required letters E and M  
- E is in position 1 (new) and 4 (ruled out).  We can avoid double-E by choosing a single-E word.  

Better candidate: “PROBE” – but P is less frequent.  

Let’s choose “ROVER” – uses R, O, V, E; but only one E and one M needed.  We need to include M.  

Balanced choice: “MOVER”
Letters: M, O, V, E, R  
- M is in position 1 (new)  
- E is in position 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VOMER” (anatomy word) – valid.  
Positions: V-1, O-2, M-3, E-4, R-5  
- M in 3 (new)  
- E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“VEXER” – uses E twice and X.

“NERVE” – uses N, E, R, V; but only one M.

We must include M.  Let’s try “MERGE”:  
E in 4 (ruled out) – discard.

“REMEM” – invalid.

A valid word with M and E and fresh consonants: “FEMUR”  
- F, E, M, U, R  
Positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-M, 4-U, 5-R  
E is in 2 (new)  
M is in 3 (new)  
Introduces F, U, R – all untested and common enough.

Therefore, FEMUR is a strong third guess.

Guess 3: FEMUR -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(-) M(-) U(x) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize the information we have so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- E, M, R

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- S, L, A, T, C, H, I, F, U

Positions ruled out:
- E: cannot be 4th (from CHIME) or 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from FEMUR) → must be 1st or 3rd
- M: cannot be 4th (from CHIME) or 3rd (from FEMUR) → must be 1st, 2nd or 5th
- R: must be 5th (from FEMUR's ✓)

So the word structure is: _ _ _ _ R with the constraints:
- Must contain E and M
- E must be in position 1 or 3
- M must be in 1, 2 or 5 (but 5 is already R)

Possible positions:
1st: E or M
2nd: M or other consonant
3rd: E or other consonant
4th: consonant
5th: R (fixed)

Letters still available (not forbidden): B, D, G, J, K, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels O, Y

We need to place E and M while using these letters.

Let's consider possible patterns:
- If E is 1st: E M _ _ R
- If E is 3rd: _ M E _ R or M _ E _ R

Looking at E M _ _ R:
We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from available letters.
Possible: EM _ _ R - but we need valid 5-letter words.

Looking at _ M E _ R:
We need a consonant for 1st position and 4th position.

Valid candidates:
- EM B E R → EMBER (but E appears twice - possible)
- G O V E R → but we need M in word
- D E M O R → needs to be valid
- B E M Y R → invalid

Looking for valid words:
- EMBER: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - valid
- DEMUR: D(1), E(2), M(3), U(4), R(5) - but U is forbidden
- OMBER: O(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5) - but we need E in 1 or 3, this has E in 4
- ERMER → invalid
- B E M E R → invalid

The most promising is EMBER, which uses all required letters (E, M, R) and follows the constraints:
- E is 1st (valid position)
- M is 2nd
- R is 5th (confirmed)
- Uses B (new letter)

The feedback from MOVER is:

M(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

That means:

- M is correctly placed in position 1.
- O is correctly placed in position 2.
- V is not in the word.
- E is correctly placed in position 4.
- R is correctly placed in position 5.

So the word is:

M O _ E R

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches this pattern, where the third letter is not any of the forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, H, I, F, U, B, V.

The available letters (for position 3) are from: D, G, J, K, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit M O _ E R:

- M O D E R → MODER is not a standard word.
- M O N E R → Not a word.
- M O G E R → Not a word.
- M O P E R → MOPER is valid.
- M O W E R → MOWER is valid.
- M O K E R → MOKER is not a word.
- M O D E R → Again, not standard.

The valid options are MOPER and MOWER. Between these, MOWER is more common.

Thus, the word must be MOWER.
