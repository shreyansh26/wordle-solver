Since this is the first guess with no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:

1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the most frequent in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. It can potentially reveal multiple correct letters in multiple positions

This approach maximizes the information gained from the first guess, which is crucial in a 6-try limit game.

Feedback summary:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A (but not in slot 1) and R (but not in slot 2), and none of O, S, E.

Letters known so far: A, R (both misplaced)
Letters excluded: O, S, E

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.

Good next candidates should include A and R shifted to different slots, and bring in fresh common letters like T, I, N, L, etc.

A word like “TRAIN” or “RAINT” would test A and R in new positions plus new letters, but note that A is already confirmed, so let’s try to place A and R differently while also introducing T, I, N.

Let’s choose “TRAIN”
- T is new (high-frequency consonant)
- R is moved to slot 2 (was in slot 2 previously, but must move) – wait, feedback says R is in the word but not in slot 2, so slot 2 is invalid. Let’s instead move R to slot 3.
- A is in slot 1 is invalid (feedback says A is not in slot 1), so A must go in slots 2-5.
- I and N are new.

An alternative word that places A and R not in their previous positions and introduces new letters is “BRAIN” – but B hasn’t been tested, and it has R in slot 2 which was just marked wrong. So avoid R in slot 2.

Another good choice: “RATIO” – but O is excluded.

Another: “GRAIN” – but G is less common and R is in slot 2.

“FRAIL” – F less common, R in slot 2.

“DRAIN” – D less common, R in slot 2.

“TRAIL” – T, R, A, I, L – this looks better:
- R is in slot 2 (invalid, was in slot 2 before)
So skip.

Another: “TRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRIAD” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TAPIR” – R in slot 5 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), but P, I less common.

“PAINT” – A in slot 2 (ok), R not present – need R.

“CHANT” – no A.

“CRANE” – E excluded.

“CRAMP” – M, P introduced.

“CRANK” – N, K introduced.

“CRANT” – N, T introduced.

“CRANT” is 5 letters, uses C, R, A, N, T – all new (except A, R confirmed). R not in slot 2 (here it's slot 2 again, so invalid).

This is tricky – need to place R not in slot 2 and A not in slot 1.

Let’s pick “CARTS” – C, A, R, T, S – but S is excluded.

“PARTY” – Y new.

“PARTY” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRASH” – S excluded.

“CRAWL” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“GRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“FRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“BRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

Hmm – any word that moves R out of slot 2 and A out of slot 1?

A better word: “DRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“RADIO” – O excluded.

“RAPID” – R in slot 1 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), P, I, D new.

“RAPID” – R is in slot 1 (previously in slot 2, so allowed), A in slot 2 (previously in slot 1, so allowed), P, I, D new.

This seems valid: R and A are both moved to new positions, and new letters P, I, D are introduced.

- A is in the word and is in position 2.
- P is in the word but not in position 3.
- O, S, E, I, D are NOT in the word.

Known facts:
1. The word has structure: _ A _ _ _
2. It must contain: R (not in 1 or 2), P (not in 3), A
3. It must NOT contain: O, S, E, I, D

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y

We need 3 more unique letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- Position 1: any letter except R, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 3: any letter except P, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 4: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Position 5: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Also R and P must appear somewhere in one of these three remaining slots.

Since A is fixed in slot 2, the word form is: X A Y Z W
We must place R somewhere in X, Y, Z, W (but not X=1 because R can’t be in position 1 from feedback)
Similarly P must be in one of these four positions but not in position 3 (from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements of R and P, then choose remaining letters.

Option 1: R in position 3
   Then P cannot be in position 3, so P must be in 1, 4, or 5
   Word form: X A R Z W with P in 1,4,5
   Candidates:
   - P A R _ _ → PAR__ but A is in slot 2 so this is P A R _ _ → already P in 1, A in 2, R in 3
     Need two more letters from allowed set for slots 4,5.
     Try P A R K_ → PARK_ but need 5 letters, so PARK + Y → PARKY (Y allowed)
     PARKY uses P, A, R, K, Y – all allowed and satisfies constraints.

Option 2: R in position 4
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   So P in 1 or 5
   Candidates:
   - P A _ R _ → P A _ R _ → need letters for 3 and 5 from allowed set
     P A C R T → PACRT but C, T allowed
   - _ A _ R P → but P is in 5, but feedback says P is not in 3 (this is ok)

Option 3: R in position 5
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   Candidates:
   - P A _ _ R → P A N C R (N, C allowed)
   - _ A P _ R → but P is in 3 which is excluded, so invalid

Looking at the most straightforward option that uses new common letters, PARKY seems ok but Y might be less common.

Another check: P A R K Y – check constraints:
- R is not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 3) ✓
- A is in 2 ✓
- P is not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

Another candidate: P A N C R – but P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, C in 4, R in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 5) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓

Next: P A R T Y – P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, Y in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (in 3) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- PARTY is a valid word.

PARTY seems slightly better than PARKY as T is more common than K.

Let’s verify PARTY:
- P in 1 (ok, P not excluded from 1)
- A in 2 (exact match)
- R in 3 (ok, R not in 1 or 2)
- T in 4 (new letter)
- Y in 5 (new letter)
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Thus PARTY is a good next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PARRY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:

1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the most frequent in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. It can potentially reveal multiple correct letters in multiple positions

This approach maximizes the information gained from the first guess, which is crucial in a 6-try limit game.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A (but not in slot 1) and R (but not in slot 2), and none of O, S, E.

Letters known so far: A, R (both misplaced)
Letters excluded: O, S, E

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.

Good next candidates should include A and R shifted to different slots, and bring in fresh common letters like T, I, N, L, etc.

A word like “TRAIN” or “RAINT” would test A and R in new positions plus new letters, but note that A is already confirmed, so let’s try to place A and R differently while also introducing T, I, N.

Let’s choose “TRAIN”
- T is new (high-frequency consonant)
- R is moved to slot 2 (was in slot 2 previously, but must move) – wait, feedback says R is in the word but not in slot 2, so slot 2 is invalid. Let’s instead move R to slot 3.
- A is in slot 1 is invalid (feedback says A is not in slot 1), so A must go in slots 2-5.
- I and N are new.

An alternative word that places A and R not in their previous positions and introduces new letters is “BRAIN” – but B hasn’t been tested, and it has R in slot 2 which was just marked wrong. So avoid R in slot 2.

Another good choice: “RATIO” – but O is excluded.

Another: “GRAIN” – but G is less common and R is in slot 2.

“FRAIL” – F less common, R in slot 2.

“DRAIN” – D less common, R in slot 2.

“TRAIL” – T, R, A, I, L – this looks better:
- R is in slot 2 (invalid, was in slot 2 before)
So skip.

Another: “TRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRIAD” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TAPIR” – R in slot 5 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), but P, I less common.

“PAINT” – A in slot 2 (ok), R not present – need R.

“CHANT” – no A.

“CRANE” – E excluded.

“CRAMP” – M, P introduced.

“CRANK” – N, K introduced.

“CRANT” – N, T introduced.

“CRANT” is 5 letters, uses C, R, A, N, T – all new (except A, R confirmed). R not in slot 2 (here it's slot 2 again, so invalid).

This is tricky – need to place R not in slot 2 and A not in slot 1.

Let’s pick “CARTS” – C, A, R, T, S – but S is excluded.

“PARTY” – Y new.

“PARTY” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAMP” – M new.

“CRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAWL” – W, L new.

“TRAWL” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAFT” – T new.

“CRAFT” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRACK” – K new.

“TRACK” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAWL” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“GRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“FRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“BRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

Hmm – any word that moves R out of slot 2 and A out of slot 1?

A better word: “DRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“RADIO” – O excluded.

“RAPID” – R in slot 1 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), P, I, D new.

“RAPID” – R is in slot 1 (previously in slot 2, so allowed), A in slot 2 (previously in slot 1, so allowed), P, I, D new.

This seems valid: R and A are both moved to new positions, and new letters P, I, D are introduced.

Thus: RAPID

2. It must contain: R (not in 1 or 2), P (not in 3), A
3. It must NOT contain: O, S, E, I, D

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y

We need 3 more unique letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- Position 1: any letter except R, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 3: any letter except P, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 4: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Position 5: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Also R and P must appear somewhere in one of these three remaining slots.

Since A is fixed in slot 2, the word form is: X A Y Z W
We must place R somewhere in X, Y, Z, W (but not X=1 because R can’t be in position 1 from feedback)
Similarly P must be in one of these four positions but not in position 3 (from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements of R and P, then choose remaining letters.

Option 1: R in position 3
   Then P cannot be in position 3, so P must be in 1, 4, or 5

     Need two more letters from allowed set for slots 4,5.
     Try P A R K_ → PARK_ but need 5 letters, so PARK + Y → PARKY (Y allowed)
     PARKY uses P, A, R, K, Y – all allowed and satisfies constraints.

Option 2: R in position 4
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 3 from feedback)

     P A C R T → PACRT but C, T allowed
   - _ A _ R P → but P is in 5, but feedback says P is not in 3 (this is ok)

Option 3: R in position 5
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   Candidates:
   - P A _ _ R → P A N C R (N, C allowed)
   - _ A P _ R → but P is in 3 which is excluded, so invalid

Looking at the most straightforward option that uses new common letters, PARKY seems ok but Y might be less common.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,PARRY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:

1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the most frequent in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. It can potentially reveal multiple correct letters in multiple positions

This approach maximizes the information gained from the first guess, which is crucial in a 6-try limit game.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A (but not in slot 1) and R (but not in slot 2), and none of O, S, E.

Letters known so far: A, R (both misplaced)
Letters excluded: O, S, E

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.

Good next candidates should include A and R shifted to different slots, and bring in fresh common letters like T, I, N, L, etc.

A word like “TRAIN” or “RAINT” would test A and R in new positions plus new letters, but note that A is already confirmed, so let’s try to place A and R differently while also introducing T, I, N.

Let’s choose “TRAIN”
- T is new (high-frequency consonant)
- R is moved to slot 2 (was in slot 2 previously, but must move) – wait, feedback says R is in the word but not in slot 2, so slot 2 is invalid. Let’s instead move R to slot 3.
- A is in slot 1 is invalid (feedback says A is not in slot 1), so A must go in slots 2-5.
- I and N are new.

An alternative word that places A and R not in their previous positions and introduces new letters is “BRAIN” – but B hasn’t been tested, and it has R in slot 2 which was just marked wrong. So avoid R in slot 2.

Another good choice: “RATIO” – but O is excluded.

Another: “GRAIN” – but G is less common and R is in slot 2.

“FRAIL” – F less common, R in slot 2.

“DRAIN” – D less common, R in slot 2.

“TRAIL” – T, R, A, I, L – this looks better:
- R is in slot 2 (invalid, was in slot 2 before)
So skip.

Another: “TRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRIAD” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TAPIR” – R in slot 5 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), but P, I less common.

“PAINT” – A in slot 2 (ok), R not present – need R.

“CHANT” – no A.

“CRANE” – E excluded.

“CRAMP” – M, P introduced.

“CRANK” – N, K introduced.

“CRANT” – N, T introduced.

“CRANT” is 5 letters, uses C, R, A, N, T – all new (except A, R confirmed). R not in slot 2 (here it's slot 2 again, so invalid).

This is tricky – need to place R not in slot 2 and A not in slot 1.

Let’s pick “CARTS” – C, A, R, T, S – but S is excluded.

“PARTY” – Y new.

“PARTY” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAMP” – M new.

“CRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAWL” – W, L new.

“TRAWL” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAFT” – T new.

“CRAFT” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRACK” – K new.

“TRACK” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAWL” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“GRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“FRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“BRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

Hmm – any word that moves R out of slot 2 and A out of slot 1?

A better word: “DRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“RADIO” – O excluded.

“RAPID” – R in slot 1 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), P, I, D new.

“RAPID” – R is in slot 1 (previously in slot 2, so allowed), A in slot 2 (previously in slot 1, so allowed), P, I, D new.

This seems valid: R and A are both moved to new positions, and new letters P, I, D are introduced.

Thus: RAPID

Guess 2: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary so far:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2.
- A is in the word and is in position 2.
- P is in the word but not in position 3.
- O, S, E, I, D are NOT in the word.

Known facts:
1. The word has structure: _ A _ _ _
2. It must contain: R (not in 1 or 2), P (not in 3), A
3. It must NOT contain: O, S, E, I, D

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y

We need 3 more unique letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- Position 1: any letter except R, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 3: any letter except P, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 4: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Position 5: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Also R and P must appear somewhere in one of these three remaining slots.

Since A is fixed in slot 2, the word form is: X A Y Z W
We must place R somewhere in X, Y, Z, W (but not X=1 because R can’t be in position 1 from feedback)
Similarly P must be in one of these four positions but not in position 3 (from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements of R and P, then choose remaining letters.

Option 1: R in position 3
   Then P cannot be in position 3, so P must be in 1, 4, or 5
   Word form: X A R Z W with P in 1,4,5
   Candidates:
   - P A R _ _ → PAR__ but A is in slot 2 so this is P A R _ _ → already P in 1, A in 2, R in 3
     Need two more letters from allowed set for slots 4,5.
     Try P A R K_ → PARK_ but need 5 letters, so PARK + Y → PARKY (Y allowed)
     PARKY uses P, A, R, K, Y – all allowed and satisfies constraints.

Option 2: R in position 4
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   So P in 1 or 5
   Candidates:
   - P A _ R _ → P A _ R _ → need letters for 3 and 5 from allowed set
     P A C R T → PACRT but C, T allowed
   - _ A _ R P → but P is in 5, but feedback says P is not in 3 (this is ok)

Option 3: R in position 5
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   Candidates:
   - P A _ _ R → P A N C R (N, C allowed)
   - _ A P _ R → but P is in 3 which is excluded, so invalid

Looking at the most straightforward option that uses new common letters, PARKY seems ok but Y might be less common.

Another check: P A R K Y – check constraints:
- R is not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 3) ✓
- A is in 2 ✓
- P is not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

Another candidate: P A N C R – but P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, C in 4, R in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 5) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- Valid word? PANCR is not a word. So discard.

Next: P A R T Y – P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, Y in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (in 3) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- PARTY is a valid word.

PARTY seems slightly better than PARKY as T is more common than K.

Let’s verify PARTY:
- P in 1 (ok, P not excluded from 1)
- A in 2 (exact match)
- R in 3 (ok, R not in 1 or 2)
- T in 4 (new letter)
- Y in 5 (new letter)
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Thus PARTY is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, a good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because:

1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are among the most frequent in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. It can potentially reveal multiple correct letters in multiple positions

This approach maximizes the information gained from the first guess, which is crucial in a 6-try limit game.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains A (but not in slot 1) and R (but not in slot 2), and none of O, S, E.

Letters known so far: A, R (both misplaced)
Letters excluded: O, S, E

Next, I want to:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce several new high-frequency consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.

Good next candidates should include A and R shifted to different slots, and bring in fresh common letters like T, I, N, L, etc.

A word like “TRAIN” or “RAINT” would test A and R in new positions plus new letters, but note that A is already confirmed, so let’s try to place A and R differently while also introducing T, I, N.

Let’s choose “TRAIN”
- T is new (high-frequency consonant)
- R is moved to slot 2 (was in slot 2 previously, but must move) – wait, feedback says R is in the word but not in slot 2, so slot 2 is invalid. Let’s instead move R to slot 3.
- A is in slot 1 is invalid (feedback says A is not in slot 1), so A must go in slots 2-5.
- I and N are new.

An alternative word that places A and R not in their previous positions and introduces new letters is “BRAIN” – but B hasn’t been tested, and it has R in slot 2 which was just marked wrong. So avoid R in slot 2.

Another good choice: “RATIO” – but O is excluded.

Another: “GRAIN” – but G is less common and R is in slot 2.

“FRAIL” – F less common, R in slot 2.

“DRAIN” – D less common, R in slot 2.

“TRAIL” – T, R, A, I, L – this looks better:
- R is in slot 2 (invalid, was in slot 2 before)
So skip.

Another: “TRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRIAD” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TAPIR” – R in slot 5 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), but P, I less common.

“PAINT” – A in slot 2 (ok), R not present – need R.

“CHANT” – no A.

“CRANE” – E excluded.

“CRAMP” – M, P introduced.

“CRANK” – N, K introduced.

“CRANT” – N, T introduced.

“CRANT” is 5 letters, uses C, R, A, N, T – all new (except A, R confirmed). R not in slot 2 (here it's slot 2 again, so invalid).

This is tricky – need to place R not in slot 2 and A not in slot 1.

Let’s pick “CARTS” – C, A, R, T, S – but S is excluded.

“PARTY” – Y new.

“PARTY” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAMP” – M new.

“CRASH” – S excluded.

“TRAWL” – W, L new.

“TRAWL” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAFT” – T new.

“CRAFT” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“TRACK” – K new.

“TRACK” has R in slot 2 (invalid).

“CRAWL” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“GRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“FRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“BRANT” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

Hmm – any word that moves R out of slot 2 and A out of slot 1?

A better word: “DRAIN” – R in slot 2 (invalid).

“RADIO” – O excluded.

“RAPID” – R in slot 1 (ok), A in slot 2 (ok), P, I, D new.

“RAPID” – R is in slot 1 (previously in slot 2, so allowed), A in slot 2 (previously in slot 1, so allowed), P, I, D new.

This seems valid: R and A are both moved to new positions, and new letters P, I, D are introduced.

Thus: RAPID

- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2.
- A is in the word and is in position 2.
- P is in the word but not in position 3.
- O, S, E, I, D are NOT in the word.

Known facts:
1. The word has structure: _ A _ _ _
2. It must contain: R (not in 1 or 2), P (not in 3), A
3. It must NOT contain: O, S, E, I, D

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y

We need 3 more unique letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with:
- Position 1: any letter except R, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 3: any letter except P, O, S, E, I, D
- Position 4: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Position 5: any letter except O, S, E, I, D
- Also R and P must appear somewhere in one of these three remaining slots.

Since A is fixed in slot 2, the word form is: X A Y Z W
We must place R somewhere in X, Y, Z, W (but not X=1 because R can’t be in position 1 from feedback)
Similarly P must be in one of these four positions but not in position 3 (from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements of R and P, then choose remaining letters.

Option 1: R in position 3
   Then P cannot be in position 3, so P must be in 1, 4, or 5
   Word form: X A R Z W with P in 1,4,5
   Candidates:
   - P A R _ _ → PAR__ but A is in slot 2 so this is P A R _ _ → already P in 1, A in 2, R in 3
     Need two more letters from allowed set for slots 4,5.
     Try P A R K_ → PARK_ but need 5 letters, so PARK + Y → PARKY (Y allowed)
     PARKY uses P, A, R, K, Y – all allowed and satisfies constraints.

Option 2: R in position 4
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   So P in 1 or 5
   Candidates:
   - P A _ R _ → P A _ R _ → need letters for 3 and 5 from allowed set
     P A C R T → PACRT but C, T allowed
   - _ A _ R P → but P is in 5, but feedback says P is not in 3 (this is ok)

Option 3: R in position 5
   Then P must be in 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 3 from feedback)
   Candidates:
   - P A _ _ R → P A N C R (N, C allowed)
   - _ A P _ R → but P is in 3 which is excluded, so invalid

Looking at the most straightforward option that uses new common letters, PARKY seems ok but Y might be less common.

Another check: P A R K Y – check constraints:
- R is not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 3) ✓
- A is in 2 ✓
- P is not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

Another candidate: P A N C R – but P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, C in 4, R in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (it’s in 5) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (it’s in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- Valid word? PANCR is not a word. So discard.

Next: P A R T Y – P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, Y in 5
Check:
- R not in 1 or 2 (in 3) ✓
- A in 2 ✓
- P not in 3 (in 1) ✓
- No O, S, E, I, D ✓
- PARTY is a valid word.

PARTY seems slightly better than PARKY as T is more common than K.

Let’s verify PARTY:
- P in 1 (ok, P not excluded from 1)
- A in 2 (exact match)
- R in 3 (ok, R not in 1 or 2)
- T in 4 (new letter)
- Y in 5 (new letter)
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Thus PARTY is a good next guess.

It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)\n4.

Introduce several new high-frequency consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.\n\nGood next candidates should include A and R shifted to different slots, and bring in fresh common letters like T, I, N, L, etc.\n\nA word like “TRAIN” or “RAINT” would test A and R in new positions plus new letters, but note that A is already confirmed, so let’s try to place A and R differently while also introducing T, I, N.\n\nLet’s choose “TRAIN”\n- T is new (high-frequency consonant)\n- R is moved to slot 2 (was in slot 2 previously, but must move) – wait, feedback says R is in the word but not in slot 2, so slot 2 is invalid.
