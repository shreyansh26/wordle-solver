For the first guess, since there's no information yet, I'll choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. Common consonants in English include S, T, R, N, L, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U.

A common strategy is to use a word that has 3-4 common consonants and 1-2 common vowels. Words like ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular choices.

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Remaining useful letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We want common consonants or vowels for these gaps. Good candidates:
- Position 3 (must precede E): common consonants like C, D, L, M, P, U(used as consonant sound), etc.
- Position 4: likewise.

Possible words that fit:

- STUPE – has U (allowed) and P, but U is vowel-like here.

From the most recent feedback (STILE → S✓ T✓ I× L✓ E✓) we now know:

1. Fixed positions: S _ _ L E  (positions 1, 4, 5 are locked)
2. Forbidden letters: A, R, O, N, I  
3. We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3, none of which may be any of the forbidden letters.

Letters still allowed (and reasonably common):
- Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S (but S already used), T (already used), V, W, X, Y, Z  
- Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

We want common letter pairs for positions 2-3 that fit S _ _ L E.

Good candidate digraphs:  
- “CH” → SC H L E  → SCHE… not a valid 5-letter word.  
- “CK” → S C K L E → “SCKLE” invalid.  
- “UM” → S U M L E → “SUMLE” invalid.  
- “UG” → S U G L E → “SUGLE” invalid.  
- “UB” → S U B L E → “SUBLE” invalid.  
- “UF” → S U F L E → “SUFLE” invalid.  
- “UM” again → nothing.  
- “UT” → S U T L E → “SUTLE” invalid.  
- “UP” → S U P L E → “SUPLE” invalid.  
- “UD” → S U D L E → “SUDLE” invalid.  
- “UD” again → nothing.

Let me step back and list every valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern S _ _ L E and contains none of the forbidden letters:

1. “SMILE” – but I is forbidden → discard.  
2. “STYLE” – Y is allowed, T is used, L,E used → letters used so far OK.  
3. “STALE” – A forbidden → discard.  
4. “SCALE” – A forbidden → discard.  
5. “STOLE” – O forbidden → discard.  
6. “SWILE” – not a word.  
7. “SHULE” – not standard.  
8. “SPULE” – not standard.  
9. “SABLE” – A forbidden → discard.  
10. “SUBLE” – not standard.

The only remaining common word that fits is “STYLE”.

- It uses Y (allowed) and T (already confirmed).  
- It avoids all forbidden letters A, R, O, N, I.

Therefore, “STYLE” is the logical next guess.
