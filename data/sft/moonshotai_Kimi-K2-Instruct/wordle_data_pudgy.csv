For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me gather information about as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word (each received an “x”).  
That wipes out the common letters A, E, I, S, R. I need a new set of completely different letters to maximize information gain.

Good next-step letters that are still usable:
- High-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, M, D
- Remaining vowels: O, U  

A word like “CLOUT” would cover C, L, O, U, T—none of which were in RAISE, so they’re all still possible.

So far we know the secret word:
- does not contain R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T (all received “x”)
- does contain U (from CLOUT’s feedback U(-)) but U is NOT in position 4

N, D, M, P, G, H, K, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.  
Among the vowels, only U is known to appear; the rest are excluded.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". \n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E\n- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E\n- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E\n- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice because it includes:\n- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which are very common in 5-letter words\n- 2 very common consonants (R, S)\nThis should give me good information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word (each received an “x”).  \nThat wipes out the common letters A, E, I, S, R. I need a new set of completely different letters to maximize information gain.\n\nGood next-step letters that are still usable:\n- High-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, M, D\n- Remaining vowels: O, U  \n\nA word like “CLOUT” would cover C, L, O, U, T—none of which were in RAISE, so they’re all still possible.\n\n“CLOUT” is a valid 5-letter word and gives me five fresh letters to test.\n\n<guess>CLOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CLOUT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know the secret word:\n- does not contain R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T (all received “x”)\n- does contain U (from CLOUT’s feedback U(-)) but U is NOT in position 4\n\nAvailable letters (high-frequency ones still unused):  \nN, D, M, P, G, H, K, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.  \nAmong the vowels, only U is known to appear; the rest are excluded.\n\nI want a word that:\n- uses U in a different position (not 4)  \n- contains several of the remaining high-frequency consonants  \n- avoids all already-ruled-out letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T)\n\nA good candidate is “MOUND”:\n- M, N, D are still possible  \n- O is already ruled out — whoops.  \nTry “HUMPY”:\n- H, M, P, Y possible; U in position 2  \n“BUMPY” – same issue, B not ruled out, but we still want high info.  \n“FUNKY” – F, N, K, Y; U in position 2  \n“GUNKY” – G, U, N, K, Y  \nAll consonants plus U are fresh.\n\n“GUNKY” seems clean and informative.\n\nDouble-check: G, U, N, K, Y – none of these were in the “x” list, and U changes position.\n\nSo next guess: GUNKY\n\n<guess>GUNKY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CLOUT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: GUNKY -> FEEDBACK: G(-) U(✓) N(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the three guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R, A, I, S, E are all excluded.
2. CLOUT → C, L, O, T are excluded; U exists somewhere (not in position 4).
3. GUNKY → G exists somewhere (not in position 1), U is in the correct position (position 2), N and K are excluded, and Y is in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- U is the second letter: _ U _ _ _
- Y is the last letter: _ U _ _ Y
- G exists somewhere (positions 3 or 4)
- Remaining possible letters (from unused high-frequency ones): B, D, F, H, M, P, V, W, etc., excluding the letters already ruled out.

Looking for 5-letter words matching the pattern _ U _ _ Y with G in either third or fourth position. Possible candidates:
- BUGGY – but G appears twice and we’ve only confirmed one G exists.
- DUDGY – not valid.
- FUDGY – not valid.
- HUGGY – two Gs again.
- MUDDY – two Ds (but D isn’t confirmed yet).
- PUDGY – possible: P, U, D, G, Y with G in position 4.

""PUDGY"" fits:
- P U D G Y
- Uses P, D, G (all still possible letters)
- U in position 2 (✓)
- Y in position 5 (✓)
- G in position 4 is allowed (since we know G exists but not in position 1)

This should give maximal information.
