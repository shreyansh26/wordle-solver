For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities early
3. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gained

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has a good balance of common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), and none of these letters are too rare. This should give us valuable information about the presence/absence of these letters and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word at all
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: x → not in the word at all
- N: - → N is in the word but not in slot 4
- E: x → not in the word at all

What we now know:
- The word definitely contains N, but not in position 4.
- It contains none of C, R, A, E.

We need to avoid all of C, R, A, E. We also need to place N somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
A good next guess should:
1. Include N in a new position
2. Use a fresh set of very common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet
3. Still be a valid 5-letter English word

Common remaining high-frequency letters (ignoring the eliminated ones) include S, T, L, I, O, D, U, M, P, B, etc.  
Because the vowels A and E are out, the remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y.  
Let’s craft a new guess that brings in several fresh letters and places N somewhere new (say, position 3).

A candidate word is SOUND:
- S – fresh, highly common
- O – fresh vowel
- U – fresh vowel
- N – already confirmed to be in the word, placed now in slot 3
- D – fresh consonant

Contains common letters that appear frequently in English words\n2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities early\n3. Doesn\'t repeat any letters to maximize information gained\n\nSome strong starting words include:\n- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)\n- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)\n- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as it has a good balance of common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), and none of these letters are too rare.

Current knowledge:

- Letters not in the word at all: C, R, A, E, S, O, U, D, F, Y  
- Letters known to be in the word:
  – N in position 1 (✓ fixed)
  – I somewhere (✓), but not in position 2 (because we had I in position 2 and it only got ✓, not ✓ for position 2) → wait, no: in NIFTY we had N(✓) I(✓) F(x) T(-) Y(x).  
    That actually means:
      N(✓): N is correct in position 1.
      I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
      T(-): T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: must be T, but T(-) means T is in the word but NOT here → so T must be in position 3 or 5.
- Position 5: ?

Also, remaining letters we haven't ruled out and that are common: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with N I _ _ _, with T somewhere in positions 3 or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- NITTY → but Y is ruled out.
- NIGHT → uses G and H, both allowed.
- NINTH → N is duplicated (but second N would have to be in position 3, but we already have N in position 1, so duplicate N is allowed if the word has two Ns).
- KILNS, but that doesn't start with N/I.
- NITRO: but R and O are ruled out.

Let's check NIGHT:
- N I G H T
- N and I are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- G and H are new letters.
- T placed in position 5 (allowed since T(-) means not in position 4).

This seems a good check.

Another option: NITTY → but Y is out.
Another: NINTH → uses T in position 4, but T(-) says T is not in position 4 → invalid.

Thus, NIGHT is the best next guess.
