- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good coverage of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The word should also avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

A common and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This allows me to quickly narrow down which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word based on the feedback.

From the new feedback on SAINT:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I, N, T are NOT in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- 1st letter: S ✓
- Letters definitely present: S (pos 1), A (somewhere not pos 1 or 2)
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E, I, N, T

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A not in positions 1 or 2
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, E, I, N, T)

Good fresh consonants to try next are C, L, M, P, D, etc. A likely pattern for the remaining four letters is S A _ _ _ with A in 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

Candidate words:
- SCAMP (but has P at 5, A at 3) – but P is new, C, M are new
- SLACK – A at 3, C, K, L new
- SALAD – repeat A, but gives two As
- SCARF – but R excluded
- SAMBA – B new, A at 3, M new, but ends with A (position 5), which would test A twice

Simplest first: choose a word with new consonants and only one A, placed in 3rd or 4th.

Let’s try SLASH:
- S ✓ at 1
- L new
- A at 3 (allowed)
- S at 4 (allowed – duplicate S is okay; it just repeats info on S)
- H new

But SLASH repeats S in 4th – might not add much info. Better to avoid duplicate letters now.

From the latest feedback:

- S ✓ in position 1 (fixed)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A ✓ in position 3 (fixed)
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- K is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

Current known letters:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: A
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E, I, N, T, L, C
- Letters still allowed and present: K (but not in 5), A (already placed at 3), plus any other letters not yet tested (B, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.)

Pattern so far: S _ A _ _

We need:
- K somewhere in positions 2, 4 (since it can’t be 5)  
- The remaining letters must be from the allowed set.

Candidate words fitting S _ A _ _:
- S B A K _  – but need a valid word
- S H A K _  – “SHAKY” or “SHAKO”
- S M A K _  – “SMAKY” is not valid
- S P A K _  – “SPAKY” is not valid
- S D A K _  – “SDAK_” is not valid
- S A K _ _ – but A is already at 3
- S _ A K _ – K at 4
- S _ A _ K – K at 5 is invalid (feedback says K not at 5)

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words fitting S _ A K _:
- SHAKY – S H A K Y
- SHAKO – S H A K O (but O is invalid)
- SHAKE – S H A K E (E is invalid)
- SKANK – invalid letters
- SMACK – C is invalid
- SNARK – R, N invalid
- SPANK – N invalid
- STALK – T, L invalid

Valid option: SHAKY (H, Y are new and allowed)

Check constraints:
- S ✓1, A ✓3  
- K in 4 (allowed)  
- H and Y are new and allowed  
- No forbidden letters

Thus, SHAKY satisfies all constraints.
