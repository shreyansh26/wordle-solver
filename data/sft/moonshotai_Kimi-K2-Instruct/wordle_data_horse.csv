For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants that might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, O: common vowels
- R, S: common consonants
- E: most common letter in English

This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters that could be in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓).

So we know:
- Word ends in ‑SE
- It contains R and O somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively
- It does NOT contain A

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 4 is S and 5 is E, so positions 1 or 3)
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is S and 5 is E, so positions 1 or 2)

I need a new word that:
1. Ends in SE
2. Contains both R and O in one of their allowed positions
3. Doesn’t repeat any letters already confirmed or eliminated

Let me try “ROUSE”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses new letters U and S (S already confirmed in 4) but this would have S in 3 instead of 4 → invalid because S must be in 4.

Next candidate: “HORSE”
- H new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- S in 4 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints.
