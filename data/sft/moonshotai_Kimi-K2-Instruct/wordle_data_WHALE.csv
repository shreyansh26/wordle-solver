For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is somewhere in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It has an A somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, S at all.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, S): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since A must be in one of positions 2-4, and we want to test new common letters, a good next guess is ""TALKE"":
- T: common consonant test
- A: must be in the word (position 2 here)
- L: common consonant test
- K: common consonant test
- E: already known to be in position 5 (matches here)

This tests several new common letters while incorporating the known constraints.

From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

   - Contains A but not in position 1.
   - Does NOT contain R, O, S.

2. TALKE → T(x) A(-) L(-) K(x) E(✓)
   - T, K are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is still in position 5.

So we now know:
- Pos 5 = E
- Pos 1,3,4: not yet fixed
- Letters in the word: A, L, E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, K
- A can be in pos 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2)
- L can be in pos 1, 2, 4, 5 (but pos 5 is E, so 1, 2, or 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains A and L (with the above position constraints).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

The most common consonants remaining (excluding banned ones) are N, D, M, G, H, B, C, F, P, etc.

Try to place A in pos 3 and L in pos 2: _ L A _ E.
We need a first letter; trying N gives N L A _ E → NLAE_ is invalid, but NLA_E is not a word.
Try A in pos 4 and L in pos 1: L _ _ A E. Common word: LEAVE → but V and E are allowed, V wasn't banned.

Let's combine all the information we have so far:

Known facts
- Position 5 = E  (from every guess)
- Position 3 = A  (from Guess 3 feedback)
- The word contains L (from Guess 2 feedback) but L is not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, T, K, V.

Current pattern
_ _ A _ E  (with the last E and the A in position 3 locked)

We still need
- One more letter that must include L somewhere (positions 2 or 4).
- Two additional letters chosen only from the still-allowed consonants:  
  B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the banned ones).

Plausible placements
1. L in position 2 → _ L A _ E

2. L in position 4 → _ _ A L E
   Example real five-letter words: DALLE, HALLE (not common), PAGLE (invalid), CABLE, FABLE, GABLE, MAPLE.

Among these, let’s pick one that uses common remaining consonants and hasn’t been tried yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is somewhere in the word but not in position 1.
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It has an A somewhere in positions 2-4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, S at all.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, S): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since A must be in one of positions 2-4, and we want to test new common letters, a good next guess is ""TALKE"":
- T: common consonant test
- A: must be in the word (position 2 here)
- L: common consonant test
- K: common consonant test
- E: already known to be in position 5 (matches here)

This tests several new common letters while incorporating the known constraints.

<guess>TALKE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TALKE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(-) K(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two clues so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends in E.
   - Contains A but not in position 1.
   - Does NOT contain R, O, S.

2. TALKE → T(x) A(-) L(-) K(x) E(✓)
   - T, K are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is still in position 5.

So we now know:
- Pos 5 = E
- Pos 1,3,4: not yet fixed
- Letters in the word: A, L, E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, K
- A can be in pos 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2)
- L can be in pos 1, 2, 4, 5 (but pos 5 is E, so 1, 2, or 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains A and L (with the above position constraints).
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

The most common consonants remaining (excluding banned ones) are N, D, M, G, H, B, C, F, P, etc.

Try to place A in pos 3 and L in pos 2: _ L A _ E.
We need a first letter; trying N gives N L A _ E → NLAE_ is invalid, but NLA_E is not a word.
Try A in pos 4 and L in pos 1: L _ _ A E. Common word: LEAVE → but V and E are allowed, V wasn't banned.
Check: LEAVE
- L in pos 1: allowed (no feedback yet on pos 1)
- E in pos 2: allowed (no info)
- A in pos 4: allowed
- V: not banned
- E in pos 5: matches known info.

So ""LEAVE"" is a valid next guess.
