For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Some good starting words include those with common vowels and consonants. Let me think of a word that includes common letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, etc.

Good candidates might be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""STARE"" is particularly good because it uses S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters in English. This will help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback:

- Cannot contain S, T, A, E at all.

From the two feedbacks so far:

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)  
   – S, T, A, E are not in the word at all.  
   – R is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is in the word again but not in position 1.  
   – O and U are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   – N and D are not in the word.

So the secret word must:
- contain R (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
- contain O (but not in position 2).  
- contain U (but not in position 3).  
- not contain S, T, A, E, N, D.

Vowels still available: I (since O and U are already known to be present).  
Consonants still common and allowable: C, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, O, U and two other allowed letters. The positions of O and U are restricted.

Possible structure:  
- R could be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- O could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- U could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try ""CORGI"":
- Letters: C, O, R, G, I.  
  – R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  – O is in position 2 (from ROUND feedback: O is in the word but not in position 2 → CONFLICT, so O cannot be in position 2).  
Thus ""CORGI"" is invalid because O is in position 2.

Instead, try ""PROUD"":
- P, R, O, U, D.  
  – D is forbidden from ROUND feedback → invalid.

Try ""CURIO"":
- C, U, R, I, O.  
  – R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  – U is in position 2 (allowed, because in ROUND U was not in position 3).  
  – O is in position 5 (allowed, because in ROUND O was not in position 2).  
  – Contains only allowed letters (no S, T, A, E, N, D).  
  – All letters are distinct and fit the constraints.

Let's summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)  
   – S, T, A, E are **not** in the word at all.  
   – R is in the word, but **not** in position 4.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
   – U is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – N and D are **not** in the word.

3. CURIO → C(x) U(-) R(-) I(x) O(-)  
   – C and I are **not** in the word at all.  
   – U is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
   – R is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So the secret word must:
- contain R (positions 2 or 5 only, because it must avoid positions 1, 3, 4)  
- contain O (must avoid positions 2 and 5)  
- contain U (must avoid positions 2 and 3)  
- not contain S, T, A, E, N, D, C, I.

Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
Allowed vowels left: none except O and U already accounted for.

Positions to fill: 5-letter word with R, O, U each in allowed spots.

Let's map possible positions:

R can only be in 2 or 5.
O can be in 1, 3, 4.
U can be in 1, 4, 5 (but not overlapping with R or O).

Case 1: R in position 2  
Then O can be 1, 3, or 4; U can be 1, 4, or 5, avoiding O's spot.

Example:  
- O in 1, U in 4 → O _ R U _  
  Needs two more letters in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 must be R (already used), so impossible.

- O in 1, U in 5 → O _ R _ U  
  Pos 3 and 4 need letters. But pos 3 is R (already used), so impossible.

- O in 3, U in 1 or 4 or 5:  
  - U in 1: U _ R O _  
  - U in 4: _ _ R O U  
  - U in 5: _ _ R O U  

- O in 4, U in 1 or 5:  
  - U in 1: U _ R _ O  
  - U in 5: _ _ R U O  

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then O can be 1, 3, 4; U can be 1, 4.

Example:  
- O in 1, U in 4 → O _ _ U R  
- O in 3, U in 1 or 4:  
  - U in 1: U _ O _ R  
  - U in 4: _ _ O U R (but O cannot be in 3 and U in 4 simultaneously because R is in 5) – no, this is valid.

Looking for actual words fitting these patterns:

From Case 1:  
- U _ R O _ → U _ R O _  
  Need two more letters. Possible word: ""FUROR"" – but R is in pos 3 (invalid), and O is in pos 4 (allowed). Wait, FUROR is F U R O R, which has R in 3 (invalid from CURIO feedback).  

From Case 2:  
- O _ _ U R  
  O _ _ U R: ""FORUM"" – F, O, R, U, M. R is in pos 3 (invalid).  
  ""HUMOR"" – H, U, M, O, R. R is in 5 (valid), U in 2 (invalid from CURIO feedback).  
  ""TUMOR"" – T is invalid.  
  ""GOURD"" – D is invalid.  
  ""BOURG"" – B, O, U, R, G. R is in 4 (invalid).  

- U _ O _ R  
  ""VIGOR"" – V, I, G, O, R. I is invalid.  
  ""BUGLE"" – B, U, G, L, E. E is invalid.  

- _ _ O U R  
  ""MOURN"" – N is invalid.  
  ""BOURN"" – N is invalid.  
  ""BOURD"" – D is invalid.  

- U _ R _ O  
  ""PURGE"" – E is invalid.  
  ""LURCH"" – C and H, but C is invalid.  

- _ _ R U O  
  ""BRUJO"" – B, R, U, J, O. R is in 2 (valid), U in 3 (invalid).  

- _ _ R O U  
  ""GROUP"" – G, R, O, U, P. R is in 2 (valid), O in 3 (valid), U in 4 (valid). This seems to fit perfectly.

Let's verify GROUP:
- Letters: G, R, O, U, P.  
- No forbidden letters (no S, T, A, E, N, D, C, I).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).  
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since must avoid 2 and 5).  
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since must avoid 2 and 3).  

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(x)  
   – S, T, A, E are **not** in the word at all.  
   – R is in the word, but **not** in position 4.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
   – U is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – N and D are **not** in the word.

3. CURIO → C(x) U(-) R(-) I(x) O(-)  
   – C and I are **not** in the word at all.  
   – U is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
   – R is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So the secret word must:
- contain R (positions 2 or 5 only, because it must avoid positions 1, 3, 4)  
- contain O (must avoid positions 2 and 5)  
- contain U (must avoid positions 2 and 3)  
- not contain S, T, A, E, N, D, C, I.

Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
Allowed vowels left: none except O and U already accounted for.

Positions to fill: 5-letter word with R, O, U each in allowed spots.

Let's map possible positions:

R can only be in 2 or 5.
O can be in 1, 3, 4.
U can be in 1, 4, 5 (but not overlapping with R or O).

Case 1: R in position 2  
Then O can be 1, 3, or 4; U can be 1, 4, or 5, avoiding O's spot.

Example:  
- O in 1, U in 4 → O _ R U _  
  Needs two more letters in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 must be R (already used), so impossible.

- O in 1, U in 5 → O _ R _ U  
  Pos 3 and 4 need letters. But pos 3 is R (already used), so impossible.

- O in 3, U in 1 or 4 or 5:  
  - U in 1: U _ R O _  
  - U in 4: _ _ R O U  
  - U in 5: _ _ R O U  

- O in 4, U in 1 or 5:  
  - U in 1: U _ R _ O  
  - U in 5: _ _ R U O  

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then O can be 1, 3, 4; U can be 1, 4.

Example:  
- O in 1, U in 4 → O _ _ U R  
- O in 3, U in 1 or 4:  
  - U in 1: U _ O _ R  
  - U in 4: _ _ O U R (but O cannot be in 3 and U in 4 simultaneously because R is in 5) – no, this is valid.

Looking for actual words fitting these patterns:

From Case 1:  
- U _ R O _ → U _ R O _  
  Need two more letters. Possible word: ""FUROR"" – but R is in pos 3 (invalid), and O is in pos 4 (allowed). Wait, FUROR is F U R O R, which has R in 3 (invalid from CURIO feedback).  

From Case 2:  
- O _ _ U R  
  O _ _ U R: ""FORUM"" – F, O, R, U, M. R is in pos 3 (invalid).  
  ""HUMOR"" – H, U, M, O, R. R is in 5 (valid), U in 2 (invalid from CURIO feedback).  
  ""TUMOR"" – T is invalid.  
  ""GOURD"" – D is invalid.  
  ""BOURG"" – B, O, U, R, G. R is in 4 (invalid).  

- U _ O _ R  
  ""VIGOR"" – V, I, G, O, R. I is invalid.  
  ""BUGLE"" – B, U, G, L, E. E is invalid.  

- _ _ O U R  
  ""MOURN"" – N is invalid.  
  ""BOURN"" – N is invalid.  
  ""BOURD"" – D is invalid.  

- U _ R _ O  
  ""PURGE"" – E is invalid.  
  ""LURCH"" – C and H, but C is invalid.  

- _ _ R U O  
  ""BRUJO"" – B, R, U, J, O. R is in 2 (valid), U in 3 (invalid).  

- _ _ R O U  
  ""GROUP"" – G, R, O, U, P. R is in 2 (valid), O in 3 (valid), U in 4 (valid). This seems to fit perfectly.

Let's verify GROUP:
- Letters: G, R, O, U, P.  
- No forbidden letters (no S, T, A, E, N, D, C, I).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
