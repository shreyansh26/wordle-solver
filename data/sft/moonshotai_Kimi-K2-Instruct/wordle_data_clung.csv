Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a word with common letters that will give me good coverage of the alphabet. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with several of these common letters to quickly eliminate many possibilities.

One popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) covering different positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

However, another strong choice is ""SLATE"" which has:
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- 3 common consonants (S, L, T) that appear in many words

Between these, ""SLATE"" might give slightly better coverage of common consonants, so I'll go with that.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has:
- Known letter: L in position 2
- Cannot contain: S, A, T, E

I need a 5-letter word with L as its second letter and none of S, A, T, E. Good consonants to test next are R, N, D, C, M, B, etc., and the remaining vowels (I, O, U).

Possible patterns: _ L _ _ _

Let me think of a word that fits this pattern and uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is ""FLING"" because:
- L is in position 2 (matches known)
- Doesn't contain S, A, T, E
- Uses common letters F, I, N, G

Another option could be ""CLIMB"" but M is less common than N. ""FLING"" seems better.

Alternatively ""BLIND"" but D is less common than N. I think ""FLING"" is the best choice here.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → L is in position 2, and letters S, A, T, E are absent.
2. FLING → L is in position 2, and letters I, F are absent, but letters N and G are in the word (positions unknown, since they are marked ✓ but not placed).

So the pattern so far is:  
_ L _ N G  (since N and G were marked ✓, meaning they are present but their positions could be anywhere)

But we also know:
- No S, A, T, E, I, F.

We need a word that:
- Has L in position 2.
- Contains N and G somewhere (not necessarily in positions 3 and 5).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E, I, F.

Letters left to try: common ones are R, D, O, U, M, etc.

Let’s list possible placements of N and G in a 5-letter word with L in position 2:

Possible positions for N and G (excluding positions already taken by L):
- N could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- G could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not same as N)

Given that N and G are both present, and we don’t know their positions, one strong candidate is ""CLUNG"" because:
- L is in position 2 (matches).
- Contains N and G (matches).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E, I, F (matches).
- Uses C and U which are still viable.

Another candidate could be ""PLONG"" but O is less constrained here and P is less common. ""CLUNG"" seems better.

Let’s verify:
- C: allowed (not in forbidden list)
- L: position 2 (correct)
- U: allowed
- N: present (✓)
- G: present (✓)

This seems like the best next guess to lock in N and G positions or get more info.
