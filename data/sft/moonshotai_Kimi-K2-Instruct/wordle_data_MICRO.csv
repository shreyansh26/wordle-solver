Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I need to choose a word that will give maximum information. A good first word should contain common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word. I'll use a word with common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

""SLATE"" is a good choice because:
- It contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It has both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing the chance to get information about 5 different letters

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means our next guess should use a completely different set of letters, ideally still covering common consonants and vowels that weren’t tried.

Good remaining common letters:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, Y, etc.

From the first two guesses:

- SLATE: all letters (S, L, A, T, E) are excluded.
- ROUND: U, N, D are excluded; R and O are in the word but not in their guessed positions (positions 1 and 2 respectively).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R (not in pos 1), O (not in pos 2)
- Letters definitely out: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D

Remaining common letters to try: I, C, M, P, H, G, B, K, Y, F, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Contains both R and O in different positions (R ≠ pos 1, O ≠ pos 2)
2. Introduces three new common consonants/vowels that haven’t been tried
3. Uses no eliminated letters

Candidate: “CROOK” – but it repeats O, which is inefficient for information.  
Next candidate: “CHIRP” – uses C, H, I, R, P.  
- R is in position 4 (allowed: not 1)  
- O is missing, so we need a word that includes O.

Better candidate: “PRIMO”
- Has both R (pos 2) and O (pos 5)
- R is not in pos 1 (ok), O is not in pos 2 (ok)
- Uses new letters P, R, I, M, O – none of which are excluded
- No duplicates

  – Eliminated letters (never appear): S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, P.

- Therefore:
  1. R must be in position 4.
  2. O is fixed in position 5.
  3. We still need three more letters from the unused pool: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, X, Y, Z plus I and M placed appropriately.

- Possible skeleton: _ _ _ R O
- We must place I and M somewhere in the first three positions, neither in their previously attempted positions (I cannot be in position 3, M cannot be in position 4).  
  – M can be in 1, 2, or 3.
  – I can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 3 if we want to avoid repetition).

- To maximize coverage of new common letters, we can try:
  – M in 1, I in 2 → M I _ R O → need a consonant in 3.
    Good common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, etc.
    “MICRO” uses C in 3: M I C R O
    – All letters unused so far.
    – I is not in position 3 (ok), M not in position 4 (ok).
    – R is in 4 (allowed), O is in 5 (confirmed).

So “MICRO” is a logical next guess that fits every constraint.

<guess>MICRO</guess>",MICRO,"- Known so far:
  – O is in position 5 (✓).
  – R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (it was “-” at positions 1 and 2 and now position 3).
    → R can only be in position 4.
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
  – M is in the word but NOT in position 4.
