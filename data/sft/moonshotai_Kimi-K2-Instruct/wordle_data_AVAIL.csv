- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify possible letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the top most common letters. This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possible letters and positions.

- Letter N is NOT in the word (x)  
- Letters already confirmed absent: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, C, G, N  

Pattern so far: A _ _ I _

Remaining usable letters (high-frequency ones first):  
Vowels: U (only remaining common vowel)  
Consonants: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a common 5-letter word starting with A, ending with I plus one more letter, with no forbidden letters.  
Possible candidates:
- APHID  (A P H I D) – D is forbidden.  
- AXIOM – O and M forbidden.  
- AFIRE – E and R forbidden.  
- AULIC – C forbidden.  
- ABLIN – uncommon.  
- ALIBI – positions 2 and 3 still need to be filled.

The common word ALIBI satisfies:
- Starts with A, has I in position 4, uses L and B which are still allowed.
- Letters used: A, L, I, B – none are forbidden.

Thus, ALIBI is a strong next guess.",Guess 4: ALIBI -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(-) I(-) B(x) I(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify possible letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the top most common letters. This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possible letters and positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

- A is the correct first letter (✓ in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are all NOT in the word (x in positions 2-5).

We need a 5-letter word starting with A that does not contain R, O, S, or E.  
Good consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, P, etc.  
Let’s look for a pattern A _ _ _ _ without those excluded letters.

Candidate words:  
- ABACK (but C is okay, K is okay – only B, C, K are new letters)  
- ADMIT (D, M, I, T – all fresh)  
- ANCHY (not common)  
- ALPEN (E excluded)  
- ANTLR (R excluded)  
- ADMIT seems strong: A D M I T – none of the excluded letters appear.

Let’s pick ADMIT.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
1. A is in position 1 (✓).
2. I is in position 4 (✓).
3. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.

We need A _ _ I _ , with the middle two letters and the last letter coming only from the remaining unused alphabet (consonants and vowels not yet excluded).

Remaining useful letters include: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common patterns with those letters:
- A B I N K → ABINK (not common)
- A C I N G → ACING (common word, uses C, N, G – none excluded)
- A L I N K → ALINK (not common)
- A P I N G → APING (common)

Both ACING and APING seem good. Between them, ACING has slightly more distinct useful letters (C, N, G) to test, so let’s pick ACING.

Current deductions:

Position map:
1 A ✓
2 ? must be L, I, or another new letter
3 ? must be I or another new letter
4 I ✓
5 ? any new letter

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, C, N, G, B

Letters still allowed: F, H, J, K, P, U, V, W, X, Y, plus the two letters we know exist elsewhere: L and I.

We know:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (ALIBI gave L(-)).
- I is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (ACING and ALIBI each showed I(-)).

Therefore I must be in position 4 (already known ✓) and nowhere else, so we can ignore further I placements.

We now need: A _ _ I _ with the blanks filled only from remaining allowed letters, and L must appear exactly once somewhere in those blanks.

Possible positions for L: 2, 3, or 5.

Candidate words fitting those constraints:
- A L F I K  → ALFIK (uncommon)
- A K I L   → can’t end with L (need 5 letters)
- A P I L   → same issue
- A H I L   → same
- A L U I K → ALUIK (uncommon)
- A V I L   → missing 5th letter
- A K I L L → double L and K is allowed, but repeats L (we don’t yet know if duplicates are allowed)

Actually, let’s focus on common 5-letter English words that fit A _ _ I _ and contain L once among positions 2, 3, 5:

1. APRIL – but P, R, I, L; R is already excluded.
2. APHID – D excluded.
3. AVAIL – A V A I L: second A would be in position 2, but we’ve only confirmed A in position 1. We don’t know if A repeats. We also know L must be at position 5? Let’s test.

AVAIL:
A (✓ position 1)
V (new)
A (new position 2)
I (✓ position 4)
L (allowed at 5)

No forbidden letters (all letters: A, V, A, I, L). It’s a common word. Let’s choose AVAIL.
