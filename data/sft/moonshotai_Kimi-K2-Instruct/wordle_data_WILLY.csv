For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the word's structure regardless of the actual secret word.

All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word.  
That’s very informative: we can immediately eliminate any word that contains any of these five letters.  
So our next guess needs to use none of A, R, O, S, E.

Looking for a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out, good choices include:
- I, U, Y for vowels
- B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc. for consonants

A frequently recommended follow-up to “AROSE” when all letters are missing is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y), because it introduces the remaining common vowels (U, I, Y) and two new consonants (N, T). I’ll use that.

(UNITY contains none of A, R, O, S, E, so it’s valid.)

So far we have:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are **NOT** in the word (x).  
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- Y is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓).  

The secret word ends with Y and contains the letter I somewhere, but not in position 3 (since UNITY gave I(-) at position 3).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Z  
Vowels left: I (already confirmed) and possibly no others (since U, A, O, E are out).

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. ends in Y,
2. contains I exactly once,
3. contains none of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T,
4. does **not** have I in the 3rd position.

Brainstorming such words:

- D I C K Y → contains D, I, C, K, Y → valid (I not in 3rd spot)  
- B I L L Y → B, I, L, Y → repeated L, but allowed → valid (I in 2nd)  
- M I D G Y → M, I, D, G, Y → valid  
- V I C K Y → V, I, C, K, Y → valid  
- L I V I D → ends in D, not Y → discard  
- G I V E Y → contains E and V → discard (E is out)  
- P I N T Y → T is out → discard

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about the word's structure regardless of the actual secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word.  
That’s very informative: we can immediately eliminate any word that contains any of these five letters.  
So our next guess needs to use none of A, R, O, S, E.

Looking for a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out, good choices include:
- I, U, Y for vowels
- B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc. for consonants

A frequently recommended follow-up to “AROSE” when all letters are missing is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y), because it introduces the remaining common vowels (U, I, Y) and two new consonants (N, T). I’ll use that.

(UNITY contains none of A, R, O, S, E, so it’s valid.)

- A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are **NOT** in the word (x).  
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- Y is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓).  

The secret word ends with Y and contains the letter I somewhere, but not in position 3 (since UNITY gave I(-) at position 3).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Z  
Vowels left: I (already confirmed) and possibly no others (since U, A, O, E are out).

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. ends in Y,
2. contains I exactly once,
3. contains none of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T,
4. does **not** have I in the 3rd position.

Brainstorming such words:

- D I C K Y → contains D, I, C, K, Y → valid (I not in 3rd spot)  
- B I L L Y → B, I, L, Y → repeated L, but allowed → valid (I in 2nd)  
- M I D G Y → M, I, D, G, Y → valid  
- V I C K Y → V, I, C, K, Y → valid  
- L I V I D → ends in D, not Y → discard  
- G I V E Y → contains E and V → discard (E is out)  
- P I N T Y → T is out → discard  
- C I G A R → ends in R → discard  

The simplest, common word that meets every rule is “DICKY”.

A frequently recommended follow-up to “AROSE” when all letters are missing is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y), because it introduces the remaining common vowels (U, I, Y) and two new consonants (N, T). I’ll use that.

(UNITY contains none of A, R, O, S, E, so it’s valid.)

<guess>UNITY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

- A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T are **NOT** in the word (x).  
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- Y is in the word and is in the correct (last) position (✓).  

The secret word ends with Y and contains the letter I somewhere, but not in position 3 (since UNITY gave I(-) at position 3).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):  
B C D F G H J K L M P Q V W X Z  
Vowels left: I (already confirmed) and possibly no others (since U, A, O, E are out).

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. ends in Y,
2. contains I exactly once,
3. contains none of A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T,
4. does **not** have I in the 3rd position.

Brainstorming such words:

- D I C K Y → contains D, I, C, K, Y → valid (I not in 3rd spot)  
- B I L L Y → B, I, L, Y → repeated L, but allowed → valid (I in 2nd)  
- M I D G Y → M, I, D, G, Y → valid  
- V I C K Y → V, I, C, K, Y → valid  
- L I V I D → ends in D, not Y → discard  
- G I V E Y → contains E and V → discard (E is out)  
- P I N T Y → T is out → discard  
- C I G A R → ends in R → discard  

The simplest, common word that meets every rule is “DICKY”.  
So I’ll go with that.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: DICKY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed facts:

- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, D, C, K  
- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct position:
  – Y in position 5 (✓)
  – I in position 2 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ Y

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowel: only I (since A, E, O, U are out)

Therefore the secret word must be of the form:
Letter-1: any allowed consonant
Letter-2: I (fixed)
Letter-3: any allowed consonant
Letter-4: any allowed consonant
Letter-5: Y (fixed)

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting this pattern. Let’s list possibilities.

Possible choices:
B I L L Y – uses B, I, L, L, Y → letters all allowed; check duplicates: L appears twice but that’s okay.  
F I L M Y – F, I, L, M, Y – all allowed.  
G I M M Y – G, I, M, M, Y – allowed.  
H I L L Y – H, I, L, L, Y – allowed.  
J I L L Y – J, I, L, L, Y – allowed.  
L I V I D – ends with D (ruled out) – discard.  
M I L K Y – contains K (ruled out) – discard.  
P I L L Y – P, I, L, L, Y – allowed.  
V I L L Y – V, I, L, L, Y – allowed.  
W I L L Y – W, I, L, L, Y – allowed.  
Z I L C H – doesn’t end in Y – discard.  

Among the valid ones, “BILLY” is a very common English word.  
So I’ll guess “BILLY”.

Guess 3: DICKY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: BILLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- B is not in the word (x)  
- I is correct and in position 2 (✓)  
- L is correct and in position 3 (✓)  
- the second L is correct and in position 4 (✓)  
- Y is correct and in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word must be:

_ I L L Y

Only the first letter is unknown, and it must be a consonant that has **not** already been ruled out.  Letters already excluded:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, D, C, K, B

Valid starting consonants left: F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Common English 5-letter words fitting “? I L L Y”:

F I L L Y → “FILLY” (a young female horse)  
G I L L Y → “GILLY” (a type of cricket fielder, also a Scots term)  
H I L L Y → “HILLY” (full of hills)  
J I L L Y → “JILLY” (diminutive of Jill or Jilly)  
P I L L Y → not a standard word  
V I L L Y → “VILLY” (rare, but exists as a diminutive)  
W I L L Y → “WILLY” (common nickname)  

All but “FILLY”, “GILLY”, “HILLY”, “JILLY”, “WILLY” are uncommon or non-words.  
Among these, “FILLY” is arguably the most standard, so I’ll try it.

(If the word were “GILLY”, “HILLY”, etc., the next step would reveal it.)
