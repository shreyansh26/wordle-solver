For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)

This will help determine whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the word.  
That means I can completely ignore those letters when choosing the next guess.  
I should pick a word whose letters have not been ruled out yet and still give broad coverage.  
Good candidates that avoid A, R, O, S, E include:

- UNTIL – common letters, two vowels, three consonants  
- LUNCH – covers U, N, C, H  
- UNITY – uses U, N, I, T, Y  

Among these, “UNTIL” contains very frequent letters (U, N, T, I, L) and has no duplicates, making it a strong second guess to gather new information.

From the feedback:

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, L  
- Letters known to be in the word: N (position 2 confirmed)  
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong spots: U, T, I  

So the pattern is: _ N _ _ _  
Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the “maybe” letters U, T, I whose positions must shift.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 2.  
2. Contains at least one each of U, T, I, but not in their previous spots.  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s place:
- N in position 2.  
- Try to place T in position 1, I in position 4, U in position 5 → T N _ I U  
The missing third letter must be one of the remaining consonants; let’s pick C → T N C I U.  
But “Tnciu” is not a valid English word.

Next arrangement:  
Put T in position 3, I in position 1, U in position 4 → I N T _ U  
Choose the remaining consonant H → “INTHU” – still not valid.

Another arrangement:  
I N _ T U – insert a consonant: D → “INDTU” – invalid.

Swap: put U in position 3, I in position 4, T in position 5 → _ N U I T  
Insert a consonant in position 1: P → “PNUIT” – invalid.

Change strategy: use a known word that satisfies the constraints.  
Look for real English words with N fixed at position 2 and containing U, T, I elsewhere but not in their former spots.

Example:  
“UNITY” – but L was ruled out, Y is still allowed.  
Positions: U (1) N (2) I (3) T (5) Y (4) – but T was wrong in position 3 and now appears in 5; I was wrong in 4 and now appears in 3; U was wrong in 1 and now still in 1 → U remains in the same place where it was wrong, so that’s disallowed.

Next candidate:  
“PINTU” – invalid word.  
“UNTIL” – already used.  
“INPUT” – uses I N P U T.  
Check positions:  
I appears in position 1 (was wrong in 4 – OK)  
N is in 2 – ✅  
P is new – OK  
U appears in 4 (was wrong in 1 – OK)  
T appears in 5 (was wrong in 3 – OK)  

So “INPUT” meets all constraints and is a valid English word.
