For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information I can gather from the feedback. Some of the most common letters in English are A, E, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess would utilize several of these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some correct letters or positions early on.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

Some of the most common letters in English are A, E, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess would utilize several of these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some correct letters or positions early on.\n\nLet me choose AROSE as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).\n- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Pattern: _ R O _ _\n- Letters not in the word: A, S, E\n\nI should now guess a word that:\n- Starts with _ R O _ _\n- Doesn’t contain A, S, or E\n- Uses some new letters to gather more information\n\nPopular 5-letter words that fit _ R O _ _ include:\n- BROIL (but has E adjacent sounds, E is out)\n- CROOK (K is a good letter to test)\n- FROST (S is out)\n- GROIN (N is common)\n- PROUD (D is common)\n- CROWN (but S is out and W might not fit)\n\nI’ll pick ""CROWN"" because it introduces C, W, and N, none of which have been tested yet, and it fits the pattern _ R O _ _ (with R and O in the correct positions).\n\nLet me verify:\n- CROWN: C, R, O, W, N – no A, S, or E present and R and O are in the 2nd and 3rd positions.\n\n<guess>CROWN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CROWN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current knowledge:\n- Pattern: _ R O _ _\n- Letters confirmed OUT: A, S, E, C, W, N\n- Letters confirmed IN (and placed): R (2nd), O (3rd)\n\nThat leaves available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z\nAvailable vowels: I, U  (since A and E are already ruled out)\n\nI need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

Current knowledge:
1. Pattern: _ R O I _   (because the 4th letter in BROIL was I and it got ✓)
2. Letters confirmed OUT so far: A, S, E, C, W, N, B, L
3. Letters confirmed IN (and placed): R (2nd), O (3rd), I (4th)

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants left: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z
- Vowels left: U  (only U hasn’t appeared or been ruled out)

So the word must be: ? R O I ?  
with the fifth letter being one of the available consonants, and the first letter also being an available consonant.

Possible single-letter choices for 1st and 5th positions (must be different if duplicates not allowed, but we’ll assume normal words).

Let’s list a few candidate words that fit “? R O I ?” using the remaining letters:

- DROID – D and D (but D hasn’t been ruled out)
- FROIL – but L is out
- GROIN – G and N; N is out
- PROUD – P and D; U is in 4th but 4th is I
- TROIK – K hasn’t been ruled out
- PRIOR – but R is already in 2nd, duplication allowed, but I is already at 4th
- CRIOL – C is out
- DROIT – D and T, neither is ruled out
- FROST – S is out
- GRIOT – G and T, neither out

Among these, “DROIT” uses only letters not yet ruled out:
D, R, O, I, T – none are on the banned list.  
“TROIK” is another (T, R, O, I, K) – also valid.

Between these, I’ll choose “DROIT” as it’s more common.

Verify:
- D – allowed
- R – known correct at 2nd
- O – known correct at 3rd
- I – known correct at 4th
- T – allowed
No conflicts.
