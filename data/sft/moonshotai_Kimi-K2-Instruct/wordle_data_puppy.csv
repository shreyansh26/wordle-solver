For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some top choices include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (very common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help identify which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in RAISE were marked with an x, so none of R, A, I, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That removes almost all of the most common letters. To keep discovering information efficiently, I should pivot to a word that uses the next-most-common letters that are still “alive.”  
The remaining high-frequency letters include:
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, F, Y

From the two guesses so far:

- R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T are all out.
- The only confirmed letter is U, which is present but not in position 5 (CLOUT had U in position 4, and it received “-”, so U is somewhere else).

Letters still available:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (already located), plus the possibility of Y sometimes acting as a vowel.

Secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ _ with U somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (cannot be 4).

To maximize information, choose a word that:
- Uses U in a new spot.
- Uses several high-frequency remaining consonants and the only remaining standard vowel (Y often behaves like a vowel in 5-letter words).

A good candidate is MUDDY:
- Contains U in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses M, D, D, Y (double D is acceptable per Wordle rules).
- M, D, Y are all still possible letters.

If MUDDY gives more hits, we can refine further.

So far we know:
1. R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T, M, D are all OUT.
2. The word contains U (✓ in position 2) and Y (✓ in position 5).
   Therefore the pattern is: _ U _ _ Y
3. Letters still available:
   Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
   Vowels: none left except U (already placed) and sometimes Y (already placed).

We need three more letters to fill positions 1, 3, and 4, chosen only from the still-available set.

High-frequency choices among remaining letters: B, F, G, H, N, P, K, V.
A good next guess should:
- Place U in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- Use three distinct, high-frequency letters for positions 1, 3, 4.
- Avoid repeating any used letters.

A balanced choice that meets these criteria is BUMPY:
- B (position 1)
- U (position 2, confirmed)
- M is already ruled out, but we can check for M again to confirm. Actually M has been ruled out from feedback 3 (M(x)), so we cannot use M again.

Let’s pick another word with available letters. The set still available for positions 1,3,4 is: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Pick three high-frequency ones: B, N, K → BUNKY
Check:
- B (ok)
- U (position 2, confirmed)
- N (ok)
- K (ok)
- Y (position 5, confirmed)

No letters in BUNKY have been ruled out except for the positions we’re testing. This should give good information.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Some top choices include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (very common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help identify which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in RAISE were marked with an x, so none of R, A, I, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That removes almost all of the most common letters. To keep discovering information efficiently, I should pivot to a word that uses the next-most-common letters that are still “alive.”  
The remaining high-frequency letters include:
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, F, Y  
- Vowels: O, U  

A balanced choice that uses three new consonants plus the remaining common vowels is “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T  
This gives good coverage of still-possible letters while avoiding the five ruled-out letters entirely.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses so far:

- R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T are all out.
- The only confirmed letter is U, which is present but not in position 5 (CLOUT had U in position 4, and it received “-”, so U is somewhere else).

Letters still available:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (already located), plus the possibility of Y sometimes acting as a vowel.

Secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ _ with U somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (cannot be 4).

To maximize information, choose a word that:
- Uses U in a new spot.
- Uses several high-frequency remaining consonants and the only remaining standard vowel (Y often behaves like a vowel in 5-letter words).

A good candidate is MUDDY:
- Contains U in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses M, D, D, Y (double D is acceptable per Wordle rules).
- M, D, Y are all still possible letters.

If MUDDY gives more hits, we can refine further.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Pattern is _ U _ _ Y (U is fixed in position 2, Y in position 5).
2. Eliminated letters so far: R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T, M, D, B, N, K.
3. Remaining candidate consonants for positions 1, 3, 4: F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
   (Y is already in position 5, U in position 2, and no other vowels are available.)

We need three more letters from the remaining set. To test as many new letters as possible in one go, pick a word that uses three different, high-frequency consonants in positions 1, 3, and 4. The common ones left are F, G, H, P, V, W.

A good combination is F U _ _ Y. For positions 3 and 4, try G and H: F U G H Y — but that repeats H and G twice. Instead, pick a real word that fits: F U G U Y is invalid (letters repeat, U already used once). Try F U G _ Y: the only valid word is FUGGY, but it’s obscure and has a double G. A better, more common word is P U G H Y (invalid). Another common pattern is F U N _ Y but N is out. Consider H U _ _ Y: HUGGY is invalid. 

Let’s try G U _ _ Y: G U _ _ Y. A valid word is GUMMY but M is out. GUPPY has P twice but P is still available. GUPPY → G U P P Y. This tests G (position 1), P (positions 3 and 4) and fits the pattern. Although P is repeated, it’s still a useful test to see if P is in positions 3 or 4.

Alternatively, H U _ _ Y: H U _ _ Y. HUNKY is out (N,K out). HUFFY: H U F F Y — tests H (position 1), F (positions 3,4). This is a real word and tests two new letters.

Between GUPPY and HUFFY, HUFFY uses two distinct new consonants (H, F) and repeats F. This gives more distinct letter information.

Therefore, HUFFY is the optimal next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Avoid repeating any used letters.

A balanced choice that meets these criteria is BUMPY:

- M is already ruled out, but we can check for M again to confirm. Actually M has been ruled out from feedback 3 (M(x)), so we cannot use M again.

Confirmed facts:
- Pattern is _ U _ _ Y (U fixed at position 2, Y fixed at position 5).
- Eliminated letters include: R, A, I, S, E, C, L, O, T, M, D, B, N, K, H, F.
- Remaining possible consonants for positions 1, 3, 4: G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need three distinct consonants from that list to fill positions 1, 3, 4.
Among the remaining letters, G, J, P, V, W are reasonably common.
Let’s pick G, P, V and form a valid English word that fits: G U _ _ Y → GUPPY is invalid (P already tested, and would repeat). J U _ _ Y → JUMPY but M is out. V U _ _ Y → VUGGY is obscure. W U _ _ Y → WUDDY is invalid. Q U _ _ Y → QUIMY is invalid. G U _ _ Y → GULPY is invalid (L is out). Looking at real 5-letter words, GUPPY is invalid (P out), JUMPY invalid (M out), VUGGY obscure. 

Valid remaining words: GUPPY, GULPY, JUMPY are all invalid due to eliminated letters. The only remaining high-frequency consonants that can fit are G, P, J, V, W. The word “JUMPY” uses J, M, P, Y. M is out. “GUPPY” uses G, U, P, P, Y. P is allowed since it was only eliminated in HUFFY feedback (F marked x, but P not tested yet). Actually P was not tested yet (HUFFY had F twice). Therefore P is still possible.

Thus a valid word with remaining letters is “GUPPY”. Testing G, P, P in positions 1,3,4.

But to maximize distinct letter information, better to use three different letters. Consider “GUVVY” — invalid (V repeats). ""JUMPY"" invalid (M out). ""JUVVY"" — invalid. No valid distinct-letter words left. The only real word left with available letters appears to be GUPPY.

However, since we have only one guess left (6th guess), we must choose the most probable word. Given pattern _ U _ _ Y and available letters, the only common word is JUMPY but M is out. The next possible is GUPPY. Therefore, GUPPY is the best choice.

Wait, let's re-check remaining letters and valid words:
Available letters for positions 1,3,4: G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Pattern: _ U _ _ Y.

Valid word: J U G G Y — but G repeats. P U G G Y — invalid. G U _ _ Y → GUPPY is the only valid word with letters G, U, P, P, Y. Since P is still available (not yet tested), this is acceptable.

Therefore, final guess is GUPPY.
