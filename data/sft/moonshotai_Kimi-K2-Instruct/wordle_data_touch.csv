For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these letters.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

However, I need to think if there's a better option. ""CRANE"" is another popular choice with C, R, A, N, E - hitting many common letters. But I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowels.

Wait, let me reconsider. ""AROSE"" has the letters A, R, O, S, E - that's 3 vowels and 2 consonants, which is great for narrowing down possibilities. The letters are all very common, and the word itself is valid and commonly used.

I think ""AROSE"" is my best first guess to maximize information.

From the feedback:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3 is wrong).
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O in a position other than 3.

Common letters we haven’t used yet and are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since O must appear but not in position 3, let’s think of words with O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Some possibilities:
- ""DOUGH"" – but this has G and H, which are less common.
- ""POINT"" – but this has I, N, T, which are good letters.
- ""CLOUD"" – has C, L, U, D, which are decent.
- ""BLOCK"" – has B, L, C, K.
- ""MOUND"" – has M, U, N, D.

""POINT"" seems good because:
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the feedback).
- Contains I, N, T, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

Therefore, I’ll go with ""POINT"".

- Uses O in a position other than 3.
- Does not use A, R, S, E.

Common letters we haven’t used yet and are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since O must appear but not in position 3, let’s think of words with O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Some possibilities:
- ""DOUGH"" – but this has G and H, which are less common.
- ""POINT"" – but this has I, N, T, which are good letters.
- ""CLOUD"" – has C, L, U, D, which are decent.
- ""BLOCK"" – has B, L, C, K.
- ""MOUND"" – has M, U, N, D.

""POINT"" seems good because:
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the feedback).
- Contains I, N, T, which are common letters not yet ruled out.
- Does not contain A, R, S, E.

Therefore, I’ll go with ""POINT"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: P, I, N
   - O is now confirmed to be in position 2 (because it went from “-” to “✓”).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters that are definitely OUT: A, R, S, E, P, I, N
- T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.

Remaining common letters that can still appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, plus the known T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains T somewhere other than position 5.
- Uses only allowed letters (none of A, R, S, E, P, I, N).

Possible T positions: 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s brainstorm words:
- T in position 1: TOUGH, TOUCH, TOFFY – but F, G, H, U, C, Y are allowed.
- T in position 3: BOTCH, LOTUS, MOTEL – but M, L, B, C, U, S are allowed.
- T in position 4: COBUT, FROST (R is out), CLOUT – C, L, U, T are allowed.

“CLOUT” stands out:
- Pattern: C L O U T → O is in position 3 rather than 2 → fails.
“TOUGH”:
- T O U G H → positions: 1-2-3-4-5. O is in position 2 (✓), T is in position 1 (not 5, so OK).
- Letters T, O, U, G, H – none of the banned letters are used.
- It is a valid English word.

I’ll go with “TOUGH”.

From all feedback:

- O is confirmed in position 2.
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- U is confirmed in position 3 and cannot appear elsewhere.
- H is confirmed in position 5 and cannot appear elsewhere.
- G is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now fixed: T O U _ H

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- has not yet been ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, I, N, G)
- is part of a valid English word matching T O U _ H

The remaining common consonants not yet excluded are B, C, D, F, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit T O U _ H:
- TOUCH – but C is still allowed
- TOUGH – already tried but G was ruled out
- TOUT… requires a second T (invalid)
- TOU… no other common words

The only valid, common word left is TOUCH.

Therefore,
