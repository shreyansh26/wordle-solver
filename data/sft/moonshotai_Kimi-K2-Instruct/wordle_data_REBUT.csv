Since this is my first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential correct letters early. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me a broad initial scan of the alphabet.

Let me condense everything we now know.

Confirmed letters & positions  
- R is position 1  
- E is position 2  
- B is position 3  

Confirmed absent letters  
A, O, S, I, G, N, L  

We need a 5-letter word that begins **REB** and uses two more letters from the set that are not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (excluding the banned list) are roughly: C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A quick scan gives “REBUS” (but S is banned) and “REBUT”.  
- REBUT uses T and U, neither of which is banned.  
It also keeps the second E out of position 5, satisfying the earlier clue that E cannot be in position 5.

Therefore, REBUT is a valid next candidate.
