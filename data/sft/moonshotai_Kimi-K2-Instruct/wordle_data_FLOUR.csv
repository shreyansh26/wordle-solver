Since there's no prior information about the secret word, the optimal first guess is a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Research shows that certain starting words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are effective because they use common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good as it contains:
- A - very common vowel
- R - very common consonant
- O - common vowel
- S - very common consonant
- E - the most common letter in English

This combination gives us maximum coverage of common letters to get the most informative feedback possible.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word
- R is in the word but in the wrong position
- O is in the correct position (third letter)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

This tells us:
1. The word has an O in position 3
2. It contains an R but not in position 2
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E

Looking for 5-letter words with O in position 3 and R somewhere else (not position 2). Good candidates would use common letters not yet eliminated (like T, N, L, M, etc.).

Possible patterns: _ _ O _ _ with R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already taken by O), so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Words like:
- TROOP (but P isn't used yet)
- FRONT (but E is eliminated)
- CROOK (but K isn't used)

A good next guess that uses common letters and fits the pattern is ""FRONT"":
- F (new letter)
- R (in position 2, but we know R is not in position 2 - so this would actually be wrong)
Wait, let me reconsider.

Actually, let's use ""DROLL"":
- D (new letter)
- R (in position 2 - but we know R is not in position 2 from feedback)
This is also wrong.

Better approach: Since O is fixed in position 3, let's try ""CROOK"":
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 - but this contradicts feedback)

Let me think differently - position 3 is O, and R can be 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidate: ""TROOP"" - but this uses P which isn't common.

Actually, ""FROST"" would be good but uses S which we know is eliminated.

""WRONG"" would be good but uses G and N which are less common.

""FROND"" uses D which is good.

But ""FRONT"" is better as it uses T and N which are very common.

Wait, I see the issue - in FRONT, R is in position 2 which we know is wrong from feedback.

So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ _

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word
- R is in the word but in the wrong position
- O is in the correct position (third letter)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

This tells us:
1. The word has an O in position 3
2. It contains an R but not in position 2
3. It does NOT contain A, S, or E

Looking for 5-letter words with O in position 3 and R somewhere else (not position 2). Good candidates would use common letters not yet eliminated (like T, N, L, M, etc.).

Possible patterns: _ _ O _ _ with R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already taken by O), so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Words like:
- TROOP (but P isn't used yet)
- FRONT (but E is eliminated)
- CROOK (but K isn't used)

A good next guess that uses common letters and fits the pattern is ""FRONT"":
- F (new letter)
- R (in position 2, but we know R is not in position 2 - so this would actually be wrong)
Wait, let me reconsider.

Actually, let's use ""DROLL"":
- D (new letter)
- R (in position 2 - but we know R is not in position 2 from feedback)
This is also wrong.

Better approach: Since O is fixed in position 3, let's try ""CROOK"":
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 - but this contradicts feedback)

Let me think differently - position 3 is O, and R can be 1, 4, or 5.

Good candidate: ""TROOP"" - but this uses P which isn't common.

Actually, ""FROST"" would be good but uses S which we know is eliminated.

""WRONG"" would be good but uses G and N which are less common.

""FROND"" uses D which is good.

But ""FRONT"" is better as it uses T and N which are very common.

Wait, I see the issue - in FRONT, R is in position 2 which we know is wrong from feedback.

Let me try ""CROWN"":
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 - again wrong)

Let's try ""GROWN"":
- G (new letter)
- R (position 1 - this could work)
- O (position 3 - correct)
- W (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This uses R in position 1, which is allowed.

<guess>GROWN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: GROWN -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(-) O(✓) W(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R is present but NOT in positions 2 (from AROSE) or 1 (from GROWN).
- A, S, E, G, W, N are all absent.

So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- Remaining letters must come from the common set minus the eliminated ones. So far we have eliminated: A, S, E, G, W, N.

Common letters left: T, L, C, D, B, F, K, M, P, H, I, U, Y, etc.

We now need to pick a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Has R in position 4 or 5.
3. Uses only un-eliminated letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _
- _ _ O _ R

Let's try both:

For _ _ O R _:
Examples: FLOOR, BLOOR, CLOUR, etc. But L and U are not yet tested.
But ""FLOOR"" has two O's - possible but less common.

For _ _ O _ R:
Examples: TUBOR, VICOR, etc. but these are not common words.

Let's pick a common word fitting one of these patterns.

""FRONT"" was already tried with R in 2, then 1. Now we need R in 4 or 5.

""COLOR"" has O in 3 and R in 5, and uses C and L which are new letters.

""COLOR"":
- C (new)
- O (position 2 - but we know position 3 is O, so this has O in wrong place)
This would have O in position 2, which contradicts our feedback.

""VIGOR"" has O in 4 - wrong.

""MOTOR"" has O in 1 and 3 - but position 1 O is wrong.

""FLOOR"" has O in 3 and 4 - but position 4 O is not confirmed.

""DOJOR"" - but J is uncommon.

""CHORD"" has O in 3 and R in 4 - this fits perfectly:
- C (new)
- H (new)
- O (✓ position 3)
- R (must be in 4 or 5, here in 4)
- D (new)

And none of these letters are eliminated yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Step 1 – lock down what is already certain  
- Position 3 = O (✓ every time)  
- Position 5 = R (✓ in FLOOR and R has been rejected in every earlier position)  
So the word skeleton is: _ _ O _ R

Step 2 – read the new information from FLOOR  
F(✓) → first letter is F  
L(✓) → second letter is L  
O(-) in position 4 → the word does NOT contain a second O anywhere else (so the fourth letter is not O)

Step 3 – combine the facts  
Letters already placed:  
1 = F  
2 = L  
3 = O  
5 = R  

We only need a single letter for position 4.  
Valid, common English letters not yet ruled out that can sit in position 4: B, K, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Step 4 – pick a plausible candidate  
“FLOWR” is not a word.  
“FLO R _” real words include FLOUR, FLOIR, FLOPR (none), so the only common choice is FLOUR (using U).

Therefore the next (and likely final) guess is FLOUR.
