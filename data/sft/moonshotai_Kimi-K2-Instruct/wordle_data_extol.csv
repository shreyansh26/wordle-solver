For the first guess, it's ideal to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly gather as much information as possible. The classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. One popular choice is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This provides a good spread of letters to help identify possible hits or misses early on.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that uses E in a different position and avoids C, R, A, N. I should also pick letters that are common and haven't been ruled out yet to maximize information. Good candidates for consonants now include S, T, L, D, M, B, H, etc., and remaining vowels include I, O, U.

From the combined feedback:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   C, R, A, N, S.

2. Letters that ARE in the word, but in wrong positions:  
   E, T, O, L.  
   (Each of these appeared in a specific position and was marked “-”, so they definitely exist in the word, just not where they appeared in STOLE.)

3. The word must therefore contain E, T, O, L plus one other letter that has not been tested yet or ruled out (the fifth letter).

4. None of these four letters can be in their previous spots:
   - E cannot be 5th (from CRANE) nor 4th (from STOLE).
   - T cannot be 2nd (from STOLE).
   - O cannot be 3rd (from STOLE).
   - L cannot be 4th (from STOLE).

5. We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels that have not appeared at all. The letters already seen are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,E. So untested letters include, for example: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

6. To satisfy the four required letters (E, T, O, L) plus one fresh consonant, and to satisfy the positional constraints, let’s try to place:
   - T not in 2nd → maybe 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th  
   - O not in 3rd → maybe 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th  
   - L not in 4th → maybe 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th  
   - E not in 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

7. Picking a consonant we haven’t used: let’s try H. A possible arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is H-O-T-E-L.

   - H: new letter, never tested.  
   - O: must be in the word, not 3rd. Here it is 2nd.  
   - T: must be in the word, not 2nd. Here it is 3rd.  
   - E: must be in the word, not 4th or 5th. Here it is 4th, but wait: E was marked “-” in both guesses, meaning it is in the word but in wrong position. E was 5th in CRANE (wrong) and 4th in STOLE (wrong). So E cannot be 4th or 5th, and must therefore be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. In HOTEL, E is 4th again, so that violates the rules.  

   Let’s rethink.

8. Another arrangement with all four letters plus a new consonant:  
   Letters to use: E, T, O, L + one new.  
   Constraints:  
   - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  
   - T must not be 2nd  
   - O must not be 3rd  
   - L must not be 4th

   Try E-T-O-L plus a new letter. But E, T, O, L are four letters; we need a 5-letter word, so the fifth letter must be new. A possible valid word is “UPLET” – but that is not common.

   Better: form a valid English word. Let’s try “LOTE?”. We need a fifth letter not yet used. “LOTEX” is not valid. “LOTEZ” not valid.

   Try “METOL” – but METOL is obscure.

   Let’s list valid 5-letter words composed of E, T, O, L plus one new letter, satisfying constraints:
   - ELOTE – not valid.
   - ELTON – T is 3rd (ok), O is 4th (ok), L is 2nd (ok), E is 1st (ok), plus N is new – but N was in CRANE and ruled out.
   - LETHE – H new, E in 2nd (ok), T in 3rd (ok), L in 1st (ok), E in 4th (ok). This satisfies all constraints:
       - Contains E (positions 2,4 – neither 5th nor 4th alone),
       - Contains T (3rd, ok since T was 2nd in STOLE),
       - Contains L (1st, ok),
       - Contains E (ok),
       - New letter H, which was never used.
   LETHE is a valid English word.

   - O not in 3rd → maybe 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th  
   - L not in 4th → maybe 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th  
   - E not in 4th or 5th → must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

7. Picking a consonant we haven’t used: let’s try H. A possible arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is H-O-T-E-L.

   - H: new letter, never tested.  
   - O: must be in the word, not 3rd. Here it is 2nd.  
   - T: must be in the word, not 2nd. Here it is 3rd.  
   - E: must be in the word, not 4th or 5th. Here it is 4th, but wait: E was marked “-” in both guesses, meaning it is in the word but in wrong position. E was 5th in CRANE (wrong) and 4th in STOLE (wrong). So E cannot be 4th or 5th, and must therefore be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. In HOTEL, E is 4th again, so that violates the rules.  

   Let’s rethink.

8. Another arrangement with all four letters plus a new consonant:  
   Letters to use: E, T, O, L + one new.  
   Constraints:  
   - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  
   - T must not be 2nd  
   - O must not be 3rd  
   - L must not be 4th

   Try E-T-O-L plus a new letter. But E, T, O, L are four letters; we need a 5-letter word, so the fifth letter must be new. A possible valid word is “UPLET” – but that is not common.

   Better: form a valid English word. Let’s try “LOTE?”. We need a fifth letter not yet used. “LOTEX” is not valid. “LOTEZ” not valid.

   Try “METOL” – but METOL is obscure.

   Let’s list valid 5-letter words composed of E, T, O, L plus one new letter, satisfying constraints:
   - ELOTE – not valid.
   - ELTON – T is 3rd (ok), O is 4th (ok), L is 2nd (ok), E is 1st (ok), plus N is new – but N was in CRANE and ruled out.
   - LETHE – H new, E in 2nd (ok), T in 3rd (ok), L in 1st (ok), E in 4th (ok). This satisfies all constraints:
       - Contains E (positions 2,4 – neither 5th nor 4th alone),
       - Contains T (3rd, ok since T was 2nd in STOLE),
       - Contains L (1st, ok),
       - Contains E (ok),
       - New letter H, which was never used.
   LETHE is a valid English word.

So, the next guess should be LETHE.

Let’s map out everything we now know.

Letters definitely in the word and their positions
- T is in the word and in the 3rd position (from Guess 3 feedback: T(✓)).

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown
- E (marked “-” in all three guesses so far)
- O (marked “-” in Guess 2)
- L (marked “-” in Guess 2 and Guess 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word
- C, R, A, N, S, H (from guesses 1 and 3)

So the word has the form: _ _ T _ _  (T fixed at position 3)

It must contain E, O, L somewhere, and one more letter we haven’t ruled out (since we have 5 slots and only 4 known letters so far). The remaining unused common consonants/vowels include B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We also know:
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (because in Guess 3 E was 2nd and 4th and both were “-”).
- O cannot be in position 3 (already T is there) but was 3rd in Guess 2 and was wrong, so O can’t be 3rd anyway.
- L cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2) and also cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 3), so L must be either 2 or 5.

Let’s try to build a word that respects all these constraints.

A convenient way is to put L in the 2nd spot (since it can’t be 1st or 4th) and E in the 5th spot (since it can’t be 2nd or 4th, and 3rd is T). That leaves positions 1 and 4 for O and one new letter.

Proposed structure: [1] L [3] [4] E

- 3rd is T fixed.
- We need O somewhere; the only open spots are 1 or 4.
- If we place O in position 1, we need one new letter in position 4.

We haven’t used B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, Y yet. A common consonant like B or D would be good. Let’s try B.

Candidate word: O L T B E – ""OLTBE"" is not valid.

Try a valid word: FLOAT – no, contains A (ruled out).

Another: “PLUTO” – contains U (good), but T is 4th, not 3rd.

Wait, we need T 3rd. So the word must be _ _ T _ _.

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words with T in the 3rd position, using letters we know must appear (E, O, L) plus one new letter, avoiding any ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- BOTEL – B new, O 2nd, T 3rd, E 4th, L 5th.
   - Check constraints:
      - E is 4th – we were told E cannot be 4th (from Guess 3 it was 4th and “-”), so BOTEL fails.
- GLOTE – G new, L 2nd, O 1st, T 3rd, E 5th.
   - Check:
      - E is 5th – never marked “-” in 5th (in CRANE it was 5th and marked “-”, so E cannot be 5th) → GLOTE fails.
- METOL – M new, E 1st, T 3rd, O 4th, L 5th.
   - Valid English word, satisfies all constraints:
      - T is 3rd ✓
      - E is 1st – never marked wrong for 1st ✓
      - O is 4th – never marked wrong for 4th (only 3rd in STOLE was wrong) ✓
      - L is 5th – never marked wrong for 5th (only 1st and 4th were wrong) ✓
      - Uses new letter M (never used) ✓
      - Avoids all ruled-out letters (C,R,A,N,S,H) ✓

Therefore, METOL is a perfect next candidate.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

3. The word must therefore contain E, T, O, L plus one other letter that has not been tested yet or ruled out (the fifth letter).

4. None of these four letters can be in their previous spots:

6. To satisfy the four required letters (E, T, O, L) plus one fresh consonant, and to satisfy the positional constraints, let’s try to place:
   - T not in 2nd → maybe 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th

7. Picking a consonant we haven’t used: let’s try H. A possible arrangement that satisfies all these constraints is H-O-T-E-L.

   - H: new letter, never tested.

   Letters to use: E, T, O, L + one new.  
   Constraints:  
   - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  
   - T must not be 2nd  
   - O must not be 3rd  
   - L must not be 4th

   Try E-T-O-L plus a new letter. But E, T, O, L are four letters; we need a 5-letter word, so the fifth letter must be new. A possible valid word is “UPLET” – but that is not common.

   Better: form a valid English word. Let’s try “LOTE?”. We need a fifth letter not yet used. “LOTEX” is not valid. “LOTEZ” not valid.

   Try “METOL” – but METOL is obscure.

   - ELOTE – not valid.
   - ELTON – T is 3rd (ok), O is 4th (ok), L is 2nd (ok), E is 1st (ok), plus N is new – but N was in CRANE and ruled out.
   - LETHE – H new, E in 2nd (ok), T in 3rd (ok), L in 1st (ok), E in 4th (ok). This satisfies all constraints:
       - Contains E (positions 2,4 – neither 5th nor 4th alone),

- We need O somewhere; the only open spots are 1 or 4.
- If we place O in position 1, we need one new letter in position 4.

We haven’t used B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, Y yet. A common consonant like B or D would be good. Let’s try B.

Candidate word: O L T B E – ""OLTBE"" is not valid.

Try a valid word: FLOAT – no, contains A (ruled out).

Another: “PLUTO” – contains U (good), but T is 4th, not 3rd.

Wait, we need T 3rd. So the word must be _ _ T _ _.

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words with T in the 3rd position, using letters we know must appear (E, O, L) plus one new letter, avoiding any ruled-out letters.

Possible words:
- BOTEL – B new, O 2nd, T 3rd, E 4th, L 5th.
   - Check constraints:
      - E is 4th – we were told E cannot be 4th (from Guess 3 it was 4th and “-”), so BOTEL fails.
- GLOTE – G new, L 2nd, O 1st, T 3rd, E 5th.
   - Check:
      - E is 5th – never marked “-” in 5th (in CRANE it was 5th and marked “-”, so E cannot be 5th) → GLOTE fails.
- METOL – M new, E 1st, T 3rd, O 4th, L 5th.
   - Valid English word, satisfies all constraints:
      - T is 3rd ✓
      - E is 1st – never marked wrong for 1st ✓
      - O is 4th – never marked wrong for 4th (only 3rd in STOLE was wrong) ✓
      - L is 5th – never marked wrong for 5th (only 1st and 4th were wrong) ✓
      - Uses new letter M (never used) ✓
      - Avoids all ruled-out letters (C,R,A,N,S,H) ✓

Therefore, METOL is a perfect next candidate.

From the feedback so far:

Must-have letters (✓ in Guess 4):
- T at position 3
- O at position 4
- L at position 5

Must-have letters whose positions are still unknown (marked “-” somewhere):
- E

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
- C, R, A, N, S, H, M

Thus the word structure is: _ _ T O L with the 5th letter already fixed as L.

We must include E somewhere, but E cannot be in positions 5 (L), 4 (O), 3 (T) from earlier feedback (in Guess 3 E was 2nd and 4th and both “-”, and in Guess 4 E was 2nd “-” again). So E must be in position 1, and we need one more consonant for position 2.

Available consonants (not used and not ruled out): B, D, F, G, I, K, P, U, Y, etc.

A simple valid word pattern: E _ T O L.

Possible consonants for position 2: B would give “EBTOL” (invalid), F gives “EFTOL” (invalid), D gives “EDTOL” (invalid), U gives “EUTOL” (invalid), G gives “EGTOL” (invalid), V gives “EVTOL” (invalid), Y gives “EYTOL” (invalid), W gives “EWTOL” (invalid), K gives “EKTOL” (invalid), P gives “EPTOL” (invalid), B gives “EBTOL” (invalid), I gives “EITOL” (invalid), etc.

Hmm, none of these seem like valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the word is _ _ T O L. We need a 5-letter word ending in TOL. Let me list valid English 5-letter words ending in TOL:

- BETOL – no, invalid
- DETOL – invalid
- FETOL – invalid
- GETOL – invalid
- KETOL – invalid
- PETOL – invalid
- YETOL – invalid

None of these appear valid. However, there is a common word: “PETAL” but that has A (ruled out).

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread the structure.

Word structure is: _ _ T O L (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We have T at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

We must include E, and E cannot be at positions 2, 4, 5 from prior feedback. So E must be at position 1, and we need a consonant at position 2.

Then the word would be E _ T O L. The only valid English word I can think of is “EXTOL”.

Let me check constraints for EXTOL:

- Letters: E, X, T, O, L.
- T is 3rd ✓
- O is 4th ✓
- L is 5th ✓
- E is 1st – never marked wrong for 1st ✓
- X is new, not used or ruled out ✓
- Avoids all ruled-out letters ✓

“EXTOL” is a valid English word meaning to praise highly.

Thus, this must be the correct word.
