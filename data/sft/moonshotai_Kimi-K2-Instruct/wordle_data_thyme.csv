1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to pick a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word (marked with x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and none of C, R, A, N appear anywhere in it.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, N.  
Good consonant choices not yet ruled out: S, T, L, M, D, H, B, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Possible candidates:

Latest feedback recap:
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, L, I (all marked x).
- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct spots: M (4th), E (5th).
- So the pattern is: _ _ _ M E
- Allowed letters: all letters except C, R, A, N, S, L, I  
(We can still use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.)

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ME” and using only the allowed letters.  
Good consonants that remain unused and common: D, T, B, H, K, G.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out, E is already used).

Candidate words I can think of that fit:
- HUMME – invalid (double M & not a 5-letter word)
- DUMME – invalid
- TUMME – invalid
- FUMME – invalid
Let’s try actual dictionary words:
- TUMME → not in word lists
- GUMME → not a word
- KUMME → not a word
- BOMBE – ends in BE, not ME
- HOMME – ends in ME, but H, O, M, M, E – uses M twice which is okay, and all letters are still allowed.  
“HOMME” is a valid English word (French loanword meaning “man”).

But let’s try something more common:  
“COMME” – uses C (already ruled out).  
“WOMME” – not a word.  
“FUMET” – wrong ending.  
“FUMED” – wrong ending.

Another good candidate: “OUGHT” – wrong ending.  
Actually, let me list simple 5-letter words ending in “ME” with allowed letters:

- DOUME – not real  
- GOMBE – ends in BE  
- HUMVE – not real  
- HUMID – wrong ending  
- JUMPE – not real  
- OUTME – not real  
- TUMID – wrong ending  
- UMBER – wrong ending  
- UMBLE – wrong ending  
- UMPTE – not real  

Let me rethink.  
Ending in M E, and we have three letters to place in positions 1-2-3.  
Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters.  
I’ll try “DUMPE” – but that’s not a word.  
Next: “BUMPY” – ends in PY.  
Next: “JUMPY” – ends in PY.  
Next: “GUMMY” – ends in MY.  
Next: “HUMID” – ends in ID.  
Next: “HUMVE” – not a word.  

Another angle: “OUTME” – not real.  

Real 5-letter word ending in ME:  
- HOMIE – ends in IE.  
- HOMME – valid English word (from French), ends in ME; letters H,O,M,M,E, none ruled out.  
- TUMMY – ends in MY.  
- TUMID – ends in ID.  

I will go with “HOMME” since it fits the pattern.

But wait, the double M might be less likely.  
Let me check other options.  

Another valid word: “FOHME” – not a word.  

Let’s try “TOWME” – not a word.  

Another word that ends in ME: “THYME” – uses T, H, Y, M, E.  
Check letters: T, H, Y, M, E – none are in the ruled-out list.
