For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Covers 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words

This should give me good feedback about which vowels and common consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all absent (x).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-). The secret word must contain an E, but not at the 5th position.

1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

- Letters used: U, N, T, I, E – none of which are banned.
- E is now in position 4 (safe, since it was originally at 5).

From the new feedback on UNTIE:

1. U and I are absent (x).
2. N is in the correct position (✓). So position 2 must be N.
3. T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
- Present letters: N (locked at position 2), T, E (but not at positions 3 or 5 respectively).
- Absent letters: A, R, O, S, U, I.

Letters remaining to test: L, D, C, M, P, Y, H, K, B, G, F, V, W, etc.

Target word pattern:
- Position 2 = N
- Contains T and E elsewhere (but not at positions 3 or 5 for E, and not at position 3 for T)
- Avoid all banned letters

Possible patterns:
Positions: 1 _ 3 4 5
Known: N at 2, E not at 5, T not at 3

Let’s try placing E at position 4. Then T must be at position 1 or 5 (but 5 is unavailable for E, and T could go to 1 or 5). Trying T at 1 and E at 4 gives T N _ E _. The missing letters could be D, L, or Y.

Testing ""T N E _ _"" patterns:
- T N E _ _ – but we need to avoid banned letters and ensure remaining letters are valid.
- T N E D _ – ""TNEDE"" invalid (repeated E and D position unclear)
- T N _ E _ – placing T at 1, N at 2, E at 4: T N _ E _ → ""T N D E _"" or ""T N L E _""

Looking at common words:
- ""T N _ E _"": ""T N E E _"" invalid (E repeats), ""T N X E Z"" etc. need valid word.

A valid word fitting this is ""T N E _ _"" but we need a real 5-letter word. Let's try ""T N D E Y"" → ""TNDEY"" invalid. Real word: ""T N E _ _"" is tricky.

Alternative: Put T at 5 and E at 1:
E N _ _ T → but E is not at position 5 (from AROSE feedback E was originally at 5 and is wrong, so E at 1 is okay).

A valid word: E N D E T – but E repeats and 2nd E is at 4, which may be okay, but double E isn't ideal.

Better: E N D E T – invalid (double E).
Real word: ""E N T E R"" – but R is banned.

Try: ""E N D E T"" – invalid.

Another approach: T at position 1, N at 2, E at 3 or 4:
- T N E _ _ → but E is then at 3 (allowed), but T is at 1.
- T N E _ _ → looking for valid word: ""T N E _ _"" – ""T N E W D"" – not valid.

Valid word: ""T N E E D"" – but double E.

Wait, from AROSE feedback E was at 5 (wrong), in UNTIE E was at 4 (still wrong), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3. But N is at 2, so E must be at 1 or 3.

Let's try E at 1:
E N _ _ _ with T somewhere not at 3 (from UNTIE feedback T not at 3). So T could be at 4 or 5.

Valid words:
E N T _ _ → ""E N T E R"" – R banned.
E N _ T _ → ""E N D T _"" – invalid.
E N _ _ T → ""E N D E T"" – invalid.

Alternative: E at 3:
_ N E _ _ with T not at 3 (already), so T at 1, 4, or 5.
T N E _ _ → ""T N E _ _"" – valid word: ""T N E E D"" – double E.
_ N E T _ → ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
_ N E _ T → ""D N E _ T"" – ""D N E W T"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
Looking for real words with N at 2, T and E present, not at banned positions:
- ""B E N T"" – but 4 letters.
- ""P I N T"" – I banned.

Wait, let's systematically build:
Letters to use: N (position 2), T, E (positions 1/3/4/5 except E not at 5), avoiding A, R, O, S, U, I.

Possible word: ""L E N T"" – 4 letters.
Need 5 letters.

Valid word: ""P E N T E"" – but P and E positions need checking.

Better systematic approach:
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2, 5)
Possible positions for T: not 3 (from UNTIE), so 1, 2, 4, 5. But 2 is N, so 1, 4, 5.

Let's try:
- E at 1, T at 4: E N _ T _ – ""E N D T _"" – invalid.
- E at 1, T at 5: E N _ _ T – ""E N D E T"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 1: T N E _ _ – ""T N E W S"" – S banned.
- E at 3, T at 4: _ N E T _ – ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 5: _ N E _ T – ""D N E W T"" – invalid.
- E at 4, T at 1: T N _ E _ – ""T N D E Y"" – invalid.

Looking for legitimate 5-letter words:
- ""D E N T"" – 4 letters.
- ""B E N D"" – 4 letters.
- ""L E N D"" – 4 letters.

Real 5-letter word: ""L E N T E"" – invalid.
Another: ""M E N T E"" – invalid.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with N at 2 and containing T and E:
- ""B E N T H"" – but H not tested.
- ""D E N T Y"" – invalid.
- ""P E N T E"" – invalid.
- ""M E N T H"" – possible.

""M E N T H"" – positions:
E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed, since T was not at 3), H at 5 (new letter).

Valid word: ""M E N T H"".

Let's check:
Letters: M, E, N, T, H – none banned.
Positions: E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed), H new.
This gives info on M and H.

Possible word: ""L E N T"" – 4 letters.
Need 5 letters.

Valid word: ""P E N T E"" – but P and E positions need checking.

Better systematic approach:
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2, 5)
Possible positions for T: not 3 (from UNTIE), so 1, 2, 4, 5. But 2 is N, so 1, 4, 5.

Let's try:
- E at 1, T at 4: E N _ T _ – ""E N D T _"" – invalid.
- E at 1, T at 5: E N _ _ T – ""E N D E T"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 1: T N E _ _ – ""T N E W S"" – S banned.
- E at 3, T at 4: _ N E T _ – ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 5: _ N E _ T – ""D N E W T"" – invalid.
- E at 4, T at 1: T N _ E _ – ""T N D E Y"" – invalid.

Looking for legitimate 5-letter words:
- ""D E N T"" – 4 letters.
- ""B E N D"" – 4 letters.
- ""L E N D"" – 4 letters.

Real 5-letter word: ""L E N T E"" – invalid.
Another: ""M E N T E"" – invalid.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with N at 2 and containing T and E:
- ""B E N T H"" – but H not tested.
- ""D E N T Y"" – invalid.
- ""P E N T E"" – invalid.
- ""M E N T H"" – possible.

""M E N T H"" – positions:
E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed, since T was not at 3), H at 5 (new letter).

Valid word: ""M E N T H"".

Let's check:
Letters: M, E, N, T, H – none banned.
Positions: E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed), H new.
This gives info on M and H.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains several common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Covers 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words

This should give me good feedback about which vowels and common consonants might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all absent (x).
- E is present but in the wrong position (-). The secret word must contain an E, but not at the 5th position.

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
2. Does contain E (but not at position 5).

I want a new guess that:
- Uses fresh, high-frequency letters to gain maximum new information.
- Places the known E in a different position (not 5).
- Avoids the banned letters A, R, O, S.

Good candidate letters left: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

I’ll choose a word with E plus four new common letters, placing E in the middle to test another position. A strong choice is ""UNTIE"":
- Letters used: U, N, T, I, E – none of which are banned.
- E is now in position 4 (safe, since it was originally at 5).
- Covers five new unique letters.

This should tell me whether U, N, T, I are in the word and give another test position for E.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) T(-) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on UNTIE:

1. U and I are absent (x).
2. N is in the correct position (✓). So position 2 must be N.
3. T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
- Present letters: N (locked at position 2), T, E (but not at positions 3 or 5 respectively).
- Absent letters: A, R, O, S, U, I.

Letters remaining to test: L, D, C, M, P, Y, H, K, B, G, F, V, W, etc.

Target word pattern:
- Position 2 = N
- Contains T and E elsewhere (but not at positions 3 or 5 for E, and not at position 3 for T)
- Avoid all banned letters

Possible patterns:
Positions: 1 _ 3 4 5
Known: N at 2, E not at 5, T not at 3

Let’s try placing E at position 4. Then T must be at position 1 or 5 (but 5 is unavailable for E, and T could go to 1 or 5). Trying T at 1 and E at 4 gives T N _ E _. The missing letters could be D, L, or Y.

Testing ""T N E _ _"" patterns:
- T N E _ _ – but we need to avoid banned letters and ensure remaining letters are valid.
- T N E D _ – ""TNEDE"" invalid (repeated E and D position unclear)
- T N _ E _ – placing T at 1, N at 2, E at 4: T N _ E _ → ""T N D E _"" or ""T N L E _""

Looking at common words:
- ""T N _ E _"": ""T N E E _"" invalid (E repeats), ""T N X E Z"" etc. need valid word.

A valid word fitting this is ""T N E _ _"" but we need a real 5-letter word. Let's try ""T N D E Y"" → ""TNDEY"" invalid. Real word: ""T N E _ _"" is tricky.

Alternative: Put T at 5 and E at 1:
E N _ _ T → but E is not at position 5 (from AROSE feedback E was originally at 5 and is wrong, so E at 1 is okay).

A valid word: E N D E T – but E repeats and 2nd E is at 4, which may be okay, but double E isn't ideal.

Better: E N D E T – invalid (double E).
Real word: ""E N T E R"" – but R is banned.

Try: ""E N D E T"" – invalid.

Another approach: T at position 1, N at 2, E at 3 or 4:
- T N E _ _ → but E is then at 3 (allowed), but T is at 1.
- T N E _ _ → looking for valid word: ""T N E _ _"" – ""T N E W D"" – not valid.

Valid word: ""T N E E D"" – but double E.

Wait, from AROSE feedback E was at 5 (wrong), in UNTIE E was at 4 (still wrong), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3. But N is at 2, so E must be at 1 or 3.

Let's try E at 1:
E N _ _ _ with T somewhere not at 3 (from UNTIE feedback T not at 3). So T could be at 4 or 5.

Valid words:
E N T _ _ → ""E N T E R"" – R banned.
E N _ T _ → ""E N D T _"" – invalid.
E N _ _ T → ""E N D E T"" – invalid.

Alternative: E at 3:
_ N E _ _ with T not at 3 (already), so T at 1, 4, or 5.
T N E _ _ → ""T N E _ _"" – valid word: ""T N E E D"" – double E.
_ N E T _ → ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
_ N E _ T → ""D N E _ T"" – ""D N E W T"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
Looking for real words with N at 2, T and E present, not at banned positions:
- ""B E N T"" – but 4 letters.
- ""P I N T"" – I banned.

Wait, let's systematically build:
Letters to use: N (position 2), T, E (positions 1/3/4/5 except E not at 5), avoiding A, R, O, S, U, I.

Possible word: ""L E N T"" – 4 letters.
Need 5 letters.

Valid word: ""P E N T E"" – but P and E positions need checking.

Better systematic approach:
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2, 5)
Possible positions for T: not 3 (from UNTIE), so 1, 2, 4, 5. But 2 is N, so 1, 4, 5.

Let's try:
- E at 1, T at 4: E N _ T _ – ""E N D T _"" – invalid.
- E at 1, T at 5: E N _ _ T – ""E N D E T"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 1: T N E _ _ – ""T N E W S"" – S banned.
- E at 3, T at 4: _ N E T _ – ""D N E T _"" – invalid.
- E at 3, T at 5: _ N E _ T – ""D N E W T"" – invalid.
- E at 4, T at 1: T N _ E _ – ""T N D E Y"" – invalid.

Looking for legitimate 5-letter words:
- ""D E N T"" – 4 letters.
- ""B E N D"" – 4 letters.
- ""L E N D"" – 4 letters.

Real 5-letter word: ""L E N T E"" – invalid.
Another: ""M E N T E"" – invalid.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with N at 2 and containing T and E:
- ""B E N T H"" – but H not tested.
- ""D E N T Y"" – invalid.
- ""P E N T E"" – invalid.
- ""M E N T H"" – possible.

""M E N T H"" – positions:
E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed, since T was not at 3), H at 5 (new letter).

Valid word: ""M E N T H"".

Let's check:
Letters: M, E, N, T, H – none banned.
Positions: E at 1 (allowed), N at 2 (correct), T at 4 (allowed), H new.
This gives info on M and H.

<guess>MENTH</guess>Based on the feedback:
- N is confirmed at position 2.
- E and T are in the word but not in the positions tested so far (E not at 5 or 4, T not at 3).

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Banned letters (never appear in the word): A, R, O, S, U, I, M, H.
2. Known present letters: N (position 2), T (somewhere), E (somewhere).
3. Position constraints:
   - N must be at position 2 (from UNTIE).
   - E has now appeared in positions 1 and 4 and been marked “wrong position” both times, so E cannot be at 1, 4, or 5 (from AROSE). Therefore E must be at position 3.
   - T has appeared in positions 3 and 4 and been marked “wrong position” both times. Since position 2 is N, T must now be at position 1 or 5.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2 = N
- Position 3 = E
- T must be at 1 or 5
- Remaining positions must be filled with letters not yet banned and not repeating E, N, or T.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Combining these constraints:

Case 1: T at position 1
Word looks like: T N E _ _
Need two more letters from the allowed set, no repeats. Example valid word: T N E B D → “TNEBD” is not a real word. We need a real English 5-letter word.

Real words fitting T N E _ _: “TNEBD” no, “TNES” too short, “TNELK” no. Actually, “T N E _ _” is hard.

Case 2: T at position 5
Word looks like: _ N E _ T
Positions 1 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters, unique, forming a real word.

Valid English word: “B N E E T” no, “D N E W T” no — but “D N E W T” is invalid.

Real word check: “D N E W T” – invalid.
“L N E E T” – invalid.

Another: “P N E W T” – invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically look for real words of the form ? N E ? T.

Real words:
- “B N E E T” – no.
- “C N E W T” – no.
- “D N E W T” – no.
- “F N E W T” – no.
- “L N E E T” – no.
- “P N E W T” – no.
- “W N E E T” – no.

But let’s check dictionary: “PENET” – but R is banned.
“LENTO” – O banned.
“BENET” – but R is banned.
“KNELT” – K, N, E, L, T. Letters K, L allowed; fits pattern _ N E _ T.

“KNELT” is a valid English word (past tense of kneel). It fits:
- Position 2 = N
- Position 3 = E
- Position 5 = T
- Uses K and L which are allowed and untested.
