Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good first guess would be something like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" as they contain common letters. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in English 5-letter words.

From both guesses we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: S, L, C, R  
2. Position 3 is definitely **A** (✓ both times).  
3. **T** is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (it was marked ✓ for presence but wrong position both times).  
4. **E** is in the word but is NOT in position 5 (marked – both times).  
5. Therefore the remaining unused common letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus T and E (whose exact spots we still need to place).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has A fixed in position 3
- uses T somewhere other than position 4
- uses E somewhere other than position 5
- uses none of S L C R

Let’s try positions:

Possible T locations: 1, 2, 5  
Possible E locations: 1, 2, 4  (cannot be 3 or 5)

Quick scan of common patterns suggests:

- If T is 1st and E is 2nd: T E A _ _  → needs two more consonants  
- If T is 1st and E is 4th: T _ A E _  
- If T is 2nd and E is 1st: E T A _ _  
- If T is 2nd and E is 4th: _ T A E _  
- If T is 5th and E is 1st: E _ A _ T  
- If T is 5th and E is 2nd: _ E A _ T  

We want a real English word fitting one of these templates and avoiding banned letters.  
A quick mental check: the pattern _ _ A _ T with E in 2nd and T in 5th gives the word “BEAST” but S is banned.  
Next: _ T A E _  → MTAE? no.  
_ T A E _  → a valid word is “GATE” but that’s 4 letters.  
Another template: T _ A _ E – “TABLE” but L is banned.  
Try “HEMAT” – but that’s 5 letters? No, not common.  

Let’s pick **THAME** – but not common.  
A more common word satisfying the constraints is **HEMAT**? No.  

Actually, **MEANT** fits:

- M E A N T  
- A is 3rd ✓  
- T is 5th (allowed, wasn’t tested there yet)

From all previous feedback:

Known facts
1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, C, R, N  
2. Position 3 = A (✓ every time)  
3. Letters definitely IN the word (but positions still to pin down): T, E, M  
4. From MEANT’s feedback:
   - M is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)  
   - E is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so T must be in position 4)  
   - N is out (already listed above)

So far we have:
M _ A T _   (positions 1,3,4 fixed)
and E must be in position 2.

Therefore the only remaining slot is position 5, which can be any letter not yet eliminated.

Letters already used or eliminated: S, L, C, R, N, plus A, E, M, T placed → remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y

Putting it together:
M E A T ?
