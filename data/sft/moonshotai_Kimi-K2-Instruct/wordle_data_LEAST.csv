For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize the information gained about the secret word. The most common letters in 5-letter words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this as it contains:
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should provide good feedback about what letters are or aren't in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The 4th letter is S.
2. The word contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
3. The word does NOT contain R or O.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is S) → A could be 2 or 3.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is S) → E could be 1, 2, or 3.

A good next word should:
- Keep the S in position 4.
- Test new common consonants (since R is out).
- Place A and E in new positions to narrow them down.

The word ""STEAK"" is a poor choice because it repeats the E in position 5 which we know is wrong. Instead, let's try ""PEALS"":
- P: new common consonant
- E: tests E in position 2
- A: tests A in position 3
- L: another new consonant
- S: confirmed in position 4

However, ""PEALS"" might not be the most efficient. A better choice is ""LEASE"":
- L: new consonant
- E: tests E in position 2
- A: tests A in position 3
- S: confirmed in position 4
- E: tests E in position 5 (but we know E is wrong in position 5) → so this is redundant.

Actually, ""STEAL"" is good:
- S in position 1 (but we know S is in position 4) → no, this violates position 4 being S.

Better: ""PLASE"":
- P: new
- L: new
- A: test A in position 2
- S: correct position 4
- E: test E in position 5 (but we know E is wrong here) → no.

Optimal: ""PEALS"" is acceptable despite E in 2 and A in 3 being possible overlaps. But even better is ""STEAM"" but O is out and A is in word. 

After reconsidering, ""STEAL"" has S in wrong position, so avoid. The best seems ""LEAPS"":
- L: new
- E: tests E in position 2
- A: tests A in position 3
- P: new
- S: correct position 4.

But simpler: ""PEALS"" is a valid word and good test. 

Actually, ""TALES"" is perfect:
- T: new consonant
- A: tests A in position 2
- L: new consonant
- E: tests E in position 4 (but 4 is S) → no, E is wrong in 5, so position 3 is fine.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is correctly fixed in position 4.
   - A and E are somewhere in the word, but *not* in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - R and O are completely absent.

2. TALES → T(-) A(-) L(-) E(-) S(-)
   - Every single letter received “-”, meaning each letter (T, A, L, E, S) is in the word but in the wrong spot.
   - Combined with round 1, we now know:
        – S must be in position 4 (from round 1) but TALES shows S in position 5 is wrong, so this is consistent.
        – A is in the word but *not* in positions 1 or 2.
        – E is in the word but *not* in positions 3 or 5.
        – L is in the word but *not* in position 3.
        – T is in the word but *not* in position 1.

Therefore:
- The 4th letter is definitely S.
- The word contains {A, E, L, T} plus whatever other letters we haven’t tested.
- A can only be in positions 3 or 4… but 4 is S, so A must be in position 3.
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4… but 4 is S, so E must be in 1 or 2.
- T must be somewhere in 2, 3, 4, or 5… but 4 is S and 3 must be A, so T is in 2 or 5.
- L must be somewhere in 1, 2, 4, or 5… 4 is S, so L is in 1, 2, or 5.

Putting these together, the skeleton so far is:

_ _ A S _

with {E, L, T} filling the remaining three spots (positions 1, 2, 5) and we must use each at least once.

Possible permutations of {E, L, T} across positions 1, 2, 5:
1. E L A S T  → ELAST
2. E T A S L  → ETASL (not a word)
3. L E A S T  → LEAST
4. L T A S E  → LTASE (not a word)
5. T E A S L  → TEASL (not a word)
6. T L A S E  → TLASE (not a word)

Only **LEAST** and **ELAST** are valid English words.  
Between them, **LEAST** is more common, so we’ll guess that.

(If it were ELAST, it would still be valid, but LEAST is more likely.)

- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4… but 4 is S, so E must be in 1 or 2.
- T must be somewhere in 2, 3, 4, or 5… but 4 is S and 3 must be A, so T is in 2 or 5.
- L must be somewhere in 1, 2, 4, or 5… 4 is S, so L is in 1, 2, or 5.

Putting these together, the skeleton so far is:

_ _ A S _

with {E, L, T} filling the remaining three spots (positions 1, 2, 5) and we must use each at least once.

Possible permutations of {E, L, T} across positions 1, 2, 5:
1. E L A S T  → ELAST
2. E T A S L  → ETASL (not a word)
3. L E A S T  → LEAST
4. L T A S E  → LTASE (not a word)
5. T E A S L  → TEASL (not a word)
6. T L A S E  → TLASE (not a word)

Only **LEAST** and **ELAST** are valid English words.  
Between them, **LEAST** is more common, so we’ll guess that.

(If it were ELAST, it would still be valid, but LEAST is more likely.)",Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
