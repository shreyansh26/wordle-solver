- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and will give me good information about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good strategy is to use words that contain multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize the information gain from the feedback.

Some good first guesses include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, etc. These words use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it's a common word with high-frequency letters (S, T, A, R, E) and can give good initial information.

From the feedback:

S ✓ → correct in position 1  
T x → not in the word at all  
A ✓ → correct in position 3  
R ✓ → correct in position 4  
E ✓ → correct in position 5  

The known pattern so far is:
S _ A R E

We still need a letter for position 2. It must be a consonant (since all vowels are already placed). Common consonants that haven’t been tested yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc. 

I’ll look for a common word that fits “S _ A R E”. The only common candidate that comes to mind is “SCARE” (since C hasn’t been eliminated yet).
