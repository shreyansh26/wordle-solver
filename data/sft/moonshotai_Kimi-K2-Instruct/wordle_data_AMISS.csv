2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to pick a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some common starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → I is the 3rd letter.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. _ _ I _ _  (I is fixed in 3rd position)
2. A is somewhere else (not position 2)
3. S is somewhere else (not position 4)
4. We can rule out R and E.

We need a word that:
- Has I in the 3rd position.
- Contains A (not in position 2) and S (not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain R or E.

Possible 5-letter words to test:
- PAINS (I at 3, A not 2, S not 4, no R/E) → but A is 2, so no.
- SAINT (I at 3, A at 2, S at 1 → A is wrong position, S is wrong position) → possible.
- WAIST (I at 3, A at 2 → A is wrong position, S at 4 → S is wrong position) → possible.
- BAITS (I at 3, A at 2 → A is wrong position, S at 5 → valid for S).

BAITS seems good:
- B, A, I, T, S
- I is correct at 3.
- A is at 2 (known wrong, but still a valid test since we need to place A elsewhere).
- S is at 5 (new position, not 4).
- No R or E.

Alternatively, SAINT:
- S, A, I, N, T
- I at 3 ✓.
- S at 1 (new position).
- A at 2 (wrong spot, but still ok to test).
- No R/E.

I'll choose SAINT to test S in position 1 and A in position 2 (since it'll help narrow positions better).

   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (same as before).
   - I is confirmed at position 3.
   - N and T are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Word structure: _ _ I _ _
- Must contain A (not in 2) and S (not in 1 or 4).
- Letters to avoid: R, E, N, T.
- Possible positions for A: 1, 3 (but 3 is I), 4, 5.
- Possible positions for S: 2, 3 (but 3 is I), 5.

The word must have:
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- S in position 2 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2: _ S I _ _, then A could be 1, 4, or 5.
  - ASI_ _ → but A is position 1, S is 2, I is 3.
  - _ S I A _ → S is 2, A is 4.
  - _ S I _ A → S is 2, A is 5.

- If S is in position 5: _ _ I _ S, then A could be 1 or 4.
  - A _ I _ S → A is 1.
  - _ _ I A S → A is 4.

Let's list valid words fitting these patterns:
1. ASIDE → but D is untested and E is invalid (from RAISE feedback).
2. BASIC → A is 2 (invalid), but word has A in 2 → skip.
3. BASIS → A is 2 (invalid), S is 4 (invalid), but has S at 2 and 4 → skip.
4. WAIST → A is 2 (invalid), S is 4 (invalid), T is invalid → skip.

   - S (position 2, allowed since S is not in 1 or 4).
   - I (position 3, correct).
   - S (position 5, allowed).
   - M is untested and seems valid.
