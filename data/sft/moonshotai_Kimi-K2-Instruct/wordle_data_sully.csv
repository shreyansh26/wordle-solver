For the first guess, we want a word that covers as many common letters as possible to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular first guesses for this reason. 

""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (very common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are **not in the word** (all marked with x).
- S is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked with -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere **except position 3**.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, or E.

Next, I’ll choose a word that:
- Keeps S in a different position.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels **not** already eliminated (i.e., no A/R/O/E).
- Introduces new common letters like T, N, I, L, etc.

A strong candidate is ""SNITS"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- N, I, T (common letters not used yet).
- Second S to test for double letters (common in 5-letter words).

But ""SNITS"" uses S twice, and we only know S appears once. Instead, let’s pick ""STING"":
- Uses S in position 1.
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not eliminated.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: L, D, C, M, P, B, H, F, Y, K, W.
Remaining common vowel not yet tried: U (since A, E, I, O are out).

4. Use other frequent consonants.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern so far: S U L _ Y
- Letters known to be present and correctly placed: S (pos 1), U (pos 2), L (pos 3), Y (pos 5).
- Letter K is NOT in the word (marked x in pos 4).
- All other letters tried (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G) are NOT in the word.

So the word looks like S U L ? Y and the only unchecked, common letter left for the 4th position is D (since most other consonants have been eliminated or used).

Valid 5-letter words matching SUL?Y:
- SULKY – already guessed and rejected (K is out).
- SULLY – uses L again, which is allowed since L is confirmed in the word.
- SULPH – P and H haven’t been tested, but P and H haven’t been eliminated either.

Between SULLY and SULPH, SULLY is more common and uses only confirmed letters plus another L (which we know is in the word anyway).

So the logical guess is SULLY.
