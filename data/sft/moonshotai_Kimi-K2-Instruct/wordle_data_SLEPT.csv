For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should cover frequently used letters without repeating any. Some of the best starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - vowel-heavy
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should provide good feedback to narrow down possibilities.

From the first guess CRANE we got:

- C(x) – C, R, A, N are NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word must:
- contain the letter E somewhere (but not as the 5th letter),
- NOT contain C, R, A, N,
- still be a valid 5-letter English word.

Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N.  
Known letter: E (not in spot 5).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the known E in a new position.
2. Introduces other common consonants and vowels not yet tested.

Popular vowels still untested: I, O, U.  
Common consonants still untested: S, T, L, D, B, M, etc.

A balanced choice is “STOLE”:
- Uses S, T, O, L, E.
- Places E in position 4 (new spot).
- Tests the new letters S, T, O, L.

(Other candidates like “POISE”, “TOILE”, “ELBOW” would be fine too, but “STOLE” is simple and common.)

Let’s absorb what we now know:

1. From CRANE:  
   – C, R, A, N are NOT in the word.  
   – E is in the word, but not in position 5.

2. From STOLE:  
   – S is in the correct position (position 1).  
   – T is in the word (but not in position 2).  
   – O is NOT in the word.  
   – L is in the word (but not in position 4).  
   – E is in the word (again) but still not in position 5.

Putting it together:

- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _ (S is locked in position 1).  
- Letters we know must appear: E, T, L (each at least once).  
- Letters definitely absent: C, R, A, N, O.  
- We’ve used E in positions 4 and 5 so far, so E could be in 2 or 3 (or 1 if duplicates were allowed, but S is already in 1).  
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STOLE feedback).  
- L cannot be in position 4 (from STOLE feedback).

Common 5-letter words starting with S that fit these constraints:
- S T E _ _  (but T cannot be in position 2, so discard).  
- S _ T _ _  (but T is somewhere).  
- S _ _ E _  or S _ _ _ E  (but E cannot be in position 5).  
Let’s try to place E in position 2, T in 3, and L where it’s allowed.

After checking, “STYLE” fits:  
- S is in position 1 (✓).  
- T is in position 3 (allowed, since T was only excluded from position 2).  
- Y is a new letter but must be checked.  
- L is in position 4 (but earlier feedback said L is NOT in position 4). Oops, conflict!

Next candidate: “STELE” – but double E might be unlikely and still has L in position 4 (invalid).

Candidate: “SETEL” – invalid (not a common word).

Candidate: “STEEL” – again L in 4 (invalid).

Candidate: “SLEET” –  
- S(1) ✓  
- L is in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 3 or 4  
- T in 5 (allowed)  
Let’s check positions: S L E E T – but E duplicates might not help, and L is in 2 (allowed).

However, E cannot be in position 5 (from first guess). In SLEET, E appears in 3 and 4, which is fine.

But a cleaner candidate might be “SLEPT”:

- S(1) ✓  
- L(2) allowed (L not excluded from 2)  
- E(3) allowed  
- P is new, needs testing  
- T(5) allowed (T only excluded from 2)  

This looks compliant and tests a new consonant P.

So new guess: “SLEPT”.
