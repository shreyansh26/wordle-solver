For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to help gather information about the secret word. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll select a word that uses several of these common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.

After considering several options, I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 5 distinct letters
- All letters are among the most common in English words
- Good mix of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)
- This should give me information about multiple letters and their positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in wrong positions (-).

Since R, O, S, E are all correct letters but misplaced, I can deduce:
1. The word contains R, O, S, E in some order (but NOT where they were in AROSE, i.e., R is not in position 2, O not in position 3, S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
2. The remaining letter must be a consonant or vowel not yet tested (since A is out).

Common consonants not used yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

I need a word that uses R, O, S, E in different positions and adds one new letter. ""STORE"" comes to mind, but that would place S in position 4 which was already marked wrong (S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked -, meaning it's in the word but not position 4). 

Another option: ""ROSES"" - but this reuses S and E in positions 4 and 5 which we know are wrong.

Better: ""SORED"" - but ""D"" isn't super common.

""ROTES"" - this moves R from position 2 to 1, O from 3 to 2, S from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4, and adds T. This seems optimal as it shifts all known letters to new positions and tests T.

So far we know:

Letters in the word (but not yet in correct spots):  
- R (not in position 1 or 2)  
- S (not in position 3 or 5)  
- E (not in position 4 or 5)  

Letters confirmed in their correct positions:  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  

Letters already ruled out: A, T.

Therefore the pattern is: _ O _ E _ with the remaining letters coming from {R, S} plus one more letter we haven’t tested yet (and that more letter must be in positions 1, 3, or 5).

We still need R and S somewhere, and they haven’t been placed correctly yet.

Possible placements:
- R can’t be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3 or 5.
- S can’t be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in 1.

Therefore S must be in position 1.

That leaves R for position 3 or 5, but position 3 is already filled by the unknown letter, so R must be in position 5.

So far we have: S O _ E R. That leaves position 3 to be filled by a new letter (not A, T, O, E, S, R). Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

The word that fits this pattern is “SONER” (but that’s not a valid English word).

Next best: “SOWER” – W hasn’t been tested yet and fits position 3.

Let’s check:
- S in 1 (allowed – wasn’t ruled out of 1)  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- W in 3 (new letter)  
- E in 4 (✓)  
- R in 5 (allowed – wasn’t ruled out of 5)
