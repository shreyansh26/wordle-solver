- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters in different positions to quickly narrow down possibilities. Classic starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" which contain frequently used English letters.

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" stands out because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- These are all very common letters in English
- The positions are varied (vowels in 1st, 3rd, 5th positions; consonants in 2nd, 4th)
- It can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

From the feedback:
- A is in the correct position (first letter)
- R is in the word but wrong position (not 2nd)
- O is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but wrong position (not 5th)

So we know:
- Word starts with A
- Contains R and E somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does not contain O or S
- R can be in positions 3,4,5
- E can be in positions 2,3,4

Possible combinations to test:
- A _ _ R _ or A _ _ _ R (but R can't be 5th because it's possible)
- A _ E _ _ or A _ _ E _ or A _ _ _ E (but E can't be 5th)

Let's try a word that places E in position 2 and R in position 3: A E R _ _
A good candidate is ""AERIE"" but that repeats E which might not be efficient. Instead, let's try ""AERIE"" or ""AEROS"" but we know S is out, so ""AERIE"" is invalid (repeats E and has I). Better to try ""AERON"" but N hasn't been tested yet.

Actually, let's try ""ARENA"":
- A is correct
- R moves to position 2 (from original position 2 which was wrong, but now we're trying position 3)
- E is in position 4 (possible since E can't be 5th)
- N and A are new letters to test

Wait, let's think more systematically. We need to test new consonants while keeping known letters. Since we have A fixed at 1 and know R and E must be somewhere, let's try placing E in 2 and R in 4: A E _ R _

A good word would be ""AEGER"" but that's not common. ""ALERT"" is better but uses L and T which are new. 

""ALTER"" seems good:
- A correct at 1
- E at 2 (allowed since E can't be 5th)
- R at 4 (allowed since R can't be 2nd)
- Tests new letters L and T
