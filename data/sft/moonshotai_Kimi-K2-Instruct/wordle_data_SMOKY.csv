This is the first guess, so I have no prior information to work with. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should:

1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to quickly identify which vowels are in the word
2. Include common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) which appear frequently in English words
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gained

One of the best starting words according to word game enthusiasts is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Another strong option is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A, O, E (three different vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests three vowels and two top consonants, giving maximum information about letter presence in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is not in the word (x) – so eliminate R from consideration.
- O is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

Key deductions so far:
1. Letters ruled out: A, R, E
2. Positions we know:
   - Position 3 = O
3. Letters that must appear somewhere in the word: S, O
4. S cannot be in position 4.

Possible structure: _ _ O _ _  (with S appearing in 1, 2, or 5)

I need a new guess that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Includes S but not in position 4.
- Uses letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, E).
- Doesn’t use any confirmed-absent letters.

Good candidate consonants left: T, L, N, C, D, G, H, etc.
Good candidate vowels left: I, U (since O is already present and A/E are out).

So I’ll pick a word like:
- T O S I C, but TOSIC isn’t a valid word.
- D O S T I – DOSTI isn’t valid.
- S T O I C – STOIC is a valid English word.

STOIC has:
- S in position 1 (satisfies S present and not in position 4).
- T, I, C all new letters to test.
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Contains no ruled-out letters (A, R, E).

Let’s extract every piece of information from the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in position 3 and therefore fixed there.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. STOIC → S(✓) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - S is in position 1 and fixed there.
   - O is in position 3.
   - T, I, C are not in the word at all.

3. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is confirmed at position 1 again.
   - O is in the word (position 3) but we just saw the feedback symbol “-” for position 2.  
     That “-” actually means “letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.”  
     However, we already know O is in position 3 (✓ from earlier), so the feedback “-” on O in position 2 is redundant but consistent (it simply confirms O is in the word).  
     No new info for O.
   - U, N, D are NOT in the word.

Known so far:
- Word structure: S _ O _ _
- Letters banned so far: A, R, E, T, I, C, U, N, D
- Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4 (no repeats, from the allowed set).

Looking for common consonants that remain:
- L, M, P, B are among the most common left.

Try simple combinations:
- S L O _ _  → need one more letter for position 4.
- S L O B _  → SLOBS (but S already used once and cannot be repeated; actually S is allowed to appear twice, but it’s not likely).
- S L O W _  → SLOW_  (but we need 5 letters).
- S L O P _  → SLOPS (again double S).
- S L O G _  → SLOGS (double S again).

Better to avoid double letters. Let’s pick two different consonants:
- S P O K _  → SPOKE (but E and K status: K is allowed, E is banned).
- S M O K _  → SMOKY (Y is allowed, K is allowed, M is allowed).

So SMOKY looks valid:
- S(✓), M, O(✓), K, Y
- All letters are from the allowed set, no repeats, no banned letters.

Let’s lock that in.
