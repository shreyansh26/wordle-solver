For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in strategic positions. The best opening words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters
- Good positional coverage

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) 
- Each letter is unique
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter): x → not in word  
- R (2nd letter): - → in word, but wrong position  
- O (3rd letter): x → not in word  
- S (4th letter): x → not in word  
- E (5th letter): - → in word, but wrong position  

So the target word:
- Contains R and E, but neither in the 2nd/5th slots respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

Next I should look for a word that:
1. Keeps R and E
2. Places them in new positions
3. Introduces fresh high-frequency letters (T, L, N, I, etc.)
4. Avoids A, O, S

Candidate letters to add: T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.

Looking at possible patterns:
R needs to be in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
E needs to be in positions 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

Let’s try TRINE:
- T and N are new high-frequency letters
- R is placed in position 2 → invalid (feedback said R is -, i.e., not in position 2)
Try INTER: R is position 4, E is position 5 → E can’t be 5 (invalid)
Try NERT: too short.
Try UNTIE: includes A (no), O (no), S (no) – but has U, N, T, I, E with R not present – no R.
Try URENT: has A – no.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is in the word, NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word, NOT in position 5.
   - A, O, S are not in the word at all.

   - E is still in the word, NOT in position 3.
   - R is still in the word, NOT in position 4.
   - I, N, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: R, E (both must appear at least once).
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N, T.
- The word must be 5 letters long, using other common English letters (from the remaining set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and must place R and E in allowed positions.

Let’s list remaining available letters:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback 1 and 2).
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback 1 and 2).

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
- Then E must be in 2 or 4.

Try REBEL:
- R(1), E(2), B, E(4), L
But E appears twice, and we don’t know if E appears once or twice. Also, E(4) is allowed, but we might want to test single occurrence first.

Try RELIC:
- R(1), E(2), L, I, C
But I is invalid (from feedback 2). So I is out.

Try RULER:
- R(1), U, L, E(4), R(5)
R appears twice, which is possible, but let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try REALM:
- R(1), E(2), A, L, M
A is invalid.

Try REBID:
- R(1), E(2), B, I, D
I is invalid.

Try FERRY:
- R(3), E(2), R appears twice. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try CREPE:

R cannot be in 2 (invalid), E cannot be in 3 or 5 (invalid).

Try PERCH:
- P, E(2), R(3), C, H
E in 2 is allowed, R in 3 is allowed. Uses new letters P, C, H. Checks all constraints:
- Contains R (in 3) and E (in 2), both in allowed positions.
- No A, O, S, I, N, T.
- All letters are from remaining valid set.

- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) 
- Each letter is unique
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter): x → not in word  
- R (2nd letter): - → in word, but wrong position  
- O (3rd letter): x → not in word  
- S (4th letter): x → not in word  
- E (5th letter): - → in word, but wrong position  

So the target word:
- Contains R and E, but neither in the 2nd/5th slots respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

Next I should look for a word that:
1. Keeps R and E
2. Places them in new positions
3. Introduces fresh high-frequency letters (T, L, N, I, etc.)
4. Avoids A, O, S

Candidate letters to add: T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.

Looking at possible patterns:
R needs to be in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
E needs to be in positions 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

Let’s try TRINE:
- T and N are new high-frequency letters
- R is placed in position 2 → invalid (feedback said R is -, i.e., not in position 2)
Try INTER: R is position 4, E is position 5 → E can’t be 5 (invalid)
Try NERT: too short.
Try UNTIE: includes A (no), O (no), S (no) – but has U, N, T, I, E with R not present – no R.
Try URENT: has A – no.
Try DITER: has S – no.
Try TIRED: R in 3, E in 5 – E can’t be 5 (invalid)
Try TRIED: R in 2 – invalid
Try INERT: R in 4, E in 2 – both valid placements; uses N, I, T as new letters.

INERT:
- I, N, E, R, T
- R in 4th (allowed)
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- No A, O, S
- All new letters I, N, T
This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of the feedback so far:
1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is in the word, NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word, NOT in position 5.
   - A, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
   - E is still in the word, NOT in position 3.
   - R is still in the word, NOT in position 4.
   - I, N, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: R, E (both must appear at least once).
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N, T.
- The word must be 5 letters long, using other common English letters (from the remaining set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and must place R and E in allowed positions.

Let’s list remaining available letters:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback 1 and 2).
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback 1 and 2).

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
- Then E must be in 2 or 4.

Try REBEL:
- R(1), E(2), B, E(4), L
But E appears twice, and we don’t know if E appears once or twice. Also, E(4) is allowed, but we might want to test single occurrence first.

Try RELIC:
- R(1), E(2), L, I, C
But I is invalid (from feedback 2). So I is out.

Try RULER:
- R(1), U, L, E(4), R(5)
R appears twice, which is possible, but let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try REALM:
- R(1), E(2), A, L, M
A is invalid.

Try REBID:
- R(1), E(2), B, I, D
I is invalid.

Try FERRY:
- R(3), E(2), R appears twice. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try CREPE:
- C, R(2), E(3), P, E(5)
R cannot be in 2 (invalid), E cannot be in 3 or 5 (invalid).

Try PERCH:
- P, E(2), R(3), C, H
E in 2 is allowed, R in 3 is allowed. Uses new letters P, C, H. Checks all constraints:
- Contains R (in 3) and E (in 2), both in allowed positions.
- No A, O, S, I, N, T.
- All letters are from remaining valid set.
- No double letters.

This seems like the optimal next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,rebel,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters in strategic positions. The best opening words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters
- Good positional coverage

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to quickly identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) 
- Each letter is unique
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This gives us maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter): x → not in word  
- R (2nd letter): - → in word, but wrong position  
- O (3rd letter): x → not in word  
- S (4th letter): x → not in word  
- E (5th letter): - → in word, but wrong position  

So the target word:
- Contains R and E, but neither in the 2nd/5th slots respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.

Next I should look for a word that:
1. Keeps R and E
2. Places them in new positions
3. Introduces fresh high-frequency letters (T, L, N, I, etc.)
4. Avoids A, O, S

Candidate letters to add: T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.

Looking at possible patterns:
R needs to be in positions 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
E needs to be in positions 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

Let’s try TRINE:
- T and N are new high-frequency letters
- R is placed in position 2 → invalid (feedback said R is -, i.e., not in position 2)
Try INTER: R is position 4, E is position 5 → E can’t be 5 (invalid)
Try NERT: too short.
Try UNTIE: includes A (no), O (no), S (no) – but has U, N, T, I, E with R not present – no R.
Try URENT: has A – no.
Try DITER: has S – no.
Try TIRED: R in 3, E in 5 – E can’t be 5 (invalid)
Try TRIED: R in 2 – invalid
Try INERT: R in 4, E in 2 – both valid placements; uses N, I, T as new letters.

INERT:
- I, N, E, R, T
- R in 4th (allowed)
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- No A, O, S
- All new letters I, N, T
This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of the feedback so far:
1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is in the word, NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word, NOT in position 5.
   - A, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)
   - E is still in the word, NOT in position 3.
   - R is still in the word, NOT in position 4.
   - I, N, T are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: R, E (both must appear at least once).
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N, T.
- The word must be 5 letters long, using other common English letters (from the remaining set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and must place R and E in allowed positions.

Let’s list remaining available letters:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from feedback 1 and 2).
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from feedback 1 and 2).

So possible positions for R: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4  

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
- Then E must be in 2 or 4.

Try REBEL:
- R(1), E(2), B, E(4), L
But E appears twice, and we don’t know if E appears once or twice. Also, E(4) is allowed, but we might want to test single occurrence first.

Try RELIC:
- R(1), E(2), L, I, C
But I is invalid (from feedback 2). So I is out.

Try RULER:
- R(1), U, L, E(4), R(5)
R appears twice, which is possible, but let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try REALM:
- R(1), E(2), A, L, M
A is invalid.

Try REBID:
- R(1), E(2), B, I, D
I is invalid.

Try FERRY:
- R(3), E(2), R appears twice. Let’s avoid double letters for now.

Try CREPE:
- C, R(2), E(3), P, E(5)
R cannot be in 2 (invalid), E cannot be in 3 or 5 (invalid).

Try PERCH:
- P, E(2), R(3), C, H
E in 2 is allowed, R in 3 is allowed. Uses new letters P, C, H. Checks all constraints:
- Contains R (in 3) and E (in 2), both in allowed positions.
- No A, O, S, I, N, T.
- All letters are from remaining valid set.
- No double letters.

1. We now have:
   - R fixed at position 1
   - E fixed at position 2
   - L fixed at position 5
   - G and U are NOT in the word
2. Therefore the word must be R E _ _ L with the two blanks filled by letters that have never been ruled out.
3. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, N, T, P, C, H, Y, G, U.
4. Remaining usable letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven’t used yet).
5. We need a valid English word of the form RE__L.
   Quick scan:  
   - REFEL – invalid (double E)  
   - REBEL – invalid (B already placed at 1, E would repeat at 4)  
   - REDEL – double E  
   - REMEL – double E  
   - REVEL – double E  
   - RENEL – N ruled out  
   - REFEL – already noted  
   - REDLY – D and Y; Y is ruled out  
   - REFLY – Y ruled out  
   - REXEL – X and E (double E)  
   - REVEL – double E  
   - REGIL – I ruled out  
   - REZEL – Z and E (double E)  
   - REDOX – O ruled out  
   - REFIX – I and X; I ruled out  
   - REFRY – Y ruled out  
   - RETAX – T, A ruled out  
   - REDYE – Y ruled out  
   - REJEL – J and E (double E)  

   Only remaining plausible single-E candidate is **REDLY**, but Y is forbidden.  
   The next simple single-E candidate is **REBEL**, but B is already placed at 1 and E would have to repeat.  
   The only clean single-E word left is **REFEL**, but again double-E.  

   Realisation: every English RE__L word either repeats E (invalid) or contains a banned letter.  
   Therefore the only possibility left is **REBEL** even though B is already known to be in the word (feedback for BERYL said B(-), i.e., B exists but is not at position 1).  
   But in REBEL, B is at position 3 (allowed), and no other constraints are violated.

   So the unique viable guess is:
