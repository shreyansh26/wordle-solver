### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information by including common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This will help narrow down possibilities regardless of the feedback. Some good starting words include CRANE, SLATE, STARE, or RAISE. These words contain common consonants and vowels.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C: A common consonant
- R: A very common consonant
- A: The most common vowel
- N: A common consonant
- E: The most common letter in English

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

That eliminates a large chunk of 5-letter words, so I should pick a completely fresh set of letters for the next guess.

What do we now know?

Letters completely excluded: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, M, P, Y  
Known-good letters: U (and it is in the 2nd position)  
Known-misplaced letter: L (is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1)

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _  
And it must contain an L somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).

Remaining unused common letters: D, G, H, I, K, V, W, B, F, J, Q, Z (but we want only valid 5-letter English words).  
We need 3 more different letters (none of the excluded ones) plus that L.

Possible patterns:  
- L must go in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- The other two positions must be filled with the still-allowed letters

Let’s list candidate words:

1. BU__L – but B is allowed? B not on the excluded list; no feedback against it.  
   BUILD – has B, U, I, L, D.  
   All letters (B, I, D) are still allowed. U is fixed at 2, L would be at 4 (allowed).  
   This looks promising.

2. GU__L – e.g., GUILD. But that repeats the same pattern as BUILD with G instead of B.  
   G is still allowed, but we only need one guess right now.

I’ll go with BUILD first because it’s common and tests B, I, D.

<guess>BUILD</guess>",BUILD,"What do we now know?

Letters completely excluded: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, M, P, Y  
Known-good letters: U (and it is in the 2nd position)  
Known-misplaced letter: L (is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1)

So the word looks like: _ U _ _ _  
And it must contain an L somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).

Remaining unused common letters: D, G, H, I, K, V, W, B, F, J, Q, Z (but we want only valid 5-letter English words).  
We need 3 more different letters (none of the excluded ones) plus that L.

Possible patterns:  
- L must go in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- The other two positions must be filled with the still-allowed letters

Let’s list candidate words:

1. BU__L – but B is allowed? B not on the excluded list; no feedback against it.  
   BUILD – has B, U, I, L, D.  
   All letters (B, I, D) are still allowed. U is fixed at 2, L would be at 4 (allowed).  
   This looks promising.

2. GU__L – e.g., GUILD. But that repeats the same pattern as BUILD with G instead of B.  
   G is still allowed, but we only need one guess right now.

I’ll go with BUILD first because it’s common and tests B, I, D.",Guess 4: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information by including common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This will help narrow down possibilities regardless of the feedback. Some good starting words include CRANE, SLATE, STARE, or RAISE. These words contain common consonants and vowels.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C: A common consonant
- R: A very common consonant
- A: The most common vowel
- N: A common consonant
- E: The most common letter in English

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a large chunk of 5-letter words, so I should pick a completely fresh set of letters for the next guess.  
To maximize information again, I’ll choose a word using the next-tier most common letters that weren’t in CRANE: S, T, O, I, L, U, D, P, M, etc.  

A balanced starter that avoids every letter already ruled out is “STOUT”.  
It uses:  
- S (common consonant)  
- T (common consonant)  
- O (common vowel)  
- U (common vowel)  
- T (again, but allowed to repeat)  

This will help determine if any of these new letters are in the word.

- Contains the letter U (but not in position 4)
- Contains none of C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O

Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words with U and only these remaining letters. Some candidates:
- LUMPY (L, U, M, P, Y) - all letters allowed
- DUMPY (D, U, M, P, Y) - all letters allowed
- JUMPY - but J isn't in our common letters, probably less likely
- BULKY - but B isn't in our list

Between LUMPY and DUMPY, both are equally valid. I'll choose LUMPY first as it tests L, M, P, Y.

From the latest feedback we now know:

- The exact word pattern: _ U I L D (because U, I, L, D are all in their correct positions).  
- The only missing letter is the first one, and it must be a letter that has never been ruled out.

Letters already excluded in any position:  
C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, M, P, Y, B  

That leaves a limited set of consonants for the first position:  
D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, we need a single letter that makes a valid 5-letter English word when placed in front of “UILD”.

Scanning possibilities:  
- F → FUILD → Not a valid English word.  
- G → GUILD → Valid word.  
- H → HUILD → Not valid.  
- W → WUILD → Not valid.  
- Other letters (D, I, J, K, L, Q, V, X, Z) either create non-words or repeat excluded letters.

GUILD is the only valid candidate left.
