For the first guess, we want to choose a word that is strategically optimal to maximize information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Include vowels and common consonants

Popular choices for first guesses include words like:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - though this uses 4 vowels which might be excessive
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's statistically one of the best starting words according to Wordle analysis, containing very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) without repeats.

From the first guess CRANE we learned:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it’s not in position 2
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, but not in slot 2
- Does NOT contain C, A, N, or E

Next step: pick a word that:
1. Has R in a position other than 2
2. Uses none of the ruled-out letters (C, A, N, E)
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tried yet

Good fresh letters to try: T, I, S, O, L, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places R in slot 3 (to avoid slot 2) and introduces new common letters:
- Could use “BURST” but it has U and S and T
- Could use “DIRTY” but Y is less common
- Could use “MURKY” but K is less common
- “FIRST” uses common letters except F isn’t super common
- “TRUST” has T, U, S

Let’s choose “TRUST”:
- R is in slot 2 – but we know R is NOT in slot 2 from feedback (R(-) in CRANE means it’s not in slot 2) – so this is bad.

Oops, let’s avoid slot 2 for R. Let’s try “BROTH”:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R, I, H  
Letter that IS in the word and in the correct position: T (last letter, slot 5)

So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ T  
Must contain the letters R, I, H somewhere in the first four slots, each in a different slot from where they appeared before.

Previous positions to avoid:
- R cannot be in slot 1 (from RIGHT) or slot 2 (from CRANE)  
- I cannot be in slot 2 (from RIGHT)  
- H cannot be in slot 4 (from RIGHT)

Fresh letters we still might try: S, U, L, D, O, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that contains R, I, H and no C, A, N, E, G.

Let’s list possible valid placements:

Available slots: 1, 2, 3, 4 (with T fixed in 5)

Possible positions for R: only slots 3 or 4  
Possible positions for I: slots 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for H: slots 1, 2, 3  

Let’s look for common words that fit.

Example candidates:
- DIRTH (but D, I, R, T, H) – all letters are fresh or confirmed, and R in 3, I in 2 (allowed), H in 4 (allowed). Wait H cannot be in 4 (from RIGHT it was in 4 and got ""-""), so H must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Another candidate: THIRD  
- T is already fixed in 5, so this is _ _ _ _ T. THIRD doesn’t fit that.

Wait let me just list a word that ends in T, has R, I, H, and avoids the disallowed positions.

Let me try BIRTH:
- B, I, R, T, H – no forbidden letters  
- Ends in T  
- R in slot 3 – allowed (was in 1 and 2 before)  
- I in slot 2 – allowed (was in 2 in RIGHT but feedback was “-” meaning it is in word but wrong position, so slot 2 was wrong for I, so I cannot be in 2 again). So I cannot be in 2. Therefore BIRTH is invalid.

Let me try HIRT? No.

Wait, how about FRITH? FRITH is a valid English word meaning “peace” (archaic) or a wood/woodland edge (Scots). Letters: F, R, I, T, H  
- All letters are fresh except R, I, T, H which we know are in the word  
- R in 2 – but R cannot be in 2 (from CRANE) – so FRITH is invalid.

Next idea: DIRTY – but Y is not confirmed, and we need H.

Let me try SHIFT:
- S, H, I, F, T  
- Ends in T  
- H in 1, I in 3, R missing – but we need R.

Need word with R, I, H, T.

Let me try “THIRD” again – but it’s _ _ _ _ T and THIRD doesn’t fit.

Wait, the word must be _ _ _ _ T and contain R, I, H.

Let me think systematically:

Possible arrangements with R, I, H in first four slots and T last:

Slots 1-4 must contain R, I, H and one other letter (from remaining allowed: B, D, F, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

We know:
- R cannot be 1 or 2  
- I cannot be 2  
- H cannot be 4  

So R must be 3 or 4  
I must be 1, 3, or 4  
H must be 1, 2, or 3  

Let’s try R in 3:

Then I and H must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but H cannot be 4)  
So possible:

H I R _ T – but then H is 1, I is 2 – allowed? I cannot be 2 (from RIGHT it was in 2 and got “-”) – so I cannot be 2.

Next: I H R _ T – I in 1, H in 2, R in 3 – all allowed positions.

So “I H R _ T” – need a letter for slot 4, can’t be forbidden letters, and must form a word. Possible letters: S, D, etc. “IHRS T” – not a word. “IHRA T” – no.

Next arrangement: R in 4:

Then I and H must be in 1, 2, or 3, with their restrictions.

Try H I _ R T – H in 1, I in 2 – but I cannot be 2.

I H _ R T – I in 1, H in 2 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 3, e.g., S: I H S R T – no.

Next: H _ I R T – H in 1, I in 3 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 2, e.g., L: H L I R T – no word.

_ H I R T – H in 2, I in 3 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 1, e.g., S: S H I R T – “SHIRT”

SHIRT:
- S, H, I, R, T  
- Ends in T (✓)  
- Contains R, I, H (✓)  
- R in 4 – allowed (was in 1 and 2 before)  
- I in 3 – allowed (was in 2 before)  
- H in 2 – allowed (was in 4 before)  
- All other letters are fresh and allowed  
- No forbidden letters

This looks valid.

</think>

From the feedback we know:
- The word ends with T (position 5 fixed).
- It must contain R, I, and H, each in new positions.
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, G.

The only common word that satisfies these constraints is:

Let’s look for common words that fit.

Example candidates:
- DIRTH (but D, I, R, T, H) – all letters are fresh or confirmed, and R in 3, I in 2 (allowed), H in 4 (allowed). Wait H cannot be in 4 (from RIGHT it was in 4 and got ""-""), so H must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Another candidate: THIRD  
- T is already fixed in 5, so this is _ _ _ _ T. THIRD doesn’t fit that.

Wait let me just list a word that ends in T, has R, I, H, and avoids the disallowed positions.

Let me try BIRTH:
- B, I, R, T, H – no forbidden letters  
- Ends in T  
- R in slot 3 – allowed (was in 1 and 2 before)  
- I in slot 2 – allowed (was in 2 in RIGHT but feedback was “-” meaning it is in word but wrong position, so slot 2 was wrong for I, so I cannot be in 2 again). So I cannot be in 2. Therefore BIRTH is invalid.

Let me try HIRT? No.

Wait, how about FRITH? FRITH is a valid English word meaning “peace” (archaic) or a wood/woodland edge (Scots). Letters: F, R, I, T, H  
- All letters are fresh except R, I, T, H which we know are in the word  
- R in 2 – but R cannot be in 2 (from CRANE) – so FRITH is invalid.

Next idea: DIRTY – but Y is not confirmed, and we need H.

Let me try SHIFT:
- S, H, I, F, T  
- Ends in T  
- H in 1, I in 3, R missing – but we need R.

Need word with R, I, H, T.

Let me try “THIRD” again – but it’s _ _ _ _ T and THIRD doesn’t fit.

Wait, the word must be _ _ _ _ T and contain R, I, H.

Let me think systematically:

Possible arrangements with R, I, H in first four slots and T last:

Slots 1-4 must contain R, I, H and one other letter (from remaining allowed: B, D, F, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

We know:
- R cannot be 1 or 2  
- I cannot be 2  
- H cannot be 4  

So R must be 3 or 4  
I must be 1, 3, or 4  
H must be 1, 2, or 3  

Let’s try R in 3:

Then I and H must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but H cannot be 4)  
So possible:

H I R _ T – but then H is 1, I is 2 – allowed? I cannot be 2 (from RIGHT it was in 2 and got “-”) – so I cannot be 2.

Next: I H R _ T – I in 1, H in 2, R in 3 – all allowed positions.

So “I H R _ T” – need a letter for slot 4, can’t be forbidden letters, and must form a word. Possible letters: S, D, etc. “IHRS T” – not a word. “IHRA T” – no.

Next arrangement: R in 4:

Then I and H must be in 1, 2, or 3, with their restrictions.

Try H I _ R T – H in 1, I in 2 – but I cannot be 2.

I H _ R T – I in 1, H in 2 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 3, e.g., S: I H S R T – no.

Next: H _ I R T – H in 1, I in 3 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 2, e.g., L: H L I R T – no word.

_ H I R T – H in 2, I in 3 – allowed  
Need letter for slot 1, e.g., S: S H I R T – “SHIRT”

SHIRT:
- S, H, I, R, T  
- Ends in T (✓)  
- Contains R, I, H (✓)  
- R in 4 – allowed (was in 1 and 2 before)  
- I in 3 – allowed (was in 2 before)  
- H in 2 – allowed (was in 4 before)  
- All other letters are fresh and allowed  
- No forbidden letters

This looks valid.From the feedback we know:
- The word ends with T (position 5 fixed).
- It must contain R, I, and H, each in new positions.
- Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, G.

The only common word that satisfies these constraints is:",Guess 3: SHIRT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
