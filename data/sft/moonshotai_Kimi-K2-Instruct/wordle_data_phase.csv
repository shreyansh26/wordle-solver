For the first guess, we want a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the information we get. Statistically, the most common letters in English are E, A, T, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, and C. A good first guess would use a mix of these letters to test as many as possible.

One common strategy is to use words like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" which contain high-frequency letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the top 7 most common letters.

From the first feedback:
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) and O(x) mean R and O are not in the word at all.
- S(✓) and E(✓) mean S and E are in the word and in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ S E  
and it contains A (but not in position 1), S, and E, and does not contain R or O.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that fits these constraints and gives us more letters to test. The word must not contain R or O, must have S in position 4 and E in position 5, and must have A somewhere (but not in position 1).

A good next guess would be something that keeps the known letters (S, E) and tests new high-frequency letters in the remaining positions. Since we know the last two letters are S and E, we can focus on the first three positions. We need to include A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already S), so A must be in 2 or 3.

Possible structure: _ A _ S E or _ _ A S E.

Let's try ""CHASE"":
- C, H are new high-frequency letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it's not position 1).
- S and E are kept in positions 4 and 5.
- Does not contain R or O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two turns we now know:

Positions:
1 : not A, R, O, C (from guesses 1 & 2: A-, R x, O x, C x)
2 : A ✓  → must be A
3 : H ✓  → must be H  
4 : S ✓  → must be S  
5 : E ✓  → must be E  

So the hidden word has the fixed pattern: _ A H S E

We still have to determine which letter is in position 1.  
It must be a consonant that is not R, O, or C (already ruled out).  
Common English consonants that fit and form a real word include:  
- B → BA HSE  
- D → DA HSE  
- F → FA HSE  
- L → LA HSE  
- M → MA HSE  
- P → PA HSE  
- W → WA HSE  

All of these are valid five-letter English spellings except “BA HSE” and “DA HSE” which are not words.  
“MA HSE” (MAHSE) is not a standard word.  
“PA HSE” (PAHSE) is also not a word.  

The most common and dictionary-valid word among these is **PHASE** (P H A S E), but we already know position 3 must be H, so P H A S E would be P ✓ H ✓ A ✓ S ✓ E ✓.
