For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover several of these letters without repeating any to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular choices for first guesses are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E which covers common consonants and vowels. Similarly, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which is also strong. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes the common vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is **not** in the word.

- Moves S to position 1.  
- Introduces T, N, I, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Of the two, I’ll pick STOLI because L and I are common and haven’t been tested.

So the new guess is STOLI.

Letters already eliminated (from all guesses): A, R, E, N, Y, C, K, L, I.

Remaining common letters that can appear in positions 4 and 5 (must be different, not yet used):  
B, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Scanning common English 5-letter words that begin with “STO”:

- STOMP – M and P (both still allowed)  
- STOUP – U and P (both allowed)  
- STOVE – E is out  
- STOWS – repeats S  
- STOTY – Y out  
- STOGY – Y out  

Between STOMP and STOUP, let’s test STOMP first because M and P are high-frequency consonants.

So the new guess is STOMP.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Among these, ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E which covers common consonants and vowels. Similarly, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E which is also strong.

We now have the fixed pattern S T O _ _, and we know the two remaining letters are **not** any of:

That leaves the still-unused letters:  
B, D, F, G, H, U, V, W, X, Z
