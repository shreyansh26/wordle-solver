This is my first guess, so I have no prior information to work with. The goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers different positions to efficiently narrow down possibilities. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to test their presence and positions. 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"", I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), providing good coverage for elimination.

From the feedback we know:
- E is in the word and in position 5.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E, and the remaining letters we can rule out are A, R, O, S.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, Y, etc.

A good second guess should use:
1. The confirmed E in position 5.
2. A fresh set of common letters that weren’t in AROSE.

Options like UNITY, UNTIE, or LINED would reuse E but introduce new letters. I’ll pick ""UNITY"" because it keeps E in slot 5 and tests U, N, I, T, which are all high-frequency letters not yet tried.

What we now know for certain:

1. Positions:  
   - Position 5 is E ✓  
   - Position 2 is I ✓  
   - Position 4 is G ✓  

2. Letters not in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, Y, M, D  

So the pattern is: _ I _ G E

We still need positions 1 and 3.  
Available letters (that haven’t been ruled out and are common in 5-letter words):  
B, C, F, H, K, L, P, W, V, Z… plus a few vowels.

To maximize information, choose consonants that are frequent and distinct.

A good candidate word is “FILGE” but FILGE is not a valid English word.  
Next, let’s pick a real word that fits the pattern: “HIDGE” isn’t valid either.  
A valid common word that fits: “LIDGE” isn’t in most dictionaries, but “WIDGE” isn’t a valid word.

Real words:  
- “BILGE” – check letters: B, I, L, G, E. All letters untested except I, G, E which are confirmed.  
- “FILLE” – duplicates L and E already placed.  
- “PILGE” – not valid.  

So the best valid word left is “BILGE”.

It fits our pattern: B (new letter, position 1) + I + L (new letter, position 3) + G + E.

   - Position 4 is G ✓  

2. Letters not in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, Y, M, D  

So the pattern is: _ I _ G E

We still need positions 1 and 3.  
Available letters (that haven’t been ruled out and are common in 5-letter words):  
B, C, F, H, K, L, P, W, V, Z… plus a few vowels.

To maximize information, choose consonants that are frequent and distinct.

A good candidate word is “FILGE” but FILGE is not a valid English word.  
Next, let’s pick a real word that fits the pattern: “HIDGE” isn’t valid either.  
A valid common word that fits: “LIDGE” isn’t in most dictionaries, but “WIDGE” isn’t a valid word.

Real words:  
- “BILGE” – check letters: B, I, L, G, E. All letters untested except I, G, E which are confirmed.  
- “FILLE” – duplicates L and E already placed.  
- “PILGE” – not valid.  

So the best valid word left is “BILGE”.

It fits our pattern: B (new letter, position 1) + I + L (new letter, position 3) + G + E.",Guess 4: BILGE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) L(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
