For my first guess, I don't have any information about the secret word yet. A good opening word should:
1. Use common letters to maximize the chance of matching letters in the secret word
2. Include vowels (especially A and E) since most English words contain them
3. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, or Z initially

Popular strategic opening words include:
- CRANE (uses common letters C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains four of the five most common English letters (E, A, R, N) plus C, giving a good chance of getting hits while covering diverse letter positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (it could be 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).

So the word ends with E and contains A somewhere else.  
Letters ruled out so far: C, R, N.  
Letters still allowed: all others except C, R, N.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E in the last slot.
2. Move A to a new position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Use new common letters to gather more information.

Possible candidates:
- SLATE – but S, L, T, E are all new; A moves to slot 2.
- PLATE – P, L, T new; A in slot 2.
- STARE – S, T new; A in slot 3 again (bad, still wrong spot).
- GLADE – G, L, D new; A in slot 2.

I'll pick SLATE because it places A in position 2, keeps E in 5, and introduces S, L, T – all common letters not yet tested.

From the three guesses we have:

1. crane → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
2. slate → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
3. gambe → G(x) A(-) M(x) B(-) E(✓)

Known facts:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The word definitely contains A, but A is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
  Therefore A must be in position 1.
- The word also contains B (because B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 4).
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, N, S, L, T, G, M.

So the pattern is: A _ _ _ E, and it must use B somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
Remaining unused common letters: D, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible valid 5-letter words that fit:
- ABIDE – uses B in position 2, D and I are new.  (But we need to check if I and D are allowed – yes, they haven’t been ruled out.)
- ABODE – uses B in position 2, O and D are new.
- ADIBE – invalid (not a word).
- AMBLE – invalid (M already ruled out).
- AUBLE – invalid (U and L – L is ruled out).

ABIDE and ABODE are the most promising.  
I’ll choose ABIDE because it tests three new letters (B, I, D) while keeping A and E in their known correct spots.
