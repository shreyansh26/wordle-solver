- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the most strategic approach is to choose a word that provides maximum information. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T)
2. Avoid duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage
3. Include both vowels and consonants

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It covers 5 distinct common letters
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving good coverage for elimination/inclusion

From the feedback on RAISE:

R (x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A (-) – A is in the word, but not in position 2.  
I (-) – I is in the word, but not in position 3.  
S (-) – S is in the word, but not in position 4.  
E (x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude completely: R, E  
- Letters that are somewhere in the word (positions not yet fixed): A, I, S  
- No information about the 1st or 5th positions yet.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A, I, S (and place them in new positions to test where they fit).  
2. Introduce new common letters to discover the remaining two unknown positions.  
3. Avoid R, E.

Candidate words that fit:
- STAIN (uses A, I, S in new spots)
- SAINT
- PASTI
- GAINS

I’ll pick STAIN because it moves A to position 3, I to position 4, and S to position 1, while adding T and N—two very common consonants.
