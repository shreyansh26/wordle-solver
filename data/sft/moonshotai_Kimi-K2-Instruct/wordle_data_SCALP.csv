For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some common choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers several common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should give us useful feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is correct and in position 3.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Letters we know:
- Pos 3 = A
- Letters NOT in the secret word: R, N, E
- Letters in the word but need to locate: C (but not in pos 1)

Plan for next guess:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Avoid R, N, E.
- Try to place C in another position (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Include new high-frequency consonants like S, T, L, D, or M, and a vowel like O, I, U, since we've only used A so far.

A reasonable candidate is ""SLOAT"":
- S (new letter) in pos 1
- L (new letter) in pos 2
- O (new vowel) in pos 3 – wait, A is fixed in pos 3. So we must keep A in pos 3.
Let’s build around A in pos 3:
- Pos 1: S
- Pos 2: O
- Pos 3: A (fixed)
- Pos 4: T
- Pos 5: C (to test if C is in pos 5)

Word: SOATC – but that’s not a valid English word.
Alternative: MOATS – A is in pos 3, but M and O are new. Check positions:
M O A T S – valid word, includes M, O, T, S, and C is not used yet (we need to place C somewhere). Let’s re-evaluate.

Better: COAST – positions:
C O A S T – A is in pos 3. C is in pos 1 again, but feedback says C is not in pos 1. So COAST is invalid.

Next try: ""LOACH""
- L, O, C, H around A in pos 3:
L O A C H – valid word, C in pos 4 (new), A in pos 3, avoids R, N, E.

But let’s go simpler: ""SLACK"" – but N is forbidden, not here; C in pos 4 (not pos 1), A in pos 3, S, L new letters. Valid word.

But ""SLACK"" uses C in pos 4 (allowed), A in pos 3, S, L new. Seems good.

Wait, let’s pick a simpler high-frequency word: ""PLANT"" – but N is forbidden. Replace N: ""PLASH"" – but H is less common.

Another: ""CLASH"" – C is in pos 1 again (invalid per feedback).

""SCAMP"" – C in pos 2 (allowed), A in pos 3, S, M, P new.

""SPANK"" – N forbidden.

""CHALK"" – C in pos 1 (invalid).

Pick P: SCALP – valid word. Check constraints:
  - L is now in pos 4 (allowed, not in pos 2).
  - C is now in pos 2 (allowed, not in pos 1 or 4).
  - No forbidden letters.

Option 2:
- pos 2 = O (new letter)
- pos 4 = L
- pos 5 = C
Word: S O A L C – but this is not a standard word.

Option 3:
- pos 2 = L – but L cannot be in pos 2 (L(-) in Guess 2). So invalid.

Option 4:

- pos 5 = C
- pos 4 = L
