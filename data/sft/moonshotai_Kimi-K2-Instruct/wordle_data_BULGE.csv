1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. The word should contain vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these. Some popular choices among Wordle players are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""STARE"", etc.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 unique letters that appear frequently in English words.

Only one letter (E) is in the hidden word, and it is in the correct position (the last letter).  
None of A, R, O, S appear anywhere.  
So the word ends in E and its first four letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet:

Goal: pick a word that gives maximal new information—ideally using common consonants and maybe the vowels I and U to test their presence.

From the two previous guesses we now know the following constraints:
- The word ends in E (position 5 is E).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, H, I, N.
- Therefore, every other letter in the alphabet is still possible except those eight plus E (since E is already placed at the end).

We need five-letter words ending in E whose first four letters are drawn from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus possibly the vowels U and Y.

Common English words ending in E that avoid the ruled-out letters are fairly sparse, but a good choice is to try letters that are still frequent and that can help narrow the pool quickly.

Possible choices: CHUTE, GLUME, CLAVE, FLUME, BLUME, etc.  
However, C and L are quite common, and “CHUTE” uses C, H, U, T, E.  
But H and T are already ruled out.  
Next try: GLUME (G, L, U, M, E).  
None of G, L, U, M have been ruled out. It seems valid.

Another quick check: “FLUME” would also fit (F, L, U, M, E). Both are valid words.

- Allowed letters still include: B, C, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus L and U).

Trying combinations:

Good candidate: ""BUGLE"" - but G is untested, and U would be position 2 (allowed), L position 4 (allowed). B is untested. This seems valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. The word should contain vowels and common consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these. Some popular choices among Wordle players are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""STARE"", etc.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), covering 5 unique letters that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Only one letter (E) is in the hidden word, and it is in the correct position (the last letter).  
None of A, R, O, S appear anywhere.  
So the word ends in E and its first four letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet:

Allowed 1st–4th letters: B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z  
Goal: pick a word that gives maximal new information—ideally using common consonants and maybe the vowels I and U to test their presence.

Candidates with high-information letters:  
- LINED, TINED, WINED, MINED, CINED, HINGE, …  
- Or ones with other common consonants: THINE, WHINE, CHIME, BLITE, …  

After checking validity, “THINE” looks good:  
T, H, I, N, E are all legal, common letters not yet ruled out, and the word is valid English.  
It tests T, H, I, N and keeps the known ✓ E in place.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know the following constraints:
- The word ends in E (position 5 is E).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, H, I, N.
- Therefore, every other letter in the alphabet is still possible except those eight plus E (since E is already placed at the end).

We need five-letter words ending in E whose first four letters are drawn from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus possibly the vowels U and Y.

Common English words ending in E that avoid the ruled-out letters are fairly sparse, but a good choice is to try letters that are still frequent and that can help narrow the pool quickly.

Possible choices: CHUTE, GLUME, CLAVE, FLUME, BLUME, etc.  
However, C and L are quite common, and “CHUTE” uses C, H, U, T, E.  
But H and T are already ruled out.  
Next try: GLUME (G, L, U, M, E).  
None of G, L, U, M have been ruled out. It seems valid.

Another quick check: “FLUME” would also fit (F, L, U, M, E). Both are valid words.  
Let’s go with “FLUME” as F and L are high-frequency consonants still untested.

From all feedback so far:
- Word ends in E (✓) → _ _ _ _ E
- Letters in correct positions: B at 1, U at 2, E at 5  
  So the skeleton is B U _ _ E
- Letters still in the word but misplaced: G and L  
  (G was at 3, L at 4; they must move)
- Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, O, S, T, H, I, N, F, M

So the third and fourth letters must be chosen from the still-allowed pool {C, D, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, G, L}, and they must be G and L in some order (since those two letters must be used exactly once each).

Possible permutations:
- G at 3, L at 4 → B U G L E
- L at 3, G at 4 → B U L G E

Both arrangements are valid English words (bugle is already known; bulge is also valid).  
From the feedback, G was marked “-” last time (present but wrong position) when it was at position 3. Moving it to position 4 satisfies “wrong position” for G. Likewise for L.  
Therefore “BULGE” is consistent with every clue.
