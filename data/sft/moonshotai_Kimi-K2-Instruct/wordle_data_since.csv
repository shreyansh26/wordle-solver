For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and vowels, without repeating any letters. This allows me to test multiple common letters at once.

Looking at common English letters, vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are very frequent. Some good starting words include:
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ARISE because it covers several vowels (A, I, E) and high-frequency consonants (R, S), giving me maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- A – not in the word (x)
- R – not in the word (x)
- I – in the word but wrong position (-)
- S – in the word but wrong position (-)
- E – in the correct position (✓, last letter)

So we know:
- Word ends with E
- Contains I and S, but neither is in the 3rd or 4th position respectively
- Does NOT contain A or R
- Letters tested so far: A, R, I, S, E

I need a new word that:
- Ends in E
- Uses the letters I and S (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- Avoids A and R

Let me think of possibilities:
- S cannot be in position 4, so maybe S is in 1st or 2nd position
- I cannot be in position 3, so maybe I is in 2nd or 4th position (but 4th is E, so 2nd)

Good candidates:
- SPIKE (S P I K E) – S in 1st, I in 3rd (invalid, I can't be in 3rd)
- SLICE (S L I C E) – I in 3rd (invalid)
- SWINE (S W I N E) – I in 3rd (invalid)
- SHINE (S H I N E) – I in 3rd (invalid)
- SNIPE (S N I P E) – I in 3rd (invalid)
- SIEGE (S I E G E) – I in 2nd, S in 1st, ends in E, no A/R – looks good!
- SITED (but must end in E, not D)
- SIDEW (invalid length)

Actually, SIEGE has E repeated, which might be okay since E could appear twice, but it's less informative.

Another approach: try a word with S in 2nd position and I in 1st or 4th (but 4th is E), so I in 1st:
- ISLET (I S L E T) – ends in T, not E
- INSET (I N S E T) – ends in T
- IVIES (but ends in S, not E)

Better to keep S in 1st and I in 2nd:
- S I _ _ E

Possible: S I L E N (SILEN – not a word), S I T E M (invalid)

Instead, let's have S in 1st and I in 4th (but 4th must be E), so no.

Alternative: S in 2nd, I in 1st:
- I S _ _ E

But then last letter is E. Words: ISSEE (invalid), ISLET (invalid ending), ISPLE (invalid)

Let me reconsider positions:
- S cannot be 4th (from ARISE)
- I cannot be 3rd (from ARISE)
- E is 5th

Possible placement:
S in 1st, I in 2nd: S I _ _ E
Words: S I _ _ E: ""S I N C E"" (SINCE) – S (1st), I (2nd), N, C, E (5th) – looks valid

Check:
- SINCE: S I N C E
  - Ends with E (matches)
  - Contains I and S (matches)
  - I is not in 3rd position (it's 2nd – ok)
  - S is not in 4th position (it's 1st – ok)
  - No A or R (ok)

This seems like a good second guess.
