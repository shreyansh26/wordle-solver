Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are likely to appear in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters

This gives good coverage of common letters while being a valid English word.

1. AROSE  
   A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

2. STEIN  
   S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S, E, T  
(The feedback shows S, T, E as “–”, i.e., present but not in those positions.)

Positions ruled out for each confirmed letter:

- S: not positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN)
- E: not positions 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN)
- T: not position 2 (from STEIN)

So S, E, T must occupy the remaining available positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but respecting each exclusion.

We also know the other two letters in the word must be from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
- keep S, E, T inside
- try plausible unused letters
- place S, E, T in allowed positions

Let’s try:

- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- T in position 5 (allowed)

This leaves positions 1 and 3 for two new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: L, U, D, M, H.

A common pattern is consonant-vowel-consonant, so let’s pick:

Position 1: L  
Position 3: U  

That forms the word “LUSTE”? Not valid. Swap E and T? No, E must be 4, T must be 5. Try another combination:

Let’s try “TESLA” – but A is ruled out. “BESTY”? – Y is possible. “MESTO”? – O is ruled out. “PESTY”? “WESTS”? (invalid). “HESTE”? – H, E, S, T, E (double E ok).

But we need 5 distinct letters if possible, so double letters only if necessary.

“PESTO” – O ruled out. “CENTS” – N ruled out. “TEMPS” – P, M, S, T, E. But we already have T, E, S inside and this would again place S in 5 (allowed), but T in 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed). So “TEMPS” uses only one new letter M, P – which are valid.

Let’s use “TEMPS”.

Check positions:

- T in 1 (allowed, not excluded)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- M (new)  
- P (new)  
- S in 5 (allowed, not excluded)  

This letter set is valid and gives new information about M and P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are likely to appear in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters

This gives good coverage of common letters while being a valid English word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on the first guess (AROSE):

- A and R are not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (originally at position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally at position 5)

So we know:
- The word has S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- The word does not contain A, R, or O

Since E and S are both in the word, but we don't know their correct positions yet, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains both E and S
2. Places them in different positions from the original guess
3. Uses new letters (not A, R, or O)
4. Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Good candidate letters to try next would be common consonants like T, L, N, D, and vowels like I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A good choice is ""STEIN"":
- Contains both S and E
- S is now in position 1 (different from original position 4)
- E is now in position 2 (different from original position 5)
- Uses new letters T, I, N
- Is a valid English word

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S, E, T  
(The feedback shows S, T, E as “–”, i.e., present but not in those positions.)

Positions ruled out for each confirmed letter:

- S: not positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN)
- E: not positions 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN)
- T: not position 2 (from STEIN)

So S, E, T must occupy the remaining available positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but respecting each exclusion.

We also know the other two letters in the word must be from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
- keep S, E, T inside
- try plausible unused letters
- place S, E, T in allowed positions

Let’s try:

- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- T in position 5 (allowed)

This leaves positions 1 and 3 for two new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: L, U, D, M, H.

A common pattern is consonant-vowel-consonant, so let’s pick:

Position 1: L  
Position 3: U  

That forms the word “LUSTE”? Not valid. Swap E and T? No, E must be 4, T must be 5. Try another combination:

Let’s try “TESLA” – but A is ruled out. “BESTY”? – Y is possible. “MESTO”? – O is ruled out. “PESTY”? “WESTS”? (invalid). “HESTE”? – H, E, S, T, E (double E ok).

But we need 5 distinct letters if possible, so double letters only if necessary.

“PESTO” – O ruled out. “CENTS” – N ruled out. “TEMPS” – P, M, S, T, E. But we already have T, E, S inside and this would again place S in 5 (allowed), but T in 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed). So “TEMPS” uses only one new letter M, P – which are valid.

Let’s use “TEMPS”.

Check positions:

- T in 1 (allowed, not excluded)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- M (new)  
- P (new)  
- S in 5 (allowed, not excluded)  

This letter set is valid and gives new information about M and P.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BESET,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are likely to appear in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters

This gives good coverage of common letters while being a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on the first guess (AROSE):

- A and R are not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (originally at position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (originally at position 5)

So we know:
- The word has S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- The word does not contain A, R, or O

Since E and S are both in the word, but we don't know their correct positions yet, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains both E and S
2. Places them in different positions from the original guess
3. Uses new letters (not A, R, or O)
4. Uses common letters to maximize information gain

Good candidate letters to try next would be common consonants like T, L, N, D, and vowels like I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A good choice is ""STEIN"":
- Contains both S and E
- S is now in position 1 (different from original position 4)
- E is now in position 2 (different from original position 5)
- Uses new letters T, I, N
- Is a valid English word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's merge the two rounds of feedback.

1. AROSE  
   A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

2. STEIN  
   S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S, E, T  
(The feedback shows S, T, E as “–”, i.e., present but not in those positions.)

Positions ruled out for each confirmed letter:

- S: not positions 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN)
- E: not positions 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN)
- T: not position 2 (from STEIN)

So S, E, T must occupy the remaining available positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but respecting each exclusion.

We also know the other two letters in the word must be from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
- keep S, E, T inside
- try plausible unused letters
- place S, E, T in allowed positions

Let’s try:

- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- T in position 5 (allowed)

This leaves positions 1 and 3 for two new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: L, U, D, M, H.

A common pattern is consonant-vowel-consonant, so let’s pick:

Position 1: L  
Position 3: U  

That forms the word “LUSTE”? Not valid. Swap E and T? No, E must be 4, T must be 5. Try another combination:

Let’s try “TESLA” – but A is ruled out. “BESTY”? – Y is possible. “MESTO”? – O is ruled out. “PESTY”? “WESTS”? (invalid). “HESTE”? – H, E, S, T, E (double E ok).

But we need 5 distinct letters if possible, so double letters only if necessary.

“PESTO” – O ruled out. “CENTS” – N ruled out. “TEMPS” – P, M, S, T, E. But we already have T, E, S inside and this would again place S in 5 (allowed), but T in 1 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed). So “TEMPS” uses only one new letter M, P – which are valid.

Let’s use “TEMPS”.

Check positions:

- T in 1 (allowed, not excluded)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- M (new)  
- P (new)  
- S in 5 (allowed, not excluded)  

This letter set is valid and gives new information about M and P.

Position facts deduced so far:

E is now **locked in position 2** (✓ at position 2 in TEMPS).

Remaining exclusions from the “–” feedback:

- S: cannot be positions 1, 4, 5 (from STEIN, AROSE, TEMPS)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 3.

- T: cannot be positions 1, 2, 5 (from STEIN, TEMPS)  
  ⇒ T must be in position 4.

So far we have:
1 _  
2 E  
3 S  
4 T  
5 _

That leaves position 1 and 5 to fill with letters **not yet ruled out**.

Available letters (unused & not excluded):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The word has to be valid English.  
A common pattern with “E S T” in the middle is “B E S T _” or “_ E S T Y”.

- BESTY – Y is allowed.  
- HESTY – H, Y allowed.  
- WREST – but R is excluded.  
- VESTA – A excluded.  
- GESTS – double S, possible but S already fixed once.  
- TESTY – T already fixed in 4.  

The simplest valid choice that keeps all constraints is **BESTY**.

From the feedback on BESTS we now know:

- B is locked at position 1 (✓)  
- E is locked at position 2 (✓)  
- S is locked at position 3 (✓)  

- The second S we just placed at position 5 got the feedback “–”, i.e. S is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
  Since S is already at position 3, this means the word contains exactly a single S (in position 3).  
  Therefore the 5-letter word ends with S at position 3 and has no additional S.

- T is still in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 (from all feedback), so T must be in position 4.

Hence we already have:

1 B  
2 E  
3 S  
4 T  
5 ?

The only remaining letter to choose is whatever goes in position 5.  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, I, N, M, P, Y, plus S and T are already placed, so cannot appear again in position 5.  
Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common English 5-letter words fitting B E S T _:

- BESTS – ruled out (already tried, duplicate S)  
- BESOT – O is ruled out  
- No other common word with B-E-S-T-? except BESTS.

Therefore the only possibility left is that the final letter must be one of the remaining letters and still form a valid word.  
Looking at the pattern, the actual word must be ""BEST*"" where * is a letter from the allowed list.

Among the possible letters, the most common final letter after ""BEST"" in English is ""L"" (BESTL not valid) or ""H"" (BESTH not valid), etc.  
The only actual dictionary word fitting B-E-S-T-* with these constraints is:

BESTO – but O is ruled out.  
BESTY – Y is ruled out.  
BESTK – not a word.  
BESTG – not a word.  

Realizing this, we must have missed earlier constraints. Rechecking:

- Position 5 must be a single, unused letter that forms a valid word.  
Given all previous constraints, the only valid English word left is **BESTK**? No. **BESTH**? No. **BESTL**? No.

Wait, let's list all 5-letter words starting B-E-S-T. Only BESTS and BESOT exist, both ruled out. This suggests an earlier mis-step.

Ah! Here's the realization: T cannot be in position 5, but there's no constraint preventing T from being in position 4, which we have locked, and we need a valid word.

But the only valid word left under all constraints is BESTS, which we've just tried. 

Upon reflection, we must have an error in earlier steps. Re-examining: ""BESTY"" feedback had T as ""–"" (present but wrong position). In BESTY, T was in position 4, so T cannot be 4. Therefore T must be 1,2,3, or 5. But 1=B, 2=E, 3=S are fixed, so T must be 5.

But in BESTS, T was position 4 and got ""–"", confirming T can't be 4. Thus T must be 5.

Hence the word must be B-E-S-T at 1-2-3-5, and position 4 must be a letter. This forms B-E-S-*-T. The only common word fitting is BES**T** with 4th letter.

Looking again: we've used S, E, T, B; excluded A,R,O,I,N,M,P,Y. Remaining letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common word: BES**ET** – but E already used twice? No, we have E at 2.  
B-E-S-E-T would duplicate E, which is possible in Wordle. Check if B-E-S-E-T is valid.  

Yes, BESET is a valid English word meaning to harass or trouble.

Checking constraints:
- B ✓1  
- E ✓2  
- S must be 3 (from earlier lock)  
- E again at 4 is allowed (letters can repeat)  
- T at 5 is allowed (since T must be at 5 now)  

Also, all new letters used (second E and T at 5) are allowed by exclusion.

Therefore the only remaining logical word is **BESET**.

- BESTS – ruled out (already tried, duplicate S)  
- BESOT – O is ruled out  
- No other common word with B-E-S-T-? except BESTS.

Therefore the only possibility left is that the final letter must be one of the remaining letters and still form a valid word.  
Looking at the pattern, the actual word must be ""BEST*"" where * is a letter from the allowed list.

Among the possible letters, the most common final letter after ""BEST"" in English is ""L"" (BESTL not valid) or ""H"" (BESTH not valid), etc.  
The only actual dictionary word fitting B-E-S-T-* with these constraints is:

BESTO – but O is ruled out.  
BESTY – Y is ruled out.  
BESTK – not a word.  
BESTG – not a word.  

Realizing this, we must have missed earlier constraints. Rechecking:

- Position 5 must be a single, unused letter that forms a valid word.  
Given all previous constraints, the only valid English word left is **BESTK**? No. **BESTH**? No. **BESTL**? No.

Wait, let's list all 5-letter words starting B-E-S-T. Only BESTS and BESOT exist, both ruled out. This suggests an earlier mis-step.

Ah! Here's the realization: T cannot be in position 5, but there's no constraint preventing T from being in position 4, which we have locked, and we need a valid word.

But the only valid word left under all constraints is BESTS, which we've just tried. 

Upon reflection, we must have an error in earlier steps. Re-examining: ""BESTY"" feedback had T as ""–"" (present but wrong position). In BESTY, T was in position 4, so T cannot be 4. Therefore T must be 1,2,3, or 5. But 1=B, 2=E, 3=S are fixed, so T must be 5.

But in BESTS, T was position 4 and got ""–"", confirming T can't be 4. Thus T must be 5.

Hence the word must be B-E-S-T at 1-2-3-5, and position 4 must be a letter. This forms B-E-S-*-T. The only common word fitting is BES**T** with 4th letter.

Looking again: we've used S, E, T, B; excluded A,R,O,I,N,M,P,Y. Remaining letters: C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Common word: BES**ET** – but E already used twice? No, we have E at 2.  
B-E-S-E-T would duplicate E, which is possible in Wordle. Check if B-E-S-E-T is valid.  

Yes, BESET is a valid English word meaning to harass or trouble.

Checking constraints:
- B ✓1  
- E ✓2  
- S must be 3 (from earlier lock)  
- E again at 4 is allowed (letters can repeat)  
- T at 5 is allowed (since T must be at 5 now)  

Also, all new letters used (second E and T at 5) are allowed by exclusion.

Therefore the only remaining logical word is **BESET**.",Guess 6: BESET -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) S(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
