Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters frequently found in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and statistically strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

So far we know:
- T is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are **not** in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ T _

We still need to test vowels (since A and E are out, try I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (like N, R, C, H, D, etc.).  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Introduce new common letters while avoiding S, L, A, E.
3. Not repeat letters already known to be absent.

Possible candidates: CHANT, FRUIT, NIGHT, POINT, etc.

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)

So the secret word:
- has T in position 4.
- contains I somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- does NOT contain S, L, A, E, P, O, N.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, R, D, H, M, K, B, G, F, W, Y.  
Remaining vowels: I (already known), U.

We must use I in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
Good candidate pattern: try I in position 1 (IC_T_ or IR_T_ etc.).

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters:  
- I in position 1  
- R and C are common and untested  
- U is still a possible vowel  

“ICURT” is invalid (not a word).  
“CIR” words: “CIR” + “T” → need one more letter.  
“DIRT” is 4 letters.

Updated constraints:

- Pattern: _ _ _ T _  (T is fixed in position 4)

- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, G, H, R
- Remaining common letters to test: C, D, M, U, Y, K, B, F, W, etc.

Therefore the word must look like:
_ I _ T _

We still need three distinct letters from the allowed set, none of which have been ruled out, and none repeating.

Candidate possibilities:
- DITTY – uses T twice, but T is already confirmed, and double letters are allowed; however Y is untested and two Ts are fine.
- VITAM – not valid (M is allowed, but V and M haven’t been tested yet, but “VITAM” isn’t a recognized 5-letter word).
- CIVET – C, V, E are out (E already excluded).
- WITCH – W is untested, C is untested, H already ruled out.
- LIMIT – M is allowed, but L is out.
- DICOT – D, C, O are out (O already excluded).

A valid word that fits the pattern and only uses allowed new letters:
D I C T _ — but we need a final letter. The only unused common letter left is Y (since we have already excluded so many).

Thus the word is D I C T Y → DICTY is not a valid word.

Next option: M I C T _ — M, I, C, T plus a fifth letter. The only possible letter left that is common and not ruled out is Y → M I C T Y = “M ICTY” not valid.

Another choice: F I V E T — too many invalid letters.

Wait, we need a real word. Let’s list valid _ I _ T _ words with allowed letters:

- DITTY  (D, I, T, T, Y) — uses T twice, but T is confirmed and Y is new, and all letters not yet ruled out. Valid word.
- CIVET — C, I, V, E, T — E is out.
- DIGHT — H out.
- FILTH — H out, L out.
- KILTY — K, I, L, T, Y — L out.
- WITTY — W, I, T, T, Y — W and Y are new; W is allowed. Valid word.

Both “DITTY” and “WITTY” are valid 5-letter words, but “WITTY” introduces W, I, T, T, Y — W and Y are new. However, Y hasn’t been tested yet, and W is also new.

But T is already confirmed, and we can’t get new info from it. We need to test new consonants.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,dirty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters frequently found in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and statistically strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- T is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are **not** in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ T _

We still need to test vowels (since A and E are out, try I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (like N, R, C, H, D, etc.).  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Introduce new common letters while avoiding S, L, A, E.
3. Not repeat letters already known to be absent.

Possible candidates: CHANT, FRUIT, NIGHT, POINT, etc.  
""POINT"" looks promising:
- P, O, I, N are all new letters.
- T is kept in position 4.
- Uses common letters (O, I, N).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   → T is fixed in position 4 (word pattern: _ _ _ T _).

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   → I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   → O, P, N are out.  
   → T re-confirmed in position 4 (but the dash here is redundant since we already had ✓).

So the secret word:
- has T in position 4.
- contains I somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- does NOT contain S, L, A, E, P, O, N.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, R, D, H, M, K, B, G, F, W, Y.  
Remaining vowels: I (already known), U.

We must use I in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
Good candidate pattern: try I in position 1 (IC_T_ or IR_T_ etc.).

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters:  
- I in position 1  
- R and C are common and untested  
- U is still a possible vowel  

“ICURT” is invalid (not a word).  
“CIR” words: “CIR” + “T” → need one more letter.  
“DIRT” is 4 letters.  
A real word: “DIRTY” has Y, which is possible.

Another possibility: “RIGHT” (only uses letters not yet ruled out: R, I, G, H, T).  
- T already fixed in position 4.  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).  

“RIGHT” is a valid 5-letter word and tests R, I, G, H with T fixed.

Let's parse the latest feedback carefully.

Guess 4: DITTY → FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓)

Breaking this down:
- D in position 1 is ✓ (correct position)
- I in position 2 is ✓ (correct position)
- T in position 3 is - (wrong position) - but we already know T is in position 4, so this is expected
- T in position 4 is ✓ (correct position)
- Y in position 5 is ✓ (correct position)

From this, we can conclude that positions 1-5 are:
D I _ T Y

We already have:
- Position 1: D ✓
- Position 2: I ✓
- Position 4: T ✓
- Position 5: Y ✓

We only need to determine the letter in position 3. Looking back at all the letters we've ruled out:
Definitely NOT in word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, G, H, R

Letters we've tested that are still possible: C, M, U, K, B, F, W, V, etc.

The word is DI_TY. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit this pattern:
- DIC TY → DICTY (invalid)
- DIM TY → DIMTY (invalid)
- DIB TY → DIB TY (invalid)
- DIV TY → DIV TY (invalid)
- DIS TY → DISTY (invalid)
- DICOT → O is out
- DIETY → E is out
- DINTY → N is out
- DIRTY → R is out
- DITTY → already tried

Looking at valid English words:
- DITTY was our last guess (but position 3 T was -, which is expected since T is in position 4)
- DIGIT → G is out
- DISHY → H and S are out

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be DI_TY where _ is a single letter we haven't tried yet.

Possible valid words:
- DICTY (invalid)
- DIMLY (but we need DI_TY)
- DITTY is the only real word of this form, but we already used it

But DITTY gave us:
D(1) ✓, I(2) ✓, T(3) -, T(4) ✓, Y(5) ✓

This suggests the word is exactly DITTY, because:
- Position 3's T being - is just telling us T isn't in position 3 (which we know, it's in 4)
- All other letters match perfectly

Therefore the word must be DITTY.

All feedback confirms the word structure is D-I-T-T-Y. Every letter is in its correct position.

<guess>DITTY</guess>",DITTY,"Let's parse the latest feedback carefully.

Guess 4: DITTY → FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓)

Breaking this down:
- D in position 1 is ✓ (correct position)
- I in position 2 is ✓ (correct position)
- T in position 3 is - (wrong position) - but we already know T is in position 4, so this is expected
- T in position 4 is ✓ (correct position)
- Y in position 5 is ✓ (correct position)

From this, we can conclude that positions 1-5 are:
D I _ T Y

We already have:
- Position 1: D ✓
- Position 2: I ✓
- Position 4: T ✓
- Position 5: Y ✓

We only need to determine the letter in position 3. Looking back at all the letters we've ruled out:
Definitely NOT in word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, G, H, R

Letters we've tested that are still possible: C, M, U, K, B, F, W, V, etc.

The word is DI_TY. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit this pattern:
- DIC TY → DICTY (invalid)
- DIM TY → DIMTY (invalid)
- DIB TY → DIB TY (invalid)
- DIV TY → DIV TY (invalid)
- DIS TY → DISTY (invalid)
- DICOT → O is out
- DIETY → E is out
- DINTY → N is out
- DIRTY → R is out
- DITTY → already tried

Looking at valid English words:
- DITTY was our last guess (but position 3 T was -, which is expected since T is in position 4)
- DIGIT → G is out
- DISHY → H and S are out

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be DI_TY where _ is a single letter we haven't tried yet.

Possible valid words:
- DICTY (invalid)
- DIMLY (but we need DI_TY)
- DITTY is the only real word of this form, but we already used it

But DITTY gave us:
D(1) ✓, I(2) ✓, T(3) -, T(4) ✓, Y(5) ✓

This suggests the word is exactly DITTY, because:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,dirty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters frequently found in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Include vowels and common consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and statistically strong first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- T is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are **not** in the word at all.

Therefore the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ T _

We still need to test vowels (since A and E are out, try I, O, U) and common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (like N, R, C, H, D, etc.).  

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Introduce new common letters while avoiding S, L, A, E.
3. Not repeat letters already known to be absent.

Possible candidates: CHANT, FRUIT, NIGHT, POINT, etc.  
""POINT"" looks promising:
- P, O, I, N are all new letters.
- T is kept in position 4.
- Uses common letters (O, I, N).

<guess>POINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   → T is fixed in position 4 (word pattern: _ _ _ T _).

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   → I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   → O, P, N are out.  
   → T re-confirmed in position 4 (but the dash here is redundant since we already had ✓).

So the secret word:
- has T in position 4.
- contains I somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- does NOT contain S, L, A, E, P, O, N.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, R, D, H, M, K, B, G, F, W, Y.  
Remaining vowels: I (already known), U.

We must use I in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
Good candidate pattern: try I in position 1 (IC_T_ or IR_T_ etc.).

A word that fits these constraints and tests new letters:  
- I in position 1  
- R and C are common and untested  
- U is still a possible vowel  

“ICURT” is invalid (not a word).  
“CIR” words: “CIR” + “T” → need one more letter.  
“DIRT” is 4 letters.  
A real word: “DIRTY” has Y, which is possible.

Another possibility: “RIGHT” (only uses letters not yet ruled out: R, I, G, H, T).  
- T already fixed in position 4.  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).  

“RIGHT” is a valid 5-letter word and tests R, I, G, H with T fixed.

Let’s go with RIGHT.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: RIGHT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated constraints:

- Pattern: _ _ _ T _  (T is fixed in position 4)
- Letters known to be in the word: I (exact position 2), T (position 4)
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, G, H, R
- Remaining common letters to test: C, D, M, U, Y, K, B, F, W, etc.

Therefore the word must look like:
_ I _ T _

We still need three distinct letters from the allowed set, none of which have been ruled out, and none repeating.

Candidate possibilities:
- DITTY – uses T twice, but T is already confirmed, and double letters are allowed; however Y is untested and two Ts are fine.
- VITAM – not valid (M is allowed, but V and M haven’t been tested yet, but “VITAM” isn’t a recognized 5-letter word).
- CIVET – C, V, E are out (E already excluded).
- WITCH – W is untested, C is untested, H already ruled out.
- LIMIT – M is allowed, but L is out.
- DICOT – D, C, O are out (O already excluded).

A valid word that fits the pattern and only uses allowed new letters:
D I C T _ — but we need a final letter. The only unused common letter left is Y (since we have already excluded so many).

Thus the word is D I C T Y → DICTY is not a valid word.

Next option: M I C T _ — M, I, C, T plus a fifth letter. The only possible letter left that is common and not ruled out is Y → M I C T Y = “M ICTY” not valid.

Another choice: F I V E T — too many invalid letters.

Wait, we need a real word. Let’s list valid _ I _ T _ words with allowed letters:

- DITTY  (D, I, T, T, Y) — uses T twice, but T is confirmed and Y is new, and all letters not yet ruled out. Valid word.
- CIVET — C, I, V, E, T — E is out.
- DIGHT — H out.
- FILTH — H out, L out.
- KILTY — K, I, L, T, Y — L out.
- WITTY — W, I, T, T, Y — W and Y are new; W is allowed. Valid word.

Both “DITTY” and “WITTY” are valid 5-letter words, but “WITTY” introduces W, I, T, T, Y — W and Y are new. However, Y hasn’t been tested yet, and W is also new.

But T is already confirmed, and we can’t get new info from it. We need to test new consonants.

Between DITTY and WITTY, both are ok, but DITTY tests D, Y and keeps I and T.

Let’s pick DITTY.
