For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common consonants like R, S, T, N, L and vowels like E, A, O, I, U are good choices. A balanced word with a mix of these letters is ideal.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common as a starting or ending letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This word gives a good spread of frequently used letters, which helps narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- T: in the word, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain S or E.
2. Contains L, A, T somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

We need a new guess that:
- Avoids S and E.
- Uses L, A, T in different positions.
- Adds new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- P: new letter, frequent
- L: moves to position 2 (previously was in 2, now 2 again—allowed because we only know it’s “not in 2” from previous feedback; we’re testing if it can be elsewhere)
- A: moves to position 3 (previously in 3, same reasoning)
- N: new letter, very common
- T: moves to position 5 (previously in 4, now testing 5)

However, we know T cannot be in position 4, but position 5 is untested. Also, we know L cannot be in position 2, so we should move L elsewhere. Let’s adjust.

Better word: “TRIAL”
- T: moves to position 1 (ok, since T cannot be in 4; new position)
- R: new letter

- A: moves to position 4 (was in 3, now 4)

This tests T in 1, A in 4, L in 5, and adds R, I. Nice spread.

Letters confirmed outside: S, E, R

Remaining consonants to test: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, etc.

Remaining vowels to test: O, U (since A, I are already in word)

T _ _ A L

Let’s find a word that fits this pattern and includes or excludes the remaining possibilities. For speed, let’s try:

“TONAL” is a valid English word:
- T (pos 1) ✓
- O (pos 2) – new vowel
- N (pos 3) – new consonant
- A (pos 4) ✓
- L (pos 5) ✓

This respects all constraints:
- Includes I (from TRIAL feedback) — wait, no: “TONAL” does NOT include I. That’s okay because the feedback was “I is in the word but not in position 3”; we don’t need to test it immediately, but we do need to keep it in mind.

But actually, since I is in the word (from TRIAL), we need a word with I in it. So “TONAL” would be wrong because it doesn’t have I.

Let’s find a word that has:
- T _ _ A L
- includes I (but not in pos 3)

Possible options:
- TIBAL – not a word
- TICAL – valid (means “a medicine tablet”)

   - Letters to exclude: S, E
   - Letters in word but wrong place: L (not pos 2), A (not pos 3), T (not pos 4)

2. TRIAL → T(✓) R(x) I(-) A(✓) L(✓)
   - T is correct in position 1.
   - R is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is correct in position 4.
   - L is correct in position 5.

So far we know the word looks like:
T _ _ A L

Letters confirmed inside: T (pos 1), A (pos 4), L (pos 5)

Letters confirmed outside: S, E, R

Letters still in word but positions unknown: I (not 3)

Remaining consonants to test: N, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, etc.

Remaining vowels to test: O, U (since A, I are already in word)

We need a 5-letter word with pattern:
T _ _ A L

Let’s find a word that fits this pattern and includes or excludes the remaining possibilities. For speed, let’s try:
- TUBAL (has U and B)
- TONAL (has O and N)

“TONAL” is a valid English word:
- T (pos 1) ✓
- O (pos 2) – new vowel
- N (pos 3) – new consonant
- A (pos 4) ✓
- L (pos 5) ✓

This respects all constraints:
- Includes I (from TRIAL feedback) — wait, no: “TONAL” does NOT include I. That’s okay because the feedback was “I is in the word but not in position 3”; we don’t need to test it immediately, but we do need to keep it in mind.

But actually, since I is in the word (from TRIAL), we need a word with I in it. So “TONAL” would be wrong because it doesn’t have I.

Let’s find a word that has:
- T _ _ A L
- includes I (but not in pos 3)

Possible options:
- TIBAL – not a word
- TICAL – valid (means “a medicine tablet”)
- TILAK – valid (religious mark on forehead)

“TILAK” is valid, but has K which is uncommon.

“TICAL” is more common.

Let’s go with TICAL.

From the feedback we now know:

- Letters 1,2,3,4,5: T I _ A L
- No C anywhere (from TICAL).

We need only the third letter.  
The word must be “TI?AL” where the missing letter is a consonant and hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Valid English words of the form TI?AL:
- TIBAL – not a real word  
- TIGAL – not a real word  
- TINAL – not a real word  
- TIPAL – not a real word  
- TITAL – not a real word  
- TIMAL – not a real word  
- TIHAL – not a real word  

The only valid dictionary word that fits “T I _ A L” is “TIHAL,” but that’s obscure.  
However, there is another genuine word: “TIDAL” – the tides.

D is still allowed.  
Therefore the correct missing letter is D.
