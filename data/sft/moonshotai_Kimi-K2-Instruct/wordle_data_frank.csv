Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback, I should choose a word that can help eliminate many possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Most common vowels: E, A, O, I, U
- Most common consonants: T, N, S, R, L

A strong first guess would contain:
- Multiple common vowels
- Common consonants
- No repeating letters to maximize information

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters with no repeats.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct second position: _R _ _ _
- A is in the word but in the wrong position
- O, S, E are not in the word at all

So we now know:
1. The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
2. A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1
3. O, S, E are eliminated
4. Letters that haven’t been used yet are still candidates

We should pick a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Uses A in positions 3, 4, or 5
- Avoids O, S, E
- Uses new consonants that are common

Possible letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, T, U, Y

Let’s try to form a valid English word that fits these constraints. Some candidates:
- BRAIN (but we don’t know I or N yet)
- DRAIN (D, R, A, I, N) – uses A in position 3
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N) – uses A in position 3
- GRAIN (G, R, A, I, N) – same pattern
- TRAMP (but P is less common)

DRAIN seems good because:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- A is used in position 3 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback)
- Avoids all eliminated letters (O, S, E)
- Uses common new letters (D, I, N)

Summary of what we now know:

1. Position map so far: _ R A _ _
   – R is locked in position 2
   – A is locked in position 3
   – Therefore the word is of the form _ R A _ _

2. Letters ruled out entirely: O, S, E, D, I
   (from first guess: O, S, E are out; from second guess: D and I are out)

3. Letters that appear somewhere but whose positions are unknown:
   – A is already placed at position 3 (✓)
   – N is in the word but not at position 5 (from N(-) in DRAIN), so N must be in position 1 or 4
   – Also, we have not used B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z yet

4. Possible word patterns:
   Pattern 1: N R A _ _  (N in position 1)
   Pattern 2: _ R A N _  (N in position 4)

Let’s list candidate English words that fit these patterns and avoid the ruled-out letters.

Pattern 1 (N R A _ _):
   – NRACK, NRAFT, NRAPE … none of these are valid English words.

Pattern 2 (_ R A N _):
   – BRAND, CRANE, FRANK, GRANT, PRANC, TRANQ … the only valid common words are BRAND, CRANE, FRANK, GRANT.

Check each against our constraints:
   – CRANE: E is already ruled out, so eliminate.
   – FRANK: K hasn’t been ruled out, still possible.
   – GRANT: T isn’t ruled out, still possible.
   – BRAND: D is ruled out, so eliminate.

So the best remaining choices are FRANK and GRANT.
Between the two, FRANK uses F which we haven’t tested yet, and GRANT uses G and T which we also haven’t tested.  Both are equally informative, but FRANK gives us a new consonant F and hasn’t excluded any possibilities.  FRANK it is.
