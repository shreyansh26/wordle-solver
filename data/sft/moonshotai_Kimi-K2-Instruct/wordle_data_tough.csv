For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This should give me good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   – Tells us O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)  
   – Eliminates P, I, N  
   – Confirms O is in position 2 (because it changed from “-” to “✓”)  
   – Tells us T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- The pattern is _ O _ _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N  
- T is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4  
- We still need to test other common consonants (D, L, C, M, etc.) and the remaining vowels (U).

A good third guess should:
- Lock the O in position 2  
- Include T in a new position  
- Add fresh common letters

“MOTTO” is invalid (double T).  
“DOLLY” is invalid (double L).  
“COUTH” uses C, U, T, H – all new letters; places T in position 4.  
“COULD” uses C, U, L, D – all new; puts T elsewhere next time if needed.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – eliminates A, R, S, E

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)  
   – eliminates P, I, N  
   – fixes O in position 2  
   – T is in the word but not in position 5

3. COULD → C(x) O(✓) U(✓) L(x) D(x)  
   – eliminates C, L, D  
   – confirms U is in position 3

So the pattern is: _ O U _ _

Letters still available include: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
From earlier, T must appear somewhere (and cannot be position 5).  
Hence T must be in position 1 or 4.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching “_OU_ _” with T in 1 or 4:
- TOUGH (T is in position 1)  
- YOUTH (but Y and H are untested)  
- SOUGH (contains S, already eliminated)  
- DOU… words (D is eliminated)

“TOUGH” fits all constraints:
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- O, U in positions 2,3 (already confirmed)  
- G and H are fresh letters to test
