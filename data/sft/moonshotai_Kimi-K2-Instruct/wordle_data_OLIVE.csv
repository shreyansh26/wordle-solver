Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback yet, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that includes several of these high-frequency letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback:
- A(x) - A is not in the word
- R(x) - R is not in the word
- O(-) - O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd, so it's not in position 3)
- S(x) - S is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know:
1. The word ends with E
2. It contains O but not in position 3
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S

- E in position 5
- O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 - but 5 is already E, so 1, 2, or 4)

""CLOVE"" comes to mind but has V which is less common. 
""PHONE"" has P, H, N - all good letters, and O in position 2
""POLE"" is too short
""TONER"" has R which we know is wrong

2. The word must contain O exactly once, and O is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because Guess 2 had O in position 2 and got “-”, and Guess 1 had O in position 3 and got “-”).  
   Therefore O can only be in position 1 or 4.
3. Letters that have been ruled out so far:  
   A, R, S, P, H, N.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried:  
T, L, C, D, M, G, B, F, I, U, Y, W, K, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with E (position 5),
- contains O once, in position 1 or 4,
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Candidate patterns:
- O _ _ _ E   (O in 1)
- _ _ _ O E   (O in 4)

High-probability words under these constraints:
– OBTUSE (but has S, which is out)  
– OLDIE (has D and L, both allowed)  
– OLIVE (has V)  
– OMBRE (has B)  
– TONER (R is out)  
– CONE (too short)  
– LODGE (has D and G, both allowed)  
– MIDGE (has D and G)  
– WODGE (W, D, G)  
– BOCCE (has C)  

Among these, OLDIE fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- O in position 1
- Uses letters L, D, I, none of which are ruled out yet

We now have three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
2. phone → P(x) H(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
3. oldie → O(✓) L(✓) D(x) I(-) E(✓)

What we know for certain:
- Position 5 is E (✓).
- Position 1 is O (✓).
- Position 2 is L (✓).
- Therefore the word so far is O L _ _ E

We also know:
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from oldie’s feedback I(-)).
- D is NOT in the word (D(x)).
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, P, H, N, D.

So the two unknown positions are 3 and 4.  
The remaining letters we haven’t ruled out include:
B, C, F, G, K, M, T, U, V, W, Y, I, …

Since I must appear somewhere, and position 4 is disallowed for I, I must appear in position 3.

That locks position 3 as I, giving us:
O L I _ E

We now need a letter for position 4 that:
- is not any of the eliminated letters,
- makes a valid 5-letter word.

Remaining letters for position 4: B, C, F, G, K, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Scanning the dictionary space, common words matching O L I _ E:
OLIVE – but V is allowed, E is already fixed, so it fits.

Let me check:
- O(✓) L(✓) I(✓) V(-) E(✓)  
In this pattern V would be in position 4, which has never been tested, so it is plausible.

No conflict with any prior feedback.
