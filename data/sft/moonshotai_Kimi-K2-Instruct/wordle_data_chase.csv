- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want a word that gives us a good chance of getting some hits on common letters while also helping to narrow down possible positions. A classic strategy is to use a word with a lot of common vowels and consonants. 

Words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SOARE"" are often recommended as they contain common letters. However, I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it has:
- A, O, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are present and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): The letter A is present somewhere in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

Letters not in the word: R, O

Letters confirmed in word: S, E
Letters confirmed in word but position unknown: A

Now we need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S E
- Contains A (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT contain R or O
- Has valid letters in positions 1, 2, and 3

Good candidates:
- CHASE: C H A S E - but A is in position 3, which might be okay
- PHASE: P H A S E
- BASED: but must end with SE
- LASED: but must end with SE
- VASTE: but that's not a word
- HASTE: H A S T E - but that's not ending correctly
- Caste: C A S T E - but that's not ending correctly

Wait - words must end with SE. So possible words:
- BASES: but E is in position 4, not 5
- LASES: same
- CASES: same
- CHASE: C H A S E - positions 4 and 5 are S E, and A is in position 3 (allowed)
- PHASE: P H A S E - same structure
- MASSE: but that's not a common word
- LENSE: but that's not a common word
- TASTE: T A S T E - no, T appears twice and we don't know about T yet

Between CHASE and PHASE:
- CHASE: C H A S E - C is common, H is common
- PHASE: P H A S E - P is less common than C

CHASE seems better as C and H are more common letters to test.
