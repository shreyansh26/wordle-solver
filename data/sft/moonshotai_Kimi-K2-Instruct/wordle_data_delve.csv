For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include vowels and frequently used consonants. Classic choices like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels are present and their positions, as well as the presence of S and R.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all absent (x)
- Only E is present, and it is in the correct last position (✓)

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E, and none of A, R, O, S appear anywhere.

I want a new word that keeps the final E and tests fresh letters. Good candidates avoid those ruled-out letters. Let me pick a word that includes common consonants not yet used: T, N, L, C, H, etc.

A simple, high-frequency word that fits is “UNTIE”. It keeps the final E and introduces U, N, T, I, all of which are still possible.

So far we know:
- The last letter is definitely E (both guesses ended in E and both got ✓ on the 5th position).
- Letters already confirmed absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Uses only still-allowable letters in positions 1-4.
3. Maximizes coverage of common remaining consonants.

Good consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

I can construct several candidates. “CHIDE” uses C, H, D – all still possible – but I was about to pick “CHIDE” and then realized it has an I (which is ruled out). Scratch that.

Next choice: “FLAME” – F, L, A, M, E. A is already ruled out.

Next: “BLAME” – B, L, A, M, E. Again A is ruled out.

How about “PLUME”? But U is ruled out.

Another candidate: “WEDGE” – W, E, D, G, E. That uses W, E, D, G. Only one E is in the word (the last position), the first E would be in position 2. That’s fine – we don’t know anything about duplicates yet. So W is fresh, D is fresh, G is fresh. This seems like a good coverage.

From the feedback so far:

1. All guesses end with E (✓) – so the 5th letter is E.
2. Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, G.
3. Letters we now know are in the word but misplaced:
   - D appears in WEDGE and is marked “-” – so D is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
4. Still-unused common letters include B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Contains D somewhere (not in position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 4.

Some candidate words:
- FABLE – but A is out.
- MAPLE – A is out.
- CABLE – A is out.
- JUDGE – J, U, D, G, E. U and G already ruled out.
- HEDGE – H, E, D, G, E. G ruled out.
- BUDGE – U, G ruled out.
- FUDGE – U, G ruled out.

Let’s look for words with D in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position, ending in E, and avoiding all banned letters.

A good candidate is “DELVE”:
- D in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 5 (already confirmed correct).
- L, V, E are all still possible letters.

Let’s check: D, E, L, V, E – all letters not yet ruled out.

So, “DELVE” it is.

<guess>DELVE</guess>",DELVE,"From the feedback so far:

1. All guesses end with E (✓) – so the 5th letter is E.
2. Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, G.
3. Letters we now know are in the word but misplaced:
   - D appears in WEDGE and is marked “-” – so D is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
4. Still-unused common letters include B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Contains D somewhere (not in position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 4.

Some candidate words:
- FABLE – but A is out.
- MAPLE – A is out.
- CABLE – A is out.
- JUDGE – J, U, D, G, E. U and G already ruled out.
- HEDGE – H, E, D, G, E. G ruled out.
- BUDGE – U, G ruled out.
- FUDGE – U, G ruled out.

Let’s look for words with D in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position, ending in E, and avoiding all banned letters.

A good candidate is “DELVE”:
- D in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 5 (already confirmed correct).
- L, V, E are all still possible letters.

Let’s check: D, E, L, V, E – all letters not yet ruled out.

So, “DELVE” it is.",Guess 4: DELVE -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) L(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
