For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting guesses include words like:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU
- STARE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words, which should provide helpful feedback for future guesses.

A common word that fits is “GRATE”, but G hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
Another common word is “PLATE”, but P hasn’t been ruled out either.  
Let’s try GRATE first to test G and R.  Wait, we already know R is out.

So let’s try a word like “GHATE”  – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Valid words: “PLATE”, “GNATE”, “GLATE” – none of these fit.

Wait, “PLATE” uses P and L, but L is already ruled out.

Try “PHATE” – invalid.

How about “GRATE” – but R is ruled out.

Next, try “GNATE” – invalid.

Try “DWATE” – invalid.

DRATE: not a word.
FRATE: not a word.
GRATE: G and R; R is out.
PRATE: P and R; R is out.
TRATE: not a word.

Filtering out ones that use S, L, C, R:

Valid remaining starting consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid words from the list:

- ORATE – O and R; R is out.
- QUATE – Q and U.

Best options: ABATE, AGATE, AWATE, ELATE, ENATE, QUATE, THATE, WHATE, YEATE.

Among these, “ENATE” (meaning related to birth or descent) is a valid word, uses E and N in positions 1 & 2, neither of which are ruled out.  Let’s test ENATE.

ENATE:
- E in position 1 (new letter for position 1)
- N in position 2 (new letter)
- A in position 3 (confirmed)

- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ A T E.

Letters definitely absent: S, L.  
We need 2 more letters (in positions 1 and 2) that haven’t been ruled out.  
Good candidates for position 1: consonants that commonly start words, like C, B, F, M, P, R, etc.  
Good candidates for position 2: vowels or common consonants like R, N, H, D, etc.

Let’s try CRATE:
- C (position 1) – common consonant, hasn’t been ruled out.
- R (position 2) – common consonant, hasn’t been ruled out.
- A, T, E are already confirmed in their correct positions.

This should help us verify C and R while preserving the known letters.

A common word that fits is “GRATE”, but G hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
Another common word is “PLATE”, but P hasn’t been ruled out either.  
Let’s try GRATE first to test G and R.  Wait, we already know R is out.

So let’s try a word like “GHATE”  – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Valid words: “PLATE”, “GNATE”, “GLATE” – none of these fit.

Wait, “PLATE” uses P and L, but L is already ruled out.

Try “PHATE” – invalid.

How about “GRATE” – but R is ruled out.

Next, try “GNATE” – invalid.

Try “DWATE” – invalid.

Try “BRATE” – B and R; R is out.

Try “FRATE” – but “FRATE” isn’t a word.

Valid English words that end in “ATE” and have 5 letters: e.g., “GRATE”, “PLATE”, “CRATE”, “BRATE”, “PRATE”, “SKATE”, “SLATE”, “STATE”, etc.  From these, we’ve already tried SLATE, CRATE.  The remaining ones with new starting letters:

BRATE: B and R; R is out.
DRATE: not a word.
FRATE: not a word.
GRATE: G and R; R is out.
PRATE: P and R; R is out.
TRATE: not a word.

Instead, we need to try a word that uses different consonants in positions 1 & 2.  
Valid 5-letter words that fit _ _ A T E:

- HUATE – invalid.

Filtering out ones that use S, L, C, R:

Valid remaining starting consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid words from the list:
- ABATE – A already used in position 3; but A in position 1 is allowed (no info on A in position 1).  However, we only know A is in position 3, not necessarily that A is only in position 3.  So ABATE is possible.
- AGATE – G and A.
- AWATE – W and A.
- BLATE – L is out.
- CHATE – C is out.
- COATE – C is out.
- ELATE – E already in position 5; E in position 1 is allowed, but E is already confirmed in position 5.  No info on other E’s.  ELATE is possible.
- ENATE – N and E.

- ORATE – O and R; R is out.
- QUATE – Q and U.

- YEATE – Y and E.
- ZLATE – Z and L; L is out.

Best options: ABATE, AGATE, AWATE, ELATE, ENATE, QUATE, THATE, WHATE, YEATE.

Among these, “ENATE” (meaning related to birth or descent) is a valid word, uses E and N in positions 1 & 2, neither of which are ruled out.  Let’s test ENATE.

ENATE:
- E in position 1 (new letter for position 1)
- N in position 2 (new letter)
- A in position 3 (confirmed)
- T in position 4 (confirmed)
- E in position 5 (confirmed)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

Valid candidates:
- ABATE – A in position 1 is allowed (not yet tested); B is new
- AGATE – G in position 1, A in position 2
- AWATE – W and A
- BOATE – invalid (not a word)
- DUATE – invalid
- FIATE – invalid
- GHATE – invalid
- HUATE – invalid
- MIATE – invalid
- PIATE – invalid
- QUATE – Q and U; Q must be followed by U, so positions 1-2 would be QU
- VIATE – invalid
- WHATE – W and H

Real words that fit:
- ABATE
- AGATE
- AWATE
- QUATE

Among these, “ABATE” is a common word and introduces two fresh letters (A and B).  
Let’s test ABATE.

ABATE:
- A in position 1 (new letter for position 1)
- B in position 2 (entirely new letter)
- A, T, E in positions 3,4,5 (already confirmed)
This will tell us if B is in position 2 and whether A is allowed in position 1 or another A is present.

We now know the exact pattern:

A _ A T E

with the second letter still unknown.

Letters already ruled out: S, L, C, R, N, B  
Remaining possible second-position letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q (but Q would need a U), T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words that match A _ A T E:

- AGATE  (G) – but we haven’t tried G yet
- ALATE  (L) – L is ruled out
- AWATE  (W) – valid, but W is very uncommon in that spot
- AMATE  (M) – valid
- ADATE  – not a real word
- AFATE  – not a real word
- AHATE  – not a real word
- AKATE  – not a real word
- APATE  – not a real word
- ASATE  – not a real word
- AVATE  – not a real word
- AXATE  – not a real word
- AYATE  – not a real word
- AZATE  – not a real word

The clearest valid candidate left is AGATE, but we just tested ABATE and got B(x); G has not been tested yet.  Other clear valid words are AMATE and AWATE.  

AGATE is a real and fairly common word, so let’s test it to see if G is the missing letter.
