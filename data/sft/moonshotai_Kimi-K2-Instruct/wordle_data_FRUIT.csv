For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage of the alphabet to help narrow down possibilities. Common starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it uses frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words and includes 3 consonants and 2 vowels, giving us good information about both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct second position (✓)
- A, N, E are all absent (x)

So the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word with R in the second spot, and no C, A, N, E.  
A good next step is to probe remaining vowels and common consonants.  
The remaining vowels are I, O, U.  
Common consonants not yet used (and allowed) include B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Introduces new vowels and consonants.
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).

One such word is “BROIL”:
