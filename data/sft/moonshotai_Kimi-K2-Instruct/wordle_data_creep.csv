For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and a variety of vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as an optimal first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits

This should help me identify which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (must be somewhere other than position 5).
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we need:
- A five-letter word with R as the second letter.
- Must contain E somewhere other than the last position.
- Cannot contain A, O, or S.

Possible next-step choices:
- First letter: not A or O
- Third letter: not A, O, S
- Fourth letter: not A, O, S
- Fifth letter: not A, O, S, or E

Let me construct a candidate word:
- R is fixed at position 2.
- E needs to be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Try putting E in position 1: E R _ _ _
- Remaining letters (can't be A, O, S): T, I, N, L, etc.

Let's try ""ERICT"" - but this uses C which might be okay. Actually let's think of more common letters.

""TRIBE"" would fit:
- R is in position 2
- E is in position 4 (not position 5, so okay)

From the two feedbacks:

1. AROSE:  
   - R is correct in position 2.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

2. TRIBE:  
   - R is still correct in position 2.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (consistent).  
   - T, I, B are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Word shape: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain E, but E is not in position 5 (and cannot be in position 1, 3, 4 because those letters were already ruled out in TRIBE).
Wait, let’s list the knowns again carefully.

Letters to exclude entirely: A, O, S, T, I, B.

Knowns:
- Position 2: R
- Must contain E somewhere, but E is not allowed in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (because in TRIBE we saw E is ""-"" in position 5, and in AROSE we saw E is ""-"" in position 5, but in TRIBE the E was in position 4 and it was marked ""-"" meaning not in correct position but in word somewhere). Wait, no:

In TRIBE, E was in position 4 and the feedback was E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, but could be in 1 or 3. But in TRIBE, positions 1 and 3 were T and I, both marked x (not in word), so E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 either from TRIBE.

Hmm, this seems impossible. Let me re-examine:

From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From TRIBE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus E must be in position 3 (since positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are ruled out for E). But in TRIBE, position 3 was I, which was marked x (I not in word), so E could be in position 3. So E is in position 3.

So word shape: _ R E _ _

Now, possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: cannot be A, O, S, T, I, B. Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

- Must contain E somewhere, but E is not allowed in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (because in TRIBE we saw E is ""-"" in position 5, and in AROSE we saw E is ""-"" in position 5, but in TRIBE the E was in position 4 and it was marked ""-"" meaning not in correct position but in word somewhere). Wait, no:

In TRIBE, E was in position 4 and the feedback was E(-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, but could be in 1 or 3. But in TRIBE, positions 1 and 3 were T and I, both marked x (not in word), so E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 either from TRIBE.

Hmm, this seems impossible. Let me re-examine:

From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
From TRIBE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus E must be in position 3 (since positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are ruled out for E). But in TRIBE, position 3 was I, which was marked x (I not in word), so E could be in position 3. So E is in position 3.

So word shape: _ R E _ _

Now, possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5: cannot be A, O, S, T, I, B. Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words fitting _ R E _ _:

Possible candidates:
- C R E E D
- D R E A D (but A is out)
- F R E E D
- G R E E D
- P R E E D
- C R E E K
- G R E E K

CREED seems most common and fits all constraints.

Check:
- CREED: C, R (✓), E, E, D
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, O, S, T, I, B)
- E is in positions 3 and 4, and we know E is in word (positions 3 is fine since E can be in 3)

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

So we need:

Possible next-step choices:

We now have:

C R E E _

and we just learned that neither D nor K is the final letter, while C, R, E, E are all correct in their positions.

Letters already excluded from the entire word:  
A, O, S, T, I, B, D, K.

Remaining common consonants for position 5: F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common English five-letter words spelled C R E E _ :

- CREEL – a reel for fishing line (valid word)  
- CREEM – (proper noun, magazine name; not valid)  
- CREEP – common word  
- CREES – plural of Cree (proper noun, usually invalid)  
- CREED, CREEK already tried.

“CREEL” and “CREEP” are both valid; “CREEP” is more common.

Check constraints:  
- CREEP uses P, which hasn’t been used or ruled out.  
- All earlier constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CREEP.
