For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. The word should also avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common ending letter

This should give us good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: correct position (✓, 2nd letter)
- A, T, E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word is _ L _ _ _
2. Letters S, A, T, E are NOT in the word.
3. We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants.

Good next candidates should include:
- L in the 2nd position
- Avoid S, A, T, E
- Try new common letters

Possible starting letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

- B: common starting letter
- L: confirmed in 2nd position
- O: common vowel we haven't tested

From the two guesses we know:

1. Pattern so far: _ L _ _ _
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, B, O, N, D.

Next step: keep L in position 2, and try other common letters we haven’t used yet.

Remaining common vowels: I, U  
Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, R, W, Y, etc.

- L: fixed in 2nd position  
- I: new vowel  
- M: new consonant

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. Pattern: _ L I _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, B, O, N, D, K
3. Current information:
   - L is definitely in position 2
   - I is definitely in position 3
   - F is in the word but not in position 1
   - C is in the word but not in position 4

So the actual word looks like: [?] L I [?] [?]
with F and C somewhere in the remaining slots 1, 4, or 5, but not in their current tested positions.

Possible letters remaining (excluding the banned set): C, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word matching _ L I _ _ that uses F and C somewhere, plus one more letter.

Let’s consider possible rearrangements:
- If C is in position 1: C L I _ _ → CLI?? Need valid words like “CLIFF” (but F is already known to be in the word, and we’d have F in position 4 or 5). However, “CLI” is a prefix, but “CLIFF” is 5 letters. But we’d have C L I F F, but the word can’t have double F since F is only confirmed once. Also, we can’t repeat letters unless the word itself does. But since we have no evidence of double letters, better to avoid.

- If C is in position 4: _ L I C _ → ?LIC? Valid words might be “ALICE” but A is banned. “PLIC?” Not valid. “SLICE” but S is banned.

- If C is in position 5: _ L I _ C → ?LI?C Valid words: “FLICK” already tried. “CLIC?” Not valid. “FLICS” but S is banned. “PLIC?” Not valid. “GLICK” but K is banned.

- If F is in position 4: _ L I F _ → ?LIF? Possible words: “CLIFF” but C would be in position 1, which might work. But A is banned, so “CLIFF” is possible. However, we’d have C L I F F, but we have no confirmation of double F. Also, C is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 4, which is fine here (C would be in position 1).

- If F is in position 5: _ L I _ F → ?LI?F Possible words: “CLIFF” again, but that would put F in position 4 and 5, unlikely. “GLIFF” but G is still possible.

Looking at the remaining letters, let’s try “FLINT” but N is banned. “FLIRT” – R is still possible, T is banned. “FLIPS” – P and S, but S is banned. “FLICK” already done.

Next option: “CLIFF” seems plausible:
- C is allowed in position 1
- L in 2, I in 3
- F can be in position 4 or 5
- Double F is possible but we have no evidence against it
However, we know C is in the word but not in position 4, so position 1 is fine.

But to avoid assuming double letters, let’s look for another word.

Next candidate: “GLIB?” Not valid. “PLIED” – D is banned.

Alternative: “FLIRP” – not a word.

Another approach: since F must be somewhere, and C must be somewhere, and positions 1,4,5 are open, let’s try a word that places F in position 4 and C in position 5: _ L I F C → “ELIFC” not a word. “ULIFC” no.

Realizing that valid 5-letter words fitting _ L I _ _ with F and C are limited, the most promising is “CLIFF” despite the double F, as it’s a real word.

But let’s check another: “FLICS” – S is banned. “CLIFT” – T is banned. “PLING” – N is banned.

Another valid word: “FLIMP” – but M and P are allowed, but this seems obscure.

Re-evaluating, the only reasonable common word left seems “CLIFF”.

But let’s verify: C is allowed in position 1, L in 2, I in 3, F in 4 and 5. This fits all constraints:
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- F is in the word but not in position 1 (here it’s in 4 and 5, so fine)
- C is in the word but not in position 4 (here it’s in 1, so fine)
- No banned letters used (S, A, T, E, B, O, N, D, K)

Thus, “CLIFF” is the logical next guess.
