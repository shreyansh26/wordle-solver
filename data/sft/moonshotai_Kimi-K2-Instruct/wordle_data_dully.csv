For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give maximum information by including common letters and covering different positions. A good strategy is to use common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". After considering these options, ""CRANE"" stands out because it contains the common letters C, R, A, N, E which are frequently found in many 5-letter words, giving good potential for hits or misses that will guide subsequent guesses.

All five letters in CRANE – C, R, A, N, E – are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

That means the word is made only from the remaining 19 letters: B D F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z.

Since we now know five letters that are NOT in the word, I should try a completely fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels. A commonly suggested follow-up in this situation is to use a word like “SPOIL”, “SLUMP”, or “DOUGH”. Among those, “SPOIL” uses five new letters (S, P, O, I, L) that are all still possible and fairly common in English words. I’ll go with that.

(Alternate choices like “DOUGH” or “FLING” would also be fine, but I’m picking SPOIL.)

From both prior guesses we now know:

- Letters definitely absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, I  
- One letter definitely present: L (but in the wrong position, since the feedback on L is “-”)

So the secret word:
- contains an L somewhere NOT in position 5  
- uses none of the nine ruled-out letters above  
- still allows: B D F G H J K M Q T U V W X Y Z

I want a fresh word that:
1. re-uses L in a different spot to test its placement,  
2. introduces other still-possible consonants and vowels,  
3. is itself a valid 5-letter English word.

A good pattern is to put L in spot 1 and surround it with common remaining consonants plus a vowel that hasn’t been tested yet. The best single untested vowel left is U. Among consonants, B, D, F, G, H, K, M, T are all still possible. Trying to spread them out, “BLUNT” uses B, L, U, N, T, but N is already ruled out. “FLUID” uses F, L, U, I, D – but I is ruled out. “GLUM” is too short; “GLUME” contains E (ruled out). “BLUSH” uses B, L, U, S, H – S is ruled out. “BULKY” uses B, U, L, K, Y – all still allowed and gives good coverage.

Therefore “BULKY” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, I, B, K  
- Present letters: U (position 2), L (position 3), Y (position 5)  

So the secret word’s pattern is:  
_ U L _ Y  

Letters still available (not yet ruled out) are:  
D F G H J M Q T V W X Z

To narrow the possibilities, I need a 5-letter word that matches _ U L _ Y.  
Looking at the remaining consonants, the only common English word fitting this pattern is “DULY” – but that’s 4 letters.  
Wait, let me scan again for 5-letter words ending in U L _ Y.  

Actually, the only valid English 5-letter word that fits _ U L _ Y is “DULLY” – but that repeats L, and we already know L is in position 3, so position 4 can’t be L again without duplicating in the word (which is allowed unless specified otherwise).  

But “DULLY” uses D, U, L, L, Y. All letters are still possible (D not ruled out), and it tests whether the 4th letter is L again. However, if the word were “DULLY”, the feedback would have shown L(-) or L(✓) for the 4th position, but since we only know L is somewhere in the word (but not necessarily twice), this is a valid test.  

Another candidate is “GULLY” – G, U, L, L, Y. Again, tests G and the double L.  

But since we need to maximize information, let’s choose a word that introduces a new consonant in the 4th position without repeating L. The only remaining valid word is “HULKY” – but K is already ruled out.  

Rechecking:  
- Position 1: must be from D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
- Position 4: must be from D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ U L _ Y:  
- DULLY  
- GULLY  
- HULKY (invalid, K is out)  
- MULLY (not a word)  
- TULLY (not a word)  

Between “DULLY” and “GULLY”, both introduce a new consonant. “DULLY” tests D, while “GULLY” tests G. Both are reasonable, but “DULLY” is more common.  

Thus, the best next guess is “DULLY”.

<guess>DULLY</guess>",DULLY,"From the feedback so far:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, I, B, K  
- Present letters: U (position 2), L (position 3), Y (position 5)  

So the secret word’s pattern is:  
_ U L _ Y  

Letters still available (not yet ruled out) are:  
D F G H J M Q T V W X Z

To narrow the possibilities, I need a 5-letter word that matches _ U L _ Y.  
Looking at the remaining consonants, the only common English word fitting this pattern is “DULY” – but that’s 4 letters.
