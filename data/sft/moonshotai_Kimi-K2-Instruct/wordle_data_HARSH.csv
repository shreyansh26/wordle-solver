For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)
- SLANT (covers S, L, A, N, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the most optimal first guesses because it contains the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. It has a good mix of consonants and vowels, and uses letters that appear in the top 10 most frequent letters in English.

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE as my first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word at all (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word at all (x)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: C, N, E
- Letters that must appear somewhere (but currently in wrong spots): R, A
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3

Looking for a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and A
2. Does not contain C, N, or E
3. Has R somewhere other than position 2
4. Has A somewhere other than position 3

Good candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me try a word like RADIO:
- Has R (must be in word) and A (must be in word)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 2 before)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before)
- D, I, O are new letters

But RADIO has I and O which are vowels - better to test more consonants.

Alternative: DRAMA
- Has R and A
- But has two As, which might not be optimal for information
- Also has D and M

Another option: ROAST
- But this has S and T which we haven't tested, but also O
- And R is in position 1 (good), A in position 3 (but A was in position 3 before, so this might still be ""wrong position"")

Wait, A was in position 3 and got (-), so in ROAST it would be in position 3 again - that's the same wrong position, so this is bad.

Better option: RATIO
- R in position 1 (good, since it was in 2)
- A in position 2 (good, since it was in 3)
- T, I, O are new letters

But let's think of words with R and A in entirely new positions.

How about FLOUR? No, that has O,U - and no A.

Let's try: TRAMP
- R in position 2 (but this was its original position, so bad)

GRASP:
- R in position 2 (original position, bad)

Let's consider words where:
- R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

Options:
- R in 1, A in 2: RADIO, RACON (but has N), RADIX
- R in 1, A in 4: RAZOR (but has O), RAGGA (but has G twice)

- R in 4, A in 2: TABOR (but has O)
- R in 5, A in 1: AARGH (not valid), AMBAR

Let's go with DRAMA:
- D, R, A, M, A
- Contains R and A
- R is in position 2 (but this was its original position, so this is bad)

Oops, let's pick TRASH:
- T, R, A, S, H
- R is in position 2 (bad, same as original)

Let's try: GRASP
- G, R, A, S, P
- R is in position 2 (bad)

How about: FRANK
- But has N (excluded)

Let's try: FAULT

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)
- SLANT (covers S, L, A, N, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the most optimal first guesses because it contains the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. It has a good mix of consonants and vowels, and uses letters that appear in the top 10 most frequent letters in English.

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE as my first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word at all (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word at all (x)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: C, N, E
- Letters that must appear somewhere (but currently in wrong spots): R, A
- R is not in position 2
- A is not in position 3

Looking for a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and A
2. Does not contain C, N, or E
3. Has R somewhere other than position 2
4. Has A somewhere other than position 3

Good candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me try a word like RADIO:
- Has R (must be in word) and A (must be in word)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 2 before)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before)
- D, I, O are new letters

But RADIO has I and O which are vowels - better to test more consonants.

Alternative: DRAMA
- Has R and A
- But has two As, which might not be optimal for information
- Also has D and M

Another option: ROAST
- But this has S and T which we haven't tested, but also O
- And R is in position 1 (good), A in position 3 (but A was in position 3 before, so this might still be ""wrong position"")

Wait, A was in position 3 and got (-), so in ROAST it would be in position 3 again - that's the same wrong position, so this is bad.

Better option: RATIO
- R in position 1 (good, since it was in 2)
- A in position 2 (good, since it was in 3)
- T, I, O are new letters

But let's think of words with R and A in entirely new positions.

How about FLOUR? No, that has O,U - and no A.

Let's try: TRAMP
- R in position 2 (but this was its original position, so bad)

GRASP:
- R in position 2 (original position, bad)

Let's consider words where:
- R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5

Options:
- R in 1, A in 2: RADIO, RACON (but has N), RADIX
- R in 1, A in 4: RAZOR (but has O), RAGGA (but has G twice)
- R in 3, A in 1: ARBOR (but has B and O), ARGOT (but has O,T)
- R in 3, A in 2: DRAMA (but has D,M,A and two As)
- R in 4, A in 1: AMBER (but has E), AMBER has E
- R in 4, A in 2: TABOR (but has O)
- R in 5, A in 1: AARGH (not valid), AMBAR

Let's go with DRAMA:
- D, R, A, M, A
- Contains R and A
- R is in position 2 (but this was its original position, so this is bad)

Oops, let's pick TRASH:
- T, R, A, S, H
- R is in position 2 (bad, same as original)

Let's try: GRASP
- G, R, A, S, P
- R is in position 2 (bad)

How about: FRANK
- But has N (excluded)

Let's try: FAULT
- No R

Better option: ROAST is no good (A in 3)
How about: TARDY
- T, A, R, D, Y
- A is in position 2 (good, was in 3)
- R is in position 3 (good, was in 2)
- T, D, Y are new letters

This seems optimal - TARDY uses new positions for R and A and tests new letters.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Z

Current constraints:

- Letters ruled out: C, N, E, T, D, Y, F, M
- Available letters left: B, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

So we need a 5-letter word of shape ? A R ? ? that:
– contains S somewhere, but NOT in position 5
– uses only the still-allowed letters

Possible patterns:
- S A R _ _  → but S would be in position 1 (allowed) and we still need two more letters
- _ A R S _  → S in position 4 (allowed)
- _ A R _ S → S in position 5 → ruled out
- _ A R _ _ with S in position 1 or 4

Let’s look for valid English words fitting:

1. S A R _ _  
   - SARGE (valid, uses G,E; but E is out)  
   - SARKY (Y is out)  
   - SARIN (I,N; N is out)  

2. _ A R S _  
   - B A R S → too short  
   - L A R S → LARS (name, usually 4 letters)  
   - P A R S → PARS (short)  
   - H A R S → HARSH? no, needs 5 letters  
   - V A R S _ → VARSY not a word  
   - G A R S → GARSH not a word  
   - W A R S → WARST not a word  

3. Need a 5-letter dictionary word fitting _ A R _ S → none with remaining letters.

4. Re-check pattern S A R _ _:  
   S A R G E → E out  
   S A R K _ → S A R K S (but S already used in 5, duplicate not ruled out but we only have one S)  
   S A R K Y → Y out  

5. Alternative: S A R K _ or S A R G _, but we need 5 letters total.

6. Best candidate remaining: S A R G E → invalid because E is out.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 1 and we fill the rest.  
S A R _ _  
We have 2 more letters to pick from allowed: B, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
We need two more consonants or vowels (but O, I, U are still allowed).

Possible: S A R I K → SARIK (valid variant of SARI)  
But let’s check a more common word: W A R P S is invalid already.

Actually: the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ A R S _ with allowed letters is:

B A R S + one more letter? Not working.

Wait, how about:

K A R S T → KARST? (valid geological term)

But T is out (from TARDY feedback).

G A R S H → GARSH not valid.

H A R S H → HARSH – uses H twice, and H is allowed. Let’s check:

HARSH:
- H A R S H
- H is allowed
- A,R correct positions
- S is in position 4 (allowed), second H is new
- No excluded letters used

This seems valid and is a common word.

Let’s go with HARSH.

- _ A R _ _ with S in position 1 or 4

Let’s look for valid English words fitting:

1. S A R _ _  
   - SARGE (valid, uses G,E; but E is out)  
   - SARKY (Y is out)  
   - SARIN (I,N; N is out)  

2. _ A R S _  
   - B A R S → too short  
   - L A R S → LARS (name, usually 4 letters)  
   - P A R S → PARS (short)  
   - H A R S → HARSH? no, needs 5 letters  
   - V A R S _ → VARSY not a word  
   - G A R S → GARSH not a word  
   - W A R S → WARST not a word  

3. Need a 5-letter dictionary word fitting _ A R _ S → none with remaining letters.

4. Re-check pattern S A R _ _:  
   S A R G E → E out  
   S A R K _ → S A R K S (but S already used in 5, duplicate not ruled out but we only have one S)  
   S A R K Y → Y out  

5. Alternative: S A R K _ or S A R G _, but we need 5 letters total.

6. Best candidate remaining: S A R G E → invalid because E is out.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 1 and we fill the rest.  
S A R _ _  
We have 2 more letters to pick from allowed: B, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z  
We need two more consonants or vowels (but O, I, U are still allowed).

Possible: S A R I K → SARIK (valid variant of SARI)  
But let’s check a more common word: W A R P S is invalid already.

Actually: the only valid 5-letter word fitting _ A R S _ with allowed letters is:

B A R S + one more letter? Not working.

Wait, how about:

K A R S T → KARST? (valid geological term)

But T is out (from TARDY feedback).

G A R S H → GARSH not valid.

H A R S H → HARSH – uses H twice, and H is allowed. Let’s check:

HARSH:
- H A R S H
- H is allowed
- A,R correct positions
- S is in position 4 (allowed), second H is new
- No excluded letters used

This seems valid and is a common word.

Let’s go with HARSH.",Guess 4: HARSH -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
