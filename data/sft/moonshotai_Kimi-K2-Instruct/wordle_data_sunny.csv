For the first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R (both common consonants), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This should give me good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s summarize what we have learned so far:

1. CRANE (Guess 1):
   C ✗, R ✗, A ✗, N ✓ (position 4), E ✗

2. SOUND (Guess 2):
   S ✓ (position 1), O ✗, U – (letter is in word, wrong position), N ✓ (position 4), D ✗

Current knowledge:
- Letter positions:
  - Position 1: S ✓
  - Position 4: N ✓
- Letters in word but wrong positions:
  - U (not in position 2 or 5; must be in 3 or 5; but 5 is already ruled out by N, so U must be in position 2 or 3)
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, O, D
- Confirmed letters: S, N, U

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 1
- N in position 4
- U somewhere (positions 2 or 3)
- No C, R, A, E, O, D

Let’s brainstorm three-letter combinations for positions 2-3-5 that obey these rules:

Since U must be in 2 or 3, and position 4 is N, let’s try:

- S U _ N _
- S _ U N _

Possible combinations:
- S U _ N _ → looking for valid words like S U _ N _ (with 3rd and 5th letters not eliminated)
- S P U N K → but K wasn’t tested yet, and P hasn’t been eliminated.
- S U _ N _ → S U M N _ (but M and other letters not yet tested)
- S _ U N _ → S P U N K, S B U N _ (but B not tested)
- S T U N G (but G not tested)
- S L U N G (but G and L not tested)

Actually, let me list possible valid words:
- S P U N K (P, U, N, K; all allowed)
- S T U N G (T, U, N, G; T and G allowed)
- S L U N G (L, U, N, G; L and G allowed)
- S H U N T (H, U, N, T; H and T allowed)

Among these, ""SHUNT"" seems good because it tests H and T which are common and haven’t been eliminated yet.

Let me check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (new, not eliminated)
- U (must be in word, position 2 or 3; here position 3)
- N (position 4) ✓
- T (new, not eliminated)

This seems optimal.

Summary after 3 guesses

Letters we know for sure  
- Position 1: S ✓  
- Position 4: N ✓  

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed  
- U (has shown “-” twice, so it’s in the word but neither in position 2 nor 3 from SHUNT; that leaves only position 5)

Letters already eliminated  
C, R, A, E, O, D, H, T

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out and not yet placed)  
B, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels I (only vowel left) and sometimes Y.

We need a 5-letter word that looks like:  
S _ _ N U

Let’s list plausible English words that fit S _ _ N U:

- S I N G U ? (not a word)
- S P I N U ? (not a word)
- S K U N U ? (no)
- S L I N U ? (no)
- S K I N U ? (no)

Actually English has very few common 5-letter words ending in “NU”.  
“Snafu” ends in FU – ruled out.  
“Sinus” ends in US – ruled out.  
“Scrum” – wrong.  
“Skunk” fits the pattern S K U N K but has K in position 2 and 5.  
Wait, let me think:  
“Skunk” → S K U N K.  We need S _ _ N U.  That doesn’t fit.

Another pattern: maybe U is in position 3 and another letter in 5?  No, we concluded U must be in 5.

Double-checking:  
After Guess 3 (SHUNT) the feedback for U was “-” again, meaning U is in word but not in position 2 or 3.  Position 4 is N, so U must be in position 5.

Thus the target must literally be:  
S _ _ N U

English 5-letter word that matches:  
S K U N U – no.  
S P I N U – no.  
S I N G U – no.  
S L I N U – no.  
S P L I N U – no.  

Actually the only recognizable 5-letter word fitting S _ _ N U is “SKUNU” (not a word) or “SPUNU” (not a word).  Let me reconsider.

Ah!  I missed “S P U N K” (Guess 3 used SHUNT, so P, U, N, K haven’t been eliminated).  The format is S P _ N K – no, N is 4th.

Wait, let me write the format correctly:  
We have:  
S (pos 1) ✓  
_ (pos 2)  
_ (pos 3)  
N (pos 4) ✓  
U (pos 5) ✓  

Thus the pattern is: S _ _ N U

English word fitting: only “SINNU” (not a word), “SKUNU” (not), “SOGNU”?  None.

I must have missed something.  Let me re-examine constraints.

Actually, after Guess 3 (SHUNT) feedback:  
S ✓ H ✗ U – N ✓ T ✗

U is in word, not in pos 2 or 5 (in SHUNT it is pos 3).  Therefore U could still be in pos 2, 3, or 5.  Position 4 is N.  So U could be in pos 2, 3, or 5.

Let me list possible patterns:

Case 1: U in pos 2 → S U _ N _  
Need a 3rd and 5th letter, no C/R/A/E/O/D/H/T, and 5th can’t be N.  
Available consonants: B, F, G, I (vowel), K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Possible: S U B N ? – no word.  
S U M N ? – no.  
S U G N ? – no.  
S U L K N – reversed.  
S U L I N ? – no.  
S U N K Y – no.

Case 2: U in pos 3 → S _ U N _  
Available consonants same as above.  
Possible: S B U N ? – no.  
S F U N ? – no.  
S G U N ? – no.  
S P U N ? – S P U N K (but K in 5th).  That is a valid English word: SPUNK.  
Let me check:  
SPUNK → S P U N K  
Positions:  
S 1 ✓  
P 2 – new  
U 3 – ok  
N 4 ✓  
K 5 – new  
All letters are allowed (not in eliminated list).  

Case 3: U in pos 5 → S _ _ N U  
No common English word found.

Thus the only plausible candidate is SPUNK.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R (both common consonants), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This should give me good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

Feedback for CRANE:
- C: not in the word (✗)
- R: not in the word (✗)
- A: not in the word (✗)
- N: correct position (✓)
- E: not in the word (✗)

What we know:

1. The fourth letter is N.
2. Letters C, R, A, E are ruled out.
3. We still need to test common vowels like I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

To maximize information, we should try a word that:
- Keeps N in the 4th position.
- Introduces new letters we haven't tested yet (especially common ones).

Good candidates: 
- SOUND (tests S, O, U, D, with N kept in 4th)
- MOUNT (tests M, O, U, T, with N kept in 4th)
- PINTO (tests P, I, T, O, with N in 4th)

I'll go with SOUND because it tests three new vowels (O, U) and two new consonants (S, D), while keeping N in place.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we have learned so far:

1. CRANE (Guess 1):

2. SOUND (Guess 2):
   S ✓ (position 1), O ✗, U – (letter is in word, wrong position), N ✓ (position 4), D ✗

Current knowledge:
- Letter positions:
  - Position 1: S ✓
  - Position 4: N ✓
- Letters in word but wrong positions:
  - U (not in position 2 or 5; must be in 3 or 5; but 5 is already ruled out by N, so U must be in position 2 or 3)
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, O, D
- Confirmed letters: S, N, U

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 1
- N in position 4
- U somewhere (positions 2 or 3)
- No C, R, A, E, O, D

Let’s brainstorm three-letter combinations for positions 2-3-5 that obey these rules:

Since U must be in 2 or 3, and position 4 is N, let’s try:

- S U _ N _
- S _ U N _

Possible combinations:
- S U _ N _ → looking for valid words like S U _ N _ (with 3rd and 5th letters not eliminated)
- S P U N K → but K wasn’t tested yet, and P hasn’t been eliminated.
- S U _ N _ → S U M N _ (but M and other letters not yet tested)
- S _ U N _ → S P U N K, S B U N _ (but B not tested)
- S T U N G (but G not tested)
- S L U N G (but G and L not tested)

Actually, let me list possible valid words:
- S P U N K (P, U, N, K; all allowed)
- S T U N G (T, U, N, G; T and G allowed)
- S L U N G (L, U, N, G; L and G allowed)
- S H U N T (H, U, N, T; H and T allowed)

Among these, ""SHUNT"" seems good because it tests H and T which are common and haven’t been eliminated yet.

Let me check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (new, not eliminated)
- U (must be in word, position 2 or 3; here position 3)
- N (position 4) ✓
- T (new, not eliminated)

This seems optimal.

Let’s list plausible English words that fit S _ _ N U:

- S I N G U ? (not a word)
- S P I N U ? (not a word)
- S K U N U ? (no)
- S L I N U ? (no)
- S K I N U ? (no)

Actually English has very few common 5-letter words ending in “NU”.  
“Snafu” ends in FU – ruled out.  
“Sinus” ends in US – ruled out.  
“Scrum” – wrong.  
“Skunk” fits the pattern S K U N K but has K in position 2 and 5.  
Wait, let me think:  
“Skunk” → S K U N K.  We need S _ _ N U.  That doesn’t fit.

Another pattern: maybe U is in position 3 and another letter in 5?  No, we concluded U must be in 5.

Double-checking:  
After Guess 3 (SHUNT) the feedback for U was “-” again, meaning U is in word but not in position 2 or 3.  Position 4 is N, so U must be in position 5.

Ah!  I missed “S P U N K” (Guess 3 used SHUNT, so P, U, N, K haven’t been eliminated).  The format is S P _ N K – no, N is 4th.

Actually, after Guess 3 (SHUNT) feedback:  
S ✓ H ✗ U – N ✓ T ✗

U is in word, not in pos 2 or 5 (in SHUNT it is pos 3).  Therefore U could still be in pos 2, 3, or 5.  Position 4 is N.  So U could be in pos 2, 3, or 5.

Let me list possible patterns:

3. SHUNT → S(✓) H(x) U(-) N(✓) T(x)
4. SPUNK → S(✓) P(x) U(-) N(✓) K(x)

From all of these we can compile:

- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Position 4 is definitely N.
- The letter U appears in the word, but **NOT** in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because in every guess where U appeared, it received “-”).  
  Since position 1 is S and position 4 is N, the only place left for U is **position 2 or 3**, but we’ve now ruled out both positions 2 and 3.  
  That’s impossible—there’s no remaining spot for U—so we must have mis-read the feedback.

Let’s re-examine carefully:

- In Guess 2 (SOUND) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.
- In Guess 3 (SHUNT) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.
- In Guess 4 (SPUNK) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.

Hence U can **only** be in position 2.

Therefore the word shape is:
S U _ N _

We need:
- Position 1 = S
- Position 2 = U
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 and 5 are still unknown, but must be letters **not yet eliminated**.

Eliminated letters so far:
C, R, A, E, O, D, H, T, P, K  
Remaining consonants: B, F, G, I (vowel), L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We also have the vowel I still available.

We need a valid English 5-letter word matching S U _ N _ .

Checking common words:
- S U N N Y → but that has N twice and we already have one N in position 4.  
- S U B N ? – no such word.  
- S U G N ? – no.  
- S U L K N – reversed.  
- S U M N ? – no.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N T → no.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N K → not a word.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N ?  
Wait, “SUING” is 5 letters, but positions wouldn’t fit.  
- S U I N ? – no.

Actually, the only familiar word that fits S U _ N _ is **SUNNY**, but it uses N twice and we only have one N confirmed in position 4.  That seems unlikely.

Next candidate: **S U I N X** – doesn’t exist.  

Let me think of others:  
“S U L K N” – no.  
“S U L L N” – no.  
“S U B N E” – no.  

Wait, there is a word **SUING** (S U I N G) but that would be S U I N G → G would be position 5, but G isn’t eliminated.  So S U I N G?  But that’s 5 letters and matches: S, U, I, N, G.  But we need S U _ N _.  So positions would be S U _ N _ .  Actually the word **SUING** has letters: S, U, I, N, G.  But the pattern is S U _ N _.  So positions 1,2,3,4,5: S U _ N _.  So “SUING” is S U I N G → position 4 would be N, so that fits S U I N G?  Wait, no.  SUING is S-U-I-N-G so positions 1-2-3-4-5: S U I N G.  So that’s S U I N G, which matches our pattern S U _ N _ only if the blank is I and G is 5th.  So that would be S U I N G → but N is position 4, so word is S U I N G.  However, SUING is a valid word.

But SUING has I and G, which have not been eliminated.  Let’s verify:

- S (1) ✓  
- U (2) ✓ (and we deduced U must be in 2)  
- I (3) – not eliminated  
- N (4) ✓  
- G (5) – not eliminated  

All letters are allowed.  So **SUING** is the only plausible candidate left.

Therefore the guess is **SUING**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with multiple vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, or L. 

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R (both common consonants), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), and E (most common vowel). This should give me good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Feedback for CRANE:
- C: not in the word (✗)
- R: not in the word (✗)
- A: not in the word (✗)
- N: correct position (✓)
- E: not in the word (✗)

What we know:

1. The fourth letter is N.
2. Letters C, R, A, E are ruled out.
3. We still need to test common vowels like I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

To maximize information, we should try a word that:
- Keeps N in the 4th position.
- Introduces new letters we haven't tested yet (especially common ones).

Good candidates: 
- SOUND (tests S, O, U, D, with N kept in 4th)
- MOUNT (tests M, O, U, T, with N kept in 4th)
- PINTO (tests P, I, T, O, with N in 4th)

I'll go with SOUND because it tests three new vowels (O, U) and two new consonants (S, D), while keeping N in place.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we have learned so far:

1. CRANE (Guess 1):
   C ✗, R ✗, A ✗, N ✓ (position 4), E ✗

2. SOUND (Guess 2):
   S ✓ (position 1), O ✗, U – (letter is in word, wrong position), N ✓ (position 4), D ✗

Current knowledge:
- Letter positions:
  - Position 1: S ✓
  - Position 4: N ✓
- Letters in word but wrong positions:
  - U (not in position 2 or 5; must be in 3 or 5; but 5 is already ruled out by N, so U must be in position 2 or 3)
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, O, D
- Confirmed letters: S, N, U

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 1
- N in position 4
- U somewhere (positions 2 or 3)
- No C, R, A, E, O, D

Let’s brainstorm three-letter combinations for positions 2-3-5 that obey these rules:

Since U must be in 2 or 3, and position 4 is N, let’s try:

- S U _ N _
- S _ U N _

Possible combinations:
- S U _ N _ → looking for valid words like S U _ N _ (with 3rd and 5th letters not eliminated)
- S P U N K → but K wasn’t tested yet, and P hasn’t been eliminated.
- S U _ N _ → S U M N _ (but M and other letters not yet tested)
- S _ U N _ → S P U N K, S B U N _ (but B not tested)
- S T U N G (but G not tested)
- S L U N G (but G and L not tested)

Actually, let me list possible valid words:
- S P U N K (P, U, N, K; all allowed)
- S T U N G (T, U, N, G; T and G allowed)
- S L U N G (L, U, N, G; L and G allowed)
- S H U N T (H, U, N, T; H and T allowed)

Among these, ""SHUNT"" seems good because it tests H and T which are common and haven’t been eliminated yet.

Let me check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (new, not eliminated)
- U (must be in word, position 2 or 3; here position 3)
- N (position 4) ✓
- T (new, not eliminated)

This seems optimal.

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed  
- U (has shown “-” twice, so it’s in the word but neither in position 2 nor 3 from SHUNT; that leaves only position 5)

Letters already eliminated  
C, R, A, E, O, D, H, T

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out and not yet placed)  
B, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels I (only vowel left) and sometimes Y.

We need a 5-letter word that looks like:  
S _ _ N U

Let’s list plausible English words that fit S _ _ N U:

- S I N G U ? (not a word)
- S P I N U ? (not a word)
- S K U N U ? (no)
- S L I N U ? (no)
- S K I N U ? (no)

Actually English has very few common 5-letter words ending in “NU”.  
“Snafu” ends in FU – ruled out.  
“Sinus” ends in US – ruled out.  
“Scrum” – wrong.  
“Skunk” fits the pattern S K U N K but has K in position 2 and 5.  
Wait, let me think:  
“Skunk” → S K U N K.  We need S _ _ N U.  That doesn’t fit.

Another pattern: maybe U is in position 3 and another letter in 5?  No, we concluded U must be in 5.

Double-checking:  
After Guess 3 (SHUNT) the feedback for U was “-” again, meaning U is in word but not in position 2 or 3.  Position 4 is N, so U must be in position 5.

Thus the target must literally be:  
S _ _ N U

English 5-letter word that matches:  
S K U N U – no.  
S P I N U – no.  
S I N G U – no.  
S L I N U – no.  
S P L I N U – no.  

Actually the only recognizable 5-letter word fitting S _ _ N U is “SKUNU” (not a word) or “SPUNU” (not a word).  Let me reconsider.

Ah!  I missed “S P U N K” (Guess 3 used SHUNT, so P, U, N, K haven’t been eliminated).  The format is S P _ N K – no, N is 4th.

Wait, let me write the format correctly:  
We have:  
S (pos 1) ✓  
_ (pos 2)  
_ (pos 3)  
N (pos 4) ✓  
U (pos 5) ✓  

Thus the pattern is: S _ _ N U

English word fitting: only “SINNU” (not a word), “SKUNU” (not), “SOGNU”?  None.

I must have missed something.  Let me re-examine constraints.

Actually, after Guess 3 (SHUNT) feedback:  
S ✓ H ✗ U – N ✓ T ✗

U is in word, not in pos 2 or 5 (in SHUNT it is pos 3).  Therefore U could still be in pos 2, 3, or 5.  Position 4 is N.  So U could be in pos 2, 3, or 5.

Let me list possible patterns:

Case 1: U in pos 2 → S U _ N _  
Need a 3rd and 5th letter, no C/R/A/E/O/D/H/T, and 5th can’t be N.  
Available consonants: B, F, G, I (vowel), K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Possible: S U B N ? – no word.  
S U M N ? – no.  
S U G N ? – no.  
S U L K N – reversed.  
S U L I N ? – no.  
S U N K Y – no.

Case 2: U in pos 3 → S _ U N _  
Available consonants same as above.  
Possible: S B U N ? – no.  
S F U N ? – no.  
S G U N ? – no.  
S P U N ? – S P U N K (but K in 5th).  That is a valid English word: SPUNK.  
Let me check:  
SPUNK → S P U N K  
Positions:  
S 1 ✓  
P 2 – new  
U 3 – ok  
N 4 ✓  
K 5 – new  
All letters are allowed (not in eliminated list).  

Case 3: U in pos 5 → S _ _ N U  
No common English word found.

Thus the only plausible candidate is SPUNK.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(x) U(-) N(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: SHUNT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) U(-) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 4: SPUNK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) U(-) N(✓) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have four pieces of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
2. SOUND → S(✓) O(x) U(-) N(✓) D(x)
3. SHUNT → S(✓) H(x) U(-) N(✓) T(x)
4. SPUNK → S(✓) P(x) U(-) N(✓) K(x)

From all of these we can compile:

- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Position 4 is definitely N.
- The letter U appears in the word, but **NOT** in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because in every guess where U appeared, it received “-”).  
  Since position 1 is S and position 4 is N, the only place left for U is **position 2 or 3**, but we’ve now ruled out both positions 2 and 3.  
  That’s impossible—there’s no remaining spot for U—so we must have mis-read the feedback.

Let’s re-examine carefully:

- In Guess 2 (SOUND) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.
- In Guess 3 (SHUNT) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.
- In Guess 4 (SPUNK) U got “-”, so U is NOT in position 3.

Hence U can **only** be in position 2.

Therefore the word shape is:
S U _ N _

We need:
- Position 1 = S
- Position 2 = U
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 and 5 are still unknown, but must be letters **not yet eliminated**.

Eliminated letters so far:
C, R, A, E, O, D, H, T, P, K  
Remaining consonants: B, F, G, I (vowel), L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We also have the vowel I still available.

We need a valid English 5-letter word matching S U _ N _ .

Checking common words:
- S U N N Y → but that has N twice and we already have one N in position 4.  
- S U B N ? – no such word.  
- S U G N ? – no.  
- S U L K N – reversed.  
- S U M N ? – no.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N T → no.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N K → not a word.  
- S U I N ? – S U I N ?  
Wait, “SUING” is 5 letters, but positions wouldn’t fit.  
- S U I N ? – no.

Actually, the only familiar word that fits S U _ N _ is **SUNNY**, but it uses N twice and we only have one N confirmed in position 4.  That seems unlikely.

Next candidate: **S U I N X** – doesn’t exist.  

Let me think of others:  
“S U L K N” – no.  
“S U L L N” – no.  
“S U B N E” – no.  

Wait, there is a word **SUING** (S U I N G) but that would be S U I N G → G would be position 5, but G isn’t eliminated.  So S U I N G?  But that’s 5 letters and matches: S, U, I, N, G.  But we need S U _ N _.  So positions would be S U _ N _ .  Actually the word **SUING** has letters: S, U, I, N, G.  But the pattern is S U _ N _.  So positions 1,2,3,4,5: S U _ N _.  So “SUING” is S U I N G → position 4 would be N, so that fits S U I N G?  Wait, no.  SUING is S-U-I-N-G so positions 1-2-3-4-5: S U I N G.  So that’s S U I N G, which matches our pattern S U _ N _ only if the blank is I and G is 5th.  So that would be S U I N G → but N is position 4, so word is S U I N G.  However, SUING is a valid word.

But SUING has I and G, which have not been eliminated.  Let’s verify:

- S (1) ✓  
- U (2) ✓ (and we deduced U must be in 2)  
- I (3) – not eliminated  
- N (4) ✓  
- G (5) – not eliminated  

All letters are allowed.  So **SUING** is the only plausible candidate left.

Therefore the guess is **SUING**.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out)  
B, F, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel Y (sometimes used as a vowel)

S U _ N _

We need one consonant for position 3 and one consonant for position 5 using only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible consonants left: B, F, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- S U X N ? – no.  
- S U Z N ? – no.

Only plausible word that comes to mind is **SUNNY**, but it doubles the N (we only have one N confirmed). Most word lists do not accept double N here.

Re-examine: position 3 must be a consonant not yet eliminated, and position 5 must be a consonant not yet eliminated. The only remaining candidate that is an actual English word is **SUNNY**, even though it uses N twice.  However, the prior feedback has never indicated that the word has two N’s, so this is risky.

Looking again carefully, there is another word: **SUM_N_** – no.  

Wait, let me list English words of the form S U _ N _:

- S U B N Y – no.  
- S U F N Y – no.

Given the constraints, **SUNNY** is the only remaining candidate that is a recognized English word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, we guess SUNNY.

Only plausible word that comes to mind is **SUNNY**, but it doubles the N (we only have one N confirmed). Most word lists do not accept double N here.

Re-examine: position 3 must be a consonant not yet eliminated, and position 5 must be a consonant not yet eliminated. The only remaining candidate that is an actual English word is **SUNNY**, even though it uses N twice.  However, the prior feedback has never indicated that the word has two N’s, so this is risky.

Looking again carefully, there is another word: **SUM_N_** – no.  

Wait, let me list English words of the form S U _ N _:

- S U B N Y – no.  
- S U F N Y – no.  
- S U L N Y – no.  
- S U M N Y – no.  
- S U N N Y – SUNNY (double N).

Given the constraints, **SUNNY** is the only remaining candidate that is a recognized English word fitting the pattern.

Therefore, we guess SUNNY.",Guess 6: SUNNY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
