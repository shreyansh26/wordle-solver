For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Common starting words include options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"". 

After considering these, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many English words
- It gives good coverage to test for multiple frequent letters at once

This initial guess should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

From the two sets of feedback we now have:

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
→ Word must contain S (but not in position 4) and does NOT contain R, A, I, E.

Guess 2: SOUND  
S(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
→ Word must contain S (but not in position 1) and must contain U (but not in position 3) and does NOT contain O, N, D.

Collecting constraints:

- Required letters: S and U  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- U cannot be in position 3  
- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, E, O, N, D  

Letters still usable: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels still usable: only U (since A, E, I, O are out).  
So the word must contain U and at least one other vowel? Actually, only U remains, so every vowel slot must be U or nothing, but we already know U is present.

The word has 5 letters, contains S and U, and must use only the allowed consonants and U.

Let’s look for positions:
S must be in 2, 3, or 5  
U must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5  

Possible overlaps: S and U could be in 2 and 5 or 5 and 2, etc.

Also, we want common letters to maximize info. Let’s try a word that shifts both S and U to new positions and introduces new common consonants like T, L, C, H, M, etc.

A good candidate:  
- S in position 2  
- U in position 4  
- Common consonants for the others: T, L, etc.

Consider ""TULSY"" – but Y may be less common.  

Consider ""PLUSH"" – but H and P are okay, and it uses S and U in new positions:
- P(allowed)  
- L(allowed)  
- U(position 3, but feedback said U cannot be in position 3 from SOUND)  
→ Invalid because U would be in position 3.

Next: ""LUSTY"" – uses L, U, S, T, Y  
- S is in 4 → was forbidden in position 4 from first guess (RAISE: S in 4 was -, but that meant S was in word but not in 4, so 4 is forbidden)  
→ S in 4 is invalid.

Next: ""MUSTY"" – S in 5, U in 2

Guess 3: MUSTY  
M(x) – M is NOT in the word

S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (namely, position 3)  
T(x) – T is NOT in the word  
Y(✓) – Y is in the word AND in the correct position (namely, position 5)

So far we have:
- Letters fixed so far:  
  – pos 2 = U  
  – pos 3 = S  
  – pos 5 = Y  
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, O, N, D, M, T  
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the known present ones (U, S, Y are already placed).

We still need letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed letters.

A quick check of the remaining letters:
We want common English letters that fit: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Among these, the most common consonants are C, F, G, H, L, P, V, etc.

So we need to form a valid 5-letter English word of the form:  
[?1] U S [?4] Y

Let’s scan possible combinations:

Words like:  
- BUSKY → B is allowed, K is allowed, but we have no K yet.  
- CUSHY → C, H allowed → CUSHY is a valid English word.  
- GUSHY, LUSHY, PUSHY, RUSHY are also words, but R is forbidden.

So possible candidates with the pattern ?_U_S_Y:

CUSKY – but “CUSKY” isn’t a common English word.  
CUSHY – valid word, letters C and H are allowed.  
GUSHY – G is allowed.  
FUSKY – not a word.  
PUSKY – not a word.  
LUSHY – L is allowed, and “LUSHY” is a valid word.

Between CUSHY, GUSHY, LUSHY, the most common and likely in word-lists is CUSHY.

Let’s run a quick check:

C – not yet excluded.  
U – fixed at 2 ✓  
S – fixed at 3 ✓  
H – not yet excluded.  
Y – fixed at 5 ✓  

Also, none of these letters were ever marked as absent, so CUSHY is fully compliant.

Thus, the next logical guess is CUSHY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Common starting words include options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"". 

After considering these, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many English words
- It gives good coverage to test for multiple frequent letters at once

This initial guess should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (was position 4).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains exactly one S.
2. Letters R, A, I, E are not present.
3. The S must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it was in position 4 in RAISE).

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that keeps S, avoids R/A/I/E, and introduces new common letters. Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, etc. Vowels left: O, U, Y.

A balanced word: ""TURNS"" – uses T, U, N, R, S. But R is forbidden (from feedback).  
Next: ""SOUND"" – uses S, O, U, N, D. This fits:
- S is moved to position 1 (was 4), testing new placement.
- Introduces O, U, N, D (none of which were in RAISE).

Let’s go with SOUND.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 1: RAISE  
R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
→ Word must contain S (but not in position 4) and does NOT contain R, A, I, E.

Guess 2: SOUND  
S(-), O(x), U(-), N(x), D(x)  
→ Word must contain S (but not in position 1) and must contain U (but not in position 3) and does NOT contain O, N, D.

Collecting constraints:

- Required letters: S and U  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- U cannot be in position 3  
- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, E, O, N, D  

Letters still usable: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels still usable: only U (since A, E, I, O are out).  
So the word must contain U and at least one other vowel? Actually, only U remains, so every vowel slot must be U or nothing, but we already know U is present.

The word has 5 letters, contains S and U, and must use only the allowed consonants and U.

Let’s look for positions:
S must be in 2, 3, or 5  
U must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5  

Possible overlaps: S and U could be in 2 and 5 or 5 and 2, etc.

Also, we want common letters to maximize info. Let’s try a word that shifts both S and U to new positions and introduces new common consonants like T, L, C, H, M, etc.

A good candidate:  
- S in position 2  
- U in position 4  
- Common consonants for the others: T, L, etc.

Consider ""TULSY"" – but Y may be less common.  

Consider ""PLUSH"" – but H and P are okay, and it uses S and U in new positions:
- P(allowed)  
- L(allowed)  
- U(position 3, but feedback said U cannot be in position 3 from SOUND)  
→ Invalid because U would be in position 3.

Next: ""LUSTY"" – uses L, U, S, T, Y  
- S is in 4 → was forbidden in position 4 from first guess (RAISE: S in 4 was -, but that meant S was in word but not in 4, so 4 is forbidden)  
→ S in 4 is invalid.

Next: ""MUSTY"" – S in 5, U in 2  
Letters: M, U, S, T, Y  
All allowed letters, and:
- S is in position 5 (allowed: positions 2,3,5)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed: 1,2,4,5)  
- No forbidden letters used.

This seems optimal. Let’s go with MUSTY.

T(x) – T is NOT in the word  
Y(✓) – Y is in the word AND in the correct position (namely, position 5)

So far we have:
- Letters fixed so far:  
  – pos 2 = U  
  – pos 3 = S  
  – pos 5 = Y  
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, E, O, N, D, M, T  
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the known present ones (U, S, Y are already placed).

We still need letters for positions 1 and 4 from the remaining allowed letters.

A quick check of the remaining letters:
We want common English letters that fit: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Among these, the most common consonants are C, F, G, H, L, P, V, etc.

Words like:  
- BUSKY → B is allowed, K is allowed, but we have no K yet.  
- CUSHY → C, H allowed → CUSHY is a valid English word.  
- GUSHY, LUSHY, PUSHY, RUSHY are also words, but R is forbidden.

So possible candidates with the pattern ?_U_S_Y:

CUSKY – but “CUSKY” isn’t a common English word.  
CUSHY – valid word, letters C and H are allowed.  
GUSHY – G is allowed.  
FUSKY – not a word.  
PUSKY – not a word.  
LUSHY – L is allowed, and “LUSHY” is a valid word.

Between CUSHY, GUSHY, LUSHY, the most common and likely in word-lists is CUSHY.

Let’s run a quick check:

C – not yet excluded.  
U – fixed at 2 ✓  
S – fixed at 3 ✓

Let's merge all feedback so far into a single picture.

Known pattern so far:  
_ U S _ Y

Letters fixed:  
- Position 2 = U  
- Position 3 = S  
- Position 5 = Y  

Letters that are definitely absent:  
R, A, I, E, O, N, D, M, T, C  

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

From Guess 4 we learned:  
H(-)  → H is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).  
Since H can’t go in 4, it must be in position 1.

So the word must be:  
H U S _ Y  

Only position 4 is left. Allowed letters for position 4 (from the list above) are:  
B, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

Among these, the only letter that forms a valid English 5-letter word is L → HUSLY?  No.  
K → HUSKY → common word.  
G → HUSGY?  Not a word.  
Hence the only plausible candidate is HUSKY.
