For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gained about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters to test their presence in the secret word.

One popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests for three vowels and two common consonants. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TIRED feedback)
- Only positions 1, 3, 5 are possible for R (but it can’t be in 3 either because it was in 3 and marked “-”), so R must be in 1 or 5.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (position 1) – x → A is NOT in the word.
- R (position 2) – - → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O (position 3) – x → O is NOT in the word.
- S (position 4) – x → S is NOT in the word.
- E (position 5) – - → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:

- Letters NOT present: A, O, S  
- Letters present but misplaced: R and E  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- E cannot be in position 5  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E somewhere (but not in their excluded positions),
2. Does not use A, O, or S,
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (like T, I, N, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TIRED”:
- T, I, D are fresh letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was excluded from position 5).

Let’s try it.

2. TIRED → T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Absent letters: T, I, D
   - Present letters: R (in word, not position 3), E (correct position 4)

Summary so far:
- Word contains: R and E (E is fixed at position 4)
- Definitely absent: A, O, S, T, I, D
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TIRED feedback)
- Only positions 1, 3, 5 are possible for R (but it can’t be in 3 either because it was in 3 and marked “-”), so R must be in 1 or 5.
- Positions 1,2,3,5 still need letters, with many common letters already ruled out.

We need 5-letter words that:
- Have E in position 4
- Have R exactly once, in position 1 or 5
- Use only letters not yet excluded (no A O S T I D)

Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, U, Y
Vowels left: E (already fixed), U, Y (sometimes)

Let’s look for a word with R in 1 or 5 and E in 4.

Candidate lists:
- R _ _ E _
- _ _ _ E R

Try R _ _ E _ : possible letters left for positions 2,3,5: N, L, C, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, U, Y.

A good high-frequency triple is N, C, H → “R N C E H” → RNCEH is not a word.

Next try: R U N E _ → RUNEH not a word.

Try _ _ _ E R: need three-letter prefix with unused letters and ending in ER.

Possible: “C H E E R” – CHEER
- C, H, E, E, R – uses E twice (valid), R at 5 (allowed), letters C, H not yet tested.

Let’s verify:
- C, H not excluded
- R in position 5 (good)
- E in position 4 (good)
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (A, O, S, T, I, D)

CHEER fits all constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gained about the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters to test their presence in the secret word.

One popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and tests for three vowels and two common consonants. This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (position 1) – x → A is NOT in the word.
- R (position 2) – - → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O (position 3) – x → O is NOT in the word.
- S (position 4) – x → S is NOT in the word.
- E (position 5) – - → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:

- Letters NOT present: A, O, S  
- Letters present but misplaced: R and E  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- E cannot be in position 5  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E somewhere (but not in their excluded positions),
2. Does not use A, O, or S,
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (like T, I, N, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TIRED”:
- T, I, D are fresh letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was excluded from position 5).

Let’s try it.

<guess>TIRED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two prior guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Absent letters: A, O, S
   - Present but misplaced: R (not in position 2), E (not in position 5)

2. TIRED → T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Absent letters: T, I, D
   - Present letters: R (in word, not position 3), E (correct position 4)

Summary so far:
- Word contains: R and E (E is fixed at position 4)
- Definitely absent: A, O, S, T, I, D
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TIRED feedback)
- Only positions 1, 3, 5 are possible for R (but it can’t be in 3 either because it was in 3 and marked “-”), so R must be in 1 or 5.
- Positions 1,2,3,5 still need letters, with many common letters already ruled out.

We need 5-letter words that:
- Have E in position 4
- Have R exactly once, in position 1 or 5
- Use only letters not yet excluded (no A O S T I D)

Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, U, Y
Vowels left: E (already fixed), U, Y (sometimes)

Let’s look for a word with R in 1 or 5 and E in 4.

Candidate lists:
- R _ _ E _
- _ _ _ E R

Try R _ _ E _ : possible letters left for positions 2,3,5: N, L, C, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, U, Y.

A good high-frequency triple is N, C, H → “R N C E H” → RNCEH is not a word.

Next try: R U N E _ → RUNEH not a word.

Try _ _ _ E R: need three-letter prefix with unused letters and ending in ER.

Possible: “C H E E R” – CHEER
- C, H, E, E, R – uses E twice (valid), R at 5 (allowed), letters C, H not yet tested.

Let’s verify:
- C, H not excluded
- R in position 5 (good)
- E in position 4 (good)
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (A, O, S, T, I, D)

CHEER fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: CHEER -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three prior guesses we now know:

Letters that are **in** the secret word (positions fixed or constrained):
- E is exactly at position 4.
- R is exactly at position 5.

Letters that are **not** in the word:  
A, O, S, T, I, D, C, H.

So the word has the pattern:
_ _ _ E R

We still need three different letters for positions 1, 2 and 3.  
These letters must:
- not appear in the “absent” list above  
- not already be fixed (only E and R are fixed)  
- be distinct if possible (no extra repeats unless proven).

Remaining high-frequency consonants: N, L, G, M, P, B, F, K, U, Y  
Vowels: none left to add (only E is allowed and already placed).

Among 5-letter words ending in “E R”, common ones with the remaining letters include:
- N E V E R – but V not excluded, but “NEVER” uses N, E, V, E, R.  
  Check: N, V, E are acceptable (V hasn’t been ruled out).  
  Pattern fits: _ _ _ E R → N E V E R → positions: N(1) E(2) V(3) E(4) R(5)

All letters used (N, E, V, E, R) are consistent with current constraints.

Let’s try NEVER.

<guess>NEVER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIRED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: CHEER -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: NEVER -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

- Pattern so far: _ _ _ E R  (E at 4, R at 5)
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, T, I, D, C, H, N, V
- Therefore the first three positions must be chosen from the remaining available letters:
  B, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, and vowels U and Y (only E is already in the word)
- Among common 5-letter English words that end in “ER”, the only letters still allowed for positions 1-3 are:
  B, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y (plus any other single occurrence vowel we haven’t used).

Looking for words that fit _ _ _ER and use only the allowed letters:
- L, U, B → LUBER (not a word)
- F, U, M → FUMER (valid word)
- G, L, U → GLUER (valid word)
- P, U, P → PUPER (invalid)
- B, U, M → BUMER (invalid)
- M, U, M → MUMER (invalid)
- F, U, M → FUMER is a real word meaning one who fumes.

FUMER fits every constraint: letters F, U, M, E, R; none of these letters (except E and R which are confirmed) have been marked absent. Pattern _ _ _ER holds.
