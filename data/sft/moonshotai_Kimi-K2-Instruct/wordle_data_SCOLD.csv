For the first guess, since I have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. 

Looking at English letter frequency, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, U, etc. A good starting word should use several of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 3 is O
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) — so S is somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere but not in position 4
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E

Next, we want a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Uses S in a new position
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated (like L, I, N, T, U, etc.)

Good candidates:
- FOIST (F O I S T) – but F is less common
- TOUCH (T O U C H) – no S
- SOILS – repeats S, and S would still be in position 1 or 4
- NOISY – but ends in Y, which is less common
- LOINS – uses L, I, N, S and keeps O in position 2 (but O must be in position 3)
- POINT – P, I, N, T with O in position 2 (wrong position for O)
- COINS – C, O, I, N, S with O in position 2 (wrong position for O)

Wait, remembering O must be in position 3, the word is _ _ O _ _

Good candidates:
- TOONS – T O O N S, but has double O
- FOIST – F O I S T – S is in position 4 (which was S's original position, but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, so position 4 is allowed since it's different from original position 4)
- LOINS – L O I N S – S in position 5
- COINS – C O I N S – S in position 5
- HOIST – H O I S T – S in position 4

""TOUCH"" doesn't use S, so we should prioritize using S to confirm its placement.

Between FOIST, LOINS, COINS, HOIST:
- FOIST: F is less common
- LOINS: uses L, I, N, S
- COINS: uses C, I, N, S
- HOIST: uses H, I, S, T

""LOINS"" seems good – it uses L, I, N, S with O in position 2 (but O must be in position 3). Wait, no – LOINS is L O I N S, so O is position 2, which violates the O must be in position 3.

Correct structure is _ _ O _ _

So:
- T O _ _ _ – no, O must be third
- _ _ O _ _

Possible words:
- FOIST: F O I S T – O is position 2 (no)
- HOIST: H O I S T – O is position 2 (no)
- COINS: C O I N S – O is position 2 (no)
- LOINS: L O I N S – O is position 2 (no)

I need to choose a word with O in position 3.

Examples:
- _ _ O _ _
- C _ O _ _? Not helpful
- S _ O _ _? But S is in the word somewhere
- _ S O _ _? Maybe
- _ _ O S _? Maybe
- _ _ O _ S? Maybe

Let's try to pick a word with O in position 3 and S in a new position.

Common 5-letter words with O in third:

- ABOVE – A, R out
- ADORE – A, R, E out
- AGONY – A out
- AMONG – A out
- AVOID – A, R, E out, and V is less common
- BLOWN – B, L, W, N

- SOUND – S, U, N, D
- SOUTH – S, U, T, H
- TOUCH – T, U, C, H
- TOWER – T, W, E out, R out
- VOICE – V, I, C, E out
- WORSE – W, R, S, E out
- YOUTH – Y, U, T, H

From these, words with O in position 3 and S in the word:

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
→ O is in position 3  
→ S is in the word but not in position 4  
→ Eliminate A, R, E

Round 2: SOUND  
S(✓) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(✓)  
→ S is now fixed in position 1  
→ O must be in the word but is **not** in position 2 (it must be in position 3, which is already known, so this just re-affirms the earlier O placement)  
→ U and N are out  
→ D is fixed in position 5  

So far we have the pattern:  
S _ O _ D  

Letters still available (no A, R, E, U, N):  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, O (but O is already used in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ O _ D.

Possible middle letters (position 2 and 4) must be from the remaining consonants and vowels, and the word must be valid.

Looking at common English patterns:
- S _ O _ D
Position 2: any consonant or vowel except O, A, R, E, U, N  
Position 4: any consonant or vowel except O, A, R, E, U, N

Likely candidates:
- S P O O D – but double O may not be allowed, and O is already used once
- S L O I D – I is allowed
- S L O B D – not a word
- S L O G D – not a word
- S C O U D – U is out
- S C O L D – C, O, L, D – fits: S C O L D

""S C O L D"" is a valid English word and fits the pattern S _ O _ D with letters we haven't ruled out.

Let's check:
- S in position 1: ✓ (known)
- C: new letter, not eliminated
- O in position 3: ✓ (known)
- L: new letter, not eliminated
- D in position 5: ✓ (known)

Thus, ""SCOLD"" is the most logical next guess.
