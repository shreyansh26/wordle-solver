For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good starting word should ideally:
1. Use 5 distinct letters
2. Include several of these common letters
3. Not repeat any letters (to maximize letter coverage)

Popular and effective first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the top 7 most common letters (S, L, A, T, E), gives good coverage of vowels and consonants, and has no repeating letters.

From the three rounds so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ S fixed in position 1, T is somewhere else.

2. STING → S(✓) T(✓) I(x) N(✓) G(x)  
   ⇒ S in 1, T in 2, N in 4.

3. STUNK → S(✓) T(✓) U(x) N(✓) K(x)  
   ⇒ Confirms S T _ N _ and rules out U and K.

Thus the pattern is:  
S T ? N ?

Letters already eliminated: L, A, E, I, G, U, K  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, H, M, P, R, V, W, Y  
Available vowels: O (only remaining vowel left)

Therefore the missing letters (positions 3 and 5) must both be consonants, with at least one being O to supply a vowel.

But O is a vowel and is not yet ruled out. Let’s consider O for position 3 or 5.

Possible words fitting S T _ N _ :

- STONE → has O and E, but E is ruled out.  
- STONY → Y okay, O okay, N already used.  
- STAND → A ruled out.  
- STENO → E ruled out.  
- STENOPE → too long.  
- STROP → P okay, O okay. Pattern S T R O P – but we only have 5 letters and position 5 must be the last letter. Actually, STROP would be S T R O P, which doesn’t fit S T _ N _ (N is position 4).  

Let me list letters we have:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: S T ? N ?

Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, M, O, P, R, V, W, Y, and none of L,A,E,I,G,U,K

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 5, or O in either since O is a vowel.

Looking for common combinations:

STON_ → next letter must be consonant not used yet. STONE has E (out), STONK has K (out), STONY has Y (valid).  
STONY – S T O N Y: letters S,T,O,N,Y. All allowed.

Another possibility is STRO_ but we need N in 4, so S T R O N would be STRON, which is not a recognized word.  

Similarly, S T R I N → I is out.  

STONP? No.  

STONB? STONB is not a word.  

STON? Only STONY seems valid.

Thus the only viable option fitting all constraints appears to be STONY.

Let me verify:

STONY  
Letters: S,T,O,N,Y.  
- S ✓ position 1  
- T ✓ position 2  
- N ✓ position 4  
- O and Y are both allowed (not in banned list)  
- No banned letters (L,A,E,I,G,U,K) present  
- Real word meaning “covered in stones” or “showing no emotion”
