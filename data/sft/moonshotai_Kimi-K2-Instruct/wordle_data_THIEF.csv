For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many unique common letters as possible. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, giving us maximum feedback about letter presence and positions.

- T is not 3rd
- I is not 4th

- T in 1st position (allowed)
- W is new and allowed
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- C is new and allowed
- E in 5th position - but E can't be 5th (invalid)

Next: ""TWINE"" - but N is eliminated.

How about ""WHITE"":
- W is new
- H is new
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- T in 4th position (allowed)
- E in 5th position (invalid)

Let's try ""CITED"":
- C is new

""EDICT"":
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- D is new
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- C is new
- T in 5th position (allowed)
This contains E, I, T with no position violations and no eliminated letters.

Let's verify:
- Letters used: E, D, I, C, T

- E is in 1st (not 5th)
- T is in 5th (not 3rd)

Collecting the constraints so far:

Letters completely OUT: A, R, O, S, U, N, D, C  
Letters definitely IN: I (and we also know E and T are in the word but their positions are still unsettled).

I is already locked into position 3 (✓).

Positions we now know:  
- E is NOT in 1st or 5th (from AROSE and EDICT feedback)  
- T is NOT in 3rd or 5th (from UNTIE and EDICT feedback)  

So E must be in 2nd or 4th.  
T must be in 1st, 2nd or 4th.  
The word must contain both E and T.

We need two more consonants from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A promising pattern: put E in 2nd, T somewhere else, and fill the remaining slots with high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s try:
_ E _ _ T → needs I in 3rd → _ E I _ T  
The word would look like **? E I ? T**

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many unique common letters as possible. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, giving us maximum feedback about letter presence and positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE we learned:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x feedback).
- E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (- feedback).

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Must contain E, but E is not the last letter.

We now choose a new guess that:
1. Does not use any already-eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).
2. Uses E somewhere other than the 5th slot.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, etc.
Let’s pick a word with E plus four other new common letters.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th slot (so it’s not at the end).
- Uses U, N, T, I — all common and still possible.
- No A, R, O, S, so compatible with feedback.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's process the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S
   - Letter E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position

   - Letters NOT in the word at all: U, N
   - Letter T is in the word, but NOT in the 3rd position
   - Letter I is in the word, but NOT in the 4th position
   - Letter E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position (confirmed again)

So the word must:
- Contain E (but not in position 5)
- Contain T (but not in position 3)
- Contain I (but not in position 4)
- NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N

Remaining possible letters (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word using:
- Definitely E, T, I
- Plus two other letters from the allowed set
- E not in 5th position
- T not in 3rd position
- I not in 4th position

Looking for common patterns, ""ELITE"" comes to mind, but it has I in 4th (invalid) and uses E in 5th (invalid). 

Let's try ""ETHIC"":
- E is in 1st position (allowed)
- T is in 2nd position (allowed, since it can't be 3rd)
- H is new and allowed
- I is in 4th position - but this is invalid (from feedback I can't be in 4th)
  
Next try: ""TILED""
- T in 1st position (allowed)
- I in 2nd position (allowed)
- L is new and allowed
- E in 4th position (allowed)
- D is new and allowed
But we don't know if D or L are in the word yet.

Actually, we need to ensure the word contains E, T, I. Let's construct carefully:

- T is not 3rd
- I is not 4th

A good candidate: ""TWEED"" - but this doesn't contain I.

Another: ""TWICE""

- W is new and allowed
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- C is new and allowed

""EDICT"":

- D is new
- I in 3rd position (allowed)

This contains E, I, T with no position violations and no eliminated letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many unique common letters as possible. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, giving us maximum feedback about letter presence and positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE we learned:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all (x feedback).
- E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (- feedback).

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Must contain E, but E is not the last letter.

We now choose a new guess that:
1. Does not use any already-eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).
2. Uses E somewhere other than the 5th slot.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, etc.
Let’s pick a word with E plus four other new common letters.

A balanced choice is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E in the 4th slot (so it’s not at the end).
- Uses U, N, T, I — all common and still possible.
- No A, R, O, S, so compatible with feedback.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's process the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S
   - Letter E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word at all: U, N
   - Letter T is in the word, but NOT in the 3rd position
   - Letter I is in the word, but NOT in the 4th position
   - Letter E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position (confirmed again)

So the word must:
- Contain E (but not in position 5)
- Contain T (but not in position 3)
- Contain I (but not in position 4)
- NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, N

Remaining possible letters (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word using:
- Definitely E, T, I
- Plus two other letters from the allowed set
- E not in 5th position
- T not in 3rd position
- I not in 4th position

Looking for common patterns, ""ELITE"" comes to mind, but it has I in 4th (invalid) and uses E in 5th (invalid). 

Let's try ""ETHIC"":
- E is in 1st position (allowed)
- T is in 2nd position (allowed, since it can't be 3rd)
- H is new and allowed
- I is in 4th position - but this is invalid (from feedback I can't be in 4th)
  
Next try: ""TILED""
- T in 1st position (allowed)
- I in 2nd position (allowed)
- L is new and allowed
- E in 4th position (allowed)
- D is new and allowed
But we don't know if D or L are in the word yet.

Actually, we need to ensure the word contains E, T, I. Let's construct carefully:
We need positions where:
- E is not 5th
- T is not 3rd
- I is not 4th

A good candidate: ""TWEED"" - but this doesn't contain I.

Another: ""TWICE""
- T in 1st position (allowed)
- W is new and allowed
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- C is new and allowed
- E in 5th position - but E can't be 5th (invalid)

Next: ""TWINE"" - but N is eliminated.

How about ""WHITE"":
- W is new
- H is new
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- T in 4th position (allowed)
- E in 5th position (invalid)

Let's try ""CITED"":
- C is new
- I in 2nd position (allowed)
- T in 3rd position - but T can't be 3rd (invalid)

""EDICT"":
- E in 1st position (allowed)
- D is new
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- C is new
- T in 5th position (allowed)
This contains E, I, T with no position violations and no eliminated letters.

Let's verify:
- Letters used: E, D, I, C, T
- None of A, R, O, S, U, N are present
- E is in 1st (not 5th)
- T is in 5th (not 3rd)
- I is in 3rd (not 4th)

<guess>EDICT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) E(-)
Guess 3: EDICT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) D(x) I(✓) C(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Collecting the constraints so far:

Letters completely OUT: A, R, O, S, U, N, D, C  
Letters definitely IN: I (and we also know E and T are in the word but their positions are still unsettled).

I is already locked into position 3 (✓).

Positions we now know:  
- E is NOT in 1st or 5th (from AROSE and EDICT feedback)  
- T is NOT in 3rd or 5th (from UNTIE and EDICT feedback)  

So E must be in 2nd or 4th.  
T must be in 1st, 2nd or 4th.  
The word must contain both E and T.

We need two more consonants from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A promising pattern: put E in 2nd, T somewhere else, and fill the remaining slots with high-frequency consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s try:
_ E _ _ T → needs I in 3rd → _ E I _ T  
The word would look like **? E I ? T**

Good consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
We still need a first and fourth letter.

A very common 5-letter word fitting this mold is **HEIST**  
- H is allowed  
- E in 2nd (allowed)  
- I in 3rd (exactly what we know)  
- S is already eliminated → HEIST is invalid (contains S)

Next simplest: **FEINT**  
- F, N – but N is out → invalid

**PIETY**  
- P, Y allowed, but T is already required and we don’t know about Y yet; however Y is allowed.

**PIETY** has:
P(allowed), I(✓ in 3rd), E(allowed in 2nd), T(allowed in 4th), Y(allowed).  
But E is in 2nd, T in 4th – no conflicts.

Let’s choose **PIETY**.

Positions check:
1 P allowed  
2 E allowed (not 1st/5th)  
3 I ✓  
4 T allowed (not 3rd/5th)  
5 Y allowed  

Contains I in 3rd, plus both E and T as required, no forbidden letters.

Letters known to be IN the word (but positions still partly open):
- I (from Guess 3: I(✓) at position 3, and Guess 4 shows I(-) which only confirms I is not in position 2)
- E (multiple “-” hints: not 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th → E must be 2nd)
- T (multiple “-” hints: not 3rd, 4th, 5th, and now Guess 4 shows T(-) which adds “not 4th” again)

So the emerging fixed layout is:
1 ?  2 E  3 I  4 ?  5 T

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4 (from remaining alphabet):
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two distinct consonants from that set, one for position 1 and one for position 4.

Common English 5-letter words matching the pattern _ E I _ T:

- FEINT  – N is OUT
- HEIST – S is OUT
- BEIGE – uses G and another E (E already placed)
- VEILT – not a real word
- WEIGT – not valid
- LEGIT – L and G are both allowed, and LEGIT is a valid English word
  – L in 1st, E 2nd, I 3rd, G 4th, T 5th
  – All letters still allowed, no conflicts.

After Guess 5 (LEGIT → L(x) E(-) G(x) I(-) T(-)) we now know:

Letters completely OUT (x feedback):
A, R, O, S, U, N, D, C, P, Y, L, G

Letters known to be in the word (all from “-” feedback):
• E – cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → must be in position 2  
• I – cannot be in positions 3, 4 → must be in position 1 or 2 or 5  
  (but position 2 is now fixed for E, so I must be 1st or 5th)  
• T – cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 → must be 1st or 2nd  
  (but 2nd is E, so T must be 1st)

Current forced template:
1 T  2 E  3 ?  4 ?  5 ?   and I must appear exactly once in positions 1-5;
since T and E already occupy 1 and 2, I must be in position 5.

Therefore the pattern is:
T E _ _ I

Remaining letters allowed for positions 3 and 4 (all consonants not yet ruled out):
B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two distinct consonants from that set.

Looking for common English 5-letter words matching TE _ _ I:

- TEBRI – not valid  
- TEMPI – valid (T E M P I)  
  – M and P are still allowed.

Check constraints:
- Letters used: T, E, M, P, I  
- All letters not in the “OUT” list.  
- Positions satisfy all prior feedback.

Hence, TEMPI is a valid next guess.
