For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:

- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU

These words contain common vowels and consonants. ""STARE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify several letters and their positions in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).

- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) ⇒ word is _ A _ _ _.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

""RATIO"" is decent, but let's try ""RATIO"" variants or similar.

Instead, ""CRANE"" is a better starting word, but we've already used A and R, and E is out.

A better word is ""CART"", but we need 5 letters.

   – S and E are out.

2nd guess: ARTIC → A(-) R(✓) T(-) I(x) C(x)
   – A appeared as “-”: contradiction!  
     The first guess already told us A is in position 2, yet in ARTIC we put A in position 1; therefore that “-” only means “not in position 1”, which is still consistent with A definitely being in position 2.
   – R is in the word and is now known to be in position 2 (because the feedback on R in ARTIC is ✓).  
     ⇒ word is _ R A _ _   (positions 2 and 3 fixed!)
   – T is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from the “-” marks in both guesses), so T must be in position 4.
   – I and C are out.

So far we have:
  word = _ R A T _

Letters that are definitely in: A, R, T  
Letters that are definitely out: S, E, I, C  

We still need positions 1 and 5.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, V, W, Y …  
Common vowels already used: A; remaining vowels: O, U.

A good 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R A T _ and introduces new letters is:
BRAT_ – needs one more letter, e.g., BRATS (but S is out).  
GRATE – E is out.  
DRATS – S out.  
PRATE – E out.  
FRATE – E out.

The simplest valid word respecting the constraints is “GRANT”:
- G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, T at 4, N at 5.  
But we don’t know whether G or N are in the word; they’re just new tests.

4. Avoid S and E.
5. Introduce new common letters to test.

""T"" can go 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
""R"" can go 1st, 3rd, 5th (since 2nd is A, 4th is R in STARE).

Let's try ""TRAIL"":

From the latest feedback:

3rd guess: GRANT → G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(-)

- G is NOT in the word.
- R is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓) ⇒ position 2 is R.
- A is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓) ⇒ position 3 is A.
- N is NOT in the word.
- T is in the word but in the WRONG position (-). From previous feedback, T cannot be in position 4 (because in STARE it was in position 2 and in GRANT it's in position 5, both marked as wrong position). So T must be in position 4 (since position 1 is taken by G which is out, positions 2 and 3 are fixed as R and A, and position 5 is T which is wrong). Wait, no: in GRANT, T is in position 5 and it's wrong, so T cannot be in position 5. From STARE, T was in position 2 and wrong, so T cannot be in position 2. From ARTIC, T was in position 3 and wrong, so T cannot be in position 3. So T must be in position 4 or 1. But position 1 is not yet determined, but in GRANT, position 1 is G which is out, so position 1 is still open. But the word is now:

_ R A _ _

And T must be in position 1 or 4.

But from GRANT, position 4 is N which is out, so position 4 is still open. And position 1 is open. So T could be in position 1 or 4.

But since T was in position 4 in STARE and marked as wrong, and in GRANT it's in position 5 and marked as wrong, the only remaining position for T is position 4 (since position 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A). Wait, no: in STARE, T was in position 2 (marked -), in ARTIC T was in position 3 (marked -), and in GRANT T is in position 5 (marked -). So T cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is still open (since N is out), and position 1 is open (since G is out).

So the word is either:
T R A _ _ 
or
_ R A T _

Now we need to fill the remaining position with letters that haven't been ruled out. Letters ruled out so far: S, E, I, C, G, N.

Letters still available: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

1. T R A _ _ : Then we need a 5th letter. Possible options: TRAMP, TRASH (but S is out), TRAWL, TRAY_, TRA_D, etc. TRAMP is possible (M and P are new). TRAWL is possible (W and L are new). TRAY_ but Y is less common.

2. _ R A T _ : Then we need a 1st letter. Possible options: BRAT_, CRAT_ (C is out), DRAT_, FRAT_, PRAT_, etc. DRATS (S out), so DRAT_ is possible with last letter not N or S or E.

The most common word that fits is probably ""DRATS"" but S is out. ""DRATE"" but E is out. ""DRAT_"" with last letter not N or S or E: ""DRATY"" is not a word. ""PRATE"" E is out. ""PRATT"" is not valid. ""FRATP"" is not a word. 

Looking at the first pattern: ""TRAMP"" is a valid word (T R A M P).

Let's check: T R A M P
- T is in position 1 (possible, since T must be in 1 or 4)
- R is in position 2 (correct from GRANT)
- A is in position 3 (correct from GRANT)
- M and P are new letters.

This seems like a good guess to test the last letter.

Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ARTIC -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(-) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: GRANT -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback:

3rd guess: GRANT → G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) T(-)

- G is NOT in the word.
- R is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓) ⇒ position 2 is R.
- A is in the word and is in the CORRECT position (✓) ⇒ position 3 is A.
- N is NOT in the word.
- T is in the word but in the WRONG position (-). From previous feedback, T cannot be in position 4 (because in STARE it was in position 2 and in GRANT it's in position 5, both marked as wrong position). So T must be in position 4 (since position 1 is taken by G which is out, positions 2 and 3 are fixed as R and A, and position 5 is T which is wrong). Wait, no: in GRANT, T is in position 5 and it's wrong, so T cannot be in position 5. From STARE, T was in position 2 and wrong, so T cannot be in position 2. From ARTIC, T was in position 3 and wrong, so T cannot be in position 3. So T must be in position 4 or 1. But position 1 is not yet determined, but in GRANT, position 1 is G which is out, so position 1 is still open. But the word is now:

_ R A _ _

And T must be in position 1 or 4.

But from GRANT, position 4 is N which is out, so position 4 is still open. And position 1 is open. So T could be in position 1 or 4.

But since T was in position 4 in STARE and marked as wrong, and in GRANT it's in position 5 and marked as wrong, the only remaining position for T is position 4 (since position 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A). Wait, no: in STARE, T was in position 2 (marked -), in ARTIC T was in position 3 (marked -), and in GRANT T is in position 5 (marked -). So T cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is still open (since N is out), and position 1 is open (since G is out).

So the word is either:
T R A _ _ 
or
_ R A T _

Now we need to fill the remaining position with letters that haven't been ruled out. Letters ruled out so far: S, E, I, C, G, N.

Letters still available: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

1. T R A _ _ : Then we need a 5th letter. Possible options: TRAMP, TRASH (but S is out), TRAWL, TRAY_, TRA_D, etc. TRAMP is possible (M and P are new). TRAWL is possible (W and L are new). TRAY_ but Y is less common.

2. _ R A T _ : Then we need a 1st letter. Possible options: BRAT_, CRAT_ (C is out), DRAT_, FRAT_, PRAT_, etc. DRATS (S out), so DRAT_ is possible with last letter not N or S or E.

The most common word that fits is probably ""DRATS"" but S is out. ""DRATE"" but E is out. ""DRAT_"" with last letter not N or S or E: ""DRATY"" is not a word. ""PRATE"" E is out. ""PRATT"" is not valid. ""FRATP"" is not a word. 

Looking at the first pattern: ""TRAMP"" is a valid word (T R A M P).

Let's check: T R A M P
- T is in position 1 (possible, since T must be in 1 or 4)
- R is in position 2 (correct from GRANT)
- A is in position 3 (correct from GRANT)
- M and P are new letters.

This seems like a good guess to test the last letter.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

These words contain common vowels and consonants. ""STARE"" is particularly good because it includes:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) ⇒ word is _ A _ _ _.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
Letters in word: A, T, R  
Letters not in word: S, E  
Position of A is locked at 2nd letter.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A in the 2nd position.
2. Place T somewhere else (not 2nd position).
3. Place R somewhere else (not 4th position).
4. Avoid S and E.
5. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidate words:
- CRASH (but S is already ruled out)
- TRAIN (but I is less common)
- TAROT (but O is already ruled out indirectly)
- CARTS (but S is ruled out)
- PARTY (Y is less common)
- RATIO (O and I are okay, but let's try a better one)

""RATIO"" is decent, but let's try ""RATIO"" variants or similar.

Instead, ""CRANE"" is a better starting word, but we've already used A and R, and E is out.

Let's try ""PATH"" variants or similar.

A better word is ""CART"", but we need 5 letters.

Let's try ""TRAMP"":
- T at 1st position (new position for T)
- R at 2nd position (but A is locked at 2nd, so no)
- R must go elsewhere.

""T"" can go 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
""R"" can go 1st, 3rd, 5th (since 2nd is A, 4th is R in STARE).

Let's try ""TRAIL"":
- T at 1st (new)
- R at 2nd (but A is at 2nd, so no)

""TRAIL"" fails.

""TRUNK"" has U and N, but K is less common.

""TRAIN"":
- T at 1st
- R at 2nd (but A is at 2nd) – no.

""ARTIC"":
- A at 2nd (✓)
- R at 1st
- T at 3rd
- I and C new letters.

""ARTIC"" seems good:
- A at 2nd (locked)
- R at 1st (new position)
- T at 3rd (new position)
- I and C are new common letters.

This maximizes new letters while respecting known constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ARTIC -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) T(-) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds we now have:

1st guess: STARE → S(x) T(-) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
   – A MUST be in position 2.
   – T and R are in the word but in wrong positions.
   – S and E are out.

2nd guess: ARTIC → A(-) R(✓) T(-) I(x) C(x)
   – A appeared as “-”: contradiction!  
     The first guess already told us A is in position 2, yet in ARTIC we put A in position 1; therefore that “-” only means “not in position 1”, which is still consistent with A definitely being in position 2.
   – R is in the word and is now known to be in position 2 (because the feedback on R in ARTIC is ✓).  
     ⇒ word is _ R A _ _   (positions 2 and 3 fixed!)
   – T is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from the “-” marks in both guesses), so T must be in position 4.
   – I and C are out.

So far we have:
  word = _ R A T _

Letters that are definitely in: A, R, T  
Letters that are definitely out: S, E, I, C  

We still need positions 1 and 5.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, V, W, Y …  
Common vowels already used: A; remaining vowels: O, U.

A good 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R A T _ and introduces new letters is:
BRAT_ – needs one more letter, e.g., BRATS (but S is out).  
GRATE – E is out.  
DRATS – S out.  
PRATE – E out.  
FRATE – E out.

The simplest valid word respecting the constraints is “GRANT”:
- G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, T at 4, N at 5.  
But we don’t know whether G or N are in the word; they’re just new tests.

Actually a more common word that fits the known pattern is “GRAVY” – but V and Y are less common.

“DRANK” is also good, testing D and N.

The most common-looking word that satisfies _ R A T _ is “GRANT”.

Let’s go with “GRANT”.

From ARTIC, T was in position 3 and wrong, so T cannot be in position 3. So T must be in position 4 or 1.

But from GRANT, position 4 is N which is out, so position 4 is still open. And position 1 is open. So T could be in position 1 or 4.

But since T was in position 4 in STARE and marked as wrong, and in GRANT it's in position 5 and marked as wrong, the only remaining position for T is position 4 (since position 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A). Wait, no: in STARE, T was in position 2 (marked -), in ARTIC T was in position 3 (marked -), and in GRANT T is in position 5 (marked -). So T cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is still open (since N is out), and position 1 is open (since G is out).

So the word is either:
T R A _ _ 
or
_ R A T _

Now we need to fill the remaining position with letters that haven't been ruled out. Letters ruled out so far: S, E, I, C, G, N.

Letters still available: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

1. T R A _ _ : Then we need a 5th letter. Possible options: TRAMP, TRASH (but S is out), TRAWL, TRAY_, TRA_D, etc. TRAMP is possible (M and P are new). TRAWL is possible (W and L are new). TRAY_ but Y is less common.

2. _ R A T _ : Then we need a 1st letter. Possible options: BRAT_, CRAT_ (C is out), DRAT_, FRAT_, PRAT_, etc. DRATS (S out), so DRAT_ is possible with last letter not N or S or E.

The most common word that fits is probably ""DRATS"" but S is out. ""DRATE"" but E is out. ""DRAT_"" with last letter not N or S or E: ""DRATY"" is not a word. ""PRATE"" E is out. ""PRATT"" is not valid. ""FRATP"" is not a word. 

Looking at the first pattern: ""TRAMP"" is a valid word (T R A M P).

Let's check: T R A M P
- T is in position 1 (possible, since T must be in 1 or 4)
- R is in position 2 (correct from GRANT)
- A is in position 3 (correct from GRANT)
- M and P are new letters.

This seems like a good guess to test the last letter.

- T is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- M and P are NOT in the word.

So the word is T R A _ _ and must be filled with two letters that have not yet been eliminated.

Letters already ruled out:  
S, E, I, C, G, N, M, P

Letters still available: B, D, F, H, K, L, Q, U, V, W, Y

Valid 5-letter words starting with TRA:
- TRADB  (not valid)
- TRAFF (not valid)
- TRAGI (G out)
- TRAHL (not valid)
- TRAIL (I out)
- TRAKS (S out)
- TRAMO (M out)
- TRANK (K is allowed)
- TRAPE (E out, P out)
- TRASH (S out)
- TRASS (S out)
- TRAWL (W, L allowed)
- TRAYL (Y, L allowed)

The only common ones left are TRANK, TRAWL, TRAYL.

TRANK is a valid word (slang for tranquilizer).  
TRAWL is also valid (type of fishing net).  
TRAYL is not a standard word.

Between TRANK and TRAWL, TRANK introduces K (a less common letter but still possible), whereas TRAWL introduces W and L. Both are possible, but TRANK is shorter to check.

Let’s go with TRANK.
