For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I. 

A common recommendation is ""SLATE"" because it covers these frequent consonants and vowels. Another good option is ""RAISE"". 

I've decided to go with ""RAISE"" as it includes:
- R: Very common letter
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another common vowel
- S: Very common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

- A and S and T and D are definitely *not* in the word.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters we now **know** are in the word:
   - I at position 2.
   - E at position 4.
   - R at position 5.

   Current pattern: _ I _ E R

2. Letters we **know** are **not** in the word:
   A, S, T, D, B (also from earlier guesses).

3. From Guess 3 (BINER) we see:
   - N is in the word but **not** in position 3.

So N must be in position 1 (since positions 2, 4, 5 are already filled).

That gives us: N I _ E R

The only slot left is position 3. The missing letter must be a consonant not yet used or ruled out (options: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.).

Looking at common English five-letter words ending in “N I ? E R”, the only straightforward candidate that fits is N I C E R (using C in position 3).

Let’s verify:
- N is allowed in position 1.
- C has not been tested yet.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- R is confirmed in position 5.

No conflicts with any prior feedback.
