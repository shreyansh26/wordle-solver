For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information about the secret word. A good starting strategy is to use words that contain frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good balance of consonants and vowels, maximizing the chance of hitting letters in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on “SLATE”:

- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word but not in position 4
- E is not in the word

So we now know:
- The word has an A in the 3rd position.
- It contains S and T somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively).
- It does not contain L or E.

A good next guess should keep the known A in place, use S and T in different positions, and avoid L and E. A candidate word that fits: “STAIR”.

But let’s check:
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is now in position 1 (OK, allowed since previous S was not in position 1)
- T is now in position 2 (allowed since previous T was not in position 4)
- Letters used: S, T, A, I, R — none of which are L or E.

However, this might not be optimal because S is in position 1, and we know S is in the word but not in position 1. So placing it in position 1 again is redundant.

Instead, let’s try a word that keeps A in position 3, moves S to position 2 or later, and uses T somewhere else. Consider “CHART” — but this has no S. We need S and T.

“TRASH”:
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since previous S was in position 1 and marked as just “in word”)
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since previous T was in position 4 and marked as just “in word”)
- Letters: T, R, A, S, H — no L or E.

This seems a good choice.

Another option: “STAND” — but A is in position 3 (✓), S in 1, T in 2, N and D new. But S is in position 1 again, which is redundant.

“TRASH” is better because it tests T in position 1 and S in position 4, giving more info.

Current known facts
- A is fixed in position 3.
- The word also contains S and T, but:
  – S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
  – T is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters not in the word: L, E, R, H.

Positions so far:

2: unknown, but not A, L, E, R, H
3: A (locked)
4: unknown, but not S, T, L, E, R, H
5: unknown, but not L, E, R, H

We still need to place S and T.  
Possible slots:
- S can only go in positions 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).
- T can only go in positions 2 or 5 (same exclusions).

That means both S and T must occupy positions 2 and 5, in some order.

Combining the remaining alphabet constraints, the valid letters for positions 1 and 4 are drawn from:
{B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any already ruled out.

Let’s try an arrangement that fills positions 1 and 4 with fresh letters while keeping S and T in 2 and 5:

Option 1:  
1 = B, 2 = S, 3 = A, 4 = C, 5 = T → BSACT  
Checks: S not in 1 or 4, T not in 1 or 4, and no disallowed letters.

Option 2:  
1 = C, 2 = T, 3 = A, 4 = N, 5 = S → CTANS  
Checks the same constraints.

Option 3:  
1 = P, 2 = S, 3 = A, 4 = N, 5 = T → PSANT

Among these, “PSANT” uses common letters and tests new consonants in positions 1 and 4. I’ll go with it.

- Letters not in the word: L, E, R, H.

Positions so far:
1: unknown, but not S, T, L, E, R, H
2: unknown, but not A, L, E, R, H
3: A (locked)
4: unknown, but not S, T, L, E, R, H
5: unknown, but not L, E, R, H

We still need to place S and T.  
Possible slots:
- S can only go in positions 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded).
- T can only go in positions 2 or 5 (same exclusions).

That means both S and T must occupy positions 2 and 5, in some order.

Combining the remaining alphabet constraints, the valid letters for positions 1 and 4 are drawn from:
{B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any already ruled out.

Let’s try an arrangement that fills positions 1 and 4 with fresh letters while keeping S and T in 2 and 5:

Option 1:  
1 = B, 2 = S, 3 = A, 4 = C, 5 = T → BSACT  
Checks: S not in 1 or 4, T not in 1 or 4, and no disallowed letters.

Option 2:  
1 = C, 2 = T, 3 = A, 4 = N, 5 = S → CTANS  
Checks the same constraints.

Option 3:  
1 = P, 2 = S, 3 = A, 4 = N, 5 = T → PSANT  
Also valid.

Among these, “PSANT” uses common letters and tests new consonants in positions 1 and 4. I’ll go with it.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

1. Position 3 is A (locked-in).

2. The word contains S, T, and A:
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from feedback on slate, trash, psant)
     → S must be in position 5.
   - T is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from slate, trash)  
     feedback on psant shows T in position 5 is correct (✓)
     → T is in position 5.
   - BUT both S and T cannot occupy position 5 simultaneously.  
   This means my interpretation of the feedback has an inconsistency.

Let me re-examine the feedback line by line:

Guess 1 slate:  
S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)  
→ S is in the word, wrong place (so NOT position 1)  
→ T is in the word, wrong place (so NOT position 4)  
→ A(✓) position 3

Guess 2 trash:  
T(-) R(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)  
→ T is in the word, wrong place (so NOT position 1)  
→ S is in the word, correct place (✓) position 4

Guess 3 psant:  
P(x) S(-) A(✓) N(x) T(✓)  
→ S is in the word, wrong place (so NOT position 2)  
→ T is in the word, correct place (✓) position 5

NOW the constraints are consistent:

- A in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 4 (✓) from trash
- T is in position 5 (✓) from psant
- Letters NOT present: L, E, R, H, P, N
- Still need valid letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining alphabet.

Valid remaining letters (excluding ruled-out ones) are:  
B C D F G I J K M O Q U V W X Y Z

We need two distinct letters from this set for positions 1 and 2.

Simple consonant–vowel pattern: try B and I.

Word form: _ _ A S T  
→ B I A S T → BIAST? Not a valid English word.  
→ B O A S T → BOAST (valid word)

Check letters: B, O not yet excluded, fits constraints.

So: BOAST
