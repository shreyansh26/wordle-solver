As this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. 

Common starting word strategies include:
1. Using words with many vowels (like ""audio"" or ""arise"")
2. Using words with common consonants (like ""stare"" or ""crane"")

I want to cover as many frequently used letters as possible. Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good balanced word that includes both vowels and common consonants is ""AROSE"". This covers:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

- Contains T, but T is not in the 2nd position (so T must be in 4th or 5th).
- Does not contain A, R, O, I, N.
- Already confirmed: S, E, T are in the word.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ E _ _ that contains T (not in position 2) and only uses letters we haven't ruled out.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O, I, N): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider possible positions for T:
- T could be in position 4: S _ E T _
- T could be in position 5: S _ E _ T

Let's think of common words fitting these patterns:
1. S _ E T _ : Words like ""sheet"", ""sweet"", ""sleet"", ""sheep"" (but we can't use I or N)
   - ""sheet"" uses H, E, E, T → has E already in position 3, and another E in position 4, but we know E is only confirmed in position 3. Could have multiple E's, but not confirmed.
   - ""sweet"" uses W, E, E, T → same issue with multiple E's.
   - ""swept"" uses W, E, P, T → P is a new letter, T in position 4.

2. S _ E _ T : Words like ""slept"", ""smelt"", ""spent"", ""sweet"" (but spent uses N which is ruled out)
   - ""slept"" uses L in position 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5 → fits all rules.
   - ""smelt"" uses M in position 2, E in 3, L in 4, T in 5 → also fits.

Between ""swept"" and ""slept""/""smelt"", ""slept"" seems more common and uses L which is a common letter we haven't tested yet.

Let me check:
- ""slept"": S (position 1 ✓), L (position 2), E (position 3 ✓), P (position 4), T (position 5)
   - T is allowed in position 5 (previously only excluded from position 2)
   - All letters are allowed (no A, R, O, I, N)
   - Tests P as a new letter

This seems like a good next guess.

- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Starts with S and has E in the 3rd position: S _ E _ _
- Contains T, but T is not in the 2nd position (so T must be in 4th or 5th).
- Does not contain A, R, O, I, N.
- Already confirmed: S, E, T are in the word.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ E _ _ that contains T (not in position 2) and only uses letters we haven't ruled out.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, O, I, N): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider possible positions for T:
- T could be in position 4: S _ E T _
- T could be in position 5: S _ E _ T

Let's think of common words fitting these patterns:
1. S _ E T _ : Words like ""sheet"", ""sweet"", ""sleet"", ""sheep"" (but we can't use I or N)
   - ""sheet"" uses H, E, E, T → has E already in position 3, and another E in position 4, but we know E is only confirmed in position 3. Could have multiple E's, but not confirmed.
   - ""sweet"" uses W, E, E, T → same issue with multiple E's.
   - ""swept"" uses W, E, P, T → P is a new letter, T in position 4.

2. S _ E _ T : Words like ""slept"", ""smelt"", ""spent"", ""sweet"" (but spent uses N which is ruled out)
   - ""slept"" uses L in position 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5 → fits all rules.
   - ""smelt"" uses M in position 2, E in 3, L in 4, T in 5 → also fits.

Between ""swept"" and ""slept""/""smelt"", ""slept"" seems more common and uses L which is a common letter we haven't tested yet.

Let me check:
- ""slept"": S (position 1 ✓), L (position 2), E (position 3 ✓), P (position 4), T (position 5)
   - T is allowed in position 5 (previously only excluded from position 2)
   - All letters are allowed (no A, R, O, I, N)
   - Tests P as a new letter

This seems like a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)  
   ⇒ A, R, O absent; S and E present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

2. stein → S(✓) T(-) E(✓) I(x) N(x)  
   ⇒ S is fixed at position 1, E at position 3.  
     T is present but NOT at position 2, and I, N are absent.

3. slept → S(✓) L(x) E(✓) P(x) T(✓)  
   ⇒ L and P are absent.  
     T is now fixed at position 5.

So the pattern is:
S _ E _ T  
with only positions 2 and 4 to fill, and letters to avoid: A, R, O, I, N, L, P.

Letters that could fill positions 2 and 4 (from common remaining letters):  
B C D F G H K M U V W Y, etc.

Common words matching S _ E _ T:
- SWEET – but W is allowed, yet we’d have two E’s (and E is only confirmed in position 3).
- SHEET – H is allowed, second E possible but again extra E.
- SKEET – K and second E.
- SMELT – already tested with L rejected.
- SLEPT – already tested with L and P rejected.
- SWEPT – P rejected.
- SENT/SWELT/SWEFT – letters already disallowed.

Best untested letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Pick a word with two new allowed letters in positions 2 and 4, using no disallowed letters.

A good candidate is “SCEPT” – but “scept” isn’t a standard word (it’s an abbreviation for sceptic). Next is “SHEET” (H in 2, second E in 4) – but that adds an extra E which we can’t confirm is safe.

Another strong candidate: “SKEFT” – but “skeft” is obsolete.

Next: “SWEET” – common word with W and another E. Although it duplicates E, it’s valid and W is untested.

Alternatively, “SCENT” – N already excluded.

How about “SMEWT” – not common.

Safest is “SWEET”: S(1 ✓), W(2), E(3 ✓), E(4), T(5 ✓). It’s a standard word, tests W in position 2 and allows an extra E.

But we already know E is in position 3; having E in position 4 is acceptable (no info against it).

Another good one: “SUETY” – but Y and U are both new, yet “suety” is uncommon.

Best balance of commonality and testing new letters is “SWEET”, but to avoid duplicating the already confirmed E, choose “SHEET”.

However, “SHEET” is valid and tests H.

Let me choose “SHEET”.

Word structure: S(✓) H(_) E(✓) E(_) T(✓) → positions 2 and 4 filled by H and E.

But we might prefer to fully avoid duplicate E if possible to maximize information.

Better: pick “SKEET”: S(1), K(2), E(3), E(4), T(5) – same duplicate-E issue.

Next option: “SMELT” already tried.

Another legitimate word: “SWEPT” – P already excluded.

Next valid word: “SWEAT” – A excluded.

Next: “SWIFT” – I excluded.

Next: “SWEET” seems to be the only common word left matching S _ E _ T.

So we’ll go with “SWEET”.

Actually, let’s pick “SMELT” was wrong (already tested). Another valid: “SLEPT” done.

Wait – “SHEET” is valid and only repeats E, but we have no rule against multiple E’s.

But we could also use “SKEET” (K and second E).

Between “SHEET” and “SKEET”, “SHEET” is more common.

But let me pick a word that introduces two new letters without repeating E.

Pattern: S _ E _ T  
Positions 2 and 4: must be two different letters from allowed set.

Possible pairs:  
C and D → “SCEDT” – invalid.  
Need a real word.

Consider “SCEPT” – invalid.  
“SHEET” – uses H and E.

Another real word: “SUETY” – uncommon.

Actually, the only common English word fitting S _ E _ T without disallowed letters is “SHEET”.

Thus we’ll test “SHEET”.

But to introduce two new letters without second E, let’s try “SKEET” (K and second E).

Given constraints, “SKEET” is acceptable.

However, “SKELT” invalid.

Next simplest is “SHEET”.

But “SHEET” uses H and E, so let’s go with that.

Therefore: <guess>sheet</guess>

From all past feedback the pattern is now:
