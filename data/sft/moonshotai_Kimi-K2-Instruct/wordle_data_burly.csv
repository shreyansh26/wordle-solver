For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can gather. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" which uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we can eliminate completely: A, I, S, E, O, N, D

So far we have:
- R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- U must be in positions 1, 2, 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, Y, H, etc.

- Uses R in a new position (3rd) and U in position 1.
- Fills the remaining slots with two fresh consonants and one more vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “CURRY” – it puts U in the 1st slot, R in the 3rd and 4th (one should be correct), and introduces C and Y.  
However, since we already know D is out, CURRY is fine as it doesn’t repeat any eliminated letters.

Let’s break down what we now know after three guesses.

Letters eliminated: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C  
Letters confirmed in the word: U, R, Y  
Letter positions pinned so far:
- U = 2nd position (✓ in CURRY)
- R = 3rd position (✓ in CURRY)  
- R also appears again somewhere (because the last R in CURRY only got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in 4th place).  
- Y is in the word but not in 5th place (because it got ✓ in CURRY, yet CURRY’s 5th letter is Y—no, wait: CURRY’s 5th letter is Y, and feedback shows Y(✓), so Y must be in the 5th position; the previous interpretation was wrong).

So the word looks like: _ U R _ Y  
Because we have two R’s total, the only other R must be in position 4:
_ U R R Y

That spells “FURRY” except F hasn’t been tried yet and isn’t eliminated. Let’s check if any letters conflict: none of F, U, R, R, Y have been eliminated, and we’ve confirmed U, R, Y. So “FURRY” fits every clue.

But we also need a valid 5-letter word, and “FURRY” is valid.

(Quick sanity check: any other possibilities? With pattern _ U R _ Y and a second R, the 4th slot is the only free spot for another R. Any other consonants in position 1? We haven’t ruled out many consonants yet, but “FURRY” is the simplest fit.)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,burly,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can gather. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" which uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- R is in the word but NOT in the 1st position.
- A, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word must contain R somewhere other than the 1st letter, and none of A, I, S, E appear.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
I’ll pick a word that:
1. Places R somewhere after position 1.
2. Uses only consonants and the remaining vowels U or O (since A, I, E are out).

“ROUND” uses R in position 2, and only uses O and U (the remaining vowels we haven’t eliminated) plus common consonants N and D. This should give us more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters we can eliminate completely: A, I, S, E, O, N, D  
Letters we know are in the word (but we still don’t know where): R (not 1st or 2nd), U (not 3rd)

So far we have:
- R must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- U must be in positions 1, 2, 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, Y, H, etc.

To test placement of R and U and gather more information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses R in a new position (3rd) and U in position 1.
- Fills the remaining slots with two fresh consonants and one more vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “CURRY” – it puts U in the 1st slot, R in the 3rd and 4th (one should be correct), and introduces C and Y.  
However, since we already know D is out, CURRY is fine as it doesn’t repeat any eliminated letters.

<guess>CURRY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: CURRY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s break down what we now know after three guesses.

Letters eliminated: A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C  
Letters confirmed in the word: U, R, Y  
Letter positions pinned so far:
- U = 2nd position (✓ in CURRY)
- R = 3rd position (✓ in CURRY)  
- R also appears again somewhere (because the last R in CURRY only got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in 4th place).  
- Y is in the word but not in 5th place (because it got ✓ in CURRY, yet CURRY’s 5th letter is Y—no, wait: CURRY’s 5th letter is Y, and feedback shows Y(✓), so Y must be in the 5th position; the previous interpretation was wrong).

So the word looks like: _ U R _ Y  
Because we have two R’s total, the only other R must be in position 4:
_ U R R Y

That spells “FURRY” except F hasn’t been tried yet and isn’t eliminated. Let’s check if any letters conflict: none of F, U, R, R, Y have been eliminated, and we’ve confirmed U, R, Y. So “FURRY” fits every clue.

But we also need a valid 5-letter word, and “FURRY” is valid.

(Quick sanity check: any other possibilities? With pattern _ U R _ Y and a second R, the 4th slot is the only free spot for another R. Any other consonants in position 1? We haven’t ruled out many consonants yet, but “FURRY” is the simplest fit.)

From the feedback, we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, F  

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
- U is in position 2.  
- R is in position 3.  
- Y is in position 5.  

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions we still need to determine:  
- A second R (since the final R in CURRY and FURRY both got “-”, meaning it exists but is not in the 4th position).

The only remaining position that can hold the second R is position 1 or 4. However, position 4 is currently showing “-” for R, so R cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the second R must be in position 1.

Thus, the word structure is:  
R (position 1), U (position 2), R (position 3), ? (position 4), Y (position 5).

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with R, has U in the second position, R in the third, and Y in the fifth. The missing letter (position 4) must not be any of the eliminated letters (A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, F). Possible candidates are letters like B, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

A common word fitting this pattern is ""RUGBY"" (R-U-G-B-Y), but B has not been tested or eliminated yet. Checking the letters: R, U, G, B, Y – none are in the eliminated list. ""RUGBY"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- R in position 1: allowed (no feedback against it).  
- U in position 2: confirmed.  
- R in position 3: confirmed.  
- G and B are new letters that haven’t been eliminated.  
- Y in position 5: confirmed.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""RUGBY"".

Let’s update what we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, I, S, E, O, N, D, C, F, G  

Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions:  
- U in position 2  
- R in position 3  
- Y in position 5  

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions we still need to determine:  
- A second R (it must be somewhere, and feedback shows it’s not in 1st or 4th positions in CURRY/FURRY/RUGBY)  
- B is in the word (from RUGBY feedback B(-)) but not in position 4.

We have the pattern:  
_ U R _ Y  

We need two letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4.  
- Position 1: cannot be R, F, C, etc. (eliminated or already placed)  
- Position 4: must be B (since it’s the only remaining letter we know is in the word but not yet placed)  

But position 4 cannot be B because B(-) in RUGBY means B is in the word but not in position 4. So B must be in position 1.  

Thus the word must be:  
B U R _ Y  

The missing letter in position 4 must be a consonant not yet eliminated. From remaining common consonants (H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.), let’s pick one that forms a valid word. The only remaining letter we can deduce is R (since we know there are two Rs).  

Thus:  
B U R R Y  

Check letters: B, U, R, R, Y – none are eliminated, and the positions fit the feedback.
