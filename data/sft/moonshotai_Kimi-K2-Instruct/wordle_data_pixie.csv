For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information by covering common letters and vowel placements. After considering the frequency of letters in English words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it includes:

- Three common vowels (A, O, E) in varying positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words
- This combination will likely give us hits on at least 2-3 letters, helping narrow down possibilities significantly

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓ for E in the last slot).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Common 5-letter words ending in E that avoid A, R, O, S include:
- FUGUE
- TULLE
- WITLE
- IMPLY (but ends in Y, not E)
- …

A good next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Use none of A, R, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

The letters left to test include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.  
A word like “TULLE” would cover T, U, L, L, E; it re-uses L, which is acceptable.

Another candidate is “FUGUE” (F, U, G, U, E), but the repeated U is less informative.

“UNTIE” uses U, N, T, I, E — but contains I and N which are good test letters and no repeats.

However, since E is locked in the 5th position, a word with fresh consonants and a new vowel is ideal.

Summary of constraints so far
- E is fixed in the 5th position.
- Letters not in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, N, G, C, H, M.
- The letter I is in the word but is NOT in the 3rd position (feedback from CHIME shows I(-)).

Therefore I must sit in position 1, 2, or 4.
We still need three more consonants/vowels drawn only from the remaining alphabet:
Allowed letters left: B, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  (plus the already-known I).

We want a real English word that
1. ends in E,
2. contains I exactly once,
3. places I in position 1, 2 or 4,
4. uses no forbidden letters.

Candidate positions for I:
- 1st: I _ _ _ E
- 2nd: _ I _ _ E
- 4th: _ _ _ I E

Real words that fit:
- IVYER – but “IVYER” is uncommon.
- PIXEL – contains X (allowed) but P, I, X, E, L; ends with L not E.
- FILED – ends in D.
- WILED – ends in D.
- BIBLE – ends in E, but repeats B; B, I, B, L, E – still uses allowed letters, and I in 2nd place.

“BIBLE” satisfies every constraint:
- Ends in E.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- I is in the 2nd position (which is allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

So BIBLE is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

After considering the frequency of letters in English words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it includes:

- Three common vowels (A, O, E) in varying positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many words
- This combination will likely give us hits on at least 2-3 letters, helping narrow down possibilities significantly

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓ for E in the last slot).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Common 5-letter words ending in E that avoid A, R, O, S include:
- FUGUE
- TULLE
- WITLE
- IMPLY (but ends in Y, not E)
- …

A good next guess should:
1. End with E.
2. Use none of A, R, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

The letters left to test include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.  
A word like “TULLE” would cover T, U, L, L, E; it re-uses L, which is acceptable.

Another candidate is “FUGUE” (F, U, G, U, E), but the repeated U is less informative.

“UNTIE” uses U, N, T, I, E — but contains I and N which are good test letters and no repeats.

However, since E is locked in the 5th position, a word with fresh consonants and a new vowel is ideal.  
Let’s try: T I N G E (TINGE) – uses T, I, N, G, E. No forbidden letters, and checks T, I, N, G.

Step-by-step deduction after four guesses:

1. Fixed facts  
   - Word ends in E (position 5 always ✓).  
   - Letters **never** in the word: A, R, O, S, T, N, G, C, H, M, B, L.  
   - The letter **I** is in the word somewhere, but it is **not** in positions 2 or 3 (from CHIME and BIBLE feedback).  
     ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 4.

2. Remaining usable letters  
   Consonants: D, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: I, U, Y (but I is already required)

3. Pattern we need  
   - Pos 5 = E  
   - Exactly one I, in position 1 or 4  
   - Three other distinct letters chosen only from the remaining set above.

4. Candidate words that fit  
   - I _ _ _ E  (I in position 1)  
     – I + two consonants + one more consonant + E  
     – Example real words: “IVIDE” (invalid, repeats I), “IGGIE” (G forbidden), etc.  
   - _ _ _ I E  (I in position 4)  
     – Three consonants + I + E  
     – Real words: “PIXIE” (P, I, X, I, E – repeats I), “WIFIE” (W, I, F, I, E – repeats), “KIVIE” (no), “PIVIE” (no).  
   – Cleanest candidate: **WIFIE** uses W, I, F, I, E but repeats I.  
   – Next cleanest: **PIXIE** uses P, I, X, I, E – also repeats I.  
   – A valid single-I word: **PIVOT** (but ends in T).  
   – Correct single-I word ending in E: **PIXIE** is the only common one left (still repeats).  
   – Actually, **PIXIE** is listed in dictionaries as a 5-letter word.

5. Decision  
   PIXIE meets every constraint:  
   - Ends in E.  
   - Contains I only once (in position 4).  
   - Uses only letters from the allowed set (P, I, X, E, none of the forbidden letters).  
   - Therefore it’s a valid next guess.

   - Letters **never** in the word: A, R, O, S, T, N, G, C, H, M, B, L.  
   - The letter **I** is in the word somewhere, but it is **not** in positions 2 or 3 (from CHIME and BIBLE feedback).  
     ⇒ I must be in position 1 or 4.

2. Remaining usable letters  
   Consonants: D, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Vowels: I, U, Y (but I is already required)

3. Pattern we need  
   - Pos 5 = E  
   - Exactly one I, in position 1 or 4  
   - Three other distinct letters chosen only from the remaining set above.

4. Candidate words that fit  
   - I _ _ _ E  (I in position 1)  
     – I + two consonants + one more consonant + E  
     – Example real words: “IVIDE” (invalid, repeats I), “IGGIE” (G forbidden), etc.  
   - _ _ _ I E  (I in position 4)  
     – Three consonants + I + E  
     – Real words: “PIXIE” (P, I, X, I, E – repeats I), “WIFIE” (W, I, F, I, E – repeats), “KIVIE” (no), “PIVIE” (no).  
   – Cleanest candidate: **WIFIE** uses W, I, F, I, E but repeats I.  
   – Next cleanest: **PIXIE** uses P, I, X, I, E – also repeats I.  
   – A valid single-I word: **PIVOT** (but ends in T).  
   – Correct single-I word ending in E: **PIXIE** is the only common one left (still repeats).  
   – Actually, **PIXIE** is listed in dictionaries as a 5-letter word.

5. Decision  
   PIXIE meets every constraint:  
   - Ends in E.  
   - Contains I only once (in position 4).  
   - Uses only letters from the allowed set (P, I, X, E, none of the forbidden letters).  
   - Therefore it’s a valid next guess.",Guess 5: PIXIE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) X(✓) I(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
