For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

A popular and effective first guess is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R: very common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

Consonants still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But wait: L and K and Y are still possible.  
However, “BULKY” has U in position 2, which may be a new useful position test.

Let’s double-check no forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T are absent.  
Yes, “BULKY” fits.

What we now know

1. Fixed excluded letters (x in every guess):  
   R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T, B, L, Y  
   (twelve letters are definitely not in the word)

2. Known in-word letters  
   - U is in the word, but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (because it got “-” in both MOUNT and BULKY).  
     So U must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

3. Remaining consonants still allowed:  
   C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   (K was “-” in BULKY, so it is in the word but not in position 4)

4. Remaining vowels still allowed: only U is confirmed; the rest (none) are ruled out.

So the mystery word:
- is 5 letters  
- contains U and K (and possibly other consonants)  
- letters must come only from the still-allowed set above  
- U can be in slot 1, 4, or 5  
- K is not in slot 4

To maximize new information, pick a word that:
- Uses U in a fresh position (say slot 1)  
- Uses K in positions 2, 3, or 5  
- Adds as many new consonants as possible

A quick scan of valid 5-letter English words:

- “PUDGY” – P, D, G, Y; Y is already ruled out.  
- “DUCKS” – S is ruled out.  
- “QUICK” – Q, U, I, C, K; I is ruled out.  
- “HUMPH” – M, H, U, M, P, H; M is ruled out.  
- “CHUCK” – C, H, U, C, K – no ruled-out letters, satisfies all constraints:
   – letters C, H, U, K are all still allowed  
   – U is in slot 3 (new position)  
   – K is in slot 5 (allowed)  

Therefore “CHUCK” is a valid next guess.

<guess>CHUCK</guess>",CHUCK,"What we now know

1. Fixed excluded letters (x in every guess):  
   R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T, B, L, Y  
   (twelve letters are definitely not in the word)

2. Known in-word letters  
   - U is in the word, but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (because it got “-” in both MOUNT and BULKY).  
     So U must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

3. Remaining consonants still allowed:  
   C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   (K was “-” in BULKY, so it is in the word but not in position 4)

4. Remaining vowels still allowed: only U is confirmed; the rest (none) are ruled out.

So the mystery word:
- is 5 letters  
- contains U and K (and possibly other consonants)  
- letters must come only from the still-allowed set above  
- U can be in slot 1, 4, or 5  
- K is not in slot 4

To maximize new information, pick a word that:
- Uses U in a fresh position (say slot 1)  
- Uses K in positions 2, 3, or 5

   – letters C, H, U, K are all still allowed  
   – U is in slot 3 (new position)

Therefore “CHUCK” is a valid next guess.",Guess 4: CHUCK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) U(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
