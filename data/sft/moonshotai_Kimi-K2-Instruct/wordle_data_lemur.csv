For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'm going to choose ""SLATE"" because it covers several common vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word regardless of their positions.

- A (3rd letter) – not in the word (x)
- T (4th letter) – not in the word (x)

Summary of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S, A, T are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but NOT at position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT at position 5.

2. OLDER → O(x) L(-) D(x) E(-) R(✓)
   - O, D are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but NOT at position 2 (still consistent with previous).
   - E is in the word but NOT at position 4 (still consistent, since we already knew it wasn’t at 5 and now we also know it’s not at 4).
   - R is in the word and IS at position 5.

So far we have:
- Known letters: L, E, R
- Known positions: R must be at position 5 (from OLDER feedback).
- L cannot be at positions 2.
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.

We still need two more letters from the unused alphabet that haven’t been ruled out (no S, A, T, O, D).

Popular remaining consonants: N, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, K, etc.
Popular vowels: I, U (A, O already ruled out).

Let’s aim for a word that:
- Has R in the 5th position.
- Uses L and E somewhere not already excluded.
- Introduces two new unused letters.

Candidate structure: _ _ L _ R (L at 3), but E must fit somewhere not at 4 or 5, so E could go at 1 or 2.

Try “ELBOW” – but O is out.
Try “FLIER” – but R is already known at 5, and we want to place E not at 4.
Try “CLERK” – uses C and K, has R at 5, and places E at 3 and L at 2. However, from SLATE feedback L cannot be at position 2.

Next idea: position E at 1, L at 3, and use two new letters for 2 and 4.

Try “ELDER” – D is out (from OLDER feedback), so no.
Try “ELVER” – has V and V is uncommon; also repeats E.
Try “ELBOW” – O is out.
Try “PELER” – P and E, but repeats E and looks uncommon.
Try “HELER” – H and E, but repeats E.
Try “BELAR” – uses B and A, but A is out.
Try “FLEER” – repeats E.
Try “GLUER” – uses G and U, places E at 3, L at 2. L at 2 is forbidden (from SLATE feedback).
Try “LUCER” – L at 1, U, C, E at 4 (but E can't be at 4).
Try “LINER” – uses I, N, places E at 4 (invalid), L at 1.

Better approach: fix R at 5, and try to place E at 2, L at 3 or 4.

Candidate: “FLEER” – E at 2, L at 1, but L at 1 is allowed (only position 2 is forbidden for L), but repeats E.
Candidate: “BLUER” – B, U, L at 3, E at 4 (invalid), R at 5.
Candidate: “PLIER” – P, L at 2 (invalid), I, E at 4 (invalid), R at 5.
Candidate: “CLERK” – C, L at 2 (invalid), E at 3, R at 5, K.

Next try: “CLERK” would be good except L at 2 is forbidden.

Alternative: L at 4, E at 2 or 3.
Try “REBEL” – E at 3, L at 5 (but R must be at 5), so no.
Try “REBEL” structure is wrong.
Try “MERLE” – M, E at 2, R at 3 (but R must be at 5), so no.

Another route: L at 1 or 3 or 4, E at 1 or 2 or 3.

Try “RELIC” – R at 1 (but must be at 5), so no.
Try “LEPER” – L at 1, E at 2, P at 3, R at 5. This fits:
- R at 5 ✓
- L at 1 (allowed, since L is forbidden only at 2)
- E at 2 (allowed, since E is forbidden only at 4 and 5)
- P and new letters: P, E (already known), but introduces P.

“LEPER” seems valid and uses P and E appropriately.

Check constraints:
- R at 5 (from OLDER) ✓
- L not at 2: L is at 1, so OK ✓
- E not at 4 or 5: E is at 2, so OK ✓
- Letters not used: P (new), rest are L, E, R (known).
- No S, A, T, O, D (from previous feedback).

So “LEPER” is a good next guess.

So far we have:
- Known letters: L, E, R
- Known positions: R must be at position 5 (from OLDER feedback).
- L cannot be at positions 2.
- E cannot be at positions 4 or 5.

We still need two more letters from the unused alphabet that haven’t been ruled out (no S, A, T, O, D).

Popular remaining consonants: N, C, H, M, P, G, B, F, K, etc.
Popular vowels: I, U (A, O already ruled out).

Let’s aim for a word that:
- Has R in the 5th position.
- Uses L and E somewhere not already excluded.
- Introduces two new unused letters.

Candidate structure: _ _ L _ R (L at 3), but E must fit somewhere not at 4 or 5, so E could go at 1 or 2.

Try “ELBOW” – but O is out.
Try “FLIER” – but R is already known at 5, and we want to place E not at 4.
Try “CLERK” – uses C and K, has R at 5, and places E at 3 and L at 2. However, from SLATE feedback L cannot be at position 2.

Next idea: position E at 1, L at 3, and use two new letters for 2 and 4.

Try “ELDER” – D is out (from OLDER feedback), so no.
Try “ELVER” – has V and V is uncommon; also repeats E.
Try “ELBOW” – O is out.
Try “PELER” – P and E, but repeats E and looks uncommon.
Try “HELER” – H and E, but repeats E.
Try “BELAR” – uses B and A, but A is out.
Try “FLEER” – repeats E.
Try “GLUER” – uses G and U, places E at 3, L at 2. L at 2 is forbidden (from SLATE feedback).
Try “LUCER” – L at 1, U, C, E at 4 (but E can't be at 4).
Try “LINER” – uses I, N, places E at 4 (invalid), L at 1.

Better approach: fix R at 5, and try to place E at 2, L at 3 or 4.

Candidate: “FLEER” – E at 2, L at 1, but L at 1 is allowed (only position 2 is forbidden for L), but repeats E.
Candidate: “BLUER” – B, U, L at 3, E at 4 (invalid), R at 5.
Candidate: “PLIER” – P, L at 2 (invalid), I, E at 4 (invalid), R at 5.
Candidate: “CLERK” – C, L at 2 (invalid), E at 3, R at 5, K.

Next try: “CLERK” would be good except L at 2 is forbidden.

Alternative: L at 4, E at 2 or 3.
Try “REBEL” – E at 3, L at 5 (but R must be at 5), so no.
Try “REBEL” structure is wrong.
Try “MERLE” – M, E at 2, R at 3 (but R must be at 5), so no.

Another route: L at 1 or 3 or 4, E at 1 or 2 or 3.

Try “RELIC” – R at 1 (but must be at 5), so no.
Try “LEPER” – L at 1, E at 2, P at 3, R at 5. This fits:
- R at 5 ✓
- L at 1 (allowed, since L is forbidden only at 2)
- E at 2 (allowed, since E is forbidden only at 4 and 5)
- P and new letters: P, E (already known), but introduces P.

“LEPER” seems valid and uses P and E appropriately.

Check constraints:
- R at 5 (from OLDER) ✓
- L not at 2: L is at 1, so OK ✓
- E not at 4 or 5: E is at 2, so OK ✓
- Letters not used: P (new), rest are L, E, R (known).
- No S, A, T, O, D (from previous feedback).

So “LEPER” is a good next guess.
