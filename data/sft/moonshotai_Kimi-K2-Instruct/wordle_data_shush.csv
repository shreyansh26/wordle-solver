For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains 5 of the most common letters and all unique letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 4.

So the word looks like _ _ _ S _.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P.
A good candidate would use these unused common letters.

Possible candidates:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – but it ends with L, not S.
- DUSTY – but ends in Y, and we need to keep S in position 4.

Let me think of words ending with _ _ _ S _:
- BUSTS – violates rule (contains S in position 4, but also position 5, which is allowed, but E is already excluded)
- LISTS – but contains S twice and E is excluded
- HUSKS – but contains S twice
- MUSTS – contains S twice
- PASTS – contains A which is excluded

Actually, the word must have S in position 4, so pattern is _ _ _ S _.  
Good candidate: TUNIS – uses T, U, N, I, S (with S in position 4) and none of A, R, O, E.

Another: DUMPS – uses D, U, M, P, S (S in 4th position), avoids A, R, O, E.

Another: TUMPS – T, U, M, P, S – but ""tump"" is obscure, and plural might not count.

Best seems TUNIS or DUMPS. TUNIS is more common, but DUMPS covers different letters. I'll go with DUMPS to test D, U, M, P.

- U is in the word, but cannot be in position 2 (because it was (-) there in DUMPS).  
- Available high-frequency letters left to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We still have three unknown slots: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
U must appear in one of these (and not in slot 2).  
Good next strategy: pick a word that (a) keeps S in slot 4, (b) contains U in a new position, (c) introduces as many fresh common letters as possible.

Candidate words meeting all constraints:

- BUNKS  – B, U, N, K, S  (U in slot 2, which is allowed; letters not yet ruled out)  
- TUNGS  – T, U, N, G, S  
- FUNKS  – F, U, N, K, S  
- LUNGS  – L, U, N, G, S  

All avoid the banned letters and place S correctly.  
Among these, BUNKS, FUNKS, LUNGS all test three new letters.  
I’ll choose LUNGS because L, N, G are common and haven’t been used yet.

  Check letters: B, U, S, T, Y  
  – B, T, Y have never appeared; all are allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains 5 of the most common letters and all unique letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 4.

So the word looks like _ _ _ S _.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P.
A good candidate would use these unused common letters.

Possible candidates:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – but it ends with L, not S.
- DUSTY – but ends in Y, and we need to keep S in position 4.

Let me think of words ending with _ _ _ S _:
- BUSTS – violates rule (contains S in position 4, but also position 5, which is allowed, but E is already excluded)
- LISTS – but contains S twice and E is excluded
- HUSKS – but contains S twice
- MUSTS – contains S twice
- PASTS – contains A which is excluded

Actually, the word must have S in position 4, so pattern is _ _ _ S _.  
Good candidate: TUNIS – uses T, U, N, I, S (with S in position 4) and none of A, R, O, E.

Another: DUMPS – uses D, U, M, P, S (S in 4th position), avoids A, R, O, E.

Another: TUMPS – T, U, M, P, S – but ""tump"" is obscure, and plural might not count.

Best seems TUNIS or DUMPS. TUNIS is more common, but DUMPS covers different letters. I'll go with DUMPS to test D, U, M, P.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,shush,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many of these as possible while avoiding duplicates.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains 5 of the most common letters and all unique letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 4.

So the word looks like _ _ _ S _.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P.
A good candidate would use these unused common letters.

Possible candidates:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L) – but it ends with L, not S.
- DUSTY – but ends in Y, and we need to keep S in position 4.

Let me think of words ending with _ _ _ S _:
- BUSTS – violates rule (contains S in position 4, but also position 5, which is allowed, but E is already excluded)
- LISTS – but contains S twice and E is excluded
- HUSKS – but contains S twice
- MUSTS – contains S twice
- PASTS – contains A which is excluded

Actually, the word must have S in position 4, so pattern is _ _ _ S _.  
Good candidate: TUNIS – uses T, U, N, I, S (with S in position 4) and none of A, R, O, E.

Another: DUMPS – uses D, U, M, P, S (S in 4th position), avoids A, R, O, E.

Another: TUMPS – T, U, M, P, S – but ""tump"" is obscure, and plural might not count.

Best seems TUNIS or DUMPS. TUNIS is more common, but DUMPS covers different letters. I'll go with DUMPS to test D, U, M, P.

<guess>DUMPS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: DUMPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(-) M(x) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is correct in position 4.  
   – A, R, O, E are all absent from the word.

2. DUMPS → D(x) U(-) M(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – S is NOT in position 5 (since it is marked (-) there), confirming it is only in position 4.  
   – D, M, P are absent.  
   – U is present but in the wrong position.

Current knowledge
- Word pattern: _ _ _ S _  (S fixed in slot 4)  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, D, M, P  
- U is in the word, but cannot be in position 2 (because it was (-) there in DUMPS).  
- Available high-frequency letters left to test: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We still have three unknown slots: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
U must appear in one of these (and not in slot 2).  
Good next strategy: pick a word that (a) keeps S in slot 4, (b) contains U in a new position, (c) introduces as many fresh common letters as possible.

Candidate words meeting all constraints:

- BUNKS  – B, U, N, K, S  (U in slot 2, which is allowed; letters not yet ruled out)  
- TUNGS  – T, U, N, G, S  
- FUNKS  – F, U, N, K, S  
- LUNGS  – L, U, N, G, S  

All avoid the banned letters and place S correctly.  
Among these, BUNKS, FUNKS, LUNGS all test three new letters.  
I’ll choose LUNGS because L, N, G are common and haven’t been used yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: DUMPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(-) M(x) P(x) S(-)
Guess 3: LUNGS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) N(x) G(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Gathering all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – Word pattern _ _ _ S _ (S fixed in slot 4)  
   – Letters not in word: A, R, O, E

2. DUMPS → D(x) U(-) M(x) P(x) S(-)  
   – Additional forbidden letters: D, M, P  
   – U is in the word but not in slot 2

3. LUNGS → L(x) U(-) N(x) G(x) S(-)  
   – Additional forbidden letters: L, N, G  
   – U still not in slot 2  
   – S is still only in slot 4 (because in LUNGS it was (-) in slot 5)

So current constraints:
- Pattern: 1 2 3 S 5  (S fixed in slot 4)  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, D, M, P, L, N, G  
- U must appear somewhere in 1, 3, or 5  
- Still need two more distinct letters for positions 1, 2, 3, 5

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, C, F, H, I, K, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
We must use U exactly once.

Candidate positions for U:
- If U is in slot 1: U _ _ S _  
- If U is in slot 3: _ _ U S _  
- If U is in slot 5: _ _ _ S U

Let’s explore slot 3 because it hasn’t been tested yet for U.  
Need two fresh letters for slots 1 and 2 from remaining pool.

Available letters left: B, C, F, H, I, K, S, T, V, W, Y (plus U once)

Try:  
– Slot 1: T  
– Slot 2: I  
– Slot 3: U  
– Slot 4: S  
– Slot 5: K  

Forms the word “TIUSK” – but TIUSK is not a valid English word.

Next try:  
– Slot 1: F  
– Slot 2: I  
– Slot 3: U  
– Slot 4: S  
– Slot 5: T  

Forms “FIUST” – not valid.

Try swapping letters to find a real word:

Valid 5-letter words with U in slot 3 and S in slot 4:

- BUSTY – but Y is allowed and T hasn’t been forbidden.  
  Check letters: B, U, S, T, Y  
  – B, T, Y have never appeared; all are allowed.  
  – U is in slot 3 (new position), S in slot 4 (fixed), no forbidden letters.

So BUSTY satisfies all constraints.

Another option: CUBSY – but Cubsy is not a word.  
Another: FUSTY – F, U, S, T, Y – also valid.

Between BUSTY and FUSTY, both are equally good; I’ll pick BUSTY.

- U must appear exactly once, allowed positions: 1, 3, or 5 (positions 2 and 4 already ruled out)

Remaining common letters not yet tested or ruled out: C, F, H, I, K, V, W, etc.

Possible placements for U:
1. U _ _ S _
2. _ _ U S _
3. _ _ _ S U

Let’s test option 3 first: place U in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ S U

Pick two more fresh letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining pool (C, F, H, I, K, V, W …).

A simple valid word: C I _ S U → need a letter for position 3.

Remaining letters not yet used: F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Try:
- C H I S U → not valid
- C H U S U → not valid
- F I N S U → N is forbidden
- F I K S U → “FIKSU” not valid
- F I C U S → “FICUS” is valid (a type of plant)

- F, I, C, U, S have not been ruled out yet.
- U is in position 5 (new position)
- S is in position 4 (fixed)
- No forbidden letters used.

So FICUS is valid.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

Current constraints:
1. Fixed pattern: _ _ _ S _  (S is correct in position 4).
2. Forbidden letters (x-marked so far):  
   A, R, O, E, D, M, P, L, N, G, B, T, Y, F, I, C
3. U is in the word (marked (-) in every appearance) but it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 because:
   - In DUMPS it was (-) in position 2 → not position 2  
   - In LUNGS it was (-) in position 2 → not position 2  
   - In BUSTY it was (-) in position 2 → not position 2  
   - In FICUS it was (-) in position 4 → but S is already fixed in 4, so this just confirms U is elsewhere.

Therefore U must occupy position 1, 3, or 5.

Remaining letters not yet ruled out (from the full alphabet) are relatively few. The common ones still allowed: H, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (and U).

We need to pick three of these to fill positions 1, 2, 3, 5 with U in one of 1/3/5 and the other two positions filled from the remaining pool.

Candidate patterns:
- U _ _ S _
- _ _ U S _
- _ _ _ S U

Let’s list possible real words under these patterns with only the still-allowed letters.

1. U _ _ S _
   - UH…?  no 5-letter word starting UH with S in 4th
   - UK…?  U-K _ S _  → no common word
   - UV…?  unlikely
   - UW…?  unlikely
   Nothing obvious.

2. _ _ U S _
   - H U S K S → but K already allowed, S is in position 4.  
     Check letters: H, U, S, K, S → “HUSKS”  
     Letters used: H, U, S, K – all allowed (S already known).
   - K U S K S → not valid
   - V U S K S → not valid
   So HUSKS is valid and fully consistent.

3. _ _ _ S U  
   - H I K S U → “HIKSU” invalid  
   - C H I S U → C is forbidden  
   - Nothing else obvious.

Therefore HUSKS fits perfectly.

Final checklist for HUSKS:
- H, U, K, S are all still allowed.
- Pattern: _ _ U S _ matches.
- U is in position 3 (new position).
- No forbidden letters used.
- Valid 5-letter word.

So the next guess is HUSKS.
