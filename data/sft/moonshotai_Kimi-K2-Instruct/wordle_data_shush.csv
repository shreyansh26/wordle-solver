For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback for AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the mystery word ends in S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in S that only uses the remaining consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y, etc.).  
A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and remaining vowels.

The word LUSTS meets these criteria:
- Ends in S.
- Letters used: L, U, S, T, S → none of the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E) appear.
- It also gives us information on U, L, T (and the repeated S).

Let’s consolidate what we know after the two guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - S is the 5th letter (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).

2. From LUSTS:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
   - S appears again; the second S (position 4) also received “-”, which means S is definitely in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.  The only place S can be is position 5 (already confirmed ✓).  
     Therefore, the word has exactly ONE S, at the end.
   - L and T are not in the word (x).

So far:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains U somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, L, T.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining candidate vowels: I, U (U already confirmed), sometimes Y.

We now want a word that:
- Ends in S.
- Includes U (not in position 2).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

A good next choice is to test new common consonants while respecting the constraints. The word “DUNKS” satisfies:
- Ends in S.
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed because our previous U position 2 was only “-”, but nothing precludes U from appearing in position 2 elsewhere; we just know it wasn’t in position 2 for “LUSTS”).  
  Actually, the feedback for LUSTS told us U is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.  Therefore, U must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  S is already in position 5, so U cannot be there.  Thus U must be in 1, 3 or 4.

Let’s pick a word that places U in position 3: BUMPS.
- Ends in S.
- Has U in position 3 (legal).
- Letters B, M, P are fresh consonants not yet tested.
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters.

That seems a solid next guess.

Let’s update the constraints from all feedback so far.

Known constraints
1. A, R, O, E, L, T, B, M, P are NOT in the word (x).
2. S is definitely the fifth letter (✓).
3. U is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
   (because in both LUSTS and BUMPS, U appeared in positions 2 and 3 respectively and got “-”).
   Therefore the only remaining position for U is position 1.

So the word must be of the form:
U _ _ _ S
with letters only from the still-allowed set:
consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
vowels: I, (sometimes Y)

We need three letters in positions 2-4 chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.
Trying common patterns:

- U D I S – invalid (only 4 letters).
- U N I S – also 4.
- U N I X S – invalid.

Common dictionary words that fit U _ _ _ S:
U D I C S – not a word.
U N C L S – not a word.
U N C L S – nope.
U N I C S – nope.
U N I T S – T is banned.
U N D S – nope.
U N D U S – 5 letters, but ends in US.
U N D U S – not valid.
U N D U S – not a real word.

Actually, “UNIQS” is a valid-looking (though uncommon) 5-letter form of “UNIQ S”, but “Q” without “U” is rare.

A legitimate dictionary word that remains is “UNDOS”.
Check letters:
U ✓ (must be first)
N ✓ (allowed)
D ✓ (allowed)
O ✓ – but O is banned from guess 1.  Not allowed.

Next candidate: UPIDS – P is banned.

Next: “UNIKS” – K is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, S last.
Is “UNIKS” a valid word?  Not in standard dictionaries.

Next: “UNITS” – T is banned.

Next: “UNCUS” – C is allowed, U already used, S last.  
But the word “UNCUS” exists (a real anatomical term).  
Letters: U, N, C, U, S.  
All letters:
U (allowed, already confirmed)
N (allowed)
C (allowed)
Second U (allowed because we have no restriction on repeat letters)
S (allowed at end)

So “UNCUS” satisfies every constraint:
- 5 letters
- Ends with S
- Starts with U (only possible position for U now)
- Uses only allowed letters: U, N, C, S
- No banned letters
- Real English word

Therefore, guess UNCUS.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the mystery word ends in S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in S that only uses the remaining consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y, etc.).  
A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and remaining vowels.

The word LUSTS meets these criteria:
- Ends in S.
- Letters used: L, U, S, T, S → none of the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E) appear.
- It also gives us information on U, L, T (and the repeated S).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LUSTS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) S(-) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after the two guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - S is the 5th letter (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).

2. From LUSTS:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
   - S appears again; the second S (position 4) also received “-”, which means S is definitely in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.  The only place S can be is position 5 (already confirmed ✓).  
     Therefore, the word has exactly ONE S, at the end.
   - L and T are not in the word (x).

So far:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains U somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, L, T.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining candidate vowels: I, U (U already confirmed), sometimes Y.

We now want a word that:
- Ends in S.
- Includes U (not in position 2).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

A good next choice is to test new common consonants while respecting the constraints. The word “DUNKS” satisfies:
- Ends in S.
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed because our previous U position 2 was only “-”, but nothing precludes U from appearing in position 2 elsewhere; we just know it wasn’t in position 2 for “LUSTS”).  
  Actually, the feedback for LUSTS told us U is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.  Therefore, U must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  S is already in position 5, so U cannot be there.  Thus U must be in 1, 3 or 4.

Let’s pick a word that places U in position 3: BUMPS.
- Ends in S.
- Has U in position 3 (legal).
- Letters B, M, P are fresh consonants not yet tested.
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters.

That seems a solid next guess.

   (because in both LUSTS and BUMPS, U appeared in positions 2 and 3 respectively and got “-”).
   Therefore the only remaining position for U is position 1.

So the word must be of the form:
U _ _ _ S
with letters only from the still-allowed set:
consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
vowels: I, (sometimes Y)

We need three letters in positions 2-4 chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.
Trying common patterns:

- U D I S – invalid (only 4 letters).
- U N I S – also 4.
- U N I X S – invalid.

Common dictionary words that fit U _ _ _ S:
U D I C S – not a word.
U N C L S – not a word.
U N C L S – nope.
U N I C S – nope.
U N I T S – T is banned.
U N D S – nope.
U N D U S – 5 letters, but ends in US.

U N D U S – not a real word.

Actually, “UNIQS” is a valid-looking (though uncommon) 5-letter form of “UNIQ S”, but “Q” without “U” is rare.

O ✓ – but O is banned from guess 1.  Not allowed.

Next candidate: UPIDS – P is banned.

Next: “UNIKS” – K is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, S last.

Next: “UNITS” – T is banned.

Therefore, guess UNCUS.

Let’s update the constraints again.

1. S is the 5th letter (✓).
2. Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, L, T, B, M, P, N, C
3. U is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (because UNCUS put U in 1 & 4 and got “-”).  
   Since position 5 is S, the only remaining position where U can legally sit is position 4.

Therefore the word must be  
_ _ _ U S

We still need three consonants for positions 1-3 chosen from the still-allowed set:
Allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels: I, Y (but we already have U at 4 and no other vowel is forced).

We want a real 5-letter English word matching  
[consonant][consonant][consonant]US  
with letters only from the allowed set.

Quick scan of common endings:
- DHUS – not a word.
- FUDS – only 4 letters.
- FUGUS – contains U twice; second U would be legal but FUGUS is 5 letters and real (a type of fungus).  
  Yet U is already fixed for position 4, so the pattern is _ _ _ U S.  We need _ _ _ U S not _ _ _ U S.

Actually, with _ _ _ U S:
Possible words:
- FICUS – C is banned.
- VICUS – C is banned.
- WUDUS – W, D, U, D, U, S – D is allowed but U appears twice and we already have U in position 4; no rule forbids it, but is WUDUS a word? No.

Next, “FUGUS” is 5 letters (plural of FUGU) but letter pattern F U G U S – U appears twice but we already know U must be at 4.  So FUGUS fits: F U G U S, but we need _ _ _ U S, so positions 1-3 are F, U, G, which means positions 1-3 are F, U, G.  But position 4 is U, so actual word would be FUGUS, which is F-U-G-U-S.  That has U at positions 2 and 4, but earlier feedback showed U cannot be at positions 1,2,3,5.  Position 2 would be invalid (U appeared in position 2 in LUSTS and got “-”).  Therefore FUGUS is invalid because of U in position 2.

A workable candidate: “HUMUS” – H U M U S, but M is banned.

Next: “JUDOS” – D is allowed, J allowed, O banned.

Next: “HOCUS” – O, C banned.

Next: “HUSKS” – fits pattern _ _ _ U S?  No, pattern _ _ _ U S needed.

Wait: we need _ _ _ U S.  Try “HOCUS” – already invalid.

Let’s list valid consonants for positions 1-3 and see English words ending with -US that fit.

Consider “FUDGS” – not a word.

“HUDES” – not a word.

“FUGUS” – already discussed.

Real word: FUGUS is valid, but as noted, places U in position 2 which is banned.

Next: “VIDUS” – C banned.

“FIDUS” – D allowed, F allowed, I allowed, U allowed, S last.  “FIDUS” is a legitimate (though uncommon) word meaning “faithful”.

Check letters:
F – allowed
I – allowed
D – allowed
U – allowed
S – allowed

No banned letters appear.  
Structure: _ _ _ U S is satisfied by FIDUS (F-I-D-U-S).  
Positions of U: 4 – allowed (we deduced U must be at 4).

Therefore guess FIDUS.

3. U is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (because UNCUS put U in 1 & 4 and got “-”).  
   Since position 5 is S, the only remaining position where U can legally sit is position 4.

Therefore the word must be  
_ _ _ U S

We still need three consonants for positions 1-3 chosen from the still-allowed set:
Allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels: I, Y (but we already have U at 4 and no other vowel is forced).

We want a real 5-letter English word matching  
[consonant][consonant][consonant]US  
with letters only from the allowed set.

Quick scan of common endings:
- DHUS – not a word.
- FUDS – only 4 letters.
- FUGUS – contains U twice; second U would be legal but FUGUS is 5 letters and real (a type of fungus).  
  Yet U is already fixed for position 4, so the pattern is _ _ _ U S.  We need _ _ _ U S not _ _ _ U S.

Actually, with _ _ _ U S:
Possible words:
- FICUS – C is banned.
- VICUS – C is banned.
- WUDUS – W, D, U, D, U, S – D is allowed but U appears twice and we already have U in position 4; no rule forbids it, but is WUDUS a word? No.

Next, “FUGUS” is 5 letters (plural of FUGU) but letter pattern F U G U S – U appears twice but we already know U must be at 4.  So FUGUS fits: F U G U S, but we need _ _ _ U S, so positions 1-3 are F, U, G, which means positions 1-3 are F, U, G.  But position 4 is U, so actual word would be FUGUS, which is F-U-G-U-S.  That has U at positions 2 and 4, but earlier feedback showed U cannot be at positions 1,2,3,5.  Position 2 would be invalid (U appeared in position 2 in LUSTS and got “-”).  Therefore FUGUS is invalid because of U in position 2.

A workable candidate: “HUMUS” – H U M U S, but M is banned.

Next: “JUDOS” – D is allowed, J allowed, O banned.

Next: “HOCUS” – O, C banned.

Next: “HUSKS” – fits pattern _ _ _ U S?  No, pattern _ _ _ U S needed.

Wait: we need _ _ _ U S.  Try “HOCUS” – already invalid.

Let’s list valid consonants for positions 1-3 and see English words ending with -US that fit.

Consider “FUDGS” – not a word.

“HUDES” – not a word.

“FUGUS” – already discussed.

Real word: FUGUS is valid, but as noted, places U in position 2 which is banned.

Next: “VIDUS” – C banned.

“FIDUS” – D allowed, F allowed, I allowed, U allowed, S last.  “FIDUS” is a legitimate (though uncommon) word meaning “faithful”.

Check letters:
F – allowed
I – allowed
D – allowed
U – allowed
S – allowed

No banned letters appear.  
Structure: _ _ _ U S is satisfied by FIDUS (F-I-D-U-S).  
Positions of U: 4 – allowed (we deduced U must be at 4).

Therefore guess FIDUS.",Guess 5: FIDUS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) D(x) U(-) S(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,shush,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the mystery word ends in S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
We now need a 5-letter word ending in S that only uses the remaining consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y, etc.).  
A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and remaining vowels.

The word LUSTS meets these criteria:
- Ends in S.
- Letters used: L, U, S, T, S → none of the ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E) appear.
- It also gives us information on U, L, T (and the repeated S).

<guess>LUSTS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LUSTS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) S(-) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after the two guesses.

1. From AROSE:
   - S is the 5th letter (✓).
   - A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).

2. From LUSTS:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
   - S appears again; the second S (position 4) also received “-”, which means S is definitely in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.  The only place S can be is position 5 (already confirmed ✓).  
     Therefore, the word has exactly ONE S, at the end.
   - L and T are not in the word (x).

So far:
- Word ends with S.
- Contains U somewhere, but not in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, L, T.

Remaining candidate consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining candidate vowels: I, U (U already confirmed), sometimes Y.

We now want a word that:
- Ends in S.
- Includes U (not in position 2).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

A good next choice is to test new common consonants while respecting the constraints. The word “DUNKS” satisfies:
- Ends in S.
- Contains U in position 2 (allowed because our previous U position 2 was only “-”, but nothing precludes U from appearing in position 2 elsewhere; we just know it wasn’t in position 2 for “LUSTS”).  
  Actually, the feedback for LUSTS told us U is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.  Therefore, U must appear in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.  S is already in position 5, so U cannot be there.  Thus U must be in 1, 3 or 4.

Let’s pick a word that places U in position 3: BUMPS.
- Ends in S.
- Has U in position 3 (legal).
- Letters B, M, P are fresh consonants not yet tested.
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters.

That seems a solid next guess.

<guess>BUMPS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: LUSTS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) S(-) T(x) S(-)
Guess 3: BUMPS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(-) M(x) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update the constraints from all feedback so far.

Known constraints
1. A, R, O, E, L, T, B, M, P are NOT in the word (x).
2. S is definitely the fifth letter (✓).
3. U is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
   (because in both LUSTS and BUMPS, U appeared in positions 2 and 3 respectively and got “-”).
   Therefore the only remaining position for U is position 1.

So the word must be of the form:
U _ _ _ S
with letters only from the still-allowed set:
consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
vowels: I, (sometimes Y)

We need three letters in positions 2-4 chosen from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.
Trying common patterns:

- U D I S – invalid (only 4 letters).
- U N I S – also 4.
- U N I X S – invalid.

Common dictionary words that fit U _ _ _ S:
U D I C S – not a word.
U N C L S – not a word.
U N C L S – nope.
U N I C S – nope.
U N I T S – T is banned.
U N D S – nope.
U N D U S – 5 letters, but ends in US.
U N D U S – not valid.
U N D U S – not a real word.

Actually, “UNIQS” is a valid-looking (though uncommon) 5-letter form of “UNIQ S”, but “Q” without “U” is rare.

A legitimate dictionary word that remains is “UNDOS”.
Check letters:
U ✓ (must be first)
N ✓ (allowed)
D ✓ (allowed)
O ✓ – but O is banned from guess 1.  Not allowed.

Next candidate: UPIDS – P is banned.

Next: “UNIKS” – K is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, S last.
Is “UNIKS” a valid word?  Not in standard dictionaries.

Next: “UNITS” – T is banned.

Next: “UNCUS” – C is allowed, U already used, S last.  
But the word “UNCUS” exists (a real anatomical term).  
Letters: U, N, C, U, S.  
All letters:
U (allowed, already confirmed)
N (allowed)
C (allowed)
Second U (allowed because we have no restriction on repeat letters)
S (allowed at end)

So “UNCUS” satisfies every constraint:
- 5 letters
- Ends with S
- Starts with U (only possible position for U now)
- Uses only allowed letters: U, N, C, S
- No banned letters
- Real English word

Therefore, guess UNCUS.

3. U is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (because UNCUS put U in 1 & 4 and got “-”).  
   Since position 5 is S, the only remaining position where U can legally sit is position 4.

Therefore the word must be  
_ _ _ U S

We still need three consonants for positions 1-3 chosen from the still-allowed set:
Allowed consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

That has U at positions 2 and 4, but earlier feedback showed U cannot be at positions 1,2,3,5.  Position 2 would be invalid (U appeared in position 2 in LUSTS and got “-”).  Therefore FUGUS is invalid because of U in position 2.

Let’s consolidate the fresh feedback from Guess 5 (FIDUS):

Position 1 F → x (not in word)  
Position 2 I → x (not in word)  
Position 3 D → x (not in word)  
Position 4 U → - (U is in the word but NOT in position 4)  
Position 5 S → - (S is in the word but NOT in position 5)  

However, from Guess 1 we already knew S is the 5th letter (✓).  
So the “-” for S here simply reiterates that S is not anywhere else, which is consistent.

What’s new:
- I and D are now also forbidden letters.
- U is confirmed in the word but must NOT be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 according to every single position it’s been tried (positions 2, 3, 4, 1 all returned “-”).  
  The only remaining possibility is that the puzzle allows repeated letters, and the single instance of U must be in a position we haven’t placed it yet.  
  But wait: we have tried positions 1, 2, 3, 4 for U and all got “-”.  
  Position 5 is S, so U cannot be there either.  
  This is impossible unless the word actually contains two U’s and we have simply been told the individual positions are wrong.  
  That is the standard Wordle behavior: “-” on a letter means the letter exists elsewhere, not necessarily exactly once.

So let’s re-count:

- Word ends with S (position 5 ✓).  
- Forbidden letters so far:  
  A, R, O, E, L, T, B, M, P, N, C, F, I, D  

- Allowed letters left:  
  G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
  plus U (must appear somewhere, possibly twice)  

We need three letters for positions 2-4, chosen only from G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and U (which can appear).  
The pattern is:  
_ _ _ _ S  

and U must appear in at least one of positions 2, 3, or 4.  

Looking for real 5-letter English words ending in S that use only the allowed letters and contain U somewhere in the middle.

Real words that fit:

- GUCKS – K allowed, C not allowed.  
- HUCKS – C banned.  
- JUKES – E banned.  
- GUYUS – Y allowed, U allowed, G allowed.  “GUYUS” is plural of “guyu” (a real but obscure term).  
- JUGGS – G allowed, J allowed, but G repeated and not common.  
- GURUS – R banned.  
- YUCKS – C banned.  
- GUYUS is the only viable candidate left using allowed letters and fitting the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is GUYUS.
