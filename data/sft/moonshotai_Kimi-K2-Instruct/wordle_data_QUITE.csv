- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to build upon. A good starting strategy is to use a word with common letters and good vowel coverage to quickly gain information. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U for vowels)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it includes several very common consonants (S, L, T) and the two most common vowels (A, E), giving good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: _ _ I T E (positions 3-5 are fixed as I T E)
2. Eliminated letters (never appear): S, L, A, W, R, N
3. Letters in the word but not yet placed:
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from UNITE feedback)
4. So U must be in position 2.

Therefore the word looks like: _ U I T E
and must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Valid English word matching _ U I T E:
- ""QUITE"" – but Q is not yet ruled out, and we have no evidence for Q, but let's check if it has been eliminated. Q has not been tested yet, so it's possible.
- ""CUITE"" – not a valid word.
- ""GUILE"" – but that doesn't end in ITE.
- ""SUITE"" – S is eliminated.
- ""FLUTE"" – pattern doesn't match.
- ""QUIET"" – pattern doesn't match.
- ""FUGUE"" – pattern doesn't match.

The only valid English word fitting _ U I T E is ""QUITE"". However, we already considered this and the feedback for U in UNITE shows U is in the word but not in position 1. In ""QUITE"", U is in position 2 which would be correct. However, we haven't tested Q yet. Since Q hasn't been eliminated and ""QUITE"" fits all constraints, this must be the word.

Let me double-check: QUITE ends in ITE, has no S, L, A, W, R, N, and has U in position 2. This fits all feedback perfectly.

Therefore the next guess is QUITE.
