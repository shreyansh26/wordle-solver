Since I have no prior feedback to work with, my first guess should be a strong opening word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A balanced word would include some vowels and common consonants. 

Possible good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels/consonants (C, R, N, E) and the vowel A, giving good coverage across common letters without repeating any letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key take-aways:
1. The secret word contains the letter R, but NOT in position 2.
2. The letters C, A, N, E are definitely NOT in the word at all.
3. Therefore, the remaining letters we have not tried yet are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. We need to place the letter R in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
5. To maximize information, we should use new, common letters that haven't been ruled out yet.

Popular remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, G, H, M, P, B, K, F.
Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess would incorporate R in a different position and use new common letters. Words like:

   B(x) U(x) R(-) S(x) T(x)

   – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – B, U, S, T are NOT in the word.

Combining both rounds:
- Letters confirmed absent so far: C, A, N, E, B, U, S, T
- Letter confirmed present but whose position is still unknown: R (positions 2 and 3 ruled out; must be 1, 4, or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a fresh 5-letter word that
1. contains R,
2. avoids every one of the eight ruled-out letters,
3. places R in a new spot (1, 4, or 5).

Picking common unused letters that fit: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Y…

A good high-frequency mix is D, I, O, P, R → “DROOP” (but O repeats; not ideal) or “FRIGID” (too long) → not great.

Better: R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R or _ _ _ _ R.

Try “DROOP” still has O twice.  
Try “FROND” – letters F, R, O, N, D. N already eliminated.  
Try “PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O; keep it.

- P: new, high-frequency.  
- R: we need it.  
- I, M, O: all new, common.

Positions: R is now in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2 from guess 1. So reject PRIMO.

Next option: “FROTH” – T and H are new, but T is already out (from BURST).  
“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N; N is out.  
“DRIFT” – T is out.  
“WRING” – W and I and N; N is out.

Instead try “DRILL” – L repeats and L not ruled out yet, but we’d rather avoid repeats early.

Try “MIRTH” – T is out.

Try “FROWN” – N is out.

Try “GRIMY” – G, R, I, M, Y: none of these letters are ruled out and R is in position 2 – but we know R isn’t in position 2. So no.

Best option so far that places R in position 1:

“RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – O repeats, E is out.

“ROBIN” – B and N are out.

“ROGER” – repeats R, E, G.

Eventually a clean candidate is “FILMY” but that lacks R.

We must include R and avoid B, C, E, N, S, T, U, A.

Let’s try “FRISK” – S and K; S is out.

“GRIPE” – E is out.

“GRIME” – E is out.

“HORDE” – E is out.

“IRONY” – N and O, N is out.

“LORRY” – repeats R.

“MORPH” – H and P.

“MORPH” isn’t bad: M, O, R, P, H. None of these letters have been eliminated, and R is in position 3 – which we already ruled out in guess 2. So skip.

Place R in position 4: “GROIN” – N is out.

Place R in position 5: “GROIN” again.

We need a word where R is 1st, 4th, or 5th and uses fresh letters.

A good candidate: “FROGM” – but M already fine.

Actually let’s just pick “FROGM” – but “FROGM” isn’t a valid word.

Real valid word: “GROIN” – N out.

“GRIOT” – T out.

“GRIFF” – repeats F.

“FROND” – N out.

“GROOM” – O repeats, R in position 2 (invalid).

“PRISM” – S out.

Finally a clean valid word: “GIRTH” – T is out.

Next valid word with R in position 4: “FROTH” – T out.

“FROWN” – N out.

“HORSE” – S and E out.

“PORCH” – C out.

“WORRY” – R repeats, Y fine, but R in position 2 invalid.

“FORTH” – T out.

Eventually a valid one with R in position 5: “GRIMY” – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “GROKY” – but not a word.

A valid dictionary word that fits: “DROID” – D, R, O, I, D. D is fine, O, I new, R in position 2 invalid.

Arrgh.

Let’s just pick a simple common word with R in position 1: “RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – E out.

“ROBIN” – B and N out.

“RIGID” – I, G, D, R. Valid, and positions: R is first, which is allowed.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. Only R and I and G and D are new and not eliminated.

Let’s use RIGID.

Positions: R is in position 1, which has never been ruled out.
Letters: R, I, G, D – none of these have been declared absent yet.

So RIGID is a good next guess.

“MORPH” isn’t bad: M, O, R, P, H. None of these letters have been eliminated, and R is in position 3 – which we already ruled out in guess 2. So skip.

Place R in position 4: “GROIN” – N is out.

Place R in position 5: “GROIN” again.

We need a word where R is 1st, 4th, or 5th and uses fresh letters.

A good candidate: “FROGM” – but M already fine.

Actually let’s just pick “FROGM” – but “FROGM” isn’t a valid word.

Real valid word: “GROIN” – N out.

“GRIOT” – T out.

“GRIFF” – repeats F.

“FROND” – N out.

“GROOM” – O repeats, R in position 2 (invalid).

“PRISM” – S out.

Finally a clean valid word: “GIRTH” – T is out.

Next valid word with R in position 4: “FROTH” – T out.

“FROWN” – N out.

“HORSE” – S and E out.

“PORCH” – C out.

“WORRY” – R repeats, Y fine, but R in position 2 invalid.

“FORTH” – T out.

Eventually a valid one with R in position 5: “GRIMY” – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “GROKY” – but not a word.

A valid dictionary word that fits: “DROID” – D, R, O, I, D. D is fine, O, I new, R in position 2 invalid.

Arrgh.

Let’s just pick a simple common word with R in position 1: “RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – E out.

“ROBIN” – B and N out.

“RIGID” – I, G, D, R. Valid, and positions: R is first, which is allowed.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. Only R and I and G and D are new and not eliminated.

Let’s use RIGID.

Positions: R is in position 1, which has never been ruled out.
Letters: R, I, G, D – none of these have been declared absent yet.

So RIGID is a good next guess.",Guess 3: RIGID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) G(x) I(-) D(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,IVORY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since I have no prior feedback to work with, my first guess should be a strong opening word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A balanced word would include some vowels and common consonants. 

Possible good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels/consonants (C, R, N, E) and the vowel A, giving good coverage across common letters without repeating any letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key take-aways:
1. The secret word contains the letter R, but NOT in position 2.
2. The letters C, A, N, E are definitely NOT in the word at all.
3. Therefore, the remaining letters we have not tried yet are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. We need to place the letter R in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
5. To maximize information, we should use new, common letters that haven't been ruled out yet.

Popular remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, G, H, M, P, B, K, F.
Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess would incorporate R in a different position and use new common letters. Words like:
- SPORT (has R in position 4, common letters)
- TRIMS (has R in position 2, but we know R is not in position 2 - so skip)
- DRIFT (has R in position 2 - skip)
- FROST (has R in position 2 - skip)
- BURST (has R in position 3)
- GRIST (has R in position 2 - skip)

""BURST"" seems good - it places R in position 3 (allowed), includes new common letters B, U, S, T that haven't been tested yet.

<guess>BURST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BURST -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) R(-) S(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

1. CRANE  
   C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

   – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. BURST  
   B(x) U(x) R(-) S(x) T(x)

   – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – B, U, S, T are NOT in the word.

Combining both rounds:
- Letters confirmed absent so far: C, A, N, E, B, U, S, T
- Letter confirmed present but whose position is still unknown: R (positions 2 and 3 ruled out; must be 1, 4, or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a fresh 5-letter word that
1. contains R,
2. avoids every one of the eight ruled-out letters,
3. places R in a new spot (1, 4, or 5).

Picking common unused letters that fit: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Y…

A good high-frequency mix is D, I, O, P, R → “DROOP” (but O repeats; not ideal) or “FRIGID” (too long) → not great.

Better: R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R or _ _ _ _ R.

Try “DROOP” still has O twice.  
Try “FROND” – letters F, R, O, N, D. N already eliminated.  
Try “PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O; keep it.

- P: new, high-frequency.  
- R: we need it.  
- I, M, O: all new, common.

Positions: R is now in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2 from guess 1. So reject PRIMO.

Next option: “FROTH” – T and H are new, but T is already out (from BURST).  
“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N; N is out.  
“DRIFT” – T is out.  
“WRING” – W and I and N; N is out.

Instead try “DRILL” – L repeats and L not ruled out yet, but we’d rather avoid repeats early.

Try “MIRTH” – T is out.

Try “FROWN” – N is out.

Try “GRIMY” – G, R, I, M, Y: none of these letters are ruled out and R is in position 2 – but we know R isn’t in position 2. So no.

Best option so far that places R in position 1:

“RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – O repeats, E is out.

“ROBIN” – B and N are out.

“ROGER” – repeats R, E, G.

Eventually a clean candidate is “FILMY” but that lacks R.

We must include R and avoid B, C, E, N, S, T, U, A.

Let’s try “FRISK” – S and K; S is out.

“GRIPE” – E is out.

“GRIME” – E is out.

“HORDE” – E is out.

“IRONY” – N and O, N is out.

“LORRY” – repeats R.

“MORPH” – H and P.

“MORPH” isn’t bad: M, O, R, P, H. None of these letters have been eliminated, and R is in position 3 – which we already ruled out in guess 2. So skip.

Place R in position 4: “GROIN” – N is out.

Place R in position 5: “GROIN” again.

We need a word where R is 1st, 4th, or 5th and uses fresh letters.

A good candidate: “FROGM” – but M already fine.

Actually let’s just pick “FROGM” – but “FROGM” isn’t a valid word.

Real valid word: “GROIN” – N out.

“GRIOT” – T out.

“GRIFF” – repeats F.

“FROND” – N out.

“GROOM” – O repeats, R in position 2 (invalid).

“PRISM” – S out.

Finally a clean valid word: “GIRTH” – T is out.

Next valid word with R in position 4: “FROTH” – T out.

“FROWN” – N out.

“HORSE” – S and E out.

“PORCH” – C out.

“WORRY” – R repeats, Y fine, but R in position 2 invalid.

“FORTH” – T out.

Eventually a valid one with R in position 5: “GRIMY” – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “GROKY” – but not a word.

A valid dictionary word that fits: “DROID” – D, R, O, I, D. D is fine, O, I new, R in position 2 invalid.

Arrgh.

Let’s just pick a simple common word with R in position 1: “RIGHT” – T is out.

“RIGID” – I, G, D, R. Valid, and positions: R is first, which is allowed.

Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good next guess would incorporate R in a different position and use new common letters. Words like:
- SPORT (has R in position 4, common letters)
- TRIMS (has R in position 2, but we know R is not in position 2 - so skip)
- DRIFT (has R in position 2 - skip)
- FROST (has R in position 2 - skip)
- BURST (has R in position 3)
- GRIST (has R in position 2 - skip)

""BURST"" seems good - it places R in position 3 (allowed), includes new common letters B, U, S, T that haven't been tested yet.

<guess>BURST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BURST -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) R(-) S(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

1. CRANE  
   C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

   – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. BURST  
   B(x) U(x) R(-) S(x) T(x)

   – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – B, U, S, T are NOT in the word.

Combining both rounds:
- Letters confirmed absent so far: C, A, N, E, B, U, S, T
- Letter confirmed present but whose position is still unknown: R (positions 2 and 3 ruled out; must be 1, 4, or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a fresh 5-letter word that
1. contains R,
2. avoids every one of the eight ruled-out letters,
3. places R in a new spot (1, 4, or 5).

Picking common unused letters that fit: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Y…

A good high-frequency mix is D, I, O, P, R → “DROOP” (but O repeats; not ideal) or “FRIGID” (too long) → not great.

Better: R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R or _ _ _ _ R.

Try “DROOP” still has O twice.  
Try “FROND” – letters F, R, O, N, D. N already eliminated.  
Try “PRIMO” – P, R, I, M, O; keep it.

- P: new, high-frequency.  
- R: we need it.  
- I, M, O: all new, common.

Positions: R is now in position 2, but we already know R is not in position 2 from guess 1. So reject PRIMO.

Next option: “FROTH” – T and H are new, but T is already out (from BURST).  
“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N; N is out.  
“DRIFT” – T is out.  
“WRING” – W and I and N; N is out.

Instead try “DRILL” – L repeats and L not ruled out yet, but we’d rather avoid repeats early.

Try “MIRTH” – T is out.

Try “FROWN” – N is out.

Try “GRIMY” – G, R, I, M, Y: none of these letters are ruled out and R is in position 2 – but we know R isn’t in position 2. So no.

Best option so far that places R in position 1:

“RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – O repeats, E is out.

“ROBIN” – B and N are out.

“ROGER” – repeats R, E, G.

Eventually a clean candidate is “FILMY” but that lacks R.

We must include R and avoid B, C, E, N, S, T, U, A.

Let’s try “FRISK” – S and K; S is out.

“GRIPE” – E is out.

“GRIME” – E is out.

“HORDE” – E is out.

“IRONY” – N and O, N is out.

“LORRY” – repeats R.

“MORPH” – H and P.

“MORPH” isn’t bad: M, O, R, P, H. None of these letters have been eliminated, and R is in position 3 – which we already ruled out in guess 2. So skip.

Place R in position 4: “GROIN” – N is out.

Place R in position 5: “GROIN” again.

We need a word where R is 1st, 4th, or 5th and uses fresh letters.

A good candidate: “FROGM” – but M already fine.

Actually let’s just pick “FROGM” – but “FROGM” isn’t a valid word.

Real valid word: “GROIN” – N out.

“GRIOT” – T out.

“GRIFF” – repeats F.

“FROND” – N out.

“GROOM” – O repeats, R in position 2 (invalid).

“PRISM” – S out.

Finally a clean valid word: “GIRTH” – T is out.

Next valid word with R in position 4: “FROTH” – T out.

“FROWN” – N out.

“HORSE” – S and E out.

“PORCH” – C out.

“WORRY” – R repeats, Y fine, but R in position 2 invalid.

“FORTH” – T out.

Eventually a valid one with R in position 5: “GRIMY” – R in position 2 invalid.

Try “GROKY” – but not a word.

A valid dictionary word that fits: “DROID” – D, R, O, I, D. D is fine, O, I new, R in position 2 invalid.

Arrgh.

Let’s just pick a simple common word with R in position 1: “RIGHT” – T is out.

“RODEO” – E out.

“ROBIN” – B and N out.

“RIGID” – I, G, D, R. Valid, and positions: R is first, which is allowed.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. Only R and I and G and D are new and not eliminated.

Let’s use RIGID.

Positions: R is in position 1, which has never been ruled out.
Letters: R, I, G, D – none of these have been declared absent yet.

So RIGID is a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on RIGID:

R(-)  → R is still somewhere, but not in spot 1 (we already knew it can’t be 2 or 3).
I(-)  → I is in the word but not in spot 2 or 4.
G(x)  → G is not in the word.
D(x)  → D is not in the word.

Letters now known to be absent:  
C, A, N, E, B, U, S, T, G, D

Known to be present: R, I

Possible positions left for R: 4 or 5  
Possible positions left for I: 3 or 5 (it cannot be 2 or 4)

I need a word that
- contains both R and I,
- places R only in 4 or 5,
- places I only in 3 or 5,
- avoids every letter already marked absent,
- and brings in new, common letters to continue narrowing things down.

Good remaining consonants: F, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: O, (I already used)

Candidate words:
- FRIAR  – R in 5 (allowed), I in 3 (allowed), F, A, but A is absent. ❌
- RHINO – N absent, H, O, I in 3, R in 1 (invalid). ❌
- PRIMO – N absent. ❌
- FILMY – no R. ❌
- WHIRL – R in 4, I in 3, W, H, L all allowed. ✅

Let me confirm WHIRL:
- Letters: W, H, I, R, L  
- All five letters have not been ruled out.  
- R is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed).  
- Contains no forbidden letters.
