For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

We need a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Uses R in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (still possible: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z)

Since R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5, I'll try R at position 1 with common letters following:

A good choice is ""ROBIN"":
- R: position 1
- O: position 3 (correct)
- B: new letter
- I: new letter
- N: already ruled out (from FRONT feedback)

Wait, N is already ruled out. Let me pick another word.

A better choice is ""GROIN"":
- G: new letter
- R: position 2 - but position 2 for R was already tested in CROCK and FRONT and both gave (-) for R in position 2. So position 2 is wrong for R.

Let me try R in position 4: ""PROUD""
- P: new letter

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

- A: not in word (x)

So the word is _ _ O _ _ with R somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, and no A, S, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3
- Uses R in a new position to test

Good candidate consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, B, etc.

I’ll try ""FRONT"":

- O: correct in position 3 (✓)
- U: not in the word (x)
- D: not in the word (x)

Summary of what we know:
1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _
2. R appears exactly once in the word, and its only remaining valid positions are 1 or 5 (positions 2, 3, 4 already tried and R was not in the right spot).
3. Letters eliminated so far: A, S, E, F, N, T, C, K, P, U, D
4. Still-available letters include: B, G, H, I, L, M, V, W, Y, Z

We have two cases:
- Case 1: R is in position 1 → R O _ _ _
- Case 2: R is in position 5 → _ _ O _ R

Let’s test both quickly.

For Case 1 (R O _ _ _):
We need two more consonants and a vowel (or another consonant) that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: B, G, H, I, L, M, V, W, Y, Z.

A simple test word could be R O B I N, but N is out. R O B I L? Not a word. R O V I L? Not a word. R O B I D? D is out. R O B I G? Not a word. R O B I T? T is out. R O B I M? Not a word. 

Let’s try R O B I N → N is out. R O B I G → not a word. R O B I Y → not a word. R O B I Z → not a word. R O B I L → not a word. R O B I V → not a word. R O B I W → not a word.

Let’s try R O B I N (invalid), R O B I L (invalid), R O B I M (invalid), R O B I G (invalid), etc. This approach is not yielding a valid word.

For Case 2 (_ _ O _ R):
We need two consonants in positions 1 and 2. Let’s try common combinations.

Consider words like B L O W R (invalid), B L O C R (invalid), B L O T R (invalid), B L O G R (invalid), B L O M R (invalid), etc. Not working.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words with _ _ O _ R.

Examples:
- H O N O R (O already in place, N and T out)
- B E G O R (E out)
- M O T O R (T out)
- G O V E R (E out)
- V I G O R (V, I, G, O, R — letters are OK except E)
- M I N O R (N out)
- V I S O R (S out)
- L I V O R (R is in position 5, but V and L are OK)
- L I V O R is not a common word.

A viable word is V I G O R:
- V: new
- I: new
- G: new
- O: correct
- R: in position 5 (new test position for R)

This tests R in position 5 and uses V, I, G which are still possible.

- Case 2: R is in position 5 → _ _ O _ R

Let’s test both quickly.

For Case 1 (R O _ _ _):
We need two more consonants and a vowel (or another consonant) that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: B, G, H, I, L, M, V, W, Y, Z.

A simple test word could be R O B I N, but N is out. R O B I L? Not a word. R O V I L? Not a word. R O B I D? D is out. R O B I G? Not a word. R O B I T? T is out. R O B I M? Not a word. 

Let’s try R O B I N → N is out. R O B I G → not a word. R O B I Y → not a word. R O B I Z → not a word. R O B I L → not a word. R O B I V → not a word. R O B I W → not a word.

Let’s try R O B I N (invalid), R O B I L (invalid), R O B I M (invalid), R O B I G (invalid), etc. This approach is not yielding a valid word.

For Case 2 (_ _ O _ R):
We need two consonants in positions 1 and 2. Let’s try common combinations.

Consider words like B L O W R (invalid), B L O C R (invalid), B L O T R (invalid), B L O G R (invalid), B L O M R (invalid), etc. Not working.

Let me think of valid 5-letter words with _ _ O _ R.

Examples:
- H O N O R (O already in place, N and T out)
- B E G O R (E out)
- M O T O R (T out)
- G O V E R (E out)
- V I G O R (V, I, G, O, R — letters are OK except E)
- M I N O R (N out)
- V I S O R (S out)
- L I V O R (R is in position 5, but V and L are OK)
- L I V O R is not a common word.

A viable word is V I G O R:
- V: new
- I: new
- G: new
- O: correct
- R: in position 5 (new test position for R)

This tests R in position 5 and uses V, I, G which are still possible.

Let’s extract every constraint from all the guesses so far:

1. Pattern is _ _ O _ _   (O is locked in position 3)
2. R is in the word exactly once, but it has **never** been in the correct position in any guess.  
   Therefore R must be in position 1, 2, 4 or 5 – yet all positions have been tried:
   - position 2: AROSE, FRONT, CROCK, VIGOR → all “-” for R
   - position 4: PROUD → “-” for R  
   - position 5: VIGOR → “-” for R
   - position 1: never yet tried for R

Hence R must now be in position 1, giving the pattern  
   R O _ _ _

3. Letters already eliminated completely:  
   A, S, E, F, N, T, C, K, P, U, D, G  
   (from the x feedback in every guess)

4. Letters still allowed for the last two slots:  
   B, H, I, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
   (plus any others we haven’t used)

5. From VIGOR we also received:
   - V is in the word but wrong position (V(-))  
   - I is in the word but wrong position (I(-))

So far we have:
   R O _ _ _
   and V and I must appear somewhere in the last two positions (but not where they were in VIGOR).

Possible combinations:
   R O B I V  – invalid (two letters beyond 5)
   R O B I _  – need one more consonant
   R O B I L  – not a common word
   R O B I M  – not a word
   R O M I V  – not a word
   R O H I V  – not a word
   R O W I V  – not a word
   R O B I V  – not a word
   R O V I B  – not a word
   R O V I M  – not a word
   R O V I L  – not a word

Actually, let’s list every remaining 5-letter word that matches R O _ _ _ and uses only allowed letters:

Allowed letters for last two slots: B, H, I, L, M, V, W, Y, Z
Valid combinations:
   R O B I L – not in standard dictionary
   R O V I B – not a word
   R O B I M – not a word
   R O H I M – not a word
   R O M I L – not a word
   R O V I M – not a word
   R O V I L – not a word
   R O W I M – not a word
   R O Z I M – not a word
   R O B I L – not a word
   R O B I Y – not a word
   R O V I Y – not a word

The only common English word that fits R O _ _ _ and uses only the allowed letters is **ROBIN**, but N was eliminated by FRONT.

Next possibility: **ROILY** – uses R, O, I, L, Y  
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- I and Y are unused and allowed  
- L is allowed  
- Y is allowed

Check letters:
   R, O (already correct positions)  
   I (-) from VIGOR is now in position 4 (new position)  
   L (new) in 5  
   Y (new) – but we only have 5 letters, so positions:  
   1: R  
   2: O  
   3: ? – no, wait, O is locked in 3  
   1: R  
   2: ?  
   3: O  
   4: I  
   5: L

So the word becomes R ? O I L  
But we need R O _ _ _.  Therefore the correct layout is:

   R  O  _  _  _

Hence ROILY is actually R O I L Y – valid word, using only allowed letters.

Let me check if ROILY has any disallowed letters:  
R (ok), O (ok), I (ok but must appear), L (ok), Y (ok).  
No A S E F N T C K P U D G – all clean.

Therefore ROILY is a valid next guess.

(Note: I also considered “ROVIL”, “ROBIM”, etc., but they aren’t common words; ROILY is the only standard English word fitting the constraints.)
