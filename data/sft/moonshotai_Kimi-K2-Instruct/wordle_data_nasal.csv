For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants, such as 'A', 'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', etc. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of getting positive feedback on at least some letters, which will help narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we must have somewhere in the word:
- A (must appear, but NOT in position 1 or 3)
- E (must appear, but NOT in position 2 or 5)

Letters we must avoid:
- R, O, S (from guess 1)
- L, N, T (from guess 2)

Available consonants we can still try (common ones):
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Available vowels we can still try:
I, U (since A and E are already confirmed present)

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and E, with:
- A NOT in positions 1 or 3
- E NOT in positions 2 or 5
- No R, O, S, L, N, T anywhere.

One word meeting these constraints is “CHAMP”:
- Contains A and E? No, it only contains A.  
We need A and E.

How about “CHIME”?  
- E is in position 5 → forbidden (feedback said E not in position 5).

“GAMED”:
- D is forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“CABER”:
- R is forbidden.

“PIVOT”:
- O and T are forbidden.

“PEACH”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“PLACE”:
- L is forbidden, and A in position 2 is allowed, but the word uses L.

“BEACH”:
- E is in position 2 → forbidden.

“PEAKY”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden.

“CAFE?” – no E.

We need to ensure both A and E are present and placed in allowed spots.

Try “BREAD”:
- R is forbidden.

“PEACH” already rejected.

“CACHE” – no E.

“PACER” – R and E in position 4, but R is forbidden.

“BAKER” – R forbidden.

“PAKES” – S forbidden.

“HAKE” – too short.

Let’s list positions constraints:

Positions:
1: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
2: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
3: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
4: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
5: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T

We need both A and E in the word, and they must be in allowed spots.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5 (but 3 is forbidden, 1 is forbidden)
Possible positions for E: 1,3,4 (but 2 and 5 are forbidden)

Possible patterns:
- A in 2, E in 1,3,4
- A in 4, E in 1,3
- A in 5, E in 1,3,4

Let’s try A in 2, E in 1:

“EAGLE” – L forbidden  
“EAGRE” – R forbidden  
“EAVED” – D forbidden  
“EASEL” – L forbidden  
“EATER” – R and T forbidden  
No good EA... words without forbidden letters.

- A NOT in positions 1 or 3
- E NOT in positions 2 or 5
- No R, O, S, L, N, T anywhere.

One word meeting these constraints is “CHAMP”:
- Contains A and E? No, it only contains A.  
We need A and E.

How about “CHIME”?  
- E is in position 5 → forbidden (feedback said E not in position 5).

“GAMED”:
- D is forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“CABER”:
- R is forbidden.

“PIVOT”:
- O and T are forbidden.

“PEACH”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“PLACE”:
- L is forbidden, and A in position 2 is allowed, but the word uses L.

“BEACH”:
- E is in position 2 → forbidden.

“PEAKY”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden.

“CAFE?” – no E.

We need to ensure both A and E are present and placed in allowed spots.

Try “BREAD”:
- R is forbidden.

“PEACH” already rejected.

“CACHE” – no E.

“PACER” – R and E in position 4, but R is forbidden.

“BAKER” – R forbidden.

“PAKES” – S forbidden.

“HAKE” – too short.

Let’s list positions constraints:

Positions:
1: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
2: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
3: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
4: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
5: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T

We need both A and E in the word, and they must be in allowed spots.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5 (but 3 is forbidden, 1 is forbidden)
Possible positions for E: 1,3,4 (but 2 and 5 are forbidden)

Possible patterns:
- A in 2, E in 1,3,4
- A in 4, E in 1,3
- A in 5, E in 1,3,4

Let’s try A in 2, E in 1:

Word pattern: E A _ _ _

Valid consonants for 3,4,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Is there a word EA _ _ _ ?  
“EAGER” – R forbidden  
“EARTH” – R and T forbidden  
“EAGLE” – L forbidden  
“EAGRE” – R forbidden  
“EAVED” – D forbidden  
“EASEL” – L forbidden  
“EATER” – R and T forbidden  
No good EA... words without forbidden letters.

Next: A in 4, E in 1:

E _ _ A _

E _ _ A _ :  
“EQUAL” – L forbidden  
“EXACT” – T forbidden  
“EVADE” – D forbidden  
“EMAIL” – L forbidden  
“EXALT” – T forbidden  
“ECLAT” – T forbidden  
No good.

Next: A in 4, E in 3:

_ _ E A _

“CHEAP” – P allowed, no forbidden letters  
C, H, E, A, P – all allowed letters  
Check constraints:  
A in position 4 – allowed (not 1 or 3)  
E in position 3 – allowed (not 2 or 5)  
Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none are R, O, S, L, N, T  
This seems valid.

Let’s choose “CHEAP”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
- A (and its only correct position is 4).

Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word  
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P

Thus the word is of the form _ _ _ A _ (A fixed at 4) and must contain the letter A (already satisfied).

Allowed remaining letters:  
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y … etc.

We need three consonants or vowels for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (position 4 is A).

A five-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ _ A _ that uses only the remaining letters and includes no forbidden ones is “BAGGY”.

But G is allowed twice?  Let’s check: G is not forbidden.  The pattern _ _ _ A _ with letters B-A-G-G-Y gives positions: B G G A Y – but we don’t know if G may repeat.  A safer single-use word is “UMBRA” – but R is forbidden.  Another candidate: “FUGAL” – L is forbidden.

A clean candidate with single-use allowed letters is “VIRGA” – however G is allowed; but we must check:  
V, I, R, G, A – R is forbidden.

Next: “BRIAR” – R is forbidden.

“MAGMA” – M, A, G, M, A – repeats M and A, and A is already in position 4; but we only know A must appear, not how many times.  However, position 4 is fixed A; repeats of A elsewhere are not ruled out, but we want a word with only one A to limit repeats.

“FIGHT” – F, I, G, H, T – H and T forbidden.

“BIGGY” – G twice, but B, I, G, G, Y – letters B, I, G, Y are all unconstrained.  However, position 4 must be A.

The simplest valid word that fits _ _ _ A _ without any forbidden letters is “VIRGA” again – but R is out.

Another attempt: “DINGY” – but N is out.

“GUMMY” – M twice, but G, U, M, M, Y – U, G, M, Y allowed, pattern _ _ _ A _ doesn’t fit.

Let’s list:

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters for 1, 2, 3, 5 chosen from:  
Allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

A straightforward word: “BUMPY” – but P is forbidden.

“BUMID” – not a valid English word.

“BIGGA” – not a word.

“WIMPY” – P forbidden.

Finally, a legitimate English word fitting the pattern is “VIGIA” – although A repeats, it may.  But I, G, I, A allowed, pattern V I G I A: A in position 4, no forbidden letters.

But let’s pick a simpler one: “BUDDY” – D twice, but D is allowed; however, the pattern is _ _ _ A _, so it must end with A – no.

Correct pattern: _ _ _ A _  
We need a word like “BUMKA” – but it is not valid.

Real word: “FUGIA” – F, U, G, I, A – all allowed, A at 4.  But is it valid?  Dictionary shows “FUGIA” not recognized.

Valid word: “BUDDY” is not the pattern.

A genuine word fitting _ _ _ A _ and using only allowed letters: “VIGIA” isn’t common; instead, let’s use “BUDDY” again but realize pattern must be _ _ _ A _.

A correct word: “MUDRA” – M, U, D, R, A – R is out.

Finally, simplest valid word: “BULGA” – but L is out.

Valid and common word: “FRIAR” – R out.

Actually we can use “VIMBA” – M, B allowed, A at 4.

But “VIMBA” is obscure.

The best simple valid word found quickly is “MUGGA” – again G twice.

A standard word without repeats and only allowed letters: “FIDIA” – not standard.

Recheck allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A straightforward word: “MUDIY” – not a word.

Eventually, a real word: “WIMPY” – P out.

Another: “GUMMY” – M twice, but pattern _ _ _ A _ needed.

Let’s construct explicitly.

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters from the allowed set for positions 1,2,3 and one for 5.

Next, “KUDVA” – not a word.

A real word: “DUMKA” – D, U, M, K allowed: D U M K A.

That is a valid English word (a Slavic dance form), and meets all constraints:
- D, U, M, K are all not forbidden.
- A is in position 4 (correct per feedback).

- R, O, S are all NOT in the word at all.

We already know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S
- Letters we must include somewhere: A, E
- The word does NOT start with A and does NOT end with E.

Goal for the second guess:
- Use A and E in new positions.
- Avoid R, O, S entirely.
- Choose common consonants to test.

Candidate letters we can still use: A, E, plus consonants such as T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A balanced word that meets these rules is “LEANT”:
- L, N, T are new consonants.
- E and A appear but in positions 2 and 4 instead of 5 and 1, satisfying the feedback.

Let’s try A in 2, E in 1:

Word pattern: E A _ _ _

Valid consonants for 3,4,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Is there a word EA _ _ _ ?  
“EAGER” – R forbidden  
“EARTH” – R and T forbidden  
“EAGLE” – L forbidden  
“EAGRE” – R forbidden  
“EAVED” – D forbidden  
“EASEL” – L forbidden  
“EATER” – R and T forbidden  
No good EA... words without forbidden letters.

Next: A in 4, E in 1:

E _ _ A _

E _ _ A _ :  
“EQUAL” – L forbidden  
“EXACT” – T forbidden  
“EVADE” – D forbidden  
“EMAIL” – L forbidden  
“EXALT” – T forbidden  
“ECLAT” – T forbidden  
No good.

Next: A in 4, E in 3:

_ _ E A _

“CHEAP” – P allowed, no forbidden letters  
C, H, E, A, P – all allowed letters  
Check constraints:  
A in position 4 – allowed (not 1 or 3)  
E in position 3 – allowed (not 2 or 5)  
Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none are R, O, S, L, N, T  
This seems valid.

Let’s choose “CHEAP”.

<guess>CHEAP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: CHEAP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(x) A(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
- A (and its only correct position is 4).

Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word  
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P

Thus the word is of the form _ _ _ A _ (A fixed at 4) and must contain the letter A (already satisfied).

Allowed remaining letters:  
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y … etc.

We need three consonants or vowels for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (position 4 is A).

A five-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ _ A _ that uses only the remaining letters and includes no forbidden ones is “BAGGY”.

But G is allowed twice?  Let’s check: G is not forbidden.  The pattern _ _ _ A _ with letters B-A-G-G-Y gives positions: B G G A Y – but we don’t know if G may repeat.  A safer single-use word is “UMBRA” – but R is forbidden.  Another candidate: “FUGAL” – L is forbidden.

A clean candidate with single-use allowed letters is “VIRGA” – however G is allowed; but we must check:  
V, I, R, G, A – R is forbidden.

Next: “BRIAR” – R is forbidden.

“MAGMA” – M, A, G, M, A – repeats M and A, and A is already in position 4; but we only know A must appear, not how many times.  However, position 4 is fixed A; repeats of A elsewhere are not ruled out, but we want a word with only one A to limit repeats.

“FIGHT” – F, I, G, H, T – H and T forbidden.

“BIGGY” – G twice, but B, I, G, G, Y – letters B, I, G, Y are all unconstrained.  However, position 4 must be A.

The simplest valid word that fits _ _ _ A _ without any forbidden letters is “VIRGA” again – but R is out.

Another attempt: “DINGY” – but N is out.

“GUMMY” – M twice, but G, U, M, M, Y – U, G, M, Y allowed, pattern _ _ _ A _ doesn’t fit.

Let’s list:

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters for 1, 2, 3, 5 chosen from:  
Allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

A straightforward word: “BUMPY” – but P is forbidden.

“BUMID” – not a valid English word.

“BIGGA” – not a word.

“WIMPY” – P forbidden.

Finally, a legitimate English word fitting the pattern is “VIGIA” – although A repeats, it may.  But I, G, I, A allowed, pattern V I G I A: A in position 4, no forbidden letters.

But let’s pick a simpler one: “BUDDY” – D twice, but D is allowed; however, the pattern is _ _ _ A _, so it must end with A – no.

Correct pattern: _ _ _ A _  
We need a word like “BUMKA” – but it is not valid.

Real word: “FUGIA” – F, U, G, I, A – all allowed, A at 4.  But is it valid?  Dictionary shows “FUGIA” not recognized.

Valid word: “BUDDY” is not the pattern.

A genuine word fitting _ _ _ A _ and using only allowed letters: “VIGIA” isn’t common; instead, let’s use “BUDDY” again but realize pattern must be _ _ _ A _.

A correct word: “MUDRA” – M, U, D, R, A – R is out.

Finally, simplest valid word: “BULGA” – but L is out.

Valid and common word: “FRIAR” – R out.

Actually we can use “VIMBA” – M, B allowed, A at 4.

But “VIMBA” is obscure.

The best simple valid word found quickly is “MUGGA” – again G twice.

A standard word without repeats and only allowed letters: “FIDIA” – not standard.

Recheck allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A straightforward word: “MUDIY” – not a word.

Eventually, a real word: “WIMPY” – P out.

Another: “GUMMY” – M twice, but pattern _ _ _ A _ needed.

Let’s construct explicitly.

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters from the allowed set for positions 1,2,3 and one for 5.

Candidate: B I G A D → “BIGAD” – not valid.

B I K A D → “BIKAD” – invalid.

B U G A Y – “BUGAY” – invalid.

F U G A Y – “FUGAY” – invalid.

G U M A D – “GUMAD” – invalid.

But a recognized word: “VIMBA” – M, B allowed, A at 4.

However, in Wordle solutions, “VIMBA” is rare.

The most common valid word that fits _ _ _ A _ with remaining letters is “MUDRA” but R out.

Next, “KUDVA” – not a word.

A real word: “DUMKA” – D, U, M, K allowed: D U M K A.

That is a valid English word (a Slavic dance form), and meets all constraints:
- D, U, M, K are all not forbidden.
- A is in position 4 (correct per feedback).
- Letters used: D, U, M, K, A – none of the forbidden letters.

So the next guess is “DUMKA”.

Feedback summary so far:

1. A must appear in the word, but its only confirmed position is 4 (from CHEAP).  
   However, in DUMKA the A appeared in position 5 and received “-” (wrong position), so A is in the word but **not** in position 5 either.

2. Forbidden letters (never appear anywhere):  
   R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P, D, U, M, K

3. Pattern we now know:  
   _ _ _ _ A is impossible (A not at 4 and not at 5)  
   Therefore A must be in position 2 or 3.

4. Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
   B, F, G, I, V, W, Y, plus the required A and the vowels I and (possibly) others.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and only in position 2 or 3)  
- Contains none of the 14 forbidden letters  
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

A quick scan of common words:
- If A is in position 2: B_A_ _  
  B is allowed, I, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Example: “BAWDI” – but D is forbidden.  
  “BAFFY” – uses only allowed letters and is a valid word.

- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _  
  Example: “VIBRA” – R forbidden.  
  “BIGGY” – G allowed, but pattern needs A.

The simplest valid word meeting constraints is “BAFFY”.

Check:
B A F F Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed)  
Letters: B, A, F, F, Y – none are forbidden.

Hence we guess BAFFY.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants, such as 'A', 'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', etc. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of getting positive feedback on at least some letters, which will help narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so the word contains A but not in the 1st slot).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (E is in the word but not in the 5th slot).
- R, O, S are all NOT in the word at all.

We already know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, S
- Letters we must include somewhere: A, E
- The word does NOT start with A and does NOT end with E.

Goal for the second guess:
- Use A and E in new positions.
- Avoid R, O, S entirely.
- Choose common consonants to test.

Candidate letters we can still use: A, E, plus consonants such as T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A balanced word that meets these rules is “LEANT”:
- L, N, T are new consonants.
- E and A appear but in positions 2 and 4 instead of 5 and 1, satisfying the feedback.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we must have somewhere in the word:
- A (must appear, but NOT in position 1 or 3)
- E (must appear, but NOT in position 2 or 5)

Letters we must avoid:
- R, O, S (from guess 1)
- L, N, T (from guess 2)

Available consonants we can still try (common ones):
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Available vowels we can still try:
I, U (since A and E are already confirmed present)

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and E, with:
- A NOT in positions 1 or 3
- E NOT in positions 2 or 5
- No R, O, S, L, N, T anywhere.

One word meeting these constraints is “CHAMP”:
- Contains A and E? No, it only contains A.  
We need A and E.

How about “CHIME”?  
- E is in position 5 → forbidden (feedback said E not in position 5).

“GAMED”:
- D is forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“CABER”:
- R is forbidden.

“PIVOT”:
- O and T are forbidden.

“PEACH”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden (from LEANT feedback).

“PLACE”:
- L is forbidden, and A in position 2 is allowed, but the word uses L.

“BEACH”:
- E is in position 2 → forbidden.

“PEAKY”:
- E in position 2 → forbidden.

“CAFE?” – no E.

We need to ensure both A and E are present and placed in allowed spots.

Try “BREAD”:
- R is forbidden.

“PEACH” already rejected.

“CACHE” – no E.

“PACER” – R and E in position 4, but R is forbidden.

“BAKER” – R forbidden.

“PAKES” – S forbidden.

“HAKE” – too short.

Let’s list positions constraints:

Positions:
1: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
2: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
3: not A, not R, O, S, L, N, T
4: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T
5: not E, not R, O, S, L, N, T

We need both A and E in the word, and they must be in allowed spots.

Possible positions for A: 2,4,5 (but 3 is forbidden, 1 is forbidden)
Possible positions for E: 1,3,4 (but 2 and 5 are forbidden)

Possible patterns:
- A in 2, E in 1,3,4
- A in 4, E in 1,3
- A in 5, E in 1,3,4

Let’s try A in 2, E in 1:

Word pattern: E A _ _ _

Valid consonants for 3,4,5: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Is there a word EA _ _ _ ?  
“EAGER” – R forbidden  
“EARTH” – R and T forbidden  
“EAGLE” – L forbidden  
“EAGRE” – R forbidden  
“EAVED” – D forbidden  
“EASEL” – L forbidden  
“EATER” – R and T forbidden  
No good EA... words without forbidden letters.

Next: A in 4, E in 1:

E _ _ A _

E _ _ A _ :  
“EQUAL” – L forbidden  
“EXACT” – T forbidden  
“EVADE” – D forbidden  
“EMAIL” – L forbidden  
“EXALT” – T forbidden  
“ECLAT” – T forbidden  
No good.

Next: A in 4, E in 3:

_ _ E A _

“CHEAP” – P allowed, no forbidden letters  
C, H, E, A, P – all allowed letters  
Check constraints:  
A in position 4 – allowed (not 1 or 3)  
E in position 3 – allowed (not 2 or 5)  
Letters: C, H, E, A, P – none are R, O, S, L, N, T  
This seems valid.

Let’s choose “CHEAP”.

<guess>CHEAP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: CHEAP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) E(x) A(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters confirmed to be in the word  
- A (and its only correct position is 4).

Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word  
R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P

Thus the word is of the form _ _ _ A _ (A fixed at 4) and must contain the letter A (already satisfied).

Allowed remaining letters:  
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y … etc.

We need three consonants or vowels for positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 (position 4 is A).

A five-letter word fitting the pattern _ _ _ A _ that uses only the remaining letters and includes no forbidden ones is “BAGGY”.

But G is allowed twice?  Let’s check: G is not forbidden.  The pattern _ _ _ A _ with letters B-A-G-G-Y gives positions: B G G A Y – but we don’t know if G may repeat.  A safer single-use word is “UMBRA” – but R is forbidden.  Another candidate: “FUGAL” – L is forbidden.

A clean candidate with single-use allowed letters is “VIRGA” – however G is allowed; but we must check:  
V, I, R, G, A – R is forbidden.

Next: “BRIAR” – R is forbidden.

“MAGMA” – M, A, G, M, A – repeats M and A, and A is already in position 4; but we only know A must appear, not how many times.  However, position 4 is fixed A; repeats of A elsewhere are not ruled out, but we want a word with only one A to limit repeats.

“FIGHT” – F, I, G, H, T – H and T forbidden.

“BIGGY” – G twice, but B, I, G, G, Y – letters B, I, G, Y are all unconstrained.  However, position 4 must be A.

The simplest valid word that fits _ _ _ A _ without any forbidden letters is “VIRGA” again – but R is out.

Another attempt: “DINGY” – but N is out.

“GUMMY” – M twice, but G, U, M, M, Y – U, G, M, Y allowed, pattern _ _ _ A _ doesn’t fit.

Let’s list:

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters for 1, 2, 3, 5 chosen from:  
Allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

A straightforward word: “BUMPY” – but P is forbidden.

“BUMID” – not a valid English word.

“BIGGA” – not a word.

“WIMPY” – P forbidden.

Finally, a legitimate English word fitting the pattern is “VIGIA” – although A repeats, it may.  But I, G, I, A allowed, pattern V I G I A: A in position 4, no forbidden letters.

But let’s pick a simpler one: “BUDDY” – D twice, but D is allowed; however, the pattern is _ _ _ A _, so it must end with A – no.

Correct pattern: _ _ _ A _  
We need a word like “BUMKA” – but it is not valid.

Real word: “FUGIA” – F, U, G, I, A – all allowed, A at 4.  But is it valid?  Dictionary shows “FUGIA” not recognized.

Valid word: “BUDDY” is not the pattern.

A genuine word fitting _ _ _ A _ and using only allowed letters: “VIGIA” isn’t common; instead, let’s use “BUDDY” again but realize pattern must be _ _ _ A _.

A correct word: “MUDRA” – M, U, D, R, A – R is out.

Finally, simplest valid word: “BULGA” – but L is out.

Valid and common word: “FRIAR” – R out.

Actually we can use “VIMBA” – M, B allowed, A at 4.

But “VIMBA” is obscure.

The best simple valid word found quickly is “MUGGA” – again G twice.

A standard word without repeats and only allowed letters: “FIDIA” – not standard.

Recheck allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A straightforward word: “MUDIY” – not a word.

Eventually, a real word: “WIMPY” – P out.

Another: “GUMMY” – M twice, but pattern _ _ _ A _ needed.

Let’s construct explicitly.

Pattern: 1 2 3 4 5  
           _ _ _ A _

We need three letters from the allowed set for positions 1,2,3 and one for 5.

Candidate: B I G A D → “BIGAD” – not valid.

B I K A D → “BIKAD” – invalid.

B U G A Y – “BUGAY” – invalid.

F U G A Y – “FUGAY” – invalid.

G U M A D – “GUMAD” – invalid.

But a recognized word: “VIMBA” – M, B allowed, A at 4.

However, in Wordle solutions, “VIMBA” is rare.

The most common valid word that fits _ _ _ A _ with remaining letters is “MUDRA” but R out.

Next, “KUDVA” – not a word.

A real word: “DUMKA” – D, U, M, K allowed: D U M K A.

That is a valid English word (a Slavic dance form), and meets all constraints:
- D, U, M, K are all not forbidden.
- A is in position 4 (correct per feedback).
- Letters used: D, U, M, K, A – none of the forbidden letters.

So the next guess is “DUMKA”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary so far:

1. A must appear in the word, but its only confirmed position is 4 (from CHEAP).  
   However, in DUMKA the A appeared in position 5 and received “-” (wrong position), so A is in the word but **not** in position 5 either.

2. Forbidden letters (never appear anywhere):  
   R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P, D, U, M, K

3. Pattern we now know:  
   _ _ _ _ A is impossible (A not at 4 and not at 5)  
   Therefore A must be in position 2 or 3.

4. Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
   B, F, G, I, V, W, Y, plus the required A and the vowels I and (possibly) others.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and only in position 2 or 3)  
- Contains none of the 14 forbidden letters  
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

A quick scan of common words:
- If A is in position 2: B_A_ _  
  B is allowed, I, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Example: “BAWDI” – but D is forbidden.  
  “BAFFY” – uses only allowed letters and is a valid word.

- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _  
  Example: “VIBRA” – R forbidden.  
  “BIGGY” – G allowed, but pattern needs A.

The simplest valid word meeting constraints is “BAFFY”.

Check:
B A F F Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed)  
Letters: B, A, F, F, Y – none are forbidden.

Hence we guess BAFFY.

Summary of everything we now know

- The word definitely contains the letter A, and A is **only** in position 3 (from BAFFY’s feedback: A(✓) at slot 3).
- Therefore the pattern is _ _ A _ _
- Forbidden letters (never appear anywhere): R, O, S, L, N, T, C, H, E, P, D, U, M, K, B, F, Y
- Allowed letters left: G, I, V, W (plus the already-placed A)
- We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and two consonants or vowels for positions 4 and 5, drawn only from the allowed set, forming a real 5-letter word.

The only remaining vowel is I; the consonants still possible are G, V, W.

Try to build a valid word:
- G, I, V, W can be used.
- We must have _ _ A _ _
- A real word using only {G, I, V, W, A} is “VIGIA” (a rare but valid word).  
  V I G I A satisfies every rule:
  – A is fixed in position 3.  
  – All letters V, I, G are still allowed.  
  – No forbidden letters appear.

Hence our sixth (final) guess is VIGIA.
