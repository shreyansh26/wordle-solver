Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters in diverse positions to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Popular choices for first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (covers common letters: S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains 3 very common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T), which should provide good coverage for initial feedback.

From the feedback:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, I can eliminate any word containing S, L, T, E and must include A somewhere other than the 3rd letter.

Good next-step words should:
1. Include A in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
2. Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Use other common consonants not yet tested (like R, N, M, C, D, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- MARON (using M, R, N with A in 2nd position)
- RANCH (R, N, C, H with A in 2nd)
- CANDY (C, N, D, Y with A in 2nd)
- MARRY (M, R, R, Y with A in 2nd)

I'll choose ""MARRY"" because it uses common letters (M, R, Y) and places A in position 2, which wasn't tested before. The double R helps test that letter twice efficiently.

We now know:
- The word starts with M and has A in the second position: M A _ _ _
- Letters S, L, T, E, R, Y are all absent.
- Still need 3 more letters for positions 3-5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the ruled-out letters).

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Since A is already the second letter, we might consider adding one or two more vowels (I, O, U) to fill out the word. Common English patterns for M A _ _ _ include:
- M A I N _ (but N is still possible)
- M A N _ _ (but N is still possible)
- M A C _ _
- M A D _ _
- M A H _ _
- M A C H _ (but not a 5-letter word)

Let's list some 5-letter words that fit M A _ _ _, use only allowed letters, and test new common letters:
- M A C H O (tests C, H, O)
- M A N I C (tests N, I, C)
- M A D I O (tests D, I, O)
- M A H I D (tests H, I, D)

""MACON"" is a town name, but not sure if it's valid. ""MACHO"" is valid and uses common letters C, H, O. ""MANIC"" is valid but uses N, I, C. 

I'll choose M A C H O as it tests O (a vowel) and common consonants C, H.

But wait, is ""MACHO"" valid? Yes, it's a common word meaning tough or masculine.

But let me double-check the letters:
- M: confirmed at position 1.
- A: confirmed at position 2.
- C, H, O: new letters not yet tested.
- No S, L, T, E, R, Y are used.
