Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. The optimal first guess in Wordle aims to maximize information gain by covering common letters and their positions. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular because it contains the five most frequently used letters in English (E, A, R, O, T - though note S and L are also very common). However, ""CRANE"" is another excellent choice that covers common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:

1. C and R are very common consonants in English
2. A and E are the two most common vowels
3. N is also a frequently occurring letter
4. This combination gives good coverage across the alphabet and positions

This should provide valuable information about which of these common letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- N and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains C, R, and A somewhere.  
- Does NOT contain N or E.  
- The positions of C, R, and A are not 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respectively.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses C, R, and A exactly once each (since they only appeared once in CRANE).  
- Avoids N and E entirely.  
- Places C, R, and A in different positions from their original spots in CRANE.

Good candidates: 
- ""C"" cannot be in 1st place, ""R"" cannot be in 2nd, ""A"" cannot be in 3rd.
- We need two additional letters (not N or E). Common remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc. Vowels: I, O, U.

One strong option is ""CARTS"":
- C is now in 1st place (allowed since it wasn't in 1st place? Wait no, feedback said C is in word but wrong position, so 1st place is NOT correct for C. So CARTS is invalid for C in 1st.)
Next option: ""TRACS"" (but this has C in 5th, R in 2nd - R was originally 2nd, and feedback says R is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is invalid for R. So TRACS is invalid for R in 2nd.)
Another: ""ARCUS"":
- A in 1st (original was 3rd - ok)
- R in 2nd (original was 2nd - invalid, as feedback says R is in word but wrong position, so 2nd is wrong)
Next: ""SCRAM"":
- S, C, R, A, M
- C is 2nd (original was 1st - ok)
- R is 3rd (original was 2nd - ok)
- A is 4th (original was 3rd - ok)
- No N or E
This seems valid.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts
1. Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
   - C, R, A, M  (from the “-” feedback on SCRAM)
   - plus the earlier C, R, A from CRANE

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - N, E (from CRANE)
   - S (from SCRAM)

3. Position constraints so far
   - C: cannot be 1st (CRANE) or 2nd (SCRAM)
   - R: cannot be 2nd (CRANE) or 3rd (SCRAM)
   - A: cannot be 3rd (CRANE) or 4th (SCRAM)
   - M: cannot be 5th (SCRAM)

4. We have four distinct known letters (C, R, A, M) and we still need one more letter that
   - is not S, N, E, C, R, A, M.

Remaining frequent consonants: T, L, D, B, G, H, K, P, V, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y.

Possible next word must:
- use C, R, A, M exactly once each
- use one new letter
- satisfy all the positional bans above.

Let’s list valid placements for each of the four letters:

C: allowed in 3,4,5
R: allowed in 1,4,5
A: allowed in 1,2,5
M: allowed in 1,2,3,4

We need one more slot filled with a new letter.

Trying to build words systematically:

Example pattern: _ _ C R A  – invalid (needs 5 letters, and we already have C,R,A,M)
Instead look for 5-letter words that include C,R,A,M plus one new letter, respecting positions.

Try “CAMRY”
   C 1st – banned

Try “MACRO”
   C 3rd – ok
   R 4th – ok
   A 2nd – ok
   M 1st – ok
   new letter O – ok
   Word: MACRO
   Check positions:
      C (3) – allowed
      R (4) – allowed
      A (2) – allowed
      M (1) – allowed
      No S,N,E
   This satisfies every constraint.

Let’s double-check no letter repeats: MACRO uses M,A,C,R,O – all distinct and each of C,R,A,M appears once.

Therefore MACRO is a valid next guess.
