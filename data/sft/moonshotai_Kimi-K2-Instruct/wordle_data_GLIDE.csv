For the first guess, since we have no feedback yet, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we can gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

Feedback so far:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (the last letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and none of A, R, O, S appear anywhere.  
A good next step is to introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
Some frequent unused letters that could fit: T, L, N, I, U, C, D, M, P, H, etc.

A balanced candidate word ending in E and avoiding the forbidden letters is:

T, I, N, E, _ → T is good, I and N haven’t been tested, and E is fixed at the end.  
That gives us “T I N _ E”.  
A common 5-letter word matching that pattern is “TINPE” (but “PINPE” isn’t a word).  
A valid word with these constraints is “TIDES” (but S is excluded).  
Another valid word ending in E and avoiding A,R,O,S is “UNITE”.

“UNITE” uses U, N, I, T (all new letters) and keeps E in the fifth position.

Let me double-check:  
U(x? no, never tested)  
N(x? no)  
I(x? no)  
T(x? no)

Let’s update what we know from all feedback so far.

1. Positively placed letters
   - Position 4: I  (from UNITE feedback)  
   - Position 5: E  (from both AROSE and UNITE)

   So pattern: _ _ _ I E

2. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word at all  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, P

3. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions  
   - E appears once (already at position 5)  
   - L must appear somewhere other than position 2  
   - D must appear somewhere other than position 5

4. Remaining unused common letters  
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus the misplaced L and D.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
   - Ends with “IE” (positions 4-5)  
   - Contains the letter L somewhere (but not in position 2)  
   - Contains the letter D somewhere (but not in position 5)  
   - Uses no banned letters

Possible placements of L and D: positions 1, 2, 3, or 4—but position 4 is already “I”.  
So valid positions:
   - L can be in 1, 3  
   - D can be in 1, 2, 3

Let’s try putting L at position 1 and D at position 2 → “L D _ I E”.  
Real word? “LD” isn’t a normal start; no 5-letter word looks like that.

Try L at position 1 and D at position 3 → “L _ D I E”.  
Real word: “LIDIE” – not an English word.

Try L at position 3 and D at position 1 → “D _ L I E”.  
Valid word: “DLILE” – not a word.

Try L at position 3 and D at position 2 → “_ D L I E”.  
Valid word: “DLIE_” – still nothing.

Try L at position 2 and D at position 1 → “D L _ I E”.  
Valid word: “DLIE_” – again, nothing.

Wait, let’s step back. We need both L and D to appear, but L must be in position 1 or 3, and D must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let’s list every valid permutation:

1. D L _ I E → “DLIE_” – nothing  
2. D _ L I E → “DLIE_” – nothing  
3. L _ D I E → “LIDIE” – no  
4. _ D L I E → “DLIE_” – no  
5. _ L D I E → “LDIE_” – no  
6. L D _ I E – nothing

None of the above give an English word. That means a single D and a single L cannot both fit in positions 1-3 while keeping the final “IE”.

Therefore, one of L or D must be in the word more than once – but we have no evidence that duplicate letters exist, and the feedback has never indicated duplicates.

So re-evaluate: maybe we misunderstood. The feedback for PLIED showed:
   P(x)  L(✓)  I(✓)  E(-)  D(-)

That means:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (currently at pos 2, so it’s wrong place)  
- I is correctly in position 4  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (but we know E IS in position 5 from previous feedback!)

This is contradictory unless the feedback means relative to the word “PLIED” only. Re-reading the feedback rules carefully: feedback is always relative to the guess provided, not cumulative in terms of positions. So:

For PLIED:
   P(x) – P is not in the word at all  
   L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2 of PLIED)  
   I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3 of PLIED)  
   E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4 of PLIED)  
   D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 of PLIED)

This makes more sense. Let’s re-summarize:

From all feedback:

1. Letters not in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, P  
2. Correctly placed letters from PLIED:
   - Position 2: L  
   - Position 3: I  

   So pattern: _ L I _ _

3. Letters present but misplaced from PLIED:
   - E is somewhere other than position 4 (but we already know from UNITE that E is in position 5, so that’s consistent)  
   - D is somewhere other than position 5

Thus, the word is: _ L I _ E  
And D must appear in position 1 or 4 (but position 4 is E), so D must be in position 1.

Word must be: D L I _ E  
No letter in position 4 yet, and we have remaining unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y

Looking for a 5-letter word: D L I _ E  
Valid word: “DLIVE” – but not English  
“DLITE” – no  
“DLICE” – no  
“DLIVE” – not a word  

Actually, the only common English word fitting this is “DLITE” which is “DELITE” misspelled. Nothing else.

Wait, perhaps position 4 can be a letter not yet used. The pattern is _ L I _ E, and D must appear somewhere (positions 1 or 4). Position 4 is E, so D must be in position 1.

Thus word must be D L I _ E. The 4th letter must be a letter not yet used in any guess and not banned. Remaining unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y.

Valid 5-letter word: DLIVE – not English  
DLIDE – no  
DLIKE – no  

Actually, the word “DLIKE” is not a standard English word. Only possible valid word is:

“D-L-I-C-E” – “DLICE” – not a word  
“D-L-I-V-E” – “DLIVE” – no  

Real word fitting this pattern is “DLITE” – not recognized.

Real common English word: “CLIME” – but C is unused, LIME is 4 letters.  

Wait, let’s try a different approach. Maybe D is not at position 1. The pattern is _ L I _ E, and D must appear somewhere in the word (not position 5). So D could be in position 1 or 4, but position 4 is E, so D must be in position 1.

Thus the word is literally “DLI_E” – no English word exists.

But wait, the feedback says D is in the word but not in position 5. The pattern is _ L I _ E, so the only place left for D is position 1 or 4, but position 4 is E. So D must be in position 1.

Word must be D L I _ E. The only English word that fits is “DLITE” – but that’s not standard.  

Actually, the word “GLIDE” fits if we ignore D constraint, but D is misplaced from position 5, so D can be in 1-4.

Word must be _ L I _ E, with D somewhere 1-4, and no banned letters.

Possible English word: “FLIED” – F is unused, L is in pos 2, I in 3, E in 5, D in 4. That fits all constraints.

Let me check:
- Pattern: _ L I _ E → F L I D E  
- Letters: F (unused), L (correct pos 2), I (correct pos 3), D (now in pos 4, was misplaced from pos 5), E (correct pos 5)  
- No banned letters appear

“FLIED” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning past tense of fly.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since we have no feedback yet, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the information we can gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us a good starting point to narrow down possible letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (the last letter).

So the secret word ends with E, and none of A, R, O, S appear anywhere.  
A good next step is to introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet.  
Some frequent unused letters that could fit: T, L, N, I, U, C, D, M, P, H, etc.

A balanced candidate word ending in E and avoiding the forbidden letters is:

T, I, N, E, _ → T is good, I and N haven’t been tested, and E is fixed at the end.  
That gives us “T I N _ E”.  
A common 5-letter word matching that pattern is “TINPE” (but “PINPE” isn’t a word).  
A valid word with these constraints is “TIDES” (but S is excluded).  
Another valid word ending in E and avoiding A,R,O,S is “UNITE”.

“UNITE” uses U, N, I, T (all new letters) and keeps E in the fifth position.

Let me double-check:  
U(x? no, never tested)  
N(x? no)  
I(x? no)  
T(x? no)  
E(✓, good)  
Word is valid, avoids banned letters.

So I will guess “UNITE”.

<guess>UNITE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNITE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

1. Letters excluded: A, R, O, S, U, N, T
2. Letters confirmed:

   - Position 5: E (✓)

So the pattern is: _ _ I _ E

We now need two initial letters and one middle letter, all drawn from the still-unused letters.

Good remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

Looking for frequent consonant pairs at the start (like BL-, CL-, FL-, GL-, PL-, SL-). Since S is out, SL- is impossible. PL- is still valid. So we might try P L I _ E. A valid word fitting that is “PLIED”.

Check:
- P (not yet tested)
- L (not yet tested)
- I (confirmed in position 4)
- E (confirmed in position 5)
- D (not yet tested)
- No excluded letters appear.

“PLIED” is a real 5-letter word and respects all constraints.

- Letters: F (unused), L (correct pos 2), I (correct pos 3), D (now in pos 4, was misplaced from pos 5), E (correct pos 5)  
- No banned letters appear

“FLIED” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning past tense of fly.

Remaining unused common letters  \n   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus the misplaced L and D.\n\nWe need a 5-letter English word that:\n   - Ends with “IE” (positions 4-5)  \n   - Contains the letter L somewhere (but not in position 2)  \n   - Contains the letter D somewhere (but not in position 5)  \n   - Uses no banned letters\n\nPossible placements of L and D: positions 1, 2, 3, or 4—but position 4 is already “I”.  \nSo valid positions:\n   - L can be in 1, 3  \n   - D can be in 1, 2, 3\n\nLet’s try putting L at position 1 and D at position 2 → “L D _ I E”.  \nReal word? “LD” isn’t a normal start; no 5-letter word looks like that.\n\nTry L at position 1 and D at position 3 → “L _ D I E”.  \nReal word: “LIDIE” – not an English word.\n\nTry L at position 3 and D at position 1 → “D _ L I E”.  \nValid word: “DLILE” – not a word.\n\nTry L at position 3 and D at position 2 → “_ D L I E”.  \nValid word: “DLIE_” – still nothing.\n\nTry L at position 2 and D at position 1 → “D L _ I E”.  \nValid word: “DLIE_” – again, nothing.\n\nWait, let’s step back. We need both L and D to appear, but L must be in position 1 or 3, and D must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let’s list every valid permutation:\n\n1. D L _ I E → “DLIE_” – nothing  \n2. D _ L I E → “DLIE_” – nothing  \n3. L _ D I E → “LIDIE” – no  \n4. _ D L I E → “DLIE_” – no  \n5. _ L D I E → “LDIE_” – no  \n6. L D _ I E – nothing\n\nNone of the above give an English word. That means a single D and a single L cannot both fit in positions 1-3 while keeping the final “IE”.\n\nTherefore, one of L or D must be in the word more than once – but we have no evidence that duplicate letters exist, and the feedback has never indicated duplicates.\n\nSo re-evaluate: maybe we misunderstood. The feedback for PLIED showed:\n   P(x)  L(✓)  I(✓)  E(-)  D(-)\n\nThat means:\n- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (currently at pos 2, so it’s wrong place)  \n- I is correctly in position 4  \n- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (but we know E IS in position 5 from previous feedback!)\n\nThis is contradictory unless the feedback means relative to the word “PLIED” only. Re-reading the feedback rules carefully: feedback is always relative to the guess provided, not cumulative in terms of positions. So:\n\nFor PLIED:\n   P(x) – P is not in the word at all  \n   L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (position 2 of PLIED)  \n   I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3 of PLIED)  \n   E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4 of PLIED)  \n   D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 of PLIED)\n\nThis makes more sense. Let’s re-summarize:\n\nFrom all feedback:\n\n1. Letters not in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, P  \n2. Correctly placed letters from PLIED:\n   - Position 2: L  \n   - Position 3: I  \n\n   So pattern: _ L I _ _\n\n3. Letters present but misplaced from PLIED:\n   - E is somewhere other than position 4 (but we already know from UNITE that E is in position 5, so that’s consistent)  \n   - D is somewhere other than position 5\n\nThus, the word is: _ L I _ E  \nAnd D must appear in position 1 or 4 (but position 4 is E), so D must be in position 1.\n\nWord must be: D L I _ E  \nNo letter in position 4 yet, and we have remaining unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y\n\nLooking for a 5-letter word: D L I _ E  \nValid word: “DLIVE” – but not English  \n“DLITE” – no  \n“DLICE” – no  \n“DLIVE” – not a word  \n\nActually, the only common English word fitting this is “DLITE” which is “DELITE” misspelled. Nothing else.\n\nWait, perhaps position 4 can be a letter not yet used. The pattern is _ L I _ E, and D must appear somewhere (positions 1 or 4). Position 4 is E, so D must be in position 1.\n\nThus word must be D L I _ E. The 4th letter must be a letter not yet used in any guess and not banned. Remaining unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y.\n\nValid 5-letter word: DLIVE – not English  \nDLIDE – no  \nDLIKE – no  \n\nActually, the word “DLIKE” is not a standard English word. Only possible valid word is:\n\n“D-L-I-C-E” – “DLICE” – not a word  \n“D-L-I-V-E” – “DLIVE” – no  \n\nReal word fitting this pattern is “DLITE” – not recognized.\n\nReal common English word: “CLIME” – but C is unused, LIME is 4 letters.  \n\nWait, let’s try a different approach. Maybe D is not at position 1. The pattern is _ L I _ E, and D must appear somewhere in the word (not position 5). So D could be in position 1 or 4, but position 4 is E, so D must be in position 1.\n\nThus the word is literally “DLI_E” – no English word exists.\n\nBut wait, the feedback says D is in the word but not in position 5. The pattern is _ L I _ E, so the only place left for D is position 1 or 4, but position 4 is E. So D must be in position 1.\n\nWord must be D L I _ E. The only English word that fits is “DLITE” – but that’s not standard.  \n\nActually, the word “GLIDE” fits if we ignore D constraint, but D is misplaced from position 5, so D can be in 1-4.\n\nWord must be _ L I _ E, with D somewhere 1-4, and no banned letters.\n\nPossible English word: “FLIED” – F is unused, L is in pos 2, I in 3, E in 5, D in 4. That fits all constraints.\n\nLet me check:\n- Pattern: _ L I _ E → F L I D E  \n- Letters: F (unused), L (correct pos 2), I (correct pos 3), D (now in pos 4, was misplaced from pos 5), E (correct pos 5)  \n- No banned letters appear\n\n“FLIED” is a valid 5-letter English word meaning past tense of fly.\n\n<guess>FLIED</guess>\n\n<guess>FLIED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: UNITE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: PLIED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) I(✓) E(-) D(-)\nGuess 4: FLIED -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) I(✓) E(-) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
Current confirmed facts

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, P, F

2. Letters that are correctly placed  
   - Position 4: I  (from UNITE)  
   - Position 5: E  (from AROSE and UNITE)  
   Therefore the word ends: _ _ _ I E

3. Letters that are present but misplaced in PLIED / FLIED
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it’s marked ✓ in position 2 of PLIED/FLIED, but that only means it’s in the correct position for those specific guesses, which contradicts the positional info from UNITE).  
     Actually, re-reading:  
     – In UNITE: I is in position 4 and E in position 5 (✓).  
     – In PLIED: L is marked ✓ in position 2, but that must mean L is in the word and in position 2 (because the ✓ is relative to the guess, not the secret word).  
     – In FLIED: same.  
     This means the word must have L in position 2 and ends in IE.  
   - D and E were marked “-”, meaning they are in the word but in wrong positions.  
     – E we already know is in position 5 (so “-” just confirms it’s not in the position shown in those guesses).  
   - D must appear somewhere other than position 5 (already satisfied) and other than position 4 (because position 4 is I).  
     So D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
     But position 2 is L, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

So the pattern is:  
   [D or ?] L [D or ?] I E

Let’s list the possibilities:

1. D in position 1 and position 3 empty → D L _ I E  
   Possible valid word: DLICE (not a word), DLIVE (not a word), DLIKE (not a word), DLIME (not a word) → no standard word.

2. D in position 3 → _ L D I E  
   Possible letters for position 1: unused common letters are B, C, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y.  
   Real English words:  
   - BLIDE – no  
   - CLIDE – no  
   - GLIDE – yes! “GLIDE” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Check “GLIDE”:
   - G, L, I, D, E – all letters are either unused or correctly placed.  
   - Matches pattern: _ L D I E  
   - Uses no banned letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “GLIDE”.
