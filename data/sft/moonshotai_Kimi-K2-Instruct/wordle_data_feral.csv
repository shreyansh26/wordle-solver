For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common English letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test their presence in the secret word. 

Common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I will choose **RAISE** because it includes R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and common consonants. This should give good initial information about the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)

   - does NOT contain I or S

2. TREAD → T(x) R(-) E(-) A(✓) D(x)

     – R is still in the word but not in position 2
     – E is still in the word but not in position 3

   - locks in pattern: _ _ _ A _

Positions of known letters:

- R must appear in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2)
- E must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 5 if R is there)

So possible placements:

Case 1: _ _ R A E

Case 2: _ E _ A R

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TREAD -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - word contains R, A, E (but not in their original positions)
   - does NOT contain I or S

2. TREAD → T(x) R(-) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
   - confirms:
     – A is correct in position 4
     – R is still in the word but not in position 2
     – E is still in the word but not in position 3
   - eliminates T and D
   - locks in pattern: _ _ _ A _

Positions of known letters:
- A is fixed at position 4
- R must appear in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2)
- E must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 5 if R is there)

So possible placements:
- Case 1: R in position 3 → _ _ R A E (E in 5)
- Case 2: R in position 5 → _ E _ A R

Let’s test candidates for both cases.

Case 1: _ _ R A E
   – Need two distinct consonants not yet ruled out (not T, D, I, S)
   – Possible: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   – Real words: CRANE already ruled out (TREAD used E not in pos 5)
   – BRAVE? B and V allowed → BRAVE

Case 2: _ E _ A R
   – Need two distinct consonants
   – Real words: CLEAR, HEART (but H used T which is out), etc.
   – CLEAR (C, L) looks good

Between these, CLEAR seems safer because it uses common letters and fits the second case. Let’s go with CLEAR.

Check constraints:
- Uses only allowed letters (no T, D, I, S)
- A fixed at position 4
- E is in position 2, which is allowed
- R is in position 5, which is allowed
- C and L new letters

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common English letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test their presence in the secret word. 

Common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I will choose **RAISE** because it includes R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and common consonants. This should give good initial information about the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 2 is wrong)
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

So the word contains R, A, and E, but not I or S.  
R, A, and E cannot be in positions 1, 2, and 5 respectively.  
We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet except I and S
2. Contains R, A, E
3. Places R not in position 1, A not in position 2, E not in position 5

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters besides R, A, E. Let’s pick common ones: T, O, N, L, etc.

Let’s try to place R, A, E in new positions:
Possible structures:
- A _ R _ E
- A _ _ R E
- _ A R _ E
- _ A _ R E
- _ _ A R E
- etc.

Let’s try ""TREAD"":
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2, allowed since R was in position 1 before)
- E (position 3, allowed)
- A (position 4, allowed)
- D (new letter)

Check constraints:
- No I or S
- R not in position 1 (ok, it’s in position 2)
- A not in position 2 (ok, it’s in position 4)
- E not in position 5 (ok, it’s in position 3)

This seems valid.

Positions of known letters:
- A is fixed at position 4

So possible placements:

Case 1: _ _ R A E

Case 2: _ E _ A R
   – Need two distinct consonants
   – Real words: CLEAR, HEART (but H used T which is out), etc.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,feral,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common English letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, etc. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test their presence in the secret word. 

Common first guesses include words like:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I will choose **RAISE** because it includes R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters and cover vowels and common consonants. This should give good initial information about the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 2 is wrong)
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5 is wrong)

So the word contains R, A, and E, but not I or S.  
R, A, and E cannot be in positions 1, 2, and 5 respectively.  
We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet except I and S
2. Contains R, A, E
3. Places R not in position 1, A not in position 2, E not in position 5

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters besides R, A, E. Let’s pick common ones: T, O, N, L, etc.

Let’s try to place R, A, E in new positions:
Possible structures:
- A _ R _ E
- A _ _ R E
- _ A R _ E
- _ A _ R E
- _ _ A R E
- etc.

Let’s try ""TREAD"":
- T (new letter)
- R (position 2, allowed since R was in position 1 before)
- E (position 3, allowed)
- A (position 4, allowed)
- D (new letter)

Check constraints:
- No I or S
- R not in position 1 (ok, it’s in position 2)
- A not in position 2 (ok, it’s in position 4)
- E not in position 5 (ok, it’s in position 3)

This seems valid.

<guess>TREAD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREAD -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - word contains R, A, E (but not in their original positions)
   - does NOT contain I or S

2. TREAD → T(x) R(-) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
   - confirms:
     – A is correct in position 4
     – R is still in the word but not in position 2
     – E is still in the word but not in position 3
   - eliminates T and D
   - locks in pattern: _ _ _ A _

Positions of known letters:
- A is fixed at position 4
- R must appear in positions 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2)
- E must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 5 if R is there)

So possible placements:
- Case 1: R in position 3 → _ _ R A E (E in 5)
- Case 2: R in position 5 → _ E _ A R

Let’s test candidates for both cases.

Case 1: _ _ R A E
   – Need two distinct consonants not yet ruled out (not T, D, I, S)
   – Possible: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   – Real words: CRANE already ruled out (TREAD used E not in pos 5)
   – BRAVE? B and V allowed → BRAVE

Case 2: _ E _ A R
   – Need two distinct consonants
   – Real words: CLEAR, HEART (but H used T which is out), etc.
   – CLEAR (C, L) looks good

Between these, CLEAR seems safer because it uses common letters and fits the second case. Let’s go with CLEAR.

Check constraints:
- Uses only allowed letters (no T, D, I, S)
- A fixed at position 4
- E is in position 2, which is allowed
- R is in position 5, which is allowed
- C and L new letters

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's collect all constraints uncovered so far:

1. Letters known to be in the word: A, E, R  
   – A must be in position 4 (✓ from both TREAD and CLEAR)  
   – R must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from RAISE, TREAD, CLEAR respectively)  
     → R must therefore be in position 3 – the only remaining slot.  
   – E must be in the word but NOT in positions 3, 5 (from TREAD and CLEAR); it cannot be in positions 1 or 4 either (from RAISE and the fixed A respectively)  
     → E must therefore be in position 2.

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, D, I, L, S, T.

3. Positions so far:
   _ E R A _

4. We need two more distinct consonants (positions 1 and 5) chosen only from the still-allowed set:  
   B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must pick a valid 5-letter English word of the form X E R A Y, where X and Y are in the allowed set.

Scanning quickly:
- B E R A Y → BERAY – not a recognized word  
- M E R A Y → MERAY – not a recognized word  
- G E R A Y → GERAY – not a recognized word  
- F E R A L → FERAL – but L is eliminated  
- H E R A D → HERAD – D is eliminated  
- N E R A Y → NERAY – not a recognized word  
- B E R A K → BERAK – not a recognized word  
- M E R A K → MERAK – yes, an astronomical star name and a dictionary entry.

MERAK satisfies all constraints.

Positions:
1: M – allowed  
2: E – required placement  
3: R – required placement  
4: A – required placement  
5: K – allowed and new

From all feedback so far we know the fixed pattern:

Position 2: E (locked ✓)  
Position 3: R (locked ✓)  
Position 4: A (locked ✓)  
Position 5: not H, K, D, S, I

Allowed letters still unused (excluding everything already ruled out):  
B, F, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z (for positions 1 and 5)

We need a real 5-letter word of the form ? E R A ?.

Possible dictionary words that fit:
- FERAL – L eliminated  
- BERYL – L eliminated  
- PERAE – plural of “pera” (obscure, plus E repeats)  
- NERAL – L eliminated  
- VERA? – too short  
- VERAY – archaic  
- FERAY – not found  
- BERAY – not found  
- PERAI – obscure plural of pera  

Only clearly valid, common-enough choice left is **FERAL**, but the feedback has already ruled out L (CLEAR → L(-)).  
Next most plausible real word is **PERAI**, which is a variant plural of “pera” (small monetary unit) and appears in some dictionaries.

It satisfies:
- P and I are not yet excluded (I was only excluded from feedback in RAISE position 3 – no global exclusion).  
- E, R, A positions match exactly.

Therefore PERAI is the best remaining legal guess.
