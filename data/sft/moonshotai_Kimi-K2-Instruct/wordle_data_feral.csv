For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. The best starting words typically contain the most frequent letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc.) while avoiding duplicates to test more letters. 

Common strong starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E - all high frequency)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it contains 5 of the top 10 most common letters in English words, with no duplicates.

From the feedback we just received:
- S and T are NOT in the word (x),
- A, R, and E are all in the word but NOT in the positions they occupied in STARE.

Positions in STARE:
1 S
2 T
3 A
4 R
5 E

Since A, R, and E must move, we know:
- A cannot be in spot 3.
- R cannot be in spot 4.
- E cannot be in spot 5.

We need a new word that:
1. Uses ONLY the letters we have not yet ruled out: A, R, E plus any other letters we haven’t tested yet.
2. Places A, R, E in new positions.

Good candidates would use fresh consonants and avoid S or T. The common consonants B, C, D, L, N, M, P, etc. are still untested.

A word like “CRANE” would reuse C, N (which haven’t been tested) and rearrange A, R, E into new positions.

However, CRANE has C in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (forbidden), N in position 4 (new), E in position 5 (forbidden). So A and E would be in forbidden spots.

Next try: “REACT”. This has R in position 1 (new), E in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (forbidden), C in position 4 (new), T in position 5 (forbidden by T being already ruled out). So it fails.

Next: “EARLY”. This has E in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (new), R in position 3 (new), L in position 4 (new), Y in position 5 (new). A, R, E are all in new positions, and it introduces L and Y which are new consonants.

This seems solid.

Let's update our knowledge after the third guess.

Feedback for REALM:
R(-)  E(✓)  A(-)  L(-)  M(x)

Known facts after three guesses:

Letters not in the word at all: S, T, Y, M  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, L (from REALM) and A, E, L (from earlier)  
Letter R is confirmed to be in position 3 (from EARLY).

From REALM:
- R is in position 1 but marked as “in the word but wrong position” (-), so R is NOT in position 1 (we already knew it is in position 3).
- E is in position 2 and marked ✓, so E is in position 2.
- A is in position 3 (but position 3 is already R) and marked (-), so A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in position 4 and marked (-), so L is in the word but not in position 4.
- M is not in the word (x).

So far we have:
- Position 2: E (✓)
- Position 3: R (✓ from EARLY)
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from REALM) and not in position 3 (from STARE) and not in position 2 (from EARLY) and not in position 1 (from EARLY) — wait let's track A's forbidden positions more carefully:
  - STARE: A was in position 3 → (-), so not in 3.
  - EARLY: A was in position 2 → (-), so not in 2.
  - REALM: A was in position 3 → (-), so not in 3 (already known).
  So A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly for L:
- STARE: L not tested.
- EARLY: L was in position 4 → (-), so not in 4.
- REALM: L was in position 4 → (-), so not in 4 (confirmed).
  So L can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But 3 is R, so L can be in 1 or 5.

E is confirmed in position 2.
R is confirmed in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ E R _ _
Letters still to place: A and L, with constraints:
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- L must be in 1 or 5.

Thus possible positions for A and L:
Case 1: A in 1, L in 5 → A E R _ L → but we need a 5-letter word, so this would be A E R ? L, but we have no letter left to place. Wait, we have two letters (A and L) to place in two spots (positions 1,4,5), but positions 2 and 3 are fixed. So we have positions 1,4,5 open, but only A and L are confirmed letters. This means we need one more letter to fill the remaining spot, and it must be a new letter not yet tested.

Similarly:
Case 2: A in 4, L in 1 → L E R A _
Case 3: A in 5, L in 1 → L E R _ A

We need to choose a common consonant for the remaining blank. Good untested consonants include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. From these, N and D are very common.

Let's pick L E R A N (LERAN) - but LERAN is not a valid English word.
Next: L E R A D (LERAD) - not a word.
Next: A E R L D (AERLD) - no.
Wait, let's think differently: the pattern is _ E R _ _, with A and L to place in 1,4,5 and one new letter in the remaining spot.

Option 1: A in 1, L in 5, new letter in 4: A E R ? L → need a letter for position 4. Common choices: N, D, C, etc. A E R N L → not a word.
Option 2: L in 1, A in 4, new letter in 5: L E R A ? → LERAS (not a word), LERAP (no), LERAD (no), LERAN (no).
Option 3: A in 1, L in 4: A E R L _ → but L cannot be in 4 (from REALM feedback). So invalid.
Option 4: L in 1, A in 5: L E R _ A → need letter in 4. L E R D A (not a word), L E R N A (LERNA is not standard), L E R B A (no).

Hmm, perhaps the new letter is in position 1. Then we have:
new letter in 1, E in 2, R in 3, and A and L in 4 and 5 (order unknown).
Pattern: ? E R A L or ? E R L A.

Words fitting:
- D E R A L (DERAL - no)
- C E R A L (CERAL - no)
- F E R A L (FERAL - yes, valid word)
- P E R A L (no)
- B E R A L (no)

FERAL fits: F is new, E in 2 (✓), R in 3 (✓), A in 4, L in 5. Let's check constraints:
- A is in 4: allowed (not in 3,2, so ok)
- L is in 5: allowed (not in 4, so ok)
- F is new and untested.

Thus FERAL is a strong next guess.
