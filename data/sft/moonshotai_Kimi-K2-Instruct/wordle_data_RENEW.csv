For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some good candidate words are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose AROSE as my first guess because it includes the top 5 most common letters (E, A, R, O, S) and gives us a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

   - I and T are out.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
Letters that are definitely in the word and must appear:
- R, E, N

Letters we can rule out entirely:
- A, O, S, I, T

Remaining common letters to test: C, L, D, G, H, M, U, Y, B, F, K, P, V, W, plus the vowel U (since we haven’t tested U yet).

Constraints on positions:
- R cannot be in 2 or 4.
- E cannot be in 3 or 5.
- N cannot be in 2.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, E, N, uses only still-allowed letters, and satisfies the positional bans.

Let’s pick a candidate that:
- places R in 1, 3 or 5 (not 2 or 4), 
- places E in 1, 2 or 4 (not 3 or 5), 
- places N in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (not 2).

Also let’s maximize new information by adding one or two fresh common letters (e.g., L, U, D).

Possible word: UNDER
- Contains U, N, D, E, R
- Checks positional constraints:
  - U(1) – allowed
  - N(2) – forbidden (feedback says N not in pos 2) → bad, so UND**R** is blocked.

Next: REN**D**
R E N _ _

But we need 5 letters. Let’s try:
- REN**D** + new letter: RENDER (too long), RENDS (not valid).

Let’s try:
- C R E E N – repeats E, but we don’t know if doubles are allowed.

A clean choice: R U N N E – repeats N, might not help.

Let’s pick a word that uses R, E, N only once each and adds two fresh letters: L and D.

Candidate: LENDER

- D R E N _ – D R E N + last letter.

Check constraints:
- R(1) allowed
- E(2) allowed
- N(3) allowed (N not banned in 3)
- A is banned by earlier rule → RENAL fails (A is out).

Next: REN**U**M – invalid (no such word).

REN**D** – too short.

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose AROSE as my first guess because it includes the top 5 most common letters (E, A, R, O, S) and gives us a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.
2. It DOES contain R and E.
3. R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Letters left to explore: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, P, plus vowels like I, U. Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps R and E.
- Adds new common letters.
- Places R and E in new positions.

Candidate words:
- TIRED (T, I, R, E, D) – keeps R and E, adds T, I, D.
- CREPT (C, R, E, P, T) – keeps R and E, adds C, P, T.
- INERT (I, N, E, R, T) – keeps R and E, adds I, N, T.

I’ll go with INERT because it keeps R (now in position 4) and E (now in position 3), while introducing I, N, T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: INERT -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are out.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. INERT → I(x) N(-) E(-) R(-) T(x)
   - I and T are out.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
Letters that are definitely in the word and must appear:
- R, E, N

Letters we can rule out entirely:
- A, O, S, I, T

Remaining common letters to test: C, L, D, G, H, M, U, Y, B, F, K, P, V, W, plus the vowel U (since we haven’t tested U yet).

Constraints on positions:
- R cannot be in 2 or 4.
- E cannot be in 3 or 5.
- N cannot be in 2.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, E, N, uses only still-allowed letters, and satisfies the positional bans.

Let’s pick a candidate that:
- places R in 1, 3 or 5 (not 2 or 4), 
- places E in 1, 2 or 4 (not 3 or 5), 
- places N in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (not 2).

Also let’s maximize new information by adding one or two fresh common letters (e.g., L, U, D).

Possible word: UNDER
- Contains U, N, D, E, R
- Checks positional constraints:
  - U(1) – allowed
  - N(2) – forbidden (feedback says N not in pos 2) → bad, so UND**R** is blocked.

Next: REN**D**
R E N _ _

But we need 5 letters. Let’s try:
- REN**D** + new letter: RENDER (too long), RENDS (not valid).

Let’s try:
- C R E E N – repeats E, but we don’t know if doubles are allowed.

A clean choice: R U N N E – repeats N, might not help.

Let’s pick a word that uses R, E, N only once each and adds two fresh letters: L and D.

Candidate: LENDER
- But 6 letters.

Need exactly five. Let’s try:
- D R E N _ – D R E N + last letter.

Let me list possibilities systematically:
- R in pos 1: R _ _ _ _
- E in pos 2: R E _ _ _
- N in pos 3 or 4 or 5.

Example: R E N _ _
We need one more letter that’s not banned and not already used (R,E,N).

Available: L, U, D, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, V, W, C.

Let’s choose L to make RENAL (valid word).

Check constraints:
- R(1) allowed
- E(2) allowed
- N(3) allowed (N not banned in 3)
- A is banned by earlier rule → RENAL fails (A is out).

Next: REN**U**M – invalid (no such word).

REN**D** – too short.

Let’s try N in pos 4: _ _ _ N _
Pick word with N in 4 and E not in 3 or 5: possible word “UNDER” again but N at 2 is banned.

Try: “CREPE” – no, already E in 3 forbidden.

Better strategy: place R in pos 5, E in pos 2, N in pos 3.

Word: _ E N _ R

Candidate: “VENUE” – V, E, N, U, E (two E’s, but E single allowed? Unknown.)

Let’s use a simpler, high-frequency word: “NERVE”.

Check:
- N(1) – allowed
- E(2) – allowed
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned in 3)
- V(4) – new letter
- E(5) – but E banned in 5. So fail.

Next: “FERNY” – Y new, but E in 4 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), R in 2 – but R banned in 2. Fail.

Next: “NERDY” – N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5).
- E(2) allowed
- R(3) allowed
- N(1) allowed
- D, Y new
Valid word.

Step 1 – Summarize everything learned so far

Letters that must be in the word:
- E (now known to be in the correct position 2)
- R
- N

Letters that are definitely out:
- A, O, S, I, T, D, Y

Step 2 – Fix the known letter positions
- Position 2 = E (✓ from NERDY feedback)

Step 3 – Apply the “cannot-be-here” constraints on R and N
- R is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 4.
- N is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 3.

Step 4 – Compile the set of still-allowed letters
Remaining possible letters to fill the blanks:
B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, plus the required R and N.

Step 5 – Construct a 5-letter pattern
We have:
_ E _ _ _

We must place both R and N somewhere, while respecting the positional bans.

Possible placements for R and N (each must also use only allowed letters in the other slots):

Option 1: R in position 1
R E _ _ _
- N must go in position 3, 4, or 5.
  – Position 3: R E N _ _ → but N is banned from 3. ❌
  – Position 4: R E _ N _ → allowed.
  – Position 5: R E _ _ N → allowed.

Option 2: R in position 3
_ E R _ _
- N can go in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Option 3: R in position 5
_ E _ _ R
- N can go in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Step 6 – Pick a candidate that adds new common consonants
Let’s choose the pattern “R E _ N _ ” (R in 1, N in 4).  
We need a fifth letter that is common and still allowed for position 3.

Best choice: the common consonant L.

That gives: R E L N _  
The only missing letter is now position 5.  
Still-allowed letters remaining: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Choose P to maximize information: R E L N P.  
But “RELN P” is not a valid English word.

Instead, choose M: R E L N M – also invalid.

Try U: R E L N U – invalid.

Try C: R E L N C – invalid.

Try K: R E L N K – invalid.

None of these form a valid word, so let’s switch the pattern.

Try pattern “_ E R _ N” (R in 3, N in 5).  
We need a consonant for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidate: H E R O N – but O is banned. ❌

Next: P E R U N – U allowed, word exists.

Check constraints:
- P(1) – allowed
- E(2) – required
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned here)
- U(4) – allowed
- N(5) – allowed (N not banned here)

“PERUN” is a valid English word (also a name). All letters are allowed and the positional constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, PERUN is the optimal next guess.

Try: “CREPE” – no, already E in 3 forbidden.

Better strategy: place R in pos 5, E in pos 2, N in pos 3.

Word: _ E N _ R

Candidate: “VENUE” – V, E, N, U, E (two E’s, but E single allowed? Unknown.)

Let’s use a simpler, high-frequency word: “NERVE”.

Check:
- N(1) – allowed
- E(2) – allowed
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned in 3)
- V(4) – new letter
- E(5) – but E banned in 5. So fail.

Next: “FERNY” – Y new, but E in 4 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), R in 2 – but R banned in 2. Fail.

Next: “NERDY” – N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5).
- E(2) allowed
- R(3) allowed
- N(1) allowed
- D, Y new
Valid word.

Let’s use NERDY.

Guess 3: NERDY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) R(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Summarize everything learned so far

Letters that must be in the word:
- E (now known to be in the correct position 2)
- R
- N

Letters that are definitely out:
- A, O, S, I, T, D, Y

Step 2 – Fix the known letter positions
- Position 2 = E (✓ from NERDY feedback)

Step 3 – Apply the “cannot-be-here” constraints on R and N
- R is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 4.
- N is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 3.

Step 4 – Compile the set of still-allowed letters
Remaining possible letters to fill the blanks:
B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, plus the required R and N.

Step 5 – Construct a 5-letter pattern
We have:
_ E _ _ _

We must place both R and N somewhere, while respecting the positional bans.

Possible placements for R and N (each must also use only allowed letters in the other slots):

Option 1: R in position 1
R E _ _ _
- N must go in position 3, 4, or 5.
  – Position 3: R E N _ _ → but N is banned from 3. ❌
  – Position 4: R E _ N _ → allowed.
  – Position 5: R E _ _ N → allowed.

Option 2: R in position 3
_ E R _ _
- N can go in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Option 3: R in position 5
_ E _ _ R
- N can go in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Step 6 – Pick a candidate that adds new common consonants
Let’s choose the pattern “R E _ N _ ” (R in 1, N in 4).  
We need a fifth letter that is common and still allowed for position 3.

Best choice: the common consonant L.

That gives: R E L N _  
The only missing letter is now position 5.  
Still-allowed letters remaining: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Choose P to maximize information: R E L N P.  
But “RELN P” is not a valid English word.

Instead, choose M: R E L N M – also invalid.

Try U: R E L N U – invalid.

Try C: R E L N C – invalid.

Try K: R E L N K – invalid.

None of these form a valid word, so let’s switch the pattern.

Try pattern “_ E R _ N” (R in 3, N in 5).  
We need a consonant for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidate: H E R O N – but O is banned. ❌

Next: P E R U N – U allowed, word exists.

Check constraints:
- P(1) – allowed
- E(2) – required
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned here)
- U(4) – allowed
- N(5) – allowed (N not banned here)

“PERUN” is a valid English word (also a name). All letters are allowed and the positional constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, PERUN is the optimal next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

Some good candidate words are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll choose AROSE as my first guess because it includes the top 5 most common letters (E, A, R, O, S) and gives us a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.
2. It DOES contain R and E.
3. R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

Letters left to explore: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, P, plus vowels like I, U. Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps R and E.
- Adds new common letters.
- Places R and E in new positions.

Candidate words:
- TIRED (T, I, R, E, D) – keeps R and E, adds T, I, D.
- CREPT (C, R, E, P, T) – keeps R and E, adds C, P, T.
- INERT (I, N, E, R, T) – keeps R and E, adds I, N, T.

I’ll go with INERT because it keeps R (now in position 4) and E (now in position 3), while introducing I, N, T.

Letters we can rule out entirely:

Remaining common letters to test: C, L, D, G, H, M, U, Y, B, F, K, P, V, W, plus the vowel U (since we haven’t tested U yet).

Constraints on positions:
- R cannot be in 2 or 4.
- E cannot be in 3 or 5.
- N cannot be in 2.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, E, N, uses only still-allowed letters, and satisfies the positional bans.

Let’s pick a candidate that:
- places R in 1, 3 or 5 (not 2 or 4), 
- places E in 1, 2 or 4 (not 3 or 5), 
- places N in 1, 3, 4 or 5 (not 2).

Also let’s maximize new information by adding one or two fresh common letters (e.g., L, U, D).

Possible word: UNDER
- Contains U, N, D, E, R
- Checks positional constraints:
  - U(1) – allowed
  - N(2) – forbidden (feedback says N not in pos 2) → bad, so UND**R** is blocked.

Next: REN**D**
R E N _ _

But we need 5 letters. Let’s try:
- REN**D** + new letter: RENDER (too long), RENDS (not valid).

Let’s try:
- C R E E N – repeats E, but we don’t know if doubles are allowed.

A clean choice: R U N N E – repeats N, might not help.

Let’s pick a word that uses R, E, N only once each and adds two fresh letters: L and D.

Candidate: LENDER
- But 6 letters.

Need exactly five. Let’s try:
- D R E N _ – D R E N + last letter.

Let me list possibilities systematically:
- R in pos 1: R _ _ _ _
- E in pos 2: R E _ _ _
- N in pos 3 or 4 or 5.

Example: R E N _ _
We need one more letter that’s not banned and not already used (R,E,N).

Available: L, U, D, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, V, W, C.

Let’s choose L to make RENAL (valid word).

Check constraints:
- R(1) allowed
- E(2) allowed
- N(3) allowed (N not banned in 3)
- A is banned by earlier rule → RENAL fails (A is out).

Next: REN**U**M – invalid (no such word).

REN**D** – too short.

Let’s try N in pos 4: _ _ _ N _
Pick word with N in 4 and E not in 3 or 5: possible word “UNDER” again but N at 2 is banned.

Try: “CREPE” – no, already E in 3 forbidden.

Better strategy: place R in pos 5, E in pos 2, N in pos 3.

Word: _ E N _ R

Candidate: “VENUE” – V, E, N, U, E (two E’s, but E single allowed? Unknown.)

Let’s use a simpler, high-frequency word: “NERVE”.

Check:
- N(1) – allowed
- E(2) – allowed
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned in 3)
- V(4) – new letter
- E(5) – but E banned in 5. So fail.

Next: “FERNY” – Y new, but E in 4 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), R in 2 – but R banned in 2. Fail.

Next: “NERDY” – N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5).
- E(2) allowed
- R(3) allowed
- N(1) allowed
- D, Y new
Valid word.

Let’s use NERDY.

Guess 3: NERDY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) R(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Summarize everything learned so far

Letters that must be in the word:
- E (now known to be in the correct position 2)
- R
- N

Letters that are definitely out:
- A, O, S, I, T, D, Y

Step 2 – Fix the known letter positions
- Position 2 = E (✓ from NERDY feedback)

Step 3 – Apply the “cannot-be-here” constraints on R and N
- R is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 4.
- N is somewhere **except** positions 2 and 3.

Step 4 – Compile the set of still-allowed letters
Remaining possible letters to fill the blanks:
B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, plus the required R and N.

Step 5 – Construct a 5-letter pattern
We have:
_ E _ _ _

We must place both R and N somewhere, while respecting the positional bans.

Possible placements for R and N (each must also use only allowed letters in the other slots):

Option 1: R in position 1
R E _ _ _
- N must go in position 3, 4, or 5.
  – Position 3: R E N _ _ → but N is banned from 3. ❌
  – Position 4: R E _ N _ → allowed.
  – Position 5: R E _ _ N → allowed.

Option 2: R in position 3
_ E R _ _
- N can go in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Option 3: R in position 5
_ E _ _ R
- N can go in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Step 6 – Pick a candidate that adds new common consonants
Let’s choose the pattern “R E _ N _ ” (R in 1, N in 4).  
We need a fifth letter that is common and still allowed for position 3.

Best choice: the common consonant L.

That gives: R E L N _  
The only missing letter is now position 5.  
Still-allowed letters remaining: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Choose P to maximize information: R E L N P.  
But “RELN P” is not a valid English word.

Instead, choose M: R E L N M – also invalid.

Try U: R E L N U – invalid.

Try C: R E L N C – invalid.

Try K: R E L N K – invalid.

None of these form a valid word, so let’s switch the pattern.

Try pattern “_ E R _ N” (R in 3, N in 5).  
We need a consonant for positions 1 and 4.

Good candidate: H E R O N – but O is banned. ❌

Next: P E R U N – U allowed, word exists.

Check constraints:
- P(1) – allowed
- E(2) – required
- R(3) – allowed (R not banned here)
- U(4) – allowed
- N(5) – allowed (N not banned here)

“PERUN” is a valid English word (also a name). All letters are allowed and the positional constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, PERUN is the optimal next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – Extract everything we now know with certainty  
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓ in both NERDY and PERUN).  
- R and N are both in the word, but nowhere near their last-guess positions.  
  – R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4.  
  – N cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, T, D, Y, P, U.  
- Remaining candidate letters (all unused and still legal):  
  B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, plus the required R and N.

Step 2 – Determine the only possible positions left for R and N  
Word skeleton so far: _ E _ _ _

Possible slots for R (positions 1 or 5).  
Possible slots for N (positions 1, 4, 5).  

Case analysis:
- If R is in 1 → N must go in 4 or 5.  
- If R is in 5 → N must go in 1 or 4.  

Step 3 – Build concrete patterns and spell valid English words  

Pattern R E _ N _  
 Available letters for slot 3: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W  
 Candidate → R E B N _ → no valid 5-letter word ends in any of those.  
 Candidate → R E C N _ → none.  
 Candidate → R E L N _ → none.  
 Candidate → R E M N _ → none.  

Pattern R E _ _ N  
 Candidate → R E C K N → “RECKN” invalid.  
 Candidate → R E M A N → “REMAN” but A is banned.  
 Candidate → R E C O N → O banned.  
 No good matches.

Pattern _ E R _ N (R in 3, N in 5)  
 Need a start letter (pos 1) and middle letter (pos 4) from allowed set.  
 Candidate → C E R V N – invalid.  
 Candidate → H E R O N – O banned.  
 Candidate → M E R G N – invalid.  
 Candidate → W E R V N – invalid.  

Pattern _ E _ R N (R in 4, N in 5)  
 Candidate → F E R R N – repeats R.  
 Candidate → C E L R N – invalid.  
 Candidate → H E L R N – invalid.  

Pattern N E R _ _ (R in 3)  
 N must sit in 1 (allowed).  
 Need 4th and 5th letters, but R is already 3, N is 1, E is 2.  
 Candidate → N E R V E – repeats E already used in 2.  
 Candidate → N E R V Y – Y banned.  

Pattern _ E N R _ (N in 3) – but N is banned in 3. ❌

Pattern N E _ _ R (R in 5)  
 Candidate → N E B V R – invalid.  
 Candidate → N E C K R – invalid.  
 Candidate → N E V E R – word “NEVER”.

Check constraints for “NEVER”:
- N(1) – allowed (banned only in 2,3,5). ✅  
- E(2) – required. ✅  
- V(3) – allowed. ✅  
- E(4) – allowed (only E in 2 was fixed). ✅  
- R(5) – allowed (only banned in 2,3,4). ✅  

All letters are still legal, and the positional bans are respected.

From the latest feedback:

NEVER → N(-) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(-)

1. E is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.  
   Pattern so far: _ E _ E _

2. R is confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4,5.  
   Therefore R must be in position 1.

3. N is confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,5 (from previous ban list).  
   Therefore N must be in position 4.

   However position 4 is already occupied by E.  
   This contradiction proves an impossible condition.

Hence the only consistent pattern is:
R E _ E _ and N must be the final letter.

The only common English 5-letter word fitting R E _ E N is:

REBEN (a valid English word: an obsolete spelling of “ribbon”) – but that uses B (allowed) and satisfies every positional restriction.

Therefore, REBEN is the sole remaining candidate.

<guess>REBEN</guess>",REBEN,"From the latest feedback:

NEVER → N(-) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(-)

1. E is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.  
   Pattern so far: _ E _ E _

2. R is confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4,5.  
   Therefore R must be in position 1.

3. N is confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,5 (from previous ban list).  
   Therefore N must be in position 4.

   However position 4 is already occupied by E.  
   This contradiction proves an impossible condition.

Hence the only consistent pattern is:
R E _ E _ and N must be the final letter.

The only common English 5-letter word fitting R E _ E N is:

REBEN (a valid English word: an obsolete spelling of “ribbon”) – but that uses B (allowed) and satisfies every positional restriction.

Therefore, REBEN is the sole remaining candidate.",Guess 6: REBEN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(x) E(✓) N(-),FAIL
