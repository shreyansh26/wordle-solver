For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best starting words typically use common letters and cover a broad range of possibilities. 

Common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. I want to avoid words with repeated letters at first to maximize coverage.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers some very common consonants (S, L, T) and the most common vowel (E), plus A which is also very common. This should give good information regardless of what letters are in the actual word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

1. S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.
2. L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position.
3. A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
4. T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
5. E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word contains L and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively, and does not contain S, A, or T.

Word constraints so far:
- Length = 5
- Contains: L and E
- Does not contain: S, A, T
- L is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need to pick a new 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints and maximizes information. Let’s think of common words that fit.

Possible positions: L could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5, and E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Some candidate words:
- OLDER: L is in position 2 (forbidden), so no.
- ELBOW: L is in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- BLEED: L in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- ELOPE: L in 2 (forbidden), so no.
- LEDGE: L in 1, E in 2 and 5 – but E can’t be in 5, so no.
- LOVER: L in 1, O, V, E in 4, R – valid positions.
- LEMUR: L in 1, E in 2, M, U, R – E is allowed in 2.
- LEARN: L in 1, E in 2, A is forbidden, so no.
- LINED: L in 1, I, N, E in 4, D – E is allowed in 4, but D isn’t forbidden (not checked yet).
- LINER: L in 1, I, N, E in 4, R – seems good.

""LINER"" seems like a strong next guess:
- Uses common letters not yet ruled out: I, N, R
- Places L in position 1 (allowed)
- Places E in position 4 (allowed)
- Doesn’t use S, A, T

Updated constraints after LINER:

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.  (Position 2 is already taken by I, so E must be in 1 or 3.)  
- Forbidden letters so far: S, A, T, N, R.  
- Required letters: L, I (fixed at pos 2), E.

Current skeleton:
- _ I _ _ _
- E must be in position 1 or 3.  
- L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s explore both E placements:

Case 1: E in position 1 → E I _ _ _  
Then L must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
Possible valid words: E I L _ _ or E I _ L _ or E I _ _ L.  
We need a 5-letter word with E I at the start, containing L, no S/A/T/N/R.  
ELIDE: but D isn’t forbidden, yet it’s “ELIDE” – check if allowed.  
ELIDE has D and E, no S/A/T/N/R. Seems okay, but “ELIDE” might be too obscure.  
E I L _ _: looking for common letters, maybe “EVIL”? But V and other letters not forbidden.  
Wait, “EVILE” – no, not valid.  
“ELIDE” is valid, but let’s see another option.

Case 2: E in position 3 → _ I E _ _  
Then L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is E).  
So pattern: _ I E L _ or _ I E _ L.  
Letters allowed: anything not S/A/T/N/R.  
Looking for common words:  
- “FIELD” – but D okay, F, I, E, L – no forbidden letters.  
- “PIECE” – but C is allowed, E at 3, but ends with E (position 5), and E can’t be at 5 (feedback says E was wrong at 5 in LINER). So “PIECE” is invalid because last E is forbidden.  
- “FRIEL” – no R.  
- “WIELD” – W, I, E, L, D – no forbidden letters, and fits _ I E L _.

“WIELD” looks promising:
- Letters: W, I, E, L, D – none are forbidden.  
- I is correctly at 2.  
- E is at 3 (allowed).  
- L is at 4 (allowed).
