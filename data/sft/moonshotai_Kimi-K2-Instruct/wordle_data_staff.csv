For the first guess in Wordle, the optimal strategy is to use a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the amount of information gained. Common starting words include:

- ""SLATE"" - covers S, L, A, T, E (common letters and vowels)
- ""ADIEU"" - covers A, D, I, E, U (lots of vowels)
- ""CRANE"" - covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" - covers A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""SLATE"" is generally considered one of the best first guesses because it includes very common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). This provides good coverage for elimination purposes.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (S _ _ _ _).
- A is correct in the third position (_ _ A _ _).
- L is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the pattern we have is: S _ A _ _ and we know T appears somewhere else (not 4th).
We also know L and E are eliminated.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words that fit S _ A _ _ and use the letter T somewhere in positions 2, 3 (but 3 is A), or 5. Some candidates:
- SWATH (T is 5th) – but H might be risky
- SPART (T is 5th)
- STAFF – but F repeats and E is out (but E is already out)
- SWATS
- SHARK – but no T

“SHARK” lacks T, and “SWATH” uses H which is less common. “SPART” is valid and includes the T in the 5th position, satisfying all constraints.

From the new feedback:

- S ✓, T ✓, A ✓ are all in their exact positions → S T A _ _
- N and D are NOT in the word at all (they were marked x).

We now have the pattern ST A _ _ and need two more letters that are:
1. Not among the eliminated letters: L, P, R, E, N, D.
2. The letter T has already been placed as the second character, so the only remaining letter we know must be somewhere is … none; we’ve placed every letter we knew about. We just need two new letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the unused alphabet minus {L, P, R, E, N, D}.

Remaining eligible letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

We want a real 5-letter word beginning with “STA” and ending with two letters from that set.

Scanning possibilities:

- STAFF – has F, F (F is allowed)
- STAGY – ends Y (allowed, but “g y” is a bit less common)
- STAKE – E is out
- STALL – L is out
- STAMP – P is out
- STANK – N is out
- STAPH – H is allowed
- STARK – R is out
- STAVE – E is out
- STAYS – S again (double S) but Y is allowed; word is valid

Among these, “STAFF” and “STAPH” and “STAYS” are all valid.  
“STAFF” seems the most common.

So we’ll guess STAFF.
