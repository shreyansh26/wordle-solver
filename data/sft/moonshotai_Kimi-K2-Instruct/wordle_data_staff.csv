For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words typically contain common letters and vowels to quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word. 

Common effective starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- SLATE (common letters, good vowel coverage)
- CRANE (statistically strong opener)
- RAISE (good consonant/vowel mix)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong statistical opener that:
1. Contains common letters S, L, A, T, E
2. Has 2 vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
3. Uses very common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct 1st position.
- A is in the correct 3rd position.
- T is somewhere in the word but not in 4th position.
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So we know: S _ A _ _  (with T somewhere in positions 2 or 5).

Possible patterns:
1. S T A _ _
2. S _ A T _

Let’s think of common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
1. STAMP – but M and P are untested and we have no info yet.
2. STAFF – two Fs are unlikely.
3. STAND – N and D are common consonants.
4. STARK – K hasn’t been ruled out.
5. SWATH – W is untested, H is common.

Another approach is to test T in the 5th position: S _ A _ T.
Examples:
- SPART – uncommon.
- SCANT – C and N are untested but plausible.
- SWART – uncommon.

“STAND” fits pattern 1 (S T A _ _) and uses common letters D and N, which haven’t been ruled out. It also tests T in 2nd position.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best starting words typically contain common letters and vowels to quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word. 

Common effective starting words include:
- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- SLATE (common letters, good vowel coverage)
- CRANE (statistically strong opener)
- RAISE (good consonant/vowel mix)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong statistical opener that:
1. Contains common letters S, L, A, T, E
2. Has 2 vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
3. Uses very common consonants that appear in many 5-letter words

- S is in the correct 1st position.
- A is in the correct 3rd position.
- T is somewhere in the word but not in 4th position.
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So we know: S _ A _ _  (with T somewhere in positions 2 or 5).

Possible patterns:
1. S T A _ _
2. S _ A T _

Let’s think of common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
1. STAMP – but M and P are untested and we have no info yet.
2. STAFF – two Fs are unlikely.
3. STAND – N and D are common consonants.
4. STARK – K hasn’t been ruled out.
5. SWATH – W is untested, H is common.

Another approach is to test T in the 5th position: S _ A _ T.
Examples:
- SPART – uncommon.
- SCANT – C and N are untested but plausible.
- SWART – uncommon.

“STAND” fits pattern 1 (S T A _ _) and uses common letters D and N, which haven’t been ruled out. It also tests T in 2nd position.

""STARK"" uses common letters K at the end, and R hasn't been tested yet. It's a strong candidate.

""STAMP"" is also good but P is less common than K in this position.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:
- Fixed pattern: S T A _ _
- Eliminated letters: L, E, N, D, R, K, H
- From feedback on STASH: the 4th letter S exists in the word but is in the wrong position (can’t be 4th), and the 5th letter H is not in the word at all.

Since S is already at position 1, the only other possible position for the second S is position 5.  
So the word must be: S T A _ S.

Letters left to place in position 4 (cannot be any of L,E,N,D,R,K,H or S):
Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English words of the form STA _ S:
- STABS – B is allowed, common word
- STAGS – G is allowed
- STAYS – Y is allowed
- STAMS, STAFS, etc. – uncommon or invalid

Between the plausible ones, “STABS” is the most common 5-letter word.

We know:
1. Positions 1-3 are S T A (all ✓).
2. We need two more letters for positions 4-5.
3. Letters eliminated so far: L, E, N, D, R, K, H, B.
4. From the last feedback, the second S (position 5) is “-”, i.e., it is in the word but not in position 5.  
   However, the first S is already locked in position 1.  
   In a 5-letter word each letter can appear only once unless the puzzle explicitly allows repeats, and Wordle does not inform about duplicates directly.  
   The “-” on the fifth letter therefore implies that an S exists somewhere else in the word, but positions 1 and 5 are already spoken for, so the only remaining place is position 4.  
   Hence the word must be S T A S _.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Real 5-letter words of the form STAS_:
- STASH – already tried, H ruled out
- STASI – uncommon
- STASS – not a standard word
- STASY – likewise uncommon
- STASP – not a word

The only common English word that fits is “STASI” (very niche), but that is unlikely.  
Therefore the only plausible remaining candidate in ordinary Wordle vocabulary is:

STAVE – but E is eliminated  
STAGE – G and E: E eliminated  
STAMP – M and P: we tried STAMP conceptually but never actually guessed it, and M, P are still allowed.

Wait: we have never guessed STAMP.  
It uses M and P, both of which are still legal and have never been ruled out.

Hence the correct word must be:

STAMP
