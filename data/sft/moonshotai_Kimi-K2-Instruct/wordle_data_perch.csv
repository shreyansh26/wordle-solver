For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to get maximum unique feedback

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- It DOES contain at least one E, but E is not in the 5th position.

Because we’ve eliminated four very common consonants and the most common vowel, we need a new set of letters that still includes E but uses other common consonants. Good “second-guess” candidates often include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A strong second word that:
- includes E (not in position 5),
- avoids S, L, A, T,
- and introduces the common letters R, I, N, C, O, etc.,

is “CRONE”:
- C: new consonant
- R: very common
- O: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: known to be in the word, now tested in slot 5 (but feedback says it’s not there, so we’ll still learn where E can fit)

This gives us five new letters and keeps E from slot 5 while gathering more info.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters not in the word at all:
S, L, A, T, O, N  (from positions marked x)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
E – we’ve seen it marked “-” in both guesses, so E is in the word, but it is NOT in position 5 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 5 again (from CRONE).  
C – marked “-”: C is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.  
R – marked “-”: R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.  

So the three letters we are certain are in the word are C, R, E (each must appear exactly once – unless the word has duplicates, but we’ll assume normal single-letter occurrences for now).

Positions we still have to consider:
- C cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains C, R, E exactly once each.
2. Places C somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
5. Uses three new letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (avoiding S, L, A, T, O, N).

Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O already eliminated).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters is “DRIVE”:
- D: new consonant
- R: in the word, and we’re testing position 2
- I: new vowel
- V: new consonant
- E: in the word, and we’re testing position 5 (but we already know it isn’t there, so this is actually redundant – we need to swap E to a different spot)

Oops! That puts E back in position 5, which we already ruled out. Let’s rethink.

We want E somewhere in positions 1-4. Let’s try “MERGE”:
- M, G: new consonants
- E: in positions 1 and 4 (first and fourth), which are both still possible
- R: in position 2
But E appears twice, which could complicate things.

Let’s pick a simpler word that contains C, R, E just once each, with E not in slot 5.

Candidate: “CREPE”
- C in position 1 – but we ruled C out of position 1! Bad.

Candidate: “RECUR”
- R in 1, E in 2, C in 3, U in 4, R in 5 – but R is duplicated and we don’t know if it appears twice.

Candidate: “CIDER”
C (cannot be 1 – but in CIDER it is position 1). Bad.

Candidate: “PRICE”
P, I, new letters.
- P: new
- R: possible (not in position 2)
- I: new
- C: possible (not in position 1 – in PRICE it is position 3, OK)

So E in position 5 again – still bad.

Better candidate: “PERCH”
- P, H: new
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed – not in position 2)
- C in position 4 (allowed – not in position 1)
This satisfies all constraints: it uses the known letters C, R, E (each once), avoids the forbidden letters and positions, and introduces two new consonants.
