For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me good coverage of the alphabet and should help identify which letters are in the word regardless of position.

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3  
C(x) – C is not in the word at all  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5  

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, C  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 5), I (position 2), and N (somewhere else, not 1)  
- Position 3 CANNOT be E (because E(-) for position 3).  
- Position 5 IS E.  
- Position 2 IS I.  

Current template: _ I _ _ E  
Letters still allowed: anything except A, R, O, S, C  

Letters already confirmed in the word: I, N, E  
Positions we still need to fill: 1, 3, 4  
Position 1 cannot be N (feedback said N is not in position 1).  

We need three new letters from the remaining pool. Good remaining consonants: T, L, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: none left (only I is confirmed, E is at position 5, and A, O are out).  

A natural next guess is to place N in position 3 or 4.  
Try: _ I N _ E – but position 4 would still be unknown.  
Try: _ I _ N E – that would place N in position 4.  

A valid English word that matches _ I _ N E is “DINNE” – but not a valid word.  
Another: “LINEN” – positions would be L I N E N → ends with N, but we need E at 5.  

Wait, we need E at 5. So:

_ I N _ E – the only common word is “MINCE”, but C is out.  
Another pattern: _ I T _ E – “MITE” is 4 letters.  
Try “WIMPE” – but not a word.  
Try “PINEY” – but Y might be allowed, and we know N needs to be in the word.  

Let’s try “PINED” – but D is fine, but N must be in the word. In “PINED” N is in position 3. That fits the constraints:  
P(?) I(✓) N(-) E(-) D(?) – but E in position 4 is against feedback (E must be at 5).  

Realize: position 5 is E, position 2 is I, and N must appear somewhere else. So we have:  
? I ? N E  

Common word fitting: “WINNE” – no.  
“LINEN” – L I N E N – ends with N, but needs E at 5. So “LINEN” has E at 4, not 5.  
“LINEN” doesn’t fit.  

Another: “TINGE” – T I N G E.  
Letters: T, I, N, G, E.  
All letters allowed (no A, R, O, S, C).  
Positions: 1: T, 2: I (✓), 3: N (-), 4: G, 5: E (✓).

Guess 2: NIECE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(✓) E(-) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s parse the new feedback for NIECE:

N(-)  – N is in the word but not in position 1  
I(✓) – I is in the word and in position 2  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3  
C(x) – C is not in the word at all  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5  

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, C  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 5), I (position 2), and N (somewhere else, not 1)  
- Position 3 CANNOT be E (because E(-) for position 3).  
- Position 5 IS E.  
- Position 2 IS I.  

Current template: _ I _ _ E  
Letters still allowed: anything except A, R, O, S, C  

Letters already confirmed in the word: I, N, E  
Positions we still need to fill: 1, 3, 4  
Position 1 cannot be N (feedback said N is not in position 1).  

We need three new letters from the remaining pool. Good remaining consonants: T, L, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: none left (only I is confirmed, E is at position 5, and A, O are out).  

A natural next guess is to place N in position 3 or 4.  
Try: _ I N _ E – but position 4 would still be unknown.  
Try: _ I _ N E – that would place N in position 4.  

A valid English word that matches _ I _ N E is “DINNE” – but not a valid word.  
Another: “LINEN” – positions would be L I N E N → ends with N, but we need E at 5.  

Wait, we need E at 5. So:

_ I N _ E – the only common word is “MINCE”, but C is out.  
Another pattern: _ I T _ E – “MITE” is 4 letters.  
Try “WIMPE” – but not a word.  
Try “PINEY” – but Y might be allowed, and we know N needs to be in the word.  

Let’s try “PINED” – but D is fine, but N must be in the word. In “PINED” N is in position 3. That fits the constraints:  
P(?) I(✓) N(-) E(-) D(?) – but E in position 4 is against feedback (E must be at 5).  

Realize: position 5 is E, position 2 is I, and N must appear somewhere else. So we have:  
? I ? N E  

Common word fitting: “WINNE” – no.  
“LINEN” – L I N E N – ends with N, but needs E at 5. So “LINEN” has E at 4, not 5.  
“LINEN” doesn’t fit.  

Another: “TINGE” – T I N G E.  
Letters: T, I, N, G, E.  
All letters allowed (no A, R, O, S, C).  
Positions: 1: T, 2: I (✓), 3: N (-), 4: G, 5: E (✓).  
N is in position 3, but feedback said N is in the word but not in position 1. Position 3 is allowed.  

So “TINGE” is a valid guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

I think ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me good coverage of the alphabet and should help identify which letters are in the word regardless of position.

Now I need a word that:

Good consonants to test next might be T, N, L, D, C, etc. A common word that fits is ""TENTE"" but that seems less likely. Let me think of others:

- ""ELITE"" - has I, L, T - but uses E in first position which could be valid
- ""EVERY"" - uses R which we know is out
- ""LEAVE"" - uses L, V - but V is less common
- ""NIECE"" - uses N, I, C - seems good

""NIECE"" uses:
- N (common consonant)
- I (vowel we haven't tested)
- E (already confirmed)

Good remaining consonants: T, L, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  \nGood remaining vowels: none left (only I is confirmed, E is at position 5, and A, O are out).  \n\nA natural next guess is to place N in position 3 or 4.  \nTry: _ I N _ E – but position 4 would still be unknown.  \nTry: _ I _ N E – that would place N in position 4.  \n\nA valid English word that matches _ I _ N E is “DINNE” – but not a valid word.  \nAnother: “LINEN” – positions would be L I N E N → ends with N, but we need E at 5.  \n\nWait, we need E at 5. So:\n\n_ I N _ E – the only common word is “MINCE”, but C is out.  \nAnother pattern: _ I T _ E – “MITE” is 4 letters.  \nTry “WIMPE” – but not a word.  \nTry “PINEY” – but Y might be allowed, and we know N needs to be in the word.  \n\nLet’s try “PINED” – but D is fine, but N must be in the word. In “PINED” N is in position 3. That fits the constraints:  \nP(?) I(✓) N(-) E(-) D(?) – but E in position 4 is against feedback (E must be at 5).  \n\nRealize: position 5 is E, position 2 is I, and N must appear somewhere else. So we have:  \n? I ? N E  \n\nCommon word fitting: “WINNE” – no.  \n“LINEN” – L I N E N – ends with N, but needs E at 5. So “LINEN” has E at 4, not 5.  \n“LINEN” doesn’t fit.  \n\nAnother: “TINGE” – T I N G E.  \nLetters: T, I, N, G, E.  \nAll letters allowed (no A, R, O, S, C).  \nPositions: 1: T, 2: I (✓), 3: N (-), 4: G, 5: E (✓).  \nN is in position 3, but feedback said N is in the word but not in position 1.

From the feedback on HINGE we now know:

I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) E(✓) are all in their exact spots (positions 2-5).  
The only remaining unknown is position 1, and H is NOT in the word.

Known pattern so far: _ I N G E  
Letters ruled out for position 1: A, R, O, S, C, T, H (from every previous guess).  
Allowed consonants left: B, D, F, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a common 5-letter English word that starts with one of those consonants and ends with INGE.

Quick scan:
- BINGE – valid word and fits the pattern.  
- DINGE – valid but less common.  
- FINGE – not a standard word.  
- LINGE – not standard.  
- MINGE – slang.  
- PINGE – not standard.  
- VINGE – not a word.  
- WINGE – variant spelling, not ideal.

The only solid, common word left is BINGE.
