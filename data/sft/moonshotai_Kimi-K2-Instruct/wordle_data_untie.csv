- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to gather maximum information. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" are commonly recommended because they contain frequently used letters in English. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and covers both vowels and consonants.

- U (must be in position 1 or 2)

Letters to still test:
Remaining common letters: N, D, H, M, B, G, F, K, Y, etc.

Given U must be in position 1 or 2:
Possible patterns:
1. U _ T I E
2. _ U T I E

Words fitting these patterns:
1. U _ T I E
   - UNTIE? Already has I and E in correct positions, but N is new. Valid word.
   - ULTIE? Not a valid word.
   - URTIE? R is ruled out (x in TOWER).
   - UPTIE? Not a valid word.
   - UDTIE? Not a word.

2. _ U T I E
   - NUTIE? Not a valid word.
   - BUTIE? Not a valid word.
   - DUTIE? Not a word (but DUTIES is 6 letters).
   - HUTIE? Not a word.
   - GUTIE? Not a word.
   - MUTIE? Not a word.

The only valid 5-letter word among these is ""UNTIE"" (pattern 1: U _ T I E).

Let's verify:
- U is allowed in position 1 (previous U was in position 2, so this is new placement).
- N is a new letter to test.
- T, I, E are already confirmed.

Thus, the next logical guess is UNTIE.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The word ends with ""TIE"" (positions 3-5)
- U is in the word but not in position 2
- The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is ""UNTIE""

<guess>UNTIE</guess>",UNTIE,"From the latest feedback on CUTIE:
- T is now confirmed in the correct position (position 3): ✓
- I is confirmed in the correct position (position 4): ✓
- E is confirmed in the correct position (position 5): ✓
- U is in the word but in the wrong position: -
- C is NOT in the word: x

So the confirmed pattern so far is: _ _ T I E

Letters ruled out (x):
S, L, A, O, W, R, C

Letters known to be in the word but misplaced:
- U (must be in position 1 or 2)
