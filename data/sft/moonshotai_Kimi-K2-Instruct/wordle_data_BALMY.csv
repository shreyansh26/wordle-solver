For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters at once

Common strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. Among these, ""RAISE"" is excellent because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant
- A, I: Two very common vowels
- S, E: Also common letters

This gives us a good spread of letters to test early on.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: correct position = 2 (✓)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we now know:
1. Second letter is A.
2. No R, I, S, or E anywhere in the word.

Next guess should:
- Keep A in position 2.
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels (we still have letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, T, U, W, Y, etc.).
- A strong candidate is “CHANT”:
  – C, H, N, T are all common consonants not yet ruled out.
  – O is a common vowel we haven’t tested yet, but “CHANT” only uses A which we’ve already confirmed, so let’s try another vowel with “CHANT”.

Actually, “CHANT” uses only the A we know; let’s include a new vowel. A better choice is “COAST” but it has S which is ruled out. Using “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are all new consonants
- A is fixed in position 2
- No ruled-out letters

So “PLANT” seems optimal.

But “PLANT” has N which is good, but let’s see: we want to test more vowels too. We haven’t tested O, U, etc. A better word might be “TALON”:
- T, L, O, N are new letters
- A is in correct spot
- No ruled-out letters (R, I, S, E not used).

Let’s go with TALON.
