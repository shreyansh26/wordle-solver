- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This is the first guess, so I have no feedback yet. The goal is to choose a strategic word that can help eliminate many possibilities and reveal useful information. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters (especially vowels and frequent consonants)
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Common strategic starting words include ""ARISE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. These use a mix of common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it covers:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) which appear in many words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

From the feedback on RAISE:

R – NOT in the word (x)  
A – in the word, wrong position (-)  
I – in the word, wrong position (-)  
S – NOT in the word (x)  
E – in the word, wrong position (-)

Take-aways:
- The secret word has no R or S.
- It does contain A, I, and E, but none of them are in the same positions they held in RAISE (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

Therefore, the secret word has the letters A, I, E placed somewhere in positions 1, 4, or swapped among themselves.  
I need a new guess that:
1. Keeps A, I, E (but rearranges them).
2. Introduces new consonants (since R and S are out).
3. Uses valid English words.

Good candidate consonants to test next are L, N, T, C, D, M, B, etc.  
A word that fits is “ALIEN”:
- Uses A, I, E in different positions.
- Adds L and N (new consonants).

It’s a legal 5-letter word and should give more information about the placement of A, I, E and whether L or N appear.

From both rounds we now know:

Letters ruled out: R S L N  
Letters confirmed to be in the word (positions still unknown): A I E  
Positions so far:
- A cannot be in spot 2 (from RAISE) nor spot 1 (from ALIEN) → must be 3, 4, or 5
- I cannot be in spot 3 (from RAISE) nor spot 3 (from ALIEN) → must be 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E cannot be in spot 5 (from RAISE) nor spot 4 (from ALIEN) → must be 1, 2, or 3

We still need two more consonants. From common English letters that haven’t been ruled out, T, D, C, B, M are good candidates.

I’m looking for a word that:
- contains A, I, E exactly once each
- uses two fresh consonants
- puts A, I, E in still-allowed positions

A promising candidate is “IDEA” plus a consonant. However, we need five letters.  
Another candidate: “MEDIA”
- M and D are fresh consonants.
- Letters: M E D I A → positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- Check constraints:
  – A at spot 5: allowed
  – I at spot 4: allowed
  – E at spot 2: allowed
So “MEDIA” fits all constraints and tests new consonants D and M.

Another good option is “AMIDE” but that repeats A as final letter which is fine, but let’s go with MEDIA first.
