- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy for a first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. 

Common letters in English include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C etc. I'll pick a word with a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple letters.

Possible good starting words include:
- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes common letters C, R, A, N, E.

From the first feedback:
- C (1st letter) – x → not in word
- R (2nd letter) – - → in word but NOT in position 2
- A (3rd letter) – - → in word but NOT in position 3
- N (4th letter) – x → not in word
- E (5th letter) – x → not in word

So the word definitely contains an R and an A, but neither is in the positions they occupied in CRANE (positions 2 and 3). Also, C, N, E are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and A (but R ≠ 2nd, A ≠ 3rd)
- Does NOT contain C, N, E
- Uses other letters that haven’t been tested yet to gain more information.

Good remaining letters to test include S, T, I, L, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Possible candidates:
- ROAST – uses R, A, O, S, T (R is 1st, A is 3rd – violates A ≠ 3rd)
- TRAPS – R is 2nd – violates R ≠ 2nd
- DRATS – R is 2nd – violates R ≠ 2nd
- STARK – uses S, T, A, R, K (A is 3rd – violates A ≠ 3rd)
- TRAIL – R is 2nd – violates R ≠ 2nd
- RAILS – R is 1st, A is 2nd, both acceptable
- RADIO – contains E (invalid)
- RAIDS – R is 1st, A is 2nd, both acceptable, letters not yet tested: D, I, S

""RAIDS"" looks good: positions 1 (R) and 2 (A) are allowed, introduces D, I, S.

Let’s summarize what we know so far:

1. Letters definitely in the word:
   - A  (confirmed in position 2)
   - R  (somewhere, but NOT position 1)
   - S  (somewhere, but NOT position 5)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   - C, N, E, I, D

3. Positions ruled out:
   - R cannot be in position 1
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3-5 (since it’s in position 2)
   - S cannot be in position 5

4. Letters not yet tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Contains R and S somewhere else (but R not in position 1 and S not in position 5)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Candidate pattern: _ A _ _ _

We need R and S elsewhere. Let’s find a word that satisfies R and S placement.

Possible candidates:
- B A R S ?  (but S cannot be 5th)
- T A R S ?  (same)
- M A R S H  – H is new, R is 3rd (allowed), S is 4th (allowed), A is 2nd ✓
- F A R S T
- P A R S E – E is ruled out
- L A R S O – O is new, R is 3rd, S is 4th, A is 2nd

Best picks: MARSH and LARSO. MARSH is more common and uses H (new letter).

Check MARSH:
- M: new
- A: 2nd ✓
- R: 3rd (allowed)
- S: 4th (allowed)
- H: new

No conflicts.
