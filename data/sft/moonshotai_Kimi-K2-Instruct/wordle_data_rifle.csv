- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. A good strategy is to choose a word with frequently used consonants and vowels, without repeating letters. Classic starting words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are popular, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" - it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage across the alphabet.

<guess>RIFLE</guess>",RIFLE,"Current confirmed information:
1. E is in position 5 (fixed).
2. R is in position 1 (fixed).
3. I is in position 2 (fixed).
4. Absent letters so far: A, O, S, T, C, N, D.

So the pattern is: R I _ _ E
Letters still available (not yet ruled out) for positions 3 and 4: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants left: L, B, M, P, K, G, H.

We need two more consonants (or consonant + vowel) to fill positions 3 and 4. The most common remaining consonants are L and M or B and P. Let me try L and M.

Possible word: R I L M E → ""RILME"" (but this isn't a valid English word)
