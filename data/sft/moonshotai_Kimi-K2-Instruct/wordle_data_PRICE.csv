As this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters.
3. A mix of vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers these well - it has:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to test for vowel presence
- 2 common consonants (R, S) to test consonant positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we know:
1. R is the 2nd letter.
2. E is the 5th letter.
3. The letters A, O, S are not present anywhere.
4. Remaining letters to test: the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions must be filled with letters not yet eliminated (excluding A, O, S).
5. Common remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep R in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Test new letters for positions 1, 3, 4.
- Prefer common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Possible candidates: ""TRIBE"" (but B not confirmed), ""DRIVE"" (I and V), ""CRIME"" (C, M), etc.
A balanced choice: ""TRIBE"" – it has T, I, B which are all common and not yet eliminated. However, this uses B which is less common. A better choice might be ""DRIVE"" – it uses D, I, V, which are common and not eliminated. 

But to maximize coverage, let's pick ""TRIBE"" since T and I are very common, and B is plausible.

Wait – let me pick ""CRIME"" instead as C and M are common, and I is a good vowel to test. Or ""PRIME"" – P, R, I, M, E covers P and M which are common.

But looking at common 5-letter words with R _ _ _ E, ""DRIVE"" is very common. Let's go with DRIVE.

However, DRIVE has V which is less common. Maybe ""TRIBE"" is better for letter coverage.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.
2. No repeating letters to test more unique letters.
3. A mix of vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" covers these well - it has:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) to test for vowel presence
- 2 common consonants (R, S) to test consonant positions
- All unique letters to maximize coverage

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we know:
1. R is the 2nd letter.
2. E is the 5th letter.
3. The letters A, O, S are not present anywhere.
4. Remaining letters to test: the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions must be filled with letters not yet eliminated (excluding A, O, S).
5. Common remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep R in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Test new letters for positions 1, 3, 4.
- Prefer common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Possible candidates: ""TRIBE"" (but B not confirmed), ""DRIVE"" (I and V), ""CRIME"" (C, M), etc.
A balanced choice: ""TRIBE"" – it has T, I, B which are all common and not yet eliminated. However, this uses B which is less common. A better choice might be ""DRIVE"" – it uses D, I, V, which are common and not eliminated. 

But to maximize coverage, let's pick ""TRIBE"" since T and I are very common, and B is plausible.

Wait – let me pick ""CRIME"" instead as C and M are common, and I is a good vowel to test. Or ""PRIME"" – P, R, I, M, E covers P and M which are common.

But looking at common 5-letter words with R _ _ _ E, ""DRIVE"" is very common. Let's go with DRIVE.

However, DRIVE has V which is less common. Maybe ""TRIBE"" is better for letter coverage.
