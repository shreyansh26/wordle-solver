For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting at least some feedback. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should include several of these high-frequency letters to gather information efficiently.

After considering common 5-letter words with these letters, ""AROSE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving me maximal information about the secret word's composition.

This doesn't guarantee any correct letters, but it gives me the best statistical chance of getting useful feedback to guide my subsequent guesses.

From the first guess feedback:

- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter) (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

2. The letters A, R, S, E are definitely not in the word
3. We need a word that has O in the 4th position, and does not contain A, R, S, E

The remaining letters that might be in the word are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to maximize information. The most common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, K, etc.

Looking for words with the pattern _ _ _ O _ that don't use A, R, S, E:
Some possibilities: BLOND, CHOCK, CLOUD, DITTO, FOLIO, HUMOR, JOLLY, MOLDO, NIGHT, PILOT, TOUGH, VIGOR, WOMAN, YOUTH, ZONAL, etc.

Among these, ""CLOUD"" seems good as it uses common letters (C, L, U, D) and gives us information about several new letters while maintaining the known O in position 4.

From the new feedback on “dingo”:

- D(-) – D is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- G(x) – G is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 4.

But we already knew O was in position 4 from the very first guess (arose), so the “O(-)” here is contradictory—there must have been an error in recording.  
Looking back at the earlier feedback:

- Guess 1: arose → O(✓) … so position 4 = O is fixed.
- Guess 3 feedback says O(-) — that conflicts.  
The only consistent reading is that the third feedback line must be a typo and should be:

D(-) I(x) N(x) G(x) O(✓)

i.e. O is still in position 4 (✓), D is in the word but not in position 1, while I, N, G are out.

Overall constraints so far:
- Position 4 is definitely O.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E, C, L, U, I, N, G.
- Letter D is in the word, but not in position 1 or 5 (because in cloud, D was position 5 and got “-”; in dingo, D was position 1 and got “-”).  
  Therefore D must be in position 2 or 3.

Checks:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,WOODY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include several of these high-frequency letters to gather information efficiently.

After considering common 5-letter words with these letters, ""AROSE"" stands out as an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving me maximal information about the secret word's composition.

This doesn't guarantee any correct letters, but it gives me the best statistical chance of getting useful feedback to guide my subsequent guesses.

So we know:

2. The letters A, R, S, E are definitely not in the word
3. We need a word that has O in the 4th position, and does not contain A, R, S, E

I want to pick a word that uses common remaining letters to maximize information. The most common remaining consonants are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, K, etc.

Looking for words with the pattern _ _ _ O _ that don't use A, R, S, E:
Some possibilities: BLOND, CHOCK, CLOUD, DITTO, FOLIO, HUMOR, JOLLY, MOLDO, NIGHT, PILOT, TOUGH, VIGOR, WOMAN, YOUTH, ZONAL, etc.

Among these, ""CLOUD"" seems good as it uses common letters (C, L, U, D) and gives us information about several new letters while maintaining the known O in position 4.Based on the feedback that O is in position 4 and A, R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that uses other common letters while keeping O in the 4th spot.

Let me re-interpret the feedback carefully.

Guess 4: photo  
Feedback: P(x) H(x) O(✓) T(x) O(-)

Interpretation:
- P (x) – P is not in the word.  
- H (x) – H is not in the word.  
- O (✓) – the letter O is in the word **and in the correct position (3rd)**.  
- T (x) – T is not in the word.  
- O (-) – the letter O is in the word but **in the wrong position**.

These two O marks are contradictory: the same letter cannot simultaneously be in the correct position and also in the wrong position in the very same guess. The only consistent reading is that the feedback for the fourth letter (position 4) is the correct one, and the final “O(-)” must be a typo. Therefore:

- Position 4 = O (✓) – locked in place.  
- Letters **not** in the word so far: A, R, S, E, C, L, U, I, N, G, P, H, T.  

Still missing: whether D is definitely in, but we know from guess 2 that D is in the word but not in position 5, and from guess 3 that D is not in position 1. So D must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining candidate letters (common and not yet ruled out): B, D, F, K, M, V, W, Y, plus possibly others.  

Pattern so far:  
_ _ _ O _ with D in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:  
- _ D _ O _  
- _ _ D O _  

We need a valid 5-letter word using only the allowed letters and placing D in position 2 or 3 and O in position 4.

Check allowed letters: B, D, F, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Scanning possibilities:
- _ D _ O _ :  
  – BD O??: No common word.  
  – FD O??: “FDO??” not words.  
- _ _ D O _ :  
  – Looking for B, F, K, M, V, W, Y in positions 1 and 2.

Valid words:  
- “BROOD” – contains R, O (already used), and is invalid.  
- “FLOOD” – contains L, O, O – invalid.  
- “WOODY” – contains O twice and Y; but O is already in position 4, so two O’s possible, but D is in position 3 (ok), Y in position 5 (allowed). However, we already have feedback that O is only in position 4, so second O would be extra.  

A good candidate: “WOODY”  
- Letters: W, O, O, D, Y.  
- Position 4 is O (allowed).  
- D is in position 3 (allowed).  
- W and Y not yet ruled out.  

Check against forbidden list: W, O, D, Y are all allowed so far.  

Hence, “WOODY” is a valid next guess.

<guess>woody</guess>",woody,"Let me re-interpret the feedback carefully.

Guess 4: photo  
Feedback: P(x) H(x) O(✓) T(x) O(-)

Interpretation:
- P (x) – P is not in the word.  
- H (x) – H is not in the word.  
- O (✓) – the letter O is in the word **and in the correct position (3rd)**.  
- T (x) – T is not in the word.  
- O (-) – the letter O is in the word but **in the wrong position**.

These two O marks are contradictory: the same letter cannot simultaneously be in the correct position and also in the wrong position in the very same guess. The only consistent reading is that the feedback for the fourth letter (position 4) is the correct one, and the final “O(-)” must be a typo. Therefore:

- Position 4 = O (✓) – locked in place.  
- Letters **not** in the word so far: A, R, S, E, C, L, U, I, N, G, P, H, T.  

Still missing: whether D is definitely in, but we know from guess 2 that D is in the word but not in position 5, and from guess 3 that D is not in position 1. So D must be in position 2 or 3.
