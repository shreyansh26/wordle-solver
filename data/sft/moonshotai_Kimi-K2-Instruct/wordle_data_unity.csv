For the first guess, I want to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants to quickly eliminate possibilities. Words like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular starting choices.

Looking at these:
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - has 2 vowels and 3 very common consonants
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good mix of consonants and vowels

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it incorporates the most vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving broad coverage for elimination.

All five letters in “AROSE” (A, R, O, S, E) were marked with an “x”, meaning none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That immediately rules out many common letters, so for the second guess I want to:
1. Use only letters that haven’t been ruled out (i.e., none of A, R, O, S, E).
2. Still pick a word with very common remaining consonants and a vowel or two, so I can quickly narrow down possibilities.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, F, M, H, P, Y, etc.  
Common vowels still available: I, U (A, O, E ruled out).

A good balanced choice is “UNTIL”:
- U, N, T, I, L – none of A, R, O, S, E appear.  
- Uses two still-available vowels (U, I) and three very common consonants (N, T, L).

From the feedback we have so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

2. UNTIL → U(✓) N(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒  
   - U is correct in position 1.  
   - N is correct in position 2.  
   - T is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - L is not in the word at all.

So our pattern so far is: U N _ _ _

Letters we know are in the remaining positions (3, 4, 5): T and I, plus any other letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Ruled-out letters so far: A, R, O, S, E, L.

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus B and T and I (with placement constraints).

T must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in position 3).  
I must appear in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be in position 4).

Let’s list possible combinations:

- If I is in position 3 and T in position 4: U N I T _  
  Valid 5th letters (not ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Common word: “UNITS” – but S is already ruled out.  
  “UNITY” – Y is allowed. Could be “UNITY”.

- If T is in position 5 and I in position 3: U N I _ T  
  4th letter: any not ruled out. Common test: “UNIQ T” – no.  
  “UNIKT” – invalid.  
  “UNFIT” – F, I, T allowed. Seems valid.

- If I is in position 5 and T in position 4: U N _ T I

Let’s list possible combinations:

- If I is in position 3 and T in position 4: U N I T _  
  Valid 5th letters (not ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Common word: “UNITS” – but S is already ruled out.  
  “UNITY” – Y is allowed. Could be “UNITY”.

- If T is in position 5 and I in position 3: U N I _ T  
  4th letter: any not ruled out. Common test: “UNIQ T” – no.  
  “UNIKT” – invalid.  
  “UNFIT” – F, I, T allowed. Seems valid.

- If I is in position 5 and T in position 4: U N _ T I  
  3rd letter: any not ruled out.  
  “UNCTI” – invalid.  
  “UNGTI” – invalid.  
  “UNBTI” – invalid.  
  “UND TI” – invalid.  
  “UNFTI” – invalid.  
  “UNMTI” – invalid.  
  “UNK TI” – invalid.  
  “UNPTI” – invalid.  
  “UNVTI” – invalid.  
  “UNYTI” – invalid.  
  “UNDTI” – invalid.  
  “UNBTI” – invalid.  
  “UNGTI” – invalid.  
  “UNBTI” – invalid.  

- If T is in position 3: ruled out (feedback says T is not in position 3).  

The most promising valid English word fitting the constraints appears to be “UNFIT”.

Let me double-check:  
- U in position 1: ✓  
- N in position 2: ✓  
- T in position 4: allowed (not position 3)  
- I in position 3: allowed (not position 4)  
- F in position 5: not ruled out  
- No ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S, E, L) present.

“UNFIT” is a valid English 5-letter word that satisfies all feedback.

Current constraints:

1. Word must start with U N  _  _  _
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, L, F
3. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - T   (cannot be in 3rd position)
   - I   (cannot be in 4th position)

Summary of positions:

1: U (fixed)
2: N (fixed)
3: cannot be T, I, A, R, O, S, E, L, F
4: cannot be I, A, R, O, S, E, L, F
5: unrestricted except for forbidden list A,R,O,S,E,L,F

So the third position must be one of the remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Likewise for position 4, but must also accommodate the fact that I and T still have to fit somewhere.

We know T and I must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5 under these restrictions.

Possible placements:

Case 1: T in position 4, I in position 3  
   Pattern: U N I T _  
   5th letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out → possible: C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   English word that fits: U N I T Y  (UNITY)

Case 2: T in position 5, I in position 3  
   Pattern: U N I _ T  
   4th letter must be a consonant not ruled out → U N I C T, U N I D T… but none of these form common 5-letter English words.

Case 3: T in position 5, I in position 4  
   Pattern: U N _ I T  
   3rd letter must be a consonant not ruled out → U N C I T (UNICT – invalid), U N D I T (UNDIT – invalid), U N G I T (UNGIT – invalid), etc. No common word.

Case 4: T in position 3 (but feedback says T is not in position 3) → impossible.

Thus the only plausible remaining candidate is UNITY.

Check:
- U in 1 ✓  
- N in 2 ✓  
- I in 3 (allowed)  
- T in 4 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (not ruled out)  
- No forbidden letters A,R,O,S,E,L,F used.
