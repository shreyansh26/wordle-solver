### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, helping me eliminate or confirm letters for future guesses.

I want a new word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Includes R somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses fresh, high-frequency consonants.

A good candidate: “TREND”.
- E is in the right place.
- R is in position 2; since feedback showed R is not in position 2, I should avoid that. So “TREND” is actually bad.

Re-evaluate: R must appear at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E).  
“BERET” – E is at 5, R at 2 – again violates R not in 2.

   - Letters eliminated: D, I, N
   - E again confirmed in position 5.
   - R exists but is NOT in position 4.

So far:

- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3 (cannot be 2 or 4 or 5).
- Remaining consonants still possible (from typical high-frequency list): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels still possible: U (A, O, I already eliminated).

A good next word should:
- Place E in slot 5 (already guaranteed).
- Place R in slot 1 or 3.
- Introduce new, high-frequency consonants and the vowel U (only remaining vowel).

- R U M P E – not a word.

- B U R G E – G is okay, but B and G are lower frequency than C.
- P U R G E – same.
- T U R K E – not valid.
- L U R C E – not valid.

CURVE looks best: C, U, R, V, E – all letters are new except E (already confirmed) and R (placement now fixed to 3). Let’s check constraints:

- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the 5th position.

Letters still possible: R, E (and we know E is at the end).  
Letters eliminated: A, O, S.

Common consonants still available: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

I want a new word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Includes R somewhere other than position 2.
- Uses fresh, high-frequency consonants.

A good candidate: “TREND”.
- E is in the right place.
- R is in position 2; since feedback showed R is not in position 2, I should avoid that. So “TREND” is actually bad.

Re-evaluate: R must appear at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E).  
“BERET” – E is at 5, R at 2 – again violates R not in 2.

Try “INTER”.  
- I, N, T, E, R  
- E is at 4, but we know E is at 5 – bad.

Try “CREEP”.  
- E at 4 – bad.

Try “PURER”.  
- E at 4 – bad.

Try “CRANE”.  
- E at 5 – good.  
- R at 3 – acceptable (not at 2).  
- Uses new letters C, N.

So “CRANE” satisfies:
- E is in position 5 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C, N, A are fresh; but A was already eliminated (x).  
Oops – A was eliminated. Replace A with another vowel: “IRONE”? Not a word.

Replace A with U: “CRUNE”? Not a word.

Use “INERT”? E at 4 – bad.

Use “CURER”? E at 4 – bad.

Use “URGED”? E at 4 – bad.

Try “BRINE”:  
- E at 5 – good.  
- R at 2 – bad (feedback said R not at 2).

Try “DINER”:

   - Letters eliminated: D, I, N
   - E again confirmed in position 5.
   - R exists but is NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Fixed letter: _ _ _ _ E
- R must appear in one of positions 1, 3 (cannot be 2 or 4 or 5).
- Remaining consonants still possible (from typical high-frequency list): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels still possible: U (A, O, I already eliminated).

A good next word should:
- Place E in slot 5 (already guaranteed).
- Place R in slot 1 or 3.
- Introduce new, high-frequency consonants and the vowel U (only remaining vowel).

Candidate forms:
- R _ _ _ E with R in 1
- _ _ R _ E with R in 3

Let’s brainstorm:

R _ _ _ E:
- R U _ _ E → RUBBE? Not valid. RUDGE? RUGGE? No.
- R U M P E – not a word.
- R U L E – too short.
- R U T L E – not a word.
- R E L I E – I is eliminated.
- R E C K E – not a word.

- B U R G E – G is okay, but B and G are lower frequency than C.
- P U R G E – same.
- T U R K E – not valid.
- L U R C E – not valid.

CURVE looks best: C, U, R, V, E – all letters are new except E (already confirmed) and R (placement now fixed to 3). Let’s check constraints:

Let's consolidate what we now know:

Fixed letters (exact positions):
- Position 5: E ✓

Confirmed in the word but positions unknown:
- R must appear somewhere (present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)
- U must appear somewhere (present but not in position 2)

Positions R can still occupy:
- R cannot be in 2, 3, 4 (from feedback) and 5 is already E → R must be in position 1.

So the word so far is:
R _ _ _ E
with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Letters eliminated so far: A, O, S, D, I, N, C, V

Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y
Remaining vowels: U (already confirmed), and we still have space for one more vowel (but A, O, I are eliminated). The only other vowel left is Y (sometimes used as vowel).

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated, keeping in mind:
- U must appear once among positions 2,3,4
- Other two positions must be consonants from remaining set

Possible patterns:
R U _ _ E
R _ U _ E
R _ _ U E

Let's explore possibilities:

1. R U _ _ E:
   - Need two consonants from remaining set for positions 3,4
   - Possible: R U M P E (RUMPE - not valid)
   - R U B E E - invalid (repeated E)
   - R U B L E - valid word ""RUBLE""

   - R B L U E - ""RBLUE"" - no
   - R F U E - too short

From the new feedback:

RUBLE → R(✓) U(✓) B(x) L(x) E(✓)

This tells us:

1. R is now locked into position 1.
2. U is locked into position 2.
3. E is locked into position 5.
4. B and L are NOT in the word at all.

So the word must be: R U _ _ E
with positions 3 and 4 filled by letters that:
- have NOT yet been eliminated,
- are different from B and L.

Letters already eliminated so far:
A, O, S, D, I, N, C, V, B, L

Remaining consonants: F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y
(plus any other unused consonants, but these are the common ones)

We just need to pick two different consonants from the remaining set to fill positions 3 and 4.

Let’s list valid English words of the pattern R U _ _ E:

- R U F F E – “RUFFE” (valid fish name, but obscure; might be acceptable)
- R U F L E – invalid (L eliminated)
- R U G A E – not a word
- R U G G E – “RUGGE” is archaic; but “RUGGED” is 6 letters
- R U M P E – “RUMPE” is obsolete
- R U M M E – “RUMME” is obsolete
- R U N G E – “RUNGE” is a surname but not common dictionary
- R U T T E – “RUTTE” is not standard
- R U P E E – “RUPEE” (valid currency word)
- R U S E E – not valid
- R U G E L – L is eliminated
- R U T G E – not valid
- R U M E N – but pattern is R U _ _ E, not R U M E N

Among these, “RUPEE” fits perfectly:
- R at 1 ✓
- U at 2 ✓
- P and E are valid, E at 5 ✓
- Letters P and E are both still possible.

So we’ll try RUPEE.
