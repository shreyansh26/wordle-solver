1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words often use letters like A, E, R, T, L, S, N, etc. A well-balanced word like ""SLATE"" or ""AROSE"" is good, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - covering many frequent letters and vowels. This should give us good feedback to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and IS in position 5 (✓)

So we know:

- I (new vowel)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

R (✓) U (✓) _ _ E (✓)

and we know the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, D, G, I, L, N, O, S, T.

Available consonants (must fill positions 3 and 4): C, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two consonants that are still allowed. Trying common ones not yet used: C, F, H, K, M, P.

Candidate pairings:
- C and H → RUCHE
- F and H → RUFHE (not a word)
- M and P → RUMPE (not a word)
- C and K → RUCKE (not a word)
- C and M → RUCME (not a word)
- C and F → RUCFE (not a word)
- F and C → RUFCE (not a word)
- H and C → RUHCE (not a word)
- K and C → RUKCE (not a word)

RUCHE is a valid English word (“a frill or pleat”). It uses C and H, both still allowed.

So next guess: RUCHE

Current confirmed pattern:  
R (position 1) U (position 2) _ _ E (position 5)

Letters eliminated so far: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, L, N, O, S, T.

Only consonants still allowed: F, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct consonants from the allowed set to fill positions 3 and 4.  
Among those, F, K, M, P, V are common English letters that can form a valid word.

Possible valid combinations that make real 5-letter words:
- R U F F E  → “RUFFE” (a small fish)  
- R U M P E → “RUMPE” (not valid)  
- R U P V E → invalid  
- R U V F E → invalid  
- R U P K E → invalid  
etc.

The only valid remaining option is RUFFE, using F twice (which is allowed if the secret word contains double letters). We have no info against a double F, so this is the logical last guess.
