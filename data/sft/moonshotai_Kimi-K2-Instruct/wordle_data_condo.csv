Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ARISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these:
- SLATE covers common consonants (S,L,T) and vowels (A,E)
- CRANE covers different common letters (C,R,N) with A,E
- ARISE covers many vowels and common consonants
- ADIEU focuses heavily on vowels

""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 consonants (S,L,T) and 2 vowels (A,E) in balanced positions
2. S is the most common starting letter in English words
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It can quickly eliminate or confirm positions for these high-frequency letters

This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

That leaves the remaining high-frequency consonants: R, N, C, M, D, P, B, F, G, H, K and the remaining vowels: I, O, U.  
A balanced, informative next guess should use five fresh, common letters that haven’t been eliminated yet.  
Good combinations include:
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – covers three common consonants and two vowels.  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – heavy on vowels plus common consonants.

Feedback summary so far:
- C: correct in position 1
- R, Y: not in the word at all
- O: present but wrong position
- N: present but wrong position

Therefore:
- The word starts with C
- It contains O and N, but O is not in position 3, N is not in position 4
- It cannot contain S, L, A, T, E, R, Y

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W  
Remaining common vowels: I, U

Possible patterns: C _ _ _ _ with O and N somewhere, but not in the positions they were just tried.

Given that O is in the word but not third, and N is in the word but not fourth, we need to place them in new slots. Likely positions for O: 2,4,5; for N: 2,3,5.

A good next guess should test new common consonants while placing O and N in new positions. ""COVIN"" uses C, O, V, I, N - but V is less common. ""CONIC"" reuses C which is already confirmed. ""CONCH"" uses H which is common. ""COMPO"" uses P and M but no N.

""COUGH"" seems good: uses C, O, U, G, H - all common letters, places O in position 2 (new position), and tests U as a vowel while introducing G and H.

But wait - we know N must be in the word, and ""COUGH"" doesn't contain N. That would be a mistake. We must include N.

Alternative: ""CROWN"" - but R is already eliminated. ""COPIN"" - P, I, N. This places O in position 2 (new), N in position 5 (new), introduces P and I.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Looking at these:
- SLATE covers common consonants (S,L,T) and vowels (A,E)
- CRANE covers different common letters (C,R,N) with A,E
- ARISE covers many vowels and common consonants
- ADIEU focuses heavily on vowels

""SLATE"" is particularly good because:

- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) – heavy on vowels plus common consonants.  
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K) – includes common consonants and a vowel.

- C: correct in position 1

Therefore:
- The word starts with C
- It contains O and N, but O is not in position 3, N is not in position 4

Remaining common consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W

Possible patterns: C _ _ _ _ with O and N somewhere, but not in the positions they were just tried.

Given that O is in the word but not third, and N is in the word but not fourth, we need to place them in new slots. Likely positions for O: 2,4,5; for N: 2,3,5.

A good next guess should test new common consonants while placing O and N in new positions. ""COVIN"" uses C, O, V, I, N - but V is less common. ""CONIC"" reuses C which is already confirmed. ""CONCH"" uses H which is common. ""COMPO"" uses P and M but no N.

""COUGH"" seems good: uses C, O, U, G, H - all common letters, places O in position 2 (new position), and tests U as a vowel while introducing G and H.

But wait - we know N must be in the word, and ""COUGH"" doesn't contain N. That would be a mistake. We must include N.

Alternative: ""CROWN"" - but R is already eliminated. ""COPIN"" - P, I, N. This places O in position 2 (new), N in position 5 (new), introduces P and I.

Yes, ""COPIN"" seems good: C(✓) in place 1, O in new position 2, N in new position 5, plus common P and I.

5. Allowed and unused consonants remaining: D, F, G, K, M, U, W, plus vowel U.

So the last two letters must be chosen from the set {D, F, G, K, M, U, W}, and must be different from each other (no repeats).

Wait, the remaining letters can be any two distinct letters from {D,F,G,K,M,U,W}. We need a real word.

Searching real words:

- CONGA  – but A is banned.
- CONGE  – E banned.
- CONGO – O already used, second O allowed? No, already two O’s, but O is in position 2, so another O is allowed? Let’s check: O already in position 2, can appear again elsewhere unless feedback forbids. Feedback never indicated a duplicate issue. So CONGO is possible.

CONGO – letters C,O,N,G,O.

Check constraints:
C ✓
O ✓
N ✓
G unused so far (allowed)
O allowed again (no restriction against repeats)

Haven’t tried G yet, and it fits the pattern.

Another possibility is CONKY, but Y is banned. CONGA has banned A. CONFY – Y banned. CONDO – D unused, O already used. CONDO is valid: C O N D O.

Check CONDO:
Positions: C O N D O.
All letters allowed (no repeats except O, which is fine).

Between CONGO and CONDO, both obey all rules. CONGO has an extra O, CONDO has D and O. Let’s pick CONDO first because it uses D (new letter) and places O in 5th position (new placement).

G unused so far (allowed)
O allowed again (no restriction against repeats)

Haven’t tried G yet, and it fits the pattern.

Another possibility is CONKY, but Y is banned. CONGA has banned A. CONFY – Y banned. CONDO – D unused, O already used. CONDO is valid: C O N D O.

Check CONDO:
Positions: C O N D O.
All letters allowed (no repeats except O, which is fine).

Between CONGO and CONDO, both obey all rules. CONGO has an extra O, CONDO has D and O. Let’s pick CONDO first because it uses D (new letter) and places O in 5th position (new placement).

So the next guess is CONDO.",Guess 5: CONDO -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) N(✓) D(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
