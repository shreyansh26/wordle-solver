For the first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give good information while covering common letters. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are often recommended for this purpose. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes common letters S, L, A, T, E which should help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

From the two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: SLATE  
S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)

Guess 2: LEARN  
L(-) E(✓) A(-) R(x) N(x)

What we now know:

- Letters NOT in the word at all: S, T, R, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E  
- The exact positions we can rule out so far:
  – L is not in positions 2 or 1  
  – A is not in positions 3 or 2  
  – E is not in position 5  
  – E is ✓ in position 2 (so the word has E in slot 2)

Therefore the word looks like:
_ E _ _ _

with the remaining letters to place somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5: L and A (plus whatever new consonants we test).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Contains L and A somewhere in the remaining slots.
3. Uses only letters from the English alphabet that are still possible (avoid S, T, R, N).

A good choice that meets these constraints and introduces a couple of new common consonants (D and C) is “BEACH”.

Check:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- Contains A and the new letters B, C, H
- Does not use S, T, R, N
- Uses L? No – but that’s fine; we can test L in a later guess when we have more constraints. The priority now is to pin down positions for A and discover any new letters.

Wait – I realize I need L somewhere to confirm its placement. Let me rethink.

We must include L, A, E and we already fixed E in slot 2. The remaining letters are L and A plus three unknown slots.

A word that fits: “PEALS” – but S is invalid.
Another: “MEALY” – Y could be useful, but we still don’t place L in a new position.

Better: “HEALD” – H, E, A, L, D
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (new slot)
- A is in position 3 (new slot)
- Introduces H and D (both are still possible)
- No banned letters.

Let's update what we now know from all three guesses.

1. Letters ruled out: S, T, R, N, H, D  
2. Letters confirmed to be in the word: L, A, E  
3. Fixed positions so far:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)  
   - L is in position 4 (✓)  
4. Positions ruled out for remaining letters:
   - A has been tried in positions 2, 3 (and once eliminated from position 3) → still possible in 1, 4, 5  
     But position 4 is already L, so A can now only be in 1 or 5.

So the word looks like:
? E ? L ?

with the two unknown slots 1 and 5 needing the letter A plus one more valid letter not yet ruled out.

Letters we can still use: basically any consonant/vowel except S, T, R, N, H, D.

Common letters left: C, G, B, M, F, Y, K, etc.

We need a real 5-letter word that fits:
- E in 2  
- L in 4  
- A in either 1 or 5  
- One more different letter in the remaining slot  

Try A in position 1:
A E ? L ? → AE_L_  
Need a consonant for slot 3 and slot 5.  
Valid word: “AEGLO” – not an English word.  
Valid word: “AEGIS” – contains S (invalid).  
Valid word: “AEONS” – S invalid.  

Try A in position 5:
? E ? L A → _E_LA  
Need a consonant for positions 1 and 3.

Real words fitting _E_LA:
- CELLA, BELLA, FELLA, MELLA, PELLA, ZELLA  
But we must check allowed letters.
Allowed letters for slot 1: C, B, F, M, P, Z, etc. (not S, T, R, N, H, D).  
All of BELLA, CELLA, FELLA, MELLA, PELLA, ZELLA are valid.

Among these, “FELLA” uses F, E, L, L, A.  L is already known and F is a fresh consonant to test.  It satisfies:
- E in 2, L in 4, A in 5  
- No banned letters  
- Uses only one new letter F (good for efficiency)

Therefore, the next guess is FELLA.
