For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and gives maximum information. The best starting words often have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Good letter distribution for eliminating many possibilities

The feedback shows:
- All letters except E are NOT in the word (marked with x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So the word ends with “E” and contains none of C, R, A, or N.

To make the second guess informative I should:
- Keep the final E.
- Introduce a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried yet.

Good remaining common letters include: T, L, S, M, D, O, I, U, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, W, etc.

A word that uses several of these and ends in E:
- “SLIME” uses S, L, I, M, E.  
- “HOUSE” uses H, O, U, S, E.  

Between these, “HOUSE” gives us three fresh vowels (O, U) plus two new common consonants (H, S) in addition to the known E at the end. It will quickly narrow down which remaining vowels and consonants are present.

Hence I’ll guess “HOUSE”.

So far we know:
- The word ends in E (from CRANE and HOUSE feedback).
- H and O are in the word but not in their current positions.
- C, R, A, N, U, S are NOT in the word at all.

Letters that remain possible: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus H and O (which must be used somewhere else).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains H and O somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively, since they were marked ""-"" in HOUSE).
3. Uses only untested letters otherwise.

Let’s try to place H and O in new positions. Since H can’t be in position 1 and O can’t be in position 2, let’s try putting O in position 1 and H in position 3 or 4.

One candidate: ""HOMIE"" – but M and I are untested, though E is in correct spot. However, this uses O in position 2, which was where it was marked ""-"" before (O was position 2 in HOUSE and marked ""-"", so it can't be in position 2). So ""HOMIE"" is invalid.

Better candidate: ""BOGIE"" – but B, G, I are untested, but we lack H and O here. Wait, we need both H and O in the word.

Another candidate: ""PHONE"" – but P, N are untested, N was already ruled out in CRANE. So N is invalid.

Next: ""CHOKE"" – but C was ruled out, and we have K untested. Not valid.

Next: ""THOSE"" – but S was ruled out, and T is untested. Also O is position 2 again, which was ""-"" before. Invalid.

Next: ""WHOLE"" – W, H, O, L, E. Here:
- E is correct at end.
- H is position 2 (was position 1 in HOUSE and marked ""-"", so this is allowed).
- O is position 3 (was position 2 in HOUSE and marked ""-"", so allowed).
- W and L are untested.

This seems valid and uses fresh letters.

So I’ll guess WHOLE.
