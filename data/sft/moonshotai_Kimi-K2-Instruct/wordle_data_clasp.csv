- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word with common letters that can give us the most information. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A popular and effective choice is ""SLATE"" as it has S, L (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels), plus T. This covers many frequent letters and should provide good initial feedback.

The feedback from SLATE tells me:
1. S is in the word but in the wrong position (S-)
2. L is in the correct position (L✓ at position 2)
3. A is in the correct position (A✓ at position 3)
4. T is not in the word (T x)
5. E is not in the word (E x)

So far the pattern is: _ L A _ _  
Letters not in the word: T, E  
Letters in wrong positions: S (must appear elsewhere than position 1)

Now I want to test new letters while keeping L and A fixed in positions 2 and 3. I should try common letters that haven't appeared yet: R, I, N, C, O, K, etc. A good word to test next would be ""CLANK"" because:
- C is untested
- L and A stay fixed
- N is a common letter
- K is untested
- S must appear somewhere else, so I’ll move it to position 5

But I can’t use E or T, and I need to place S elsewhere. Let me try ""CLASP"":
- C (new)
- L (✓)
- A (✓)
- S (moved from position 1 to 4)
- P (new)

This tests C, P, and repositions S without any forbidden letters.
