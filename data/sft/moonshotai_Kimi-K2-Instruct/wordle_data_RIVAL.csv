For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are good first guesses because they contain frequently used letters. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Letters that are in the word: A, R, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, N  
Positions ruled out:
- A is not in position 1 (from AROSE) nor 3 (from TRAIN).
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) nor 2 again (confirmed).
- I is not in position 4.

So the word has exactly the letters A, R, I plus two more letters chosen from the remaining unused alphabet letters (excluding the eliminated ones).

Unused letters (not yet tested, excluding O, S, E, T, N):
B C D F G H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, I
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, N
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- R cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 4

A good next step is to pick a word that uses two new common consonants to fill the remaining blanks and satisfy the positional constraints. Common remaining consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s look for a word that uses these rules. A promising candidate is ""CRIMP"":
- C, R, I, M, P  
- Contains R and I, and A is not present here, which is a problem since A must be in the word.

Wait, we need all three: A, R, I.

Another candidate: ""FRIAR""  
- F, R, I, A, R  
- Contains A, R, I
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in positions 2 and 5. The first R in position 2 is invalid (from TRAIN feedback). So this is invalid.

""PILAR""  
- P, I, L, A, R  
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses new letters P and L.

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains A, R, I
- A not in 1 or 3 (it's in 4)

Let’s digest the latest feedback on PILAR:

P(x) – P is not in the word.  
I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).  

So far we know the word must contain:
• I in position 2  
• A in position 4  
• L and R somewhere (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)  
And it must NOT contain O, S, E, T, N, P.

Position map so far:
1: ?  
2: I  
3: ? (but cannot be L)  
4: A  
5: ? (but cannot be R)

Available letters for positions 1, 3, 5 (excluding the banned ones) are:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Rules:
- L must appear once, somewhere other than position 3.  
- R must appear once, somewhere other than position 5.  
- The remaining slot (the one not filled by L or R) must be one of the remaining consonants.

We have to place L and R into positions {1,3,5} while respecting their exclusions.

Possible placements:
Case 1: L in 1, R in 3 → Results in L I R A ? but R cannot be in 3 because feedback said R(-) in position 5, not 3 – actually the feedback only said R(-) without specifying relative position, it just means it is in the word but not necessarily in 5. However, since it was in 5 and marked (-), it means R is in the word but not in 5. So R could be in 1 or 3.

But we have to be careful:
- L(-) means L is in the word but not in 3. So L could be in 1 or 5.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in 5. So R could be in 1 or 3.  

And we must use both L and R.

Let’s enumerate valid placements of L and R in positions {1,3,5}:

1. L in 1, R in 3 → 1:L, 3:R → L I R A 5:?
   Then position 5 must be a new consonant.  
   Word so far: L I R A _   → needs one more consonant. Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   A common choice is to try a consonant that forms a valid word. Let’s pick a consonant for 5.  
   Trying C: LIRAC – but is LIRAC a valid English word? No.  
   Trying D: LIRAD – no.  
   Trying B: LIRAB – no.  
   Trying C: LIRAC – no.  
   Trying K: LIRAK – no.  
   Trying G: LIRAG – no.  
   So LIR_A_ may not be fruitful.

2. L in 1, R in 3: same as above, seems no common words.

3. L in 5, R in 1 → 1:R, 5:L → R I _ A L  
   Position 3 must be a new consonant.  
   Word pattern: R I _ A L  
   Fill position 3 with a consonant not yet used.  
   Try B: RIBAL – exists (RIBAL is a surname but not common, probably not in word lists).  
   Try C: RICAL – no.  
   Try D: RIDAL – no.  
   Try F: RIFAL – no.  
   Try G: RIGAL – RIGAL is a brand, but not a common word.  
   Try M: RIMAL – no.  
   Try V: RIVAL – yes! RIVAL is a valid English word.

4. L in 5, R in 3 → 1:?, 3:R, 5:L → _ I R A L  
   Position 1 must be a consonant.  
   Try C: CIRAL – no.  
   Try B: BIRAL – no.  
   Try D: DIRAL – no.  
   Try F: FIRAL – no.  
   Try H: HIRAL – no.  
   Try V: VIRAL – yes! VIRAL is a valid word.

5. L in 3 is invalid (feedback said L is not in 3).  
6. R in 5 is invalid (feedback said R is not in 5).

So the two promising candidates are RIVAL and VIRAL.

Check constraints:
- RIVAL: R I V A L  
  – I in 2: ✓  
  – A in 4: ✓  
  – L is in 5 (not in 3): ✓  
  – R is in 1 (not in 5): ✓  
  – Letters used: R, I, V, A, L – none banned.  
  – All positions valid.

- VIRAL: V I R A L  
  – I in 2: ✓  
  – A in 4: ✓  
  – L in 5: ✓  
  – R in 3: allowed? Feedback said R(-) in PILAR, which was position 5, so R cannot be in 5 but can be in 3.  
  – Letters used: V, I, R, A, L – none banned.  
  – All positions valid.

Both are valid. RIVAL seems slightly more common.

I will choose RIVAL.
