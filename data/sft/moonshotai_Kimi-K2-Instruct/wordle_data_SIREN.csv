Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are among the most frequent in English words. A good starting word should include these common letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

We now have useful feedback showing that:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in the 2nd slot).
- I, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions.
- A is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A.
- Contains R, I, S, and E somewhere, each in a different position from their locations in ARISE.

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ position 2
- I ≠ position 3
- S ≠ position 4
- E ≠ position 5

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the four known letters (R, I, S, E) but shuffle them to new positions.
2. Introduce a new consonant (since A is ruled out, we can try another common vowel like O or U, or a common consonant like T, N, L, or D).

A word that does this is “TRIES”:
- T is a new letter.
- R moves from position 2 → 2 is now ruled out, so we place R in 1.
- I moves from 3 → let’s put it in 2.
- E moves from 5 → let’s put it in 3.
- S moves from 4 → let’s put it in 4 (but that’s still the same position, so instead we’ll put S in 5).

Wait, that would make T R I E S, but then E would still be in position 3 (same as feedback shows E is in the word but wrong position, and in ARISE it was in 5, so 3 is allowed). But S would be in 5, which was E's old position, so S is moving to 5. That’s okay.

But actually, let me think of a word that moves every known letter to a NEW position:

R: from 2 → must go to 1, 3, 4, or 5
I: from 3 → must go to 1, 2, 4, or 5
S: from 4 → must go to 1, 2, 3, or 5
E: from 5 → must go to 1, 2, 3, or 4

One valid arrangement is “TRIES”:
- T (new letter) in 1
- R in 2 (but R was in 2 in ARISE, so this violates the rule)
Oops, so R cannot be in 2. Let me pick another arrangement.

Try “STRIE”:
- S in 1 (from 4 → new)
- T in 2 (new)
- R in 3 (from 2 → new)
- I in 4 (from 3 → new)
- E in 5 (from 5 → same, which violates E must move)
So that’s bad.

Try “RIOTS”:
Wait, that has A? No, A is not in the word, so this is okay, but it doesn’t use E. We must use E.

Try “RESIN”:
- R in 1 (from 2 → new)
- E in 2 (from 5 → new)
- S in 3 (from 4 → new)
- I in 4 (from 3 → new)
- N in 5 (new)
This uses all known letters in new positions and introduces N.

This seems like a good word.

Alternative: “RISEN”:
- R in 1 (new)

Let's interpret the new feedback carefully.

From RISEN:
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1
- I(✓): I is in position 2 (correct)
- S(-): S is in the word but NOT in position 3
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct)
- N(✓): N is in position 5 (correct)

So we now know:
- Positions: _ I _ E N (positions 2,4,5 are locked)
- Letters still to place: R and S (must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 3, but not their previous disallowed spots)
- R cannot be in position 1 (from RISEN) or position 2 (from ARISE)
- S cannot be in position 3 (from RISEN) or position 4 (from ARISE)

Possible positions:
- Position 1: must be R or S (since we know the word is 5 letters and positions 2,4,5 are taken by I,E,N respectively)
- Position 3: must be the remaining letter between R and S (since R and S must both be in the word)

But:
- If position 1 is R: 
  - Then position 3 must be S
  - Check constraints: R in position 1 is allowed (only restricted from position 2)
  - S in position 3 is NOT allowed (from RISEN feedback)
  
- If position 1 is S:
  - Then position 3 must be R
  - Check constraints: S in position 1 is allowed (only restricted from position 3 and 4)
  - R in position 3 is allowed (only restricted from positions 1 and 2)

Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
S I R E N

Let's verify:
- S: not in position 3 or 4 (from feedback) - it's in position 1: OK
- I: position 2 correct: OK
- R: not in position 1 or 2 (from feedback) - it's in position 3: OK
- E: position 4 correct: OK
- N: position 5 correct: OK

This seems to be the only possible word satisfying all constraints.

- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 1
- I(✓): I is in position 2 (correct)
- S(-): S is in the word but NOT in position 3
- E(✓): E is in position 4 (correct)
- N(✓): N is in position 5 (correct)

So we now know:
- Positions: _ I _ E N (positions 2,4,5 are locked)
- Letters still to place: R and S (must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 3, but not their previous disallowed spots)
- R cannot be in position 1 (from RISEN) or position 2 (from ARISE)
- S cannot be in position 3 (from RISEN) or position 4 (from ARISE)

Possible positions:
- Position 1: must be R or S (since we know the word is 5 letters and positions 2,4,5 are taken by I,E,N respectively)
- Position 3: must be the remaining letter between R and S (since R and S must both be in the word)

But:
- If position 1 is R: 
  - Then position 3 must be S
  - Check constraints: R in position 1 is allowed (only restricted from position 2)
  - S in position 3 is NOT allowed (from RISEN feedback)
  
- If position 1 is S:
  - Then position 3 must be R
  - Check constraints: S in position 1 is allowed (only restricted from position 3 and 4)
  - R in position 3 is allowed (only restricted from positions 1 and 2)

Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
S I R E N

Let's verify:
- S: not in position 3 or 4 (from feedback) - it's in position 1: OK
- I: position 2 correct: OK
- R: not in position 1 or 2 (from feedback) - it's in position 3: OK
- E: position 4 correct: OK
- N: position 5 correct: OK

This seems to be the only possible word satisfying all constraints.",Guess 3: SIREN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) R(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
