For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best strategy is to use a word with common consonants and vowels that can quickly narrow down possibilities. A good ""starter word"" often includes:

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N etc.)
- No repeating letters to maximize coverage

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words. If we get hits on any of these letters, we can use the positional feedback to narrow down our next guesses efficiently.

From the first-guess feedback:

- A(-) : The letter A is in the word but is NOT in position 1.
- R(-) : The letter R is in the word but is NOT in position 2.
- O(x) : The letter O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) : The letter S is NOT in the word at all.

2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.
3. Two letters (positions 3 and 5) are still unknown, and we haven’t tested B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z yet.

Next, we want a five-letter word that:
- Uses A and R (but A cannot be in position 1 and R cannot be in position 2).
- Avoids O, S, E.
- Introduces new common consonants and possibly a new vowel to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- It includes the known letters A (position 3) and R (position 2), satisfying the positional constraints.
- It introduces T, I, N—three new letters that are common in English and will give us more feedback.
- It avoids the forbidden letters O, S, E.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters we have tested so far:
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, N

Letters confirmed to be in the word (but position unknown):
A, R, I

Letters confirmed to be absent:
O, S, E, T, N

So the secret 5-letter word:
- Must contain A, R, I (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively, because each was marked “-” in Guess 2 or Guess 1).
- Must not contain O, S, E, T, N.
- We still don’t know about the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Current positional constraints:
1. First letter: cannot be A (from Guess 1) and cannot be T (now known absent). Still open.
2. Second letter: cannot be R (from Guess 1) and cannot be R (from Guess 2). Still open.
3. Third letter: cannot be A (from Guess 2). Still open.
4. Fourth letter: cannot be I (from Guess 2). Still open.
5. Fifth letter: cannot be N (now known absent). Still open.

We need a word that uses A, R, I, plus two new letters chosen from the untested pool, while respecting the positional bans above.

One straightforward way to proceed is to pick a word in which A, R, I all appear in new positions. A good candidate that satisfies the constraints and introduces two fresh consonants is “CRIAR” (but this is not a standard English word). Another is “CRAIC” (an Irish word, possibly too obscure). Among common English words, “FRAIL” is invalid because L hasn’t been tested yet and I would land in position 4 which is banned. “RADIO” is invalid because O is banned. “VIRAL” is invalid because L is untested and N is banned (but L is okay). We need a common word that places A, R, I in new positions and adds two fresh letters.

A better choice is “VIRAL”:
- Letters: V, I, R, A, L
- Contains the required letters: I, R, A
- Avoids banned letters (O, S, E, T, N)
- Positions:
   – I is now in position 2 (allowed, since previous “I” was in position 4).
   – R is now in position 3 (allowed, since previous “R” was in position 2).
   – A is now in position 4 (allowed, since previous “A” was in position 3).
   – V and L are new letters, giving us information.

So “VIRAL” is a sensible third guess.
