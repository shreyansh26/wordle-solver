- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Has common letters frequently found in English 5-letter words
2. Uses a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
3. Avoids rare letters that might give little info

Good starting words often contain common vowels like A, E, I and frequent consonants like R, S, T, N, L.

Some strong candidates:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three major vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓)
- O is in the correct position (third letter) (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

So the secret word looks like: _ R O _ E

I need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern R O _ E and does not contain A or S.

Good consonants to try next: D, L, N, T, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used, and E is fixed)

Possible candidates:
- BROKE (but B hasn't been tested yet)
- CRORE (but double R seems unlikely)
- DROVE (D and V are new letters)
- FROZE (F and Z are new)
- GROPE (G and P are new)
- PROVE (P and V are new)

I'll choose ""DROVE"" as it uses common letters D and V, and fits the pattern _ R O _ E.
