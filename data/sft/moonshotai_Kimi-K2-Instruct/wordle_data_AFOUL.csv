For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This way, I can quickly identify which letters are in the word and which aren't.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess. The word ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word.

Other good options might be ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it includes O, which is quite common but not in the other two options.

I\'ll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess. The word ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word.\n\nOther good options might be ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"".

So far we know:

Pattern: A _ O U _
- A is fixed in position 1.
- O is fixed in position 3.
- U is fixed in position 4.
- Letters eliminated: R, S, E, B, T, D.
- Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it received “-” in ALOUD).

Therefore:
- Position 2 must be some letter that is NOT any of the eliminated ones and is NOT L.
- Position 5 is still open.

List of remaining letters (not yet ruled out and not already placed):
C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
(remove L because it’s already known to be in the word but elsewhere)

We need 5-letter words that fit A _ O U _ and use one of the above letters in slot 2 and any unused letter in slot 5.

Possible fills:
A C O U ?
A F O U ?
A G O U ?  (no common word)
A H O U ?  (no common word)
A I O U ?  (no common word)
A K O U ?  (no common word)
A M O U ?  (AMOUR?  but R is eliminated)
A N O U ?  (no common word)
A P O U ?  (no common word)
A V O U ?  (no common word)
A W O U ?  (no common word)
A Y O U ?  (no common word)

Actually, “AMOUR” is invalid (R eliminated).  
The only reasonably common word that fits is “ACOUST”, but that’s 6 letters.  
Looking again, “AFOUL” was already considered but doesn’t fit because L would have to be in position 5 (and L must appear somewhere else).  Let’s see:  
AF O U L – pattern A F O U L.  That gives L in position 5; we know L is present, so this could be valid.

But let’s check another possibility: the 2nd letter could be C and the 5th letter could be L, giving A C O U L – the word “ACOUL-” doesn’t exist.  “ACORN” – no, U is required 4th.

The only remaining common word that fits the pattern A _ O U _ and uses available letters is “AFOUL,” except that in AFOUL the L would be in position 5, which is allowed because L just must appear somewhere in the word (feedback was “-” meaning present but not in position 2).

But wait—let’s try a different route: choose a word that puts the known letter L in position 5 and keeps A, O, U in place.  
The missing 2nd letter must be unused.  The letter C gives A C O U L – but “acoul” isn’t a word.  
The letter F gives A F O U L – “afoul” is a valid word.

So the next guess is AFoul.

Double-check:
- A(✓) F(?) O(✓) U(✓) L(?)

F and L have not been eliminated.  It’s valid.
