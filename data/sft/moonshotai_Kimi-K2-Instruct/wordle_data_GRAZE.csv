For the first guess, the best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words with frequently used vowels and consonants are ideal. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening guess because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination covers many high-frequency letters and provides good information about the secret word's structure.

From the feedback on “CRANE”:

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- C and N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R A _ E

Letters still available (since C and N are ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R A _ E and uses none of C, N, or the already-placed letters in other positions. A common word that fits is “GRAPE” but P is in the 4th spot and we don’t yet know about P. Another is “GRAVE” – again, V is possible. Another is “FRAME” – F, M are possible. A more common and high-frequency candidate is “GRATE” which uses T, another high-frequency consonant.

We now know more:

1. The pattern is _ R A _ E.
2. G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because G got a ✓ meaning it is in the word, but position 1 was not marked ✓, so it must be elsewhere).
3. T is not in the word at all.

So positions so far:
- 1st: unknown (but NOT C, N, T, G in this position)
- 2nd: R
- 3rd: A
- 4th: unknown (not T)
- 5th: E

Also, G must appear somewhere else—only possible spot is 4th, since 2,3,5 are taken.

So the word looks like _ R A G E.

Common English 5-letter words that fit: BRAGE is not valid; FRAGE is not valid; DRAGE is not valid. The only common one is BRAGE? No. Actually, ""GRAGE"" is not valid.

Let me list valid 5-letter words fitting “? R A G E”.

Searching, the only common one is “DRAGE” (not valid), “BRAGE” (not valid), “FRAGE” (not valid). 

Wait, let's list possibilities:
- BRAGE (invalid)
- CRAGE (invalid, C is out)
- DRAGE (invalid)
- FRAGE (invalid)
- PRAGE (invalid)
- TRAGE (invalid, T is out)
- GRAGE (invalid)

None of these are valid. This suggests G is NOT in 4th position. This contradicts earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the feedback said G is in the word (✓), but it was in position 1, and that position did NOT get a ✓ (it got a ✓ for being in the word, but not in correct position—no, the feedback was G(✓) meaning G is in word and in correct position? No: in the feedback system provided, a ✓ means the letter is in the word AND in correct position.

Looking back at original rules:
- ✓ : letter is in word and in correct position.
- - : letter is in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for GRATE:
- G(✓) — so G is correct in position 1.
- R(✓) — already known, position 2.
- A(✓) — position 3.
- T(x) — T not in word.
- E(✓) — position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined: G R A _ E.

We just need a valid 5-letter word fitting G R A _ E.

Possible letters for 4th position: any except C, N, T (and already used G,R,A,E). So could be B, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y.

Common words: 
- GRACE (but C is out)

From these, GRADE, GRAPE, GRAVE, GRAZE are all valid. BRADE is not, etc.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words with frequently used vowels and consonants are ideal. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening guess because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination covers many high-frequency letters and provides good information about the secret word's structure.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “CRANE”:

- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- C and N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R A _ E

Letters still available (since C and N are ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R A _ E and uses none of C, N, or the already-placed letters in other positions. A common word that fits is “GRAPE” but P is in the 4th spot and we don’t yet know about P. Another is “GRAVE” – again, V is possible. Another is “FRAME” – F, M are possible. A more common and high-frequency candidate is “GRATE” which uses T, another high-frequency consonant.

So I’ll try “GRATE”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know more:

1. The pattern is _ R A _ E.
2. G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because G got a ✓ meaning it is in the word, but position 1 was not marked ✓, so it must be elsewhere).
3. T is not in the word at all.

So positions so far:
- 1st: unknown (but NOT C, N, T, G in this position)
- 2nd: R
- 3rd: A
- 4th: unknown (not T)
- 5th: E

Also, G must appear somewhere else—only possible spot is 4th, since 2,3,5 are taken.

So the word looks like _ R A G E.

Common English 5-letter words that fit: BRAGE is not valid; FRAGE is not valid; DRAGE is not valid. The only common one is BRAGE? No. Actually, ""GRAGE"" is not valid.

Let me list valid 5-letter words fitting “? R A G E”.

Searching, the only common one is “DRAGE” (not valid), “BRAGE” (not valid), “FRAGE” (not valid). 

Wait, let's list possibilities:
- BRAGE (invalid)
- CRAGE (invalid, C is out)
- DRAGE (invalid)
- FRAGE (invalid)
- PRAGE (invalid)
- TRAGE (invalid, T is out)
- GRAGE (invalid)

None of these are valid. This suggests G is NOT in 4th position. This contradicts earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the feedback said G is in the word (✓), but it was in position 1, and that position did NOT get a ✓ (it got a ✓ for being in the word, but not in correct position—no, the feedback was G(✓) meaning G is in word and in correct position? No: in the feedback system provided, a ✓ means the letter is in the word AND in correct position.

Looking back at original rules:
- ✓ : letter is in word and in correct position.
- - : letter is in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for GRATE:
- G(✓) — so G is correct in position 1.
- R(✓) — already known, position 2.
- A(✓) — position 3.
- T(x) — T not in word.
- E(✓) — position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined: G R A _ E.

We just need a valid 5-letter word fitting G R A _ E.

Possible letters for 4th position: any except C, N, T (and already used G,R,A,E). So could be B, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y.

Common words: 
- GRACE (but C is out)
- GRADE
- GRAPE
- GRAVE
- GRAZE

From these, GRADE, GRAPE, GRAVE, GRAZE are all valid. BRADE is not, etc.

Among these, ""GRADE"" seems most common.Based on the feedback, the word must be G R A _ E with the fourth letter unknown. The most common word fitting this pattern is:

<guess>GRADE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the exact pattern:

So the fourth position must be a letter other than those four, and it must form a valid 5-letter word starting with “GRA” and ending with “E”.

Possible letters for the 4th spot: B, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Common valid words fitting GRA _ E:

- GRAPE  
- GRAVE  
- GRAZE  
- GRAME (rare, probably invalid)  
- GRAFE (invalid)

Among these, “GRAPE,” “GRAVE,” and “GRAZE” are common.

A common word that fits is “GRAPE” but P is in the 4th spot and we don’t yet know about P. Another is “GRAVE” – again, V is possible. Another is “FRAME” – F, M are possible. A more common and high-frequency candidate is “GRATE” which uses T, another high-frequency consonant.

So I’ll try “GRATE”.

<guess>GRATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: GRATE -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know more:

1. The pattern is _ R A _ E.
2. G is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because G got a ✓ meaning it is in the word, but position 1 was not marked ✓, so it must be elsewhere).
3. T is not in the word at all.

So positions so far:
- 1st: unknown (but NOT C, N, T, G in this position)
- 2nd: R
- 3rd: A
- 4th: unknown (not T)
- 5th: E

Also, G must appear somewhere else—only possible spot is 4th, since 2,3,5 are taken.

So the word looks like _ R A G E.

Common English 5-letter words that fit: BRAGE is not valid; FRAGE is not valid; DRAGE is not valid. The only common one is BRAGE? No. Actually, ""GRAGE"" is not valid.

Let me list valid 5-letter words fitting “? R A G E”.

Searching, the only common one is “DRAGE” (not valid), “BRAGE” (not valid), “FRAGE” (not valid). 

Wait, let's list possibilities:
- BRAGE (invalid)
- CRAGE (invalid, C is out)
- DRAGE (invalid)
- FRAGE (invalid)
- PRAGE (invalid)
- TRAGE (invalid, T is out)
- GRAGE (invalid)

None of these are valid. This suggests G is NOT in 4th position. This contradicts earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine:

Wait, the feedback said G is in the word (✓), but it was in position 1, and that position did NOT get a ✓ (it got a ✓ for being in the word, but not in correct position—no, the feedback was G(✓) meaning G is in word and in correct position? No: in the feedback system provided, a ✓ means the letter is in the word AND in correct position.

Looking back at original rules:
- ✓ : letter is in word and in correct position.
- - : letter is in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for GRATE:
- G(✓) — so G is correct in position 1.
- R(✓) — already known, position 2.
- A(✓) — position 3.
- T(x) — T not in word.
- E(✓) — position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined: G R A _ E.

We just need a valid 5-letter word fitting G R A _ E.

Possible letters for 4th position: any except C, N, T (and already used G,R,A,E). So could be B, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y.

Common words: 
- GRACE (but C is out)
- GRADE
- GRAPE
- GRAVE
- GRAZE

From these, GRADE, GRAPE, GRAVE, GRAZE are all valid. BRADE is not, etc.

Among these, ""GRADE"" seems most common.Based on the feedback, the word must be G R A _ E with the fourth letter unknown. The most common word fitting this pattern is:

<guess>GRADE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: GRATE -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GRADE -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the exact pattern:

G R A _ E  

and the fourth letter is NOT: C, N, T, D (from previous guesses).

So the fourth position must be a letter other than those four, and it must form a valid 5-letter word starting with “GRA” and ending with “E”.

Possible letters for the 4th spot: B, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Common valid words fitting GRA _ E:

- GRAPE  
- GRAVE  
- GRAZE  
- GRAME (rare, probably invalid)  
- GRAFE (invalid)  
- GRAIE (invalid)  

Among these, “GRAPE,” “GRAVE,” and “GRAZE” are common.  
“GRAPE” seems most likely first.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current certainty: the word is exactly G R A _ E and we have eliminated C, N, T, D, P from the fourth position.  
Remaining letters that may sit in the fourth spot (must make a valid English word): B, F, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, Y, Z.

Scanning common vocab:

- GRAVE – V remains possible.  
- GRAZE – Z remains possible.  
- GRAPE already tried (P fails).  
- GRAME, GRAFE, GRAIE, etc. are not dictionary words.

Between the only still-valid common candidates, GRAVE and GRAZE, GRAVE is the more frequent word.

Therefore the next logical guess is GRAVE.
