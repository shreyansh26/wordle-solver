For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants that might appear in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like S, T, R, N, L). 

One of the most common first guesses in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"", but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it balances vowels and consonants well.

- We haven’t tested vowels I, U yet; consonants like B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y are still possible.

Let’s construct a fresh guess:
– Must include E and T
– E can go in 1, 2, or 4
– T can go in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
– Avoid any of C, R, A, N, S, O, L

Conclusion: one of the following two patterns must be true
1) E _ _ _ T
2) _ E _ _ T   (because if T were in 1, E would have to be in 2, giving T E _ _ _, but then T would be in correct position 1; past feedback never showed a ✓ for T, so T is still only “-”. The simplest compatible pattern is _ E _ _ T.)

Let’s pick a word fitting _ E _ _ T that introduces new consonants we haven’t tried yet: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, Y, etc.

Try: G E M I T  → invalid (not a common word)  
Try: V E D I T  → invalid  
Try: B E D I T  → invalid  
Try: M E D I T → invalid  
Try: D E P T I → invalid  

Popular English word fitting the pattern _ E _ _ T that uses new letters: “DEBIT”  
- D, B new consonants  
- I already known to be present and only needs to fit somewhere in positions 3 or 4  
- E in position 2 (allowed)  
- T in position 5 (allowed)

So my next guess is DEBIT.

<guess>DEBIT</guess>",DEBIT,"Current eliminations:
Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, H  
Letters confirmed in the word: E, T, I  
Positions still unknown: every position may still be possible, but  
- E cannot be in 3, 4, or 5 (it was in 5, 3, 4 and always marked “-”)  
- T cannot be in 2 or 3 or 4 (it was in 2, 3, 4 and always marked “-”)  
Therefore:
- E must be in position 1 or 2  
- T must be in position 1 or 5 (but both can’t be in 1)

1) E _ _ _ T
