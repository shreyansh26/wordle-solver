For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. This means selecting a word that uses common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequent consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with five unique letters, including multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavily vowel-based)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage of both consonants and vowels. The letters C, R, and N are particularly common, and A and E are the two most common vowels after E.

3. A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 3.

1. CRANE → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4, but C, R, E are absent.
2. SLANT → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4 again confirm these letters and positions are locked, and add S, L, T to the ""not in word"" list.

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _  
and we also now know the letters NOT to use: C, R, E, S, L, T.

We need five letters that fit: X Y A N Z  
with X, Y, Z taken from remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Focus on consonants/vowels that are still possible. Let’s look for three-letter endings that produce real words.

Candidate endings for _ _ A N _ :
- B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Examples:
- B A N D → D is allowed, but we need _ _ A N D (B at position 1 or 2).
- G I A N T → T is already excluded.
- M A N G O → too long.
- P A I N T → T excluded.
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- H A N D Y → Y allowed, but H, D, Y are still allowed.

So let’s try: B A N D Y → but this has A at position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit _ _ A N _.

Let’s list possible words with _ _ A N _ using allowed letters:

Try brainstorming:
- B A N D → 4-letter, no.
- D A N K → 4-letter, no.
- G A N G → 4-letter, no.
- H A N D → 4-letter, no.
- F A N G → 4-letter, no.
- V A N E → E excluded.
- M A N A → 4-letter, no.
- O A N → 3-letter, no.
- P A N G → 4-letter, no.
- W A N D → 4-letter, no.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words of form _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

Using a dictionary filter:
- B A N D → 4 letters.
- B A N K → 4 letters.
- F A N G → 4 letters.
- H A N D → 4 letters.
- D A N K → 4 letters.
- G A N G → 4 letters.
- P A N G → 4 letters.
- V A N E → E excluded.
- M A N G → 4 letters.
- W A N D → 4 letters.

Hmm, none of these are 5-letter words of _ _ A N _.

Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a consonant pair before A N.

Possible 5-letter words with A N in positions 3-4:
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- C L A N K → C, L excluded.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so _ I A N A.
   - I is allowed, A is allowed, N is allowed, but we already have A and N fixed at 3,4. So _ I A N A would be I A N A in positions 2-5, which is 4 letters – doesn’t fit.
- F A N G O → but N is position 3 here, not 4.
- G I A N T → T excluded.
- H A N D Y → H, A, N, D, Y – but A is position 2, not 3.
- J A N G O → J, A, N, G, O – A is position 2, not 3.
- M A N I A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N I C → C excluded.
- W A N N A → A at position 2, not 3.
- G A N G A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N D A → A at position 2, not 3.

Realizing that _ _ A N _ is a very constrained pattern. Let me think of actual valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

Possible candidates:
- B H A N J → not a word.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so D I A N A is _ I A N A – but 5-letter is D I A N A, which is D I A N A – positions 1-5: D(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) A(5). This fits _ _ A N _ (positions 3-4 are A N), and letters are D, I, A, N, A. None are excluded.

D I A N A is a valid word (name Diana) – but is it in common dictionaries? Yes, Diana is a valid word.
- D allowed
- I allowed
- A allowed (position 3)
- N allowed (position 4)
- A allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T in it.

Another candidate:
- P I A N O → P, I, A, N, O – A at position 3, N at 4. No excluded letters.
- M A N I A → but A is at position 2.
- F I A N C → C excluded.
- V I A N D → D allowed, but V, I, A, N, D – fits _ I A N D, but _ _ A N _ is positions 3-4 A N, so V I A N D is V(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) D(5) – fits perfectly. Letters: V, I, A, N, D – none are excluded.

Between ""D I A N A"" and ""V I A N D"", ""VIAND"" is more commonly known as a word (meaning a food item).

Therefore, ""VIAND"" is a strong candidate.

Check letters:
V – allowed
I – allowed
A – correct position 3
N – correct position 4
D – allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T.

This seems correct.

1. CRANE → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4, but C, R, E are absent.
2. SLANT → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4 again confirm these letters and positions are locked, and add S, L, T to the ""not in word"" list.

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _  
and we also now know the letters NOT to use: C, R, E, S, L, T.

We need five letters that fit: X Y A N Z  
with X, Y, Z taken from remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Focus on consonants/vowels that are still possible. Let’s look for three-letter endings that produce real words.

- M A N G O → too long.
- P A I N T → T excluded.
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- H A N D Y → Y allowed, but H, D, Y are still allowed.

So let’s try: B A N D Y → but this has A at position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit _ _ A N _.

Let’s list possible words with _ _ A N _ using allowed letters:

Try brainstorming:
- B A N D → 4-letter, no.

- G A N G → 4-letter, no.
- H A N D → 4-letter, no.
- F A N G → 4-letter, no.

- M A N A → 4-letter, no.
- O A N → 3-letter, no.
- P A N G → 4-letter, no.
- W A N D → 4-letter, no.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words of form _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

- B A N D → 4 letters.
- B A N K → 4 letters.

- H A N D → 4 letters.
- D A N K → 4 letters.
- G A N G → 4 letters.
- P A N G → 4 letters.
- V A N E → E excluded.
- M A N G → 4 letters.
- W A N D → 4 letters.

Hmm, none of these are 5-letter words of _ _ A N _.

Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a consonant pair before A N.

Possible 5-letter words with A N in positions 3-4:
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- C L A N K → C, L excluded.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so _ I A N A.
   - I is allowed, A is allowed, N is allowed, but we already have A and N fixed at 3,4. So _ I A N A would be I A N A in positions 2-5, which is 4 letters – doesn’t fit.
- F A N G O → but N is position 3 here, not 4.
- G I A N T → T excluded.
- H A N D Y → H, A, N, D, Y – but A is position 2, not 3.
- J A N G O → J, A, N, G, O – A is position 2, not 3.
- M A N I A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N I C → C excluded.
- W A N N A → A at position 2, not 3.
- G A N G A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N D A → A at position 2, not 3.

Realizing that _ _ A N _ is a very constrained pattern. Let me think of actual valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

Possible candidates:
- B H A N J → not a word.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so D I A N A is _ I A N A – but 5-letter is D I A N A, which is D I A N A – positions 1-5: D(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) A(5). This fits _ _ A N _ (positions 3-4 are A N), and letters are D, I, A, N, A. None are excluded.

D I A N A is a valid word (name Diana) – but is it in common dictionaries? Yes, Diana is a valid word.
- D allowed
- I allowed
- A allowed (position 3)
- N allowed (position 4)
- A allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T in it.

Another candidate:
- P I A N O → P, I, A, N, O – A at position 3, N at 4. No excluded letters.
- M A N I A → but A is at position 2.
- F I A N C → C excluded.
- V I A N D → D allowed, but V, I, A, N, D – fits _ I A N D, but _ _ A N _ is positions 3-4 A N, so V I A N D is V(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) D(5) – fits perfectly. Letters: V, I, A, N, D – none are excluded.

Between ""D I A N A"" and ""V I A N D"", ""VIAND"" is more commonly known as a word (meaning a food item).

Therefore, ""VIAND"" is a strong candidate.

Check letters:
V – allowed
I – allowed
A – correct position 3
N – correct position 4
D – allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. This means selecting a word that uses common letters in the English language, particularly vowels and frequent consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with five unique letters, including multiple vowels and common consonants.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavily vowel-based)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage of both consonants and vowels. The letters C, R, and N are particularly common, and A and E are the two most common vowels after E.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. C is not in the word (x).
2. R is not in the word (x).
3. A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 3.
4. N is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 4.
5. E is not in the word (x).

So our word looks like: _ _ A N _ with no C, R, or E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position.
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Does not contain C, R, or E.

Let’s think of possible patterns: _ _ A N _

Possible letters for remaining positions (avoiding C, R, E): common consonants and vowels left: S, T, D, L, M, P, B, U, O, I, etc.

Some candidate words:
- STAND (but has E? No, no E, but has T, S, A, N, D) – but position 4 is N, which fits.
- PLANT (no E, C, R) – but position 4 is N, fits.
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T) – no E, C, R – fits the pattern.
- SPANK (S, P, A, N, K) – no E, C, R – fits.
- STANK (S, T, A, N, K) – fits.

""SLANT"" seems like a good choice because it introduces new common letters (S, L, T) without any of the eliminated letters.

<guess>SLANT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two feedback sets:

1. CRANE → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4, but C, R, E are absent.
2. SLANT → A(✓) at position 3 and N(✓) at position 4 again confirm these letters and positions are locked, and add S, L, T to the ""not in word"" list.

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _  
and we also now know the letters NOT to use: C, R, E, S, L, T.

We need five letters that fit: X Y A N Z  
with X, Y, Z taken from remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Focus on consonants/vowels that are still possible. Let’s look for three-letter endings that produce real words.

Candidate endings for _ _ A N _ :
- B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Examples:
- B A N D → D is allowed, but we need _ _ A N D (B at position 1 or 2).
- G I A N T → T is already excluded.
- M A N G O → too long.
- P A I N T → T excluded.
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- H A N D Y → Y allowed, but H, D, Y are still allowed.

So let’s try: B A N D Y → but this has A at position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit _ _ A N _.

Let’s list possible words with _ _ A N _ using allowed letters:

Try brainstorming:
- B A N D → 4-letter, no.
- D A N K → 4-letter, no.
- G A N G → 4-letter, no.
- H A N D → 4-letter, no.
- F A N G → 4-letter, no.
- V A N E → E excluded.
- M A N A → 4-letter, no.
- O A N → 3-letter, no.
- P A N G → 4-letter, no.
- W A N D → 4-letter, no.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words of form _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

Using a dictionary filter:
- B A N D → 4 letters.
- B A N K → 4 letters.
- F A N G → 4 letters.
- H A N D → 4 letters.
- D A N K → 4 letters.
- G A N G → 4 letters.
- P A N G → 4 letters.
- V A N E → E excluded.
- M A N G → 4 letters.
- W A N D → 4 letters.

Hmm, none of these are 5-letter words of _ _ A N _.

Let me think differently: perhaps the word starts with a consonant pair before A N.

Possible 5-letter words with A N in positions 3-4:
- B R A N D → R excluded.
- C L A N K → C, L excluded.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so _ I A N A.
   - I is allowed, A is allowed, N is allowed, but we already have A and N fixed at 3,4. So _ I A N A would be I A N A in positions 2-5, which is 4 letters – doesn’t fit.
- F A N G O → but N is position 3 here, not 4.
- G I A N T → T excluded.
- H A N D Y → H, A, N, D, Y – but A is position 2, not 3.
- J A N G O → J, A, N, G, O – A is position 2, not 3.
- M A N I A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N I C → C excluded.
- W A N N A → A at position 2, not 3.
- G A N G A → A at position 2, not 3.
- P A N D A → A at position 2, not 3.

Realizing that _ _ A N _ is a very constrained pattern. Let me think of actual valid 5-letter words fitting _ _ A N _ without C, R, E, S, L, T.

Possible candidates:
- B H A N J → not a word.
- D I A N A → but N is position 4, so D I A N A is _ I A N A – but 5-letter is D I A N A, which is D I A N A – positions 1-5: D(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) A(5). This fits _ _ A N _ (positions 3-4 are A N), and letters are D, I, A, N, A. None are excluded.

D I A N A is a valid word (name Diana) – but is it in common dictionaries? Yes, Diana is a valid word.
- D allowed
- I allowed
- A allowed (position 3)
- N allowed (position 4)
- A allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T in it.

Another candidate:
- P I A N O → P, I, A, N, O – A at position 3, N at 4. No excluded letters.
- M A N I A → but A is at position 2.
- F I A N C → C excluded.
- V I A N D → D allowed, but V, I, A, N, D – fits _ I A N D, but _ _ A N _ is positions 3-4 A N, so V I A N D is V(1) I(2) A(3) N(4) D(5) – fits perfectly. Letters: V, I, A, N, D – none are excluded.

Between ""D I A N A"" and ""V I A N D"", ""VIAND"" is more commonly known as a word (meaning a food item).

Therefore, ""VIAND"" is a strong candidate.

Check letters:
V – allowed
I – allowed
A – correct position 3
N – correct position 4
D – allowed
No C, R, E, S, L, T.
