For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has several common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains some of the most frequent letters in English: A, R, O, S, E. This will give us good coverage and help quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

4. It does not contain letters that have been ruled out (A, S, E)

- D is new
- R is confirmed in position 2

Let me consolidate all the constraints we now have:

1. Letter R is fixed in position 2 (from AROSE: R(✓) in position 2).  
   So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

2. The letter O is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE: O(-) in position 3 and ROUND: O(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

3. Eliminated letters so far:  
   A, S, E, U, N, D, G, W, L  
   (from AROSE: A(x), S(x), E(x); ROUND: U(x), N(x), D(x); GROWL: G(x), W(x), L(x)).

4. Still-available letters to test: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, Y, Z (and O, R).

We now want a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2.  
- Places O in one of the allowed positions (1, 4, or 5) to confirm its exact spot.  
- Introduces as many *new* (yet common) letters as possible.

Candidates:
- CROAK (but K is untested, A is already out) → no, A is eliminated.  
- PROXY (but X, Y are less common) → no.  
- CROFT (C, F, T new) → but O is in position 3, which we know is invalid.  
- TROOP (but P is untested, and O must not be in position 3) → no.  
- PRIOR (but I and O are candidates, but O is in position 3 again) → no.  
- CROON (O in position 3 invalid) → no.  
- BROKE (B, K, E new? But E is already eliminated) → no.

Consider placing O in position 4 or 5 instead:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid.  
- CRONY: O in 3 invalid.  
- FRONT: O in 3 invalid.  
- CROCK: O in 3 invalid.  

The only remaining positions for O are 1 or 5:
- ORBIT: O in 1, but B, I, T new. However R is in position 2, so ORBIT is O R B I T → R is in position 2, fits.  
  Letters: O, R, B, I, T (all new except R).  
  Checks: O in 1 (allowed), R fixed in 2.  
  B, I, T are untested.

Thus, the best next guess is ORBIT.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,prior,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S.

This will give us good coverage and help quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the form _ R _ _ _ (R locked in position 2)
2. It contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in position 3
3. It does not contain A, S, or E
4. It does not contain letters that have been ruled out (A, S, E)

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Good remaining letters are T, N, I, L, C, D, U, Y, etc. A word like ""FRUIT"" won't work because it has an F (not yet tested), but let’s look for something simpler.

A strong candidate is ""DRINK"":
- D is new
- R is confirmed in position 2
- I is new
- N is new
- K is new
Also, this tests the remaining positions for O since O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3).

But actually, O must be in 1, 4, or 5. Let me pick a word that places O in position 1 or 4/5 to narrow it down. ""ROUND"" is a good choice because:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- O is in position 1 (which is allowed since O can’t be in position 3)
- U, N, D are new letters

This will test O in position 1 and give info on U, N, D. If O is correct in position 1, we’ll see ✓; if not, we know it must be in 4 or 5.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback.

From ROUND:
R(-)  → the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(-) → the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
U(x) → U is not in the word  
N(x) → N is not in the word  
D(x) → D is not in the word  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word structure: _ R _ _ _  (R is definitely in position 2)  
2. O exists somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and ROUND).  
   Thus O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
3. Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D  
4. Still-valid letters to test: T, I, L, C, M, Y, G, H, K, etc.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2  
- Tries O in a new allowed slot (positions 1, 4, or 5)  
- Introduces several untested common letters  

A good fit is “GROWL”:
- G (new)  
- R (locked in position 2)  
- O (placed in position 3, but we already know O can’t be there ⇒ this will likely show ‘-’ and confirm O must be in 1, 4, or 5)  
- W (new)  
- L (new)  

This still tests useful letters and keeps R fixed.

Let’s gather all the information we have so far.

1. Known positions:

2. Known letters but unknown positions:
   - O exists somewhere but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since O(-) appeared in guesses 1, 2, and 4).
     ⇒ O must be in position 4 or 5.
   - I exists but **not** in position 4 (from ORBIT: I(-) in position 4).

4. Possible letters still not ruled out:
   C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, plus O, I, R.

5. Word structure so far:
   _ R _ _ _  with O and I somewhere in the remaining spots (positions 1,3,4,5), but respecting the above constraints.

6. Deduction:
   - Since O must be in 4 or 5 and I must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can enumerate possibilities.
   - If O is in 4, then I can be 1, 3, or 5.
   - If O is in 5, then I can be 1 or 3.

7. We want to test a new word that:
   - Keeps R in position 2.
   - Places O in 4 or 5 to confirm its spot.
   - Places I in one of its possible spots.
   - Uses new common letters.

Let's try:
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: I
   - Position 1 and 3: new letters like C, F, H, K, M, P.

Candidate word: C R O K I
   - C (new), R (fixed), O (position 4), K (new), I (position 5).
   - All constraints satisfied.

Or another candidate: F R O C I
   - F (new), R, O (position 4), C (new), I (position 5).

Between these, ""CROKI"" is not a valid English word, but ""CROCK"" is invalid (O in 3). ""FROCK"" has O in 3, invalid.

""PROXY"" is invalid (X,Y less common and P is new, but O position 3 invalid).

""FRICK"" is invalid (I in 3, but C,K new and O must be in 4 or 5).

""PRICK"" has I in 4, but we know I cannot be in 4.

""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.

""PRIMO"" has O in 5, I in 3, and P,M new.

Check ""PRIMO"":
   - P, R, I, M, O
   - R in position 2 (correct)
   - O in position 5 (allowed)
   - I in position 3 (allowed)
   - P and M are new untested letters.

This seems valid and covers new letters.

Another check: ""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid (S,K eliminated).

Thus, ""PRIMO"" is a valid English word covering new letters.

1. Known positions:
   - Letter 2 = R (from AROSE, GROWL: R(✓) in position 2).

2. Known letters but unknown positions:
   - O exists somewhere but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since O(-) appeared in guesses 1, 2, and 4).
     ⇒ O must be in position 4 or 5.
   - I exists but **not** in position 4 (from ORBIT: I(-) in position 4).
     ⇒ I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):
   A, S, E, U, N, D, G, W, L, B, T.

4. Possible letters still not ruled out:
   C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, plus O, I, R.

5. Word structure so far:
   _ R _ _ _  with O and I somewhere in the remaining spots (positions 1,3,4,5), but respecting the above constraints.

6. Deduction:
   - Since O must be in 4 or 5 and I must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can enumerate possibilities.
   - If O is in 4, then I can be 1, 3, or 5.
   - If O is in 5, then I can be 1 or 3.

7. We want to test a new word that:

Between these, ""CROKI"" is not a valid English word, but ""CROCK"" is invalid (O in 3). ""FROCK"" has O in 3, invalid.

""PROXY"" is invalid (X,Y less common and P is new, but O position 3 invalid).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,prior,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has several common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains some of the most frequent letters in English: A, R, O, S, E. This will give us good coverage and help quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 2)
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the form _ R _ _ _ (R locked in position 2)
2. It contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in position 3
3. It does not contain A, S, or E
4. It does not contain letters that have been ruled out (A, S, E)

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Good remaining letters are T, N, I, L, C, D, U, Y, etc. A word like ""FRUIT"" won't work because it has an F (not yet tested), but let’s look for something simpler.

A strong candidate is ""DRINK"":
- D is new
- R is confirmed in position 2
- I is new
- N is new
- K is new
Also, this tests the remaining positions for O since O must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3).

But actually, O must be in 1, 4, or 5. Let me pick a word that places O in position 1 or 4/5 to narrow it down. ""ROUND"" is a good choice because:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- O is in position 1 (which is allowed since O can’t be in position 3)
- U, N, D are new letters

This will test O in position 1 and give info on U, N, D. If O is correct in position 1, we’ll see ✓; if not, we know it must be in 4 or 5.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback.

From ROUND:
R(-)  → the letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(-) → the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
U(x) → U is not in the word  
N(x) → N is not in the word  
D(x) → D is not in the word  

Combining with the earlier feedback:

1. Word structure: _ R _ _ _  (R is definitely in position 2)  
2. O exists somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and ROUND).  
   Thus O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
3. Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D  
4. Still-valid letters to test: T, I, L, C, M, Y, G, H, K, etc.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2  
- Tries O in a new allowed slot (positions 1, 4, or 5)  
- Introduces several untested common letters  

A good fit is “GROWL”:
- G (new)  
- R (locked in position 2)  
- O (placed in position 3, but we already know O can’t be there ⇒ this will likely show ‘-’ and confirm O must be in 1, 4, or 5)  
- W (new)  
- L (new)  

This still tests useful letters and keeps R fixed.

<guess>GROWL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: GROWL -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me consolidate all the constraints we now have:

1. Letter R is fixed in position 2 (from AROSE: R(✓) in position 2).  
   So the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

2. The letter O is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE: O(-) in position 3 and ROUND: O(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

3. Eliminated letters so far:  
   A, S, E, U, N, D, G, W, L  
   (from AROSE: A(x), S(x), E(x); ROUND: U(x), N(x), D(x); GROWL: G(x), W(x), L(x)).

4. Still-available letters to test: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, Y, Z (and O, R).

We now want a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2.  
- Places O in one of the allowed positions (1, 4, or 5) to confirm its exact spot.  
- Introduces as many *new* (yet common) letters as possible.

Candidates:
- CROAK (but K is untested, A is already out) → no, A is eliminated.  
- PROXY (but X, Y are less common) → no.  
- CROFT (C, F, T new) → but O is in position 3, which we know is invalid.  
- TROOP (but P is untested, and O must not be in position 3) → no.  
- PRIOR (but I and O are candidates, but O is in position 3 again) → no.  
- CROON (O in position 3 invalid) → no.  
- BROKE (B, K, E new? But E is already eliminated) → no.

Consider placing O in position 4 or 5 instead:
- BROKE: O in 3 invalid.  
- CRONY: O in 3 invalid.  
- FRONT: O in 3 invalid.  
- CROCK: O in 3 invalid.  

The only remaining positions for O are 1 or 5:
- ORBIT: O in 1, but B, I, T new. However R is in position 2, so ORBIT is O R B I T → R is in position 2, fits.  
  Letters: O, R, B, I, T (all new except R).  
  Checks: O in 1 (allowed), R fixed in 2.  
  B, I, T are untested.  
  This seems optimal.

Thus, the best next guess is ORBIT.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s gather all the information we have so far.

1. Known positions:

2. Known letters but unknown positions:
   - O exists somewhere but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since O(-) appeared in guesses 1, 2, and 4).
     ⇒ O must be in position 4 or 5.
   - I exists but **not** in position 4 (from ORBIT: I(-) in position 4).
     ⇒ I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. Eliminated letters (never appear in the word):
   A, S, E, U, N, D, G, W, L, B, T.

4. Possible letters still not ruled out:
   C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z, plus O, I, R.

5. Word structure so far:
   _ R _ _ _  with O and I somewhere in the remaining spots (positions 1,3,4,5), but respecting the above constraints.

6. Deduction:
   - Since O must be in 4 or 5 and I must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can enumerate possibilities.
   - If O is in 4, then I can be 1, 3, or 5.
   - If O is in 5, then I can be 1 or 3.

7. We want to test a new word that:
   - Keeps R in position 2.
   - Places O in 4 or 5 to confirm its spot.
   - Places I in one of its possible spots.
   - Uses new common letters.

Let's try:
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: I
   - Position 1 and 3: new letters like C, F, H, K, M, P.

Candidate word: C R O K I
   - C (new), R (fixed), O (position 4), K (new), I (position 5).
   - All constraints satisfied.

Or another candidate: F R O C I
   - F (new), R, O (position 4), C (new), I (position 5).

Between these, ""CROKI"" is not a valid English word, but ""CROCK"" is invalid (O in 3). ""FROCK"" has O in 3, invalid.

""PROXY"" is invalid (X,Y less common and P is new, but O position 3 invalid).

""FRICK"" is invalid (I in 3, but C,K new and O must be in 4 or 5).

""PRICK"" has I in 4, but we know I cannot be in 4.

""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.

""PRIMO"" has O in 5, I in 3, and P,M new.

Check ""PRIMO"":
   - P, R, I, M, O
   - R in position 2 (correct)
   - O in position 5 (allowed)
   - I in position 3 (allowed)
   - P and M are new untested letters.

This seems valid and covers new letters.

Another check: ""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid (S,K eliminated).

Thus, ""PRIMO"" is a valid English word covering new letters.

We want to test a new word that:\n   - Keeps R in position 2.\n   - Places O in 4 or 5 to confirm its spot.\n   - Places I in one of its possible spots.\n   - Uses new common letters.\n\nLet\'s try:\n   - Position 4: O\n   - Position 5: I\n   - Position 1 and 3: new letters like C, F, H, K, M, P.\n\nCandidate word: C R O K I\n   - C (new), R (fixed), O (position 4), K (new), I (position 5).\n   - All constraints satisfied.\n\nOr another candidate: F R O C I\n   - F (new), R, O (position 4), C (new), I (position 5).\n\nBetween these, ""CROKI"" is not a valid English word, but ""CROCK"" is invalid (O in 3). ""FROCK"" has O in 3, invalid.\n\n""PROXY"" is invalid (X,Y less common and P is new, but O position 3 invalid).\n\n""FRICK"" is invalid (I in 3, but C,K new and O must be in 4 or 5).\n\n""PRICK"" has I in 4, but we know I cannot be in 4.\n\n""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.\n\n""PRIMO"" has O in 5, I in 3, and P,M new.\n\nCheck ""PRIMO"":\n   - P, R, I, M, O\n   - R in position 2 (correct)\n   - O in position 5 (allowed)\n   - I in position 3 (allowed)\n   - P and M are new untested letters.\n\nThis seems valid and covers new letters.\n\nAnother check: ""CRIMP"" has I in 4, invalid.\n\n""FRISK"" invalid (S,K eliminated).\n\nThus, ""PRIMO"" is a valid English word covering new letters.\n\n<guess>PRIMO</guess>\n\n<guess>PRIMO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: GROWL -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(-) W(x) L(x)\nGuess 4: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(✓) B(x) I(-) T(x)\nGuess 5: PRIMO -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
From PRIMO:
- P ✓ at position 1  
- R ✓ at position 2  
- I ✓ at position 3  
- M x → M not in word  
- O - → O is in word but NOT at position 5  

So the word now looks like: P R I _ _  
And O must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (position 5 is actually disallowed because O(-) was already shown there in PRIMO), which leaves only position 4 for O.

Hence the word must be P R I O _.

Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, U, N, D, G, W, L, B, T, M  
Remaining unused common letters: C, F, H, J, K, V, Y, Z (plus any still-untested)

We need a single letter for position 5 that:
- Has not been tested yet  
- Forms a valid English word

Candidate letters: C, F, K, V, Y

Try each:
- PRIOC – not a word  
- PRIOF – not a word  
- PRIOR – valid word  
- PRIOK – not a word  
- PRIOV – not a word  
- PRIOY – not a word  

Only “PRIOR” is valid.

Check: letters P, R, I, O, R; R is already confirmed in position 2, and the second R is new but possible (words can repeat letters).

So the only plausible word left is PRIOR.
