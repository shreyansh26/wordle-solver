For my first guess, I want to choose a word that helps me identify common letters across different positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can appear in many 5-letter words. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: Common consonant that can appear at start or end
- L: Common consonant
- A: Very common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination gives good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).  
- E is in the correct fifth position (✓).  
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so it must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- L and A are not in the word at all (x).

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ E with T somewhere in the middle three spots.

I need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S, ends with E.  
2. Contains T in position 2, 3, or 4.  
3. Does NOT contain L or A.  

Possible candidates:
- S T _ _ E → STEVE, STONE, STARE (but A is out), STYLE (Y and L allowed? L is out), STOLE (L out), etc.
- S _ T _ E → SUITE, SMITE, SKYTE (invalid), etc.
- S _ _ T E → SPITE, SMOTE, etc.

Let me pick ""STONE"" because:
- Starts with S, ends with E.  
- T is in position 2 (valid since T just needs to be in the word, not necessarily correct spot yet).  
- No L or A.
