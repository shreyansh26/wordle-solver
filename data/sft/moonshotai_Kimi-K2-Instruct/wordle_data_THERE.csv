For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and gives maximum information. Good starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
- No repeating letters

Some of the best starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's often cited as one of the best starting words due to its combination of common consonants and vowels. It contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

Key deductions:
1. The last letter is definitely E (position 5 is ✓).
2. T is somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not position 4 where it was in SLATE).
3. S, L, A are completely out.
4. We still need to test other common letters like R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5
- Include T in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 - but 5 is taken by E)
- Avoid S, L, A
- Test new common letters

Possible candidates: ""TIGER"" (but T would be in position 1 - ok), ""TRIES"", ""THEME"", ""THREE"", ""WATER""

I'll choose ""WATER"" because:
- It keeps E in position 5
- Moves T to position 3
- Tests W, A (but A is already ruled out - oops, bad choice)
Let me rethink...

Better choice: ""THEME"" - tests T in position 1, H, M which are common.
Or ""TRIPE"" - tests T in position 1, R, I, P.

I'll go with ""THEME"" as it tests common letters H, M, T in new positions while keeping the known E in place.

- T(✓) – T is in the correct position (position 1)
