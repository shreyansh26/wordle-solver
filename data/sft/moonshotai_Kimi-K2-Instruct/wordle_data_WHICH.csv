I need to make my first 5-letter word guess. Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities.

Looking at the most common letters in 5-letter English words, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy for the first guess is to use words with several vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E - 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- RAISE (same letters as ARISE)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as my first guess because it contains three of the most common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

- I(✓) – I is in the word AND in position 3  
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
- Position 3 must be I  
- The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all  
- The remaining letters must be chosen from the other 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, R, S, E

Popular consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, etc.  
Popular vowels still available: O, U, Y (since A, I, E ruled out and position 3 already I)

A strong second guess should hit fresh, high-frequency letters while keeping the I locked in position 3.

Now we have:

- Position 3 is locked to I (✓).
- Position 2 is now known to be H (✓).
- Letter C is in the word but is NOT in position 1 (-).
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, O, N, T, L, D.

So far:  
Pattern: _ H I _ _  
Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, O, N, T, L, D  
Still allowed letters include B, C, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Has H in position 2 and I in position 3.
2. Contains C somewhere after position 1 (since C is “-” in position 1).
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Likely candidates:
- CHICK – but C is in position 1 (forbidden) and K is allowed.
- WHIFF – but we need C somewhere.
- B CHICK – no.

Consider:  
- C must appear in position 4 or 5.  
- We need two more consonants/vowels from the remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try “WHICH” – but C is in position 4, which is allowed, and it has H and I in correct positions:
- W (allowed), H (✓), I (✓), C (- means in word, but not in position 1 – here C is in 4, so okay), H (repeats H, which is allowed and already confirmed).

But feedback for CHILD already confirmed H in position 2, so WHICH would force position 5 to be H – but we have no info that H repeats.

Instead, a better choice is “CHICK” – but C is in position 1, which is forbidden.

Next candidate: “QUICK” – Q is rare, U is allowed, I is correct, C is in position 4 (allowed), K is allowed.  
But Q was never tested, and we should avoid rare letters.

A safer choice: “FICUS” – but S is ruled out.

Now, let’s list valid words matching _ H I _ _ with C somewhere, and no ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns:  
- _ H I C _  
- _ H I _ C  

Looking at common words:
- “CHILI” – has L, which is ruled out.
- “CHIME” – has M and E, but E is ruled out.
- “CHIVY” – V and Y are allowed, C is in position 4 (allowed), but this is obscure.
- “CHIDE” – D and E ruled out.
- “CHINA” – N and A ruled out.
- “CHINK” – N ruled out, K allowed.

“WHICH” seems odd because H would repeat.

Wait, let’s check “CHICK” again – C is in position 1, which is forbidden by feedback (C in CHILD was “-”, meaning it can’t be in position 1).

So valid words must have C in position 4 or 5.

Let me consider “FICUS” – no, S is out.

Another candidate: “B H I C _” – no common word.

Let me think of “C” in position 4: _ H I C _.  
Need a first letter and a fifth letter from allowed letters.

Allowed: B, C, F, G, K, M, U, V, W, Y (excluding ruled-out).

Common word: “WHICH” – but W, H, I, C, H – H repeats, which is possible.  
But feedback for CHILD showed D was x, and so far we have no restriction on repeats.

But WHICH would give us:
- W: new test
- H: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- C: test in position 4
- H: repeat of position 2

This is acceptable because we have no info about repeats.

But is there a better word without repeats?

Consider “QUICK” – Q is rare, but U is allowed, I is correct, C in 4, K in 5.

But Q is risky.

Another check: “MUSIC” – but C is in position 5, and positions are _ H I _ _ – mismatch.

Ah, I see – the pattern is _ H I _ _.  
So we need words like:  
- B H I C K → BHICK – not a word.  
- M H I C K – no.  

Looking at actual dictionary, the only common word matching _ H I C _ is “WHICH”.

Similarly, _ H I _ C gives no common words (e.g., “CHIDE” ruled out).

Thus, WHICH is the most plausible next guess.
