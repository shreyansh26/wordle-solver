For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has commonly used letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A classic good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Another good option is ""CRANE"" for similar reasons. Both are solid choices, but I'll go with SLATE as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution.

So far we know:

1. Letters already confirmed: R is in position 1, E is in position 2.
2. A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (from READY feedback: A(-)).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T (from SLATE), D, Y (from READY).
4. Therefore, the current pattern is: R E _ _ _ and the word must include A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but not in position 3 or 4 (from READY). So A must be in position 5.

Hence, the word looks like: R E _ _ A.

We still need two more distinct consonants that have not been eliminated (i.e., not S, L, T, D, Y). Common remaining consonants that fit well include C, H, N, M, B, F, G, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits R E _ _ A and uses remaining common letters. A good candidate is ""REBNA"" but B is not very common in this position and ""N"" is okay. However, ""REBNA"" is not a valid English word. A valid word is ""REGNA"" but that's not a valid word either. Instead, ""REATA"" is valid but uses ""T"" which is excluded. 

The valid word ""REATA"" is ruled out. Another valid word: ""REATA"" is invalid. So we need to think of a valid five-letter word starting with RE and ending with A.

Valid words: REACH – but H is okay; however, A is in position 4 here which is not allowed (A must be in position 5). Oops, no, REACH is R E A C H – A in position 3 which is invalid.

Next option: ""REPAY"" – but Y is excluded. ""REBAR"" – but B is okay, A in position 4 is invalid. ""RECAP"" – P is okay, A in 4 is invalid.

Wait, the only valid position left for A is position 5, so the pattern is R E _ _ A.

Valid words: REATA (invalid), REGMA (invalid), RELAX (X is okay but L is excluded), RERAN (but N is okay and R is already used twice which is allowed).

Actually, ""RERAN"" is valid (past tense of rerun), fits R E _ _ A and uses R twice, but we do not have any restriction on duplicate letters. However, let's check letters: R, E, R, A, N. R, E, A are already confirmed or known. N is new and not excluded.

But we want to test two new consonants in positions 3 and 4. 

Another valid word: ""RETIA"" – but T is excluded. 

""REMIX"" – X is okay, but I is new and X is okay, but we need A in position 5.

Actually, it seems hard to find a common word fitting R E _ _ A with A at 5. Let me list:

Valid common words matching R E _ _ A:
- REATA – but T is excluded.
- REGMA – probably not common.
- RELAX – L is excluded.
- RERAN – valid, but uses R twice.

""RERAN"" is valid but uses R twice. Alternatively, ""REMAN"" – M and N are new, A in 5, but ""REMAN"" is valid.

Let me choose ""REMAN"" which is valid and tests M and N in positions 3 and 4. The letters are: R (✓), E (✓), M (new), A (must be at 5), N (new). This fits the pattern.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

4. Therefore, the current pattern is: R E _ _ _ and the word must include A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, but not in position 3 or 4 (from READY). So A must be in position 5.

Hence, the word looks like: R E _ _ A.

We still need two more distinct consonants that have not been eliminated (i.e., not S, L, T, D, Y). Common remaining consonants that fit well include C, H, N, M, B, F, G, etc.

Actually, ""RERAN"" is valid (past tense of rerun), fits R E _ _ A and uses R twice, but we do not have any restriction on duplicate letters. However, let's check letters: R, E, R, A, N. R, E, A are already confirmed or known. N is new and not excluded.

Another valid word: ""RETIA"" – but T is excluded. 

""REMIX"" – X is okay, but I is new and X is okay, but we need A in position 5.

Actually, it seems hard to find a common word fitting R E _ _ A with A at 5. Let me list:

Valid common words matching R E _ _ A:
- REATA – but T is excluded.
- REGMA – probably not common.
- RELAX – L is excluded.
- RERAN – valid, but uses R twice.

""RERAN"" is valid but uses R twice. Alternatively, ""REMAN"" – M and N are new, A in 5, but ""REMAN"" is valid.
