1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

Looking at 5-letter words: 
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.
- ""STARE"" is another good option with S, T, A, R, E.
- ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it includes the vowels A, O, E and the consonants R and S, which are all very frequent letters. This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are ruled out.  
That leaves the remaining most-common English letters: T, L, N, I, U, C, Y, D, H, M.  
A good second guess should use five of those high-frequency letters to maximize new information.

Good candidate words:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L)
- UNITY (U, N, I, T, Y)
- COUNT (C, O, U, N, T) – but O is already out, so skip.
- TULIP (T, U, L, I, P)

Remaining unused common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in the 3rd position
- N somewhere (not position 2)
- L somewhere
- Two other letters from the still-allowed pool.

Possible positions for N: 1, 3 (but 3 is I), 4, 5  
Possible positions for L: any except already tried spots (spot 2 in UNTIL, spot 2 in BLIND, spot 2 is open; spot 4 in BLIND, etc.)

Let’s list candidate words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _ with N and L placed appropriately:

- C L I N K – check: I at 3, N at 4 (allowed), L at 2 (allowed).  
- P I N C H – no L.  
- F L I N G – I at 3, N at 4, L at 2.  
- P L I N K – same structure.  
- M I N C H – no L.  
- C H I N K – no L.  

""CLINK"" looks perfect: uses C, L, I, N, K; satisfies all constraints.  
Let’s verify:
C(allowed), L(allowed, position 2 allowed), I(position 3 ✓), N(position 4 allowed), K(allowed).  
No rejected letters.  
Also, N not in position 2 and L not previously fixed in any position.

So the next logical guess is CLINK.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

Looking at 5-letter words: 
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.
- ""STARE"" is another good option with S, T, A, R, E.
- ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it includes the vowels A, O, E and the consonants R and S, which are all very frequent letters. This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are ruled out.  
That leaves the remaining most-common English letters: T, L, N, I, U, C, Y, D, H, M.  
A good second guess should use five of those high-frequency letters to maximize new information.

Good candidate words:
- UNTIL (U, N, T, I, L)
- UNITY (U, N, I, T, Y)
- COUNT (C, O, U, N, T) – but O is already out, so skip.
- TULIP (T, U, L, I, P)

I’ll pick “UNTIL” because it uses T, L, N, I, U – all still possible and fairly common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The second guess gave us useful constraints:

- U, T are not in the word (✗).
- N, I, L are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- A, R, O, S, E are also out from the first guess.

Letters still allowed: basically everything except A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

We know:
- N is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- I is somewhere, but NOT in position 4.
- L is somewhere, but NOT in position 5.

Let’s make a word using N, I, L plus two other unused common consonants.  
Remaining high-frequency letters: C, D, H, M, Y, G, P, B, F, K, V, W.

A solid 5-letter word that uses N, I, L and two of these is “BLIND”:
- B (still allowed)
- L (in the word, not in position 5 → fits)
- I (in the word, not in position 4 → fits)
- N (in the word, not in position 2 → fits)
- D (still allowed)

This lets us test positions for L, I, N and introduces B and D.

3. BLIND → B(x) L(-) I(✓) N(✓) D(x)

4. CLINK → C(x) L(-) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)

- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, B, D, C, K.

The word pattern is: _ _ I N _  (since N is fixed at 4).
We still need to place L in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and 2 was tried in UNTIL but marked wrong, so L must be in 1 or 5).

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.

- L _ I N _  (e.g., L F I N G, L H I N G, L M I N Y, etc.)
- _ _ I N L (e.g., P H I N L, F I N L, etc.)

Looking for common English words:
- L I N G is too short.
- F L I N G → positions: F(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) G(5), but L can't be at 2 (from UNTIL feedback).
- P L I N G → same issue with L at 2.

Allowed letters left: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:

  - L W I N G → ""LWING"" – no.
  - L Y I N G → ""LYING"" – this is a valid word, fits: L(1) Y(2) I(3) N(4) G(5).

  - F H I N L → ""FHINL"" – no.
  - G H I N L → ""GHINL"" – no.

Only valid word fitting is ""LYING"":

- All letters are allowed (L, Y, I, N, G).
- I is confirmed at 3, N at 4.
