For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. Classic starting words include:

- ADIEU (covers 4 vowels)
- AUDIO (covers 4 vowels)
- STARE (mix of common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (similar reasoning)
- CRANE (good consonant/vowel mix)
- ROATE (statistically optimal per some analyses)

The word ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses the very common S, L, T consonants
2. It has the common vowels A and E
3. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z
4. It tests 5 unique letters, maximizing information

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
S, A, T, P

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions aren’t pinned yet:

Specific position constraints so far (from Guess 2, ELOPE → E(-) L(-) O(-) P(x) E(-)):
- First E is **not** in position 1
- L is **not** in position 2
- O is **not** in position 3
- E is **not** in position 5

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, E, O (each must appear at least once, and possibly in multiple positions if a letter is duplicated).
2. Contains none of S, A, T, P.
3. Respects all the positional exclusions above.

Looking for common 5-letter words that meet these rules:

- ELOPE is already tried.
- Other candidates: OLDEN, LOVER, LOWER, HOLED, MOLE, BELLE, LEONE, …  

“LOWER” satisfies:
- Uses L, O, E, plus R and W (not yet tested).
- Doesn’t use S, A, T, P.
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since it only had to avoid position 2).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it only had to avoid position 3).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it only had to avoid positions 1 and 5).

Let’s unify all the information gathered so far.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, P, R  
Letters that ARE in the word but have unknown exact positions: L, O, W, E

Every one of those four required letters has been marked “-” (wrong position) in every position we have tried so far:

From SLATE:  
- L is in word, but not position 2  
- E is in word, but not position 5  

From ELOPE:  
- E is in word, but not position 1  
- L is in word, but not position 2 (already known)  
- O is in word, but not position 3  

From LOWER:  
- L is in word, but not position 1  
- O is in word, but not position 2  
- W is in word, but not position 3  
- E is in word, but not position 4  

Now we list all 5 positions with the allowed letters for each, respecting everything above.

Position 1: cannot have L, S, A, T, P, R → remaining letters include O, W, E, …  
Position 2: cannot have L, O, S, A, T, P, R → remaining letters include W, E, …  
Position 3: cannot have O, W, S, A, T, P, R → remaining letters include L, E, …  
Position 4: cannot have E, S, A, T, P, R → remaining letters include L, O, W, …  
Position 5: cannot have E, S, A, T, P, R → remaining letters include L, O, W, …

We must use each of L, O, W, E exactly once (because we have no evidence of duplicates yet) plus one more letter that is not excluded. The only remaining letters that are still untested and not excluded are for example D, G, N, C, B, F, H, etc. We’ll pick one of the common ones.

Scanning valid permutations that satisfy all constraints, the word “LOWED” is invalid because it uses D (allowed) but repeats no letters we need and contains E in position 5 which is forbidden. Trying “WELDO” – but English words only. A real dictionary word that fits is “WOOLE” – no, double O not needed. Another candidate is “ELBOW” – let’s check:

ELBOW:

- Position 1: E (allowed, only excluded from position 1? No: from ELOPE E is not allowed in position 1).  
So E cannot be first.  

Next candidate: “BOWEL”:

- B is new and allowed.  
- Check positions:  
  1: B – ok  
  2: O – ok (only excluded from position 3 in ELOPE)  
  3: W – ok (only excluded from position 3 in LOWER)  
  4: E – ok (only excluded from positions 1, 5, 4 in LOWER? From LOWER we know E is not in position 4)  
So position 4 has E, which is forbidden.  

Next candidate: “BELOW”:

- B – ok, new letter  
- E – position 2: ok (excluded from positions 1, 4, 5)  
- L – position 3: ok (excluded from positions 1, 2)  
- O – position 4: ok (excluded from 2, 3)  
- W – position 5: ok (not excluded anywhere yet)  

BELOW uses the required letters L, O, W, E exactly once each and introduces B (a new, still-allowed consonant) without any conflicts. Therefore BELOW is a legal and informative guess.
