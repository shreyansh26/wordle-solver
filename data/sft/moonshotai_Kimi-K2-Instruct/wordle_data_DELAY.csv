For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word typically includes the most frequent letters in English like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

Popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T), giving us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, A, E in some order, and does NOT contain S or T.  
Positions 1, 3 and 5 are currently occupied by S, A, E which got marks (x, -, -).  
Since A and E are both marked “in word, wrong spot”, they must appear in positions 2 or 4.  
L is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct a new guess that:
- keeps L, A, E
- avoids S and T
- tries fresh letters in the remaining slots.

A quick candidate is “LEARN”: it uses L, A, E plus R and N (both new), and moves A and E to different spots while keeping L somewhere new.

Check positions:
- L moved from 2 → 1 (allowed)
- E moved from 5 → 2 (allowed)
- A moved from 3 → 3 → still wrong spot, but we’ll learn more
- R, N are brand-new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give good information about the remaining consonants and the exact placement of A and E.

Summary of known facts:
- Letters not in the word: S, T, R, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, E  
- Known positions so far:
  – E is correctly placed in position 2.  (E✓)
  – L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from SLATE and LEARN).
  – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from both guesses).
- Therefore:
  – The pattern is: _ E _ _ _
  – L must be in position 3, 4 or 5.
  – A must be in position 1, 4 or 5.
- We still have three blanks (including the shared positions for L and A).

New candidate construction:
1. Put A in position 1 to test its placement.
2. Place L in either 3, 4 or 5 (avoiding 1, 2).
3. Fill the remaining blank(s) with letters we have not used yet (common consonants: D, G, M, P, Y, etc.).

A quick valid word that fits:  
A E L _ _  →  “AEGIS” fails (uses S, already ruled out).  
A E _ L _  →  “AEGLO” invalid.  
A E _ _ L  →  “AEGIL” invalid.  

Try swapping L to position 3:
A E L _ _  →  “AEL**” – need two consonants.  
Valid word: “AELPS” – invalid.  
“AEMIL” – invalid.  
“AEGLY” – invalid.  

Try L in position 4:
A E _ L _  →  “AEGLY” again invalid.  
“AEDLY” – invalid.  

Try L in position 5:
A E _ _ L  →  “AEGIL” invalid.  
“AEGOL” invalid.  

Back up: instead of forcing A to position 1, allow it to float to 4 or 5 still, and pick a more balanced word that keeps A and L together.

Word list scan for _ E _ _ _ with L, A, and avoiding S, T, R, N quickly yields:
  – “BEACH” uses C, H (new) but omits L.  
  – “PEACH” same issue.  
  – “HEALD” uses H, D (new) but places L in position 4; A in position 3 is forbidden (from feedback).  
  – “HEMAL” uses M, H; positions: H(1) E(2) M(3) A(4) L(5).

New candidate construction:
1. Put A in position 1 to test its placement.
2. Place L in either 3, 4 or 5 (avoiding 1, 2).
3. Fill the remaining blank(s) with letters we have not used yet (common consonants: D, G, M, P, Y, etc.).

A quick valid word that fits:  
A E L _ _  →  “AEGIS” fails (uses S, already ruled out).  
A E _ L _  →  “AEGLO” invalid.  
A E _ _ L  →  “AEGIL” invalid.  

Try swapping L to position 3:
A E L _ _  →  “AEL**” – need two consonants.  
Valid word: “AELPS” – invalid.  
“AEMIL” – invalid.  
“AEGLY” – invalid.  

Try L in position 4:
A E _ L _  →  “AEGLY” again invalid.  
“AEDLY” – invalid.  

Try L in position 5:
A E _ _ L  →  “AEGIL” invalid.  
“AEGOL” invalid.  

Back up: instead of forcing A to position 1, allow it to float to 4 or 5 still, and pick a more balanced word that keeps A and L together.

Word list scan for _ E _ _ _ with L, A, and avoiding S, T, R, N quickly yields:
  – “BEACH” uses C, H (new) but omits L.  
  – “PEACH” same issue.  
  – “HEALD” uses H, D (new) but places L in position 4; A in position 3 is forbidden (from feedback).  
  – “HEMAL” uses M, H; positions: H(1) E(2) M(3) A(4) L(5).  
    – Positions check:  
      – E is fixed at 2 ✓  
      – A not in 3 (ok, it’s at 4).  
      – L not in 1 (ok, it’s at 5).  
    – Letters: all new except L, A, E.

So “HEMAL” satisfies every constraint.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R, N, H, M  
Letters confirmed IN the word: E, A, L  
Known positions:
- E is fixed at position 2 (E✓).  
- A is fixed at position 4 (A✓).  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from SLATE, LEARN, HEMAL).  
  Therefore L must be in position 3.  

So the pattern is:  
_ E L A _  

Only position 1 and position 5 remain to be filled, using letters we have not tested yet.

Available consonants we haven’t used and are still valid: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern “_ E L A _”.  
Quick scan:  
PELAG, DELAY, BELAY, FELLA, JELLA, KELLY, etc.

“BELAY” uses B and Y (both new letters) and fits the pattern perfectly.

Pattern check:
B(1) E(2) L(3) A(4) Y(5)

- B and Y are brand-new letters.  
- L lands in position 3 for the first time, satisfying the “must be in word, not in 1,2,5” constraint.  
- A and E are already locked in positions 4 and 2 respectively.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word typically includes the most frequent letters in English like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

Popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes two common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T), giving us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, A, E in some order, and does NOT contain S or T.  
Positions 1, 3 and 5 are currently occupied by S, A, E which got marks (x, -, -).  
Since A and E are both marked “in word, wrong spot”, they must appear in positions 2 or 4.  
L is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s construct a new guess that:
- keeps L, A, E
- avoids S and T
- tries fresh letters in the remaining slots.

A quick candidate is “LEARN”: it uses L, A, E plus R and N (both new), and moves A and E to different spots while keeping L somewhere new.

Check positions:
- L moved from 2 → 1 (allowed)
- E moved from 5 → 2 (allowed)
- A moved from 3 → 3 → still wrong spot, but we’ll learn more
- R, N are brand-new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give good information about the remaining consonants and the exact placement of A and E.

Current facts after four guesses:  
- Known exact positions: _ E L A Y  
- All five letters are now confirmed and placed: E (2), L (3), A (4), Y (5).  
- Position 1 must therefore be the last missing letter.  
- Letters already ruled out include S, T, R, N, H, M, B.  
- Letters we still haven’t tested in position 1 that could form a valid word: we need a consonant that fits the pattern _ E L A Y.

The only common English 5-letter word matching _ E L A Y is “DELAY”, but D has not been ruled out.  
Likewise “FELAY” is not a valid word; “JELAY” invalid; “KELAY” invalid; “WELAY” invalid.  
Real dictionary match is “DELAY”.

Since we have exactly one slot left and D is still an untested consonant, “DELAY” satisfies every requirement.

Therefore the secret word must be DELAY.
