For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gain by testing common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple correct letters or eliminate many possibilities right away. Another good candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better due to the O and E placement. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides broad coverage of vowels and consonants.

So far we know:
- The word starts with A.
- The letters R, O, S, E, D, U, L, T are all NOT in the word at all.

We still need to fill positions 2-5 using the remaining alphabet:  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P.  
We also need at least one vowel in the remaining four positions; the only unused vowel is I.

A good next guess should:
1. Place a vowel somewhere in positions 2-5 to test for its presence (only possible vowel left is I).
2. Use common consonants we haven’t ruled out.

A straightforward candidate is “Aching” but that’s 6 letters.

- A + B, I, N, C → “ABINC” (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, H → “ACINH” (not a word)
- A + F, I, N, K → “AFINK” (not a word)
- A + M, I, N, K → “AMINK” (close to “AMNIC” but that’s rare)
- A + B, I, N, K → “ABINK” (not a word)

- A + B, I, N, G → “ABING” (not a word)
- A + B, I, N, H → “ABINH” (not a word)

Actually, looking at real 5-letter words that start with A and use only the remaining letters:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from the first guess:

This tells us:
- The first letter is definitely A.
- The letters R, O, S, and E are NOT in the word at all.
- We still need to find the remaining four letters (positions 2-5) from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, S, E).

Since the first letter is fixed as A, we now need to test other common letters in positions 2-5. A good second guess should introduce new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones (R, O, S, E).

We still need to fill positions 2-5 using the remaining alphabet:  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P.  
We also need at least one vowel in the remaining four positions; the only unused vowel is I.

A good next guess should:
1. Place a vowel somewhere in positions 2-5 to test for its presence (only possible vowel left is I).
2. Use common consonants we haven’t ruled out.

A straightforward candidate is “Aching” but that’s 6 letters.

Let’s collect what we now know with certainty.

1. The word starts with A.  
   Position 1 = A (✓)

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   R, O, S, E, D, U, L, T, C, G, V

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions we are still determining:
   - I – it is in the word (marked “-” twice, meaning wrong position each time).
   - N – it is in the word and, from the latest feedback, is now **correctly placed** in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ _ N

Letters still available (not eliminated and not yet fixed) are:
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, I

We know I must appear **somewhere** in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it cannot be in 1 or 5 because those are already filled with A and N).

We need to test positions for I and two more distinct letters chosen from the available set, ensuring no already-eliminated letters are reused.

A quick scan for common 5-letter English words that fit A _ _ _ N with the constraints:
- A B I _ N → “ABIGN” (not valid)

Testing APIAN will:
- Confirm placement of I (currently unknown).
- Reveal whether P is correct and in the right spot.

Therefore, APIAN is the logical next guess.

<guess>APIAN</guess>",APIAN,"Let’s collect what we now know with certainty.

1. The word starts with A.  
   Position 1 = A (✓)

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   R, O, S, E, D, U, L, T, C, G, V

3. Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions we are still determining:
   - I – it is in the word (marked “-” twice, meaning wrong position each time).
   - N – it is in the word and, from the latest feedback, is now **correctly placed** in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ _ N

Letters still available (not eliminated and not yet fixed) are:
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, I

We know I must appear **somewhere** in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it cannot be in 1 or 5 because those are already filled with A and N).

We need to test positions for I and two more distinct letters chosen from the available set, ensuring no already-eliminated letters are reused.

A quick scan for common 5-letter English words that fit A _ _ _ N with the constraints:
- A B I _ N → “ABIGN” (not valid)
- A M I _ N → “AMINO” (O is eliminated) 
- A F I _ N → “AFIAN” (not valid)
- A P I _ N → “APIAN” (P, I, A, N) – valid word meaning “of or relating to bees”.
- A H I _ N → “AHIND” (D eliminated)
- A J I _ N → “AJINN” (not valid)
- A K I _ N → “AKINS” (S eliminated)
- A W I _ N → “AWING” (G eliminated)
- A Y I _ N → “AYINS” (S eliminated)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gain by testing common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance to hit multiple correct letters or eliminate many possibilities right away. Another good candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better due to the O and E placement. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides broad coverage of vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from the first guess:
A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

This tells us:
- The first letter is definitely A.
- The letters R, O, S, and E are NOT in the word at all.
- We still need to find the remaining four letters (positions 2-5) from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, S, E).

Since the first letter is fixed as A, we now need to test other common letters in positions 2-5. A good second guess should introduce new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones (R, O, S, E). 

Possible good choices for the remaining letters include: T, L, N, I, U, C, D, M, P, etc. One word that uses common remaining letters is ""ADULT"" (A is fixed in position 1, and we test D, U, L, T in positions 2-5). Alternatively, ""ANCI"" isn't a word, but ""ANTIC"" is 5 letters. Another good option is ""ALMUD"" but that's less common. ""AULIC"" is also uncommon. 

The best simple and common word seems to be ""ADULT"" as it tests D, U, L, T which are all fairly common and haven't been tested yet.

<guess>ADULT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADULT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) U(x) L(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- The word starts with A.
- The letters R, O, S, E, D, U, L, T are all NOT in the word at all.

We still need to fill positions 2-5 using the remaining alphabet:  
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common consonants are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P.  
We also need at least one vowel in the remaining four positions; the only unused vowel is I.

A good next guess should:
1. Place a vowel somewhere in positions 2-5 to test for its presence (only possible vowel left is I).
2. Use common consonants we haven’t ruled out.

A straightforward candidate is “Aching” but that’s 6 letters.  
5-letter options:
- A + B, I, N, C → “ABINC” (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, H → “ACINH” (not a word)
- A + F, I, N, K → “AFINK” (not a word)
- A + M, I, N, K → “AMINK” (close to “AMNIC” but that’s rare)
- A + B, I, N, K → “ABINK” (not a word)
- A + C, I, N, K → “ACINK” (not a word)
- A + B, I, N, G → “ABING” (not a word)
- A + B, I, N, H → “ABINH” (not a word)

Actually, looking at real 5-letter words that start with A and use only the remaining letters:  
“ABACK”, “ABUZZ” (both use eliminated letters), “AFIB” (too short), “AMNIC” (rare), “APHID” (uses D), “ACINI” (plural of acinus, but uses I twice), “ACING” (uses G, I, N), but G, I, N are still allowed.

“ACING” is a valid English word, uses A (fixed), C, I, N, G – none of which have been ruled out.

Let’s try “ACING”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
1. The word starts with A (fixed in position 1).
2. Letters already eliminated: R, O, S, E, D, U, L, T, C, G.
3. The letters I, N appear in the word but are NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively (they were marked “wrong position” in ACING).

Remaining possible positions for I and N:
- I must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Unused letters we still have: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-allowed I and N).

We need a 5-letter word A _ _ _ _ that:
- contains both I and N,
- places I in 2, 4, or 5,
- places N in 2, 3, or 5,
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Quick scan of common 5-letter words starting with A:
- A-I-N in positions 1-2-3 → AIN** – no common word.
- A-I-N in 1-2-4 → AI*N* – “AGAIN” (but G already eliminated) and “ALIEN” (but L eliminated).
- A-I-N in 1-2-5 → AI**N – “ANBIN” (not a word).
- A-I-N in 1-3-4 → A*IN* – “AVIAN” (V, A, I, A, N) – uses A twice which is fine, uses V which is still allowed.
- A-I-N in 1-3-5 → A*I*N – “AVION” (O eliminated), “AMNIC” (C eliminated), “APHIN” (H allowed), but “APHIN” isn’t a real word.
- A-I-N in 1-4-5 → A**IN – “ADMIN” (D eliminated), “ABUIN” (U eliminated).

The only real 5-letter word left that satisfies the constraints is AVIAN:
- A(✓) V(-) I(-) A(-) N(-)  
  – V is new and allowed.  
  – I and N are in wrong positions, which is acceptable because we’re still testing where they belong.

So AVIAN is the logical next guess.
