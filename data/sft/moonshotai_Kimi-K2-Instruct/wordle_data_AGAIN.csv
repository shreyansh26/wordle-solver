1. Is a common 5-letter English word
2. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
3. Avoids rare letters to get more useful feedback

Common starting word strategies include using words with lots of vowels or common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- Uses N in a new position
- Uses other common letters

   - V and L are not in the word.

Summary of facts:
- Pattern is: _ _ A _ _
- N must be in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4. The only remaining possible positions for N are 3 or 5.
- However, position 3 is already A, so N must be in position 5.
- Therefore, the word ends with N: _ _ A _ N
- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, E, S, P, K, V, L
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we should prioritize common ones).

So we need a word of the form: _ _ A _ N, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- HUMAN (H, M, U allowed)
- GAMIN (G, M, I allowed)
- BATAN (but TAN is a suffix, B, T allowed)
- DAMAN (D, M allowed)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Is a common 5-letter English word
2. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
3. Avoids rare letters to get more useful feedback

Common starting word strategies include using words with lots of vowels or common consonants. Some popular choices are:
- AUDIO (good for vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (similar)

I'll go with CRANE as it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: correct position, 3rd letter (✓)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word has an A in position 3.
2. It contains N, but N cannot be in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain C, R, or E.
4. We still have no info about B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good letters to try now: anything except C, R, E. Since we know A is fixed in spot 3 and N is somewhere else, we can try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3
- Uses N in a new position
- Uses other common letters

Possible next word: SLANT
- S, L, N, T are all new letters
- N is moved from position 4 to position 4 (still invalid), so let's adjust
- STAND: A is fixed at 3, N is now at 4 (invalid) or 1/2/5
- Let's put N in position 1: NASTY (but Y is less common)
- PLANK: A at 3, N at 4 (invalid)
- PLANT: A at 3, N at 4 (invalid)
- Let's move N to position 2: BANDS
- SPANK: A at 3, N at 2 (valid)

I'll choose SPANK as it tests new letters S, P, K and places N in position 2 (valid since it wasn't in position 4 before).

Known facts
1. Letter in position 3 is A (✓ twice).
2. Letter N is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (both guesses placed it there and got “-”).
3. Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, S, P, K.

So:

- A is fixed at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- N must appear once, and its only legal positions now are 1 or 5.
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
- keeps A in position 3,
- contains N only in position 1 or 5,
- introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Let’s try N in position 1:

N _ A _ _

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T.
Vowels left: I, O, U, Y.

A good candidate is NATAL – but T is repeated and we don’t know about double letters.
Another candidate: NAVAL – V is still possible.
Yet another: NAMAZ – but Z is rare.

Let’s pick NAVAL:
- N at 1, A at 3, V at 4, L at 5.
- Contains only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s extract every fact from the four guesses.

Current pattern: _ _ A _ N (because N has now been confirmed in position 5).

Known letters  
- A is fixed in position 3.  
- N is fixed in position 5.  

Known non-letters  
C, R, E, S, P, K, V, L, H, U, M are all absent.

Remaining allowed letters (common ones first):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, T, W, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[1] [2] A [4] N  
with those four unknown slots filled only from the allowed set.

Possible candidates built from the remaining common letters:  
D, F, G, B, I, O, T are the most everyday.

Quick scan of real words fitting “??A?N” with these letters:

- GOBAN – but B is valid; G,O,B allowed  
- BISON – B,I,S – but S is already out  
- GIANT – G,I,A,N,T – but T is allowed and not yet ruled out  
- BADAN – not a word  
- DIAN – too short  
- FAGAN – F,A,G,A,N – double A  
- BATAN – not common  
- JOTAN – J is rare  
- TOGAN – not valid  

GIANT seems plausible: G, I, A, N, T – all letters allowed and common.

Let’s check: positions  
G I A N T → positions 1,2,3,4,5  
- We know position 3 is A (✓)  
- We now know N is at 5 (✓)  
- G, I, T are new letters not yet excluded.

<guess>GIANT</guess>",GIANT,"Let’s extract every fact from the four guesses.

Current pattern: _ _ A _ N (because N has now been confirmed in position 5).

Known letters  
- A is fixed in position 3.  
- N is fixed in position 5.  

Known non-letters  
C, R, E, S, P, K, V, L, H, U, M are all absent.

Remaining allowed letters (common ones first):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, T, W, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
[1] [2] A [4] N  
with those four unknown slots filled only from the allowed set.

Possible candidates built from the remaining common letters:  
D, F, G, B, I, O, T are the most everyday.

Quick scan of real words fitting “??A?N” with these letters:

- GOBAN – but B is valid; G,O,B allowed  
- BISON – B,I,S – but S is already out  
- GIANT – G,I,A,N,T – but T is allowed and not yet ruled out  
- BADAN – not a word  
- DIAN – too short  
- FAGAN – F,A,G,A,N – double A  
- BATAN – not common  
- JOTAN – J is rare  
- TOGAN – not valid  

GIANT seems plausible: G, I, A, N, T – all letters allowed and common.

Let’s check: positions  
G I A N T → positions 1,2,3,4,5  
- We know position 3 is A (✓)  
- We now know N is at 5 (✓)  
- G, I, T are new letters not yet excluded.

Hence GIANT is a valid and informative next guess.",Guess 5: GIANT -> FEEDBACK: G(-) I(-) A(✓) N(-) T(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,AGAIN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Is a common 5-letter English word
2. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
3. Avoids rare letters to get more useful feedback

Common starting word strategies include using words with lots of vowels or common consonants. Some popular choices are:
- AUDIO (good for vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (similar)

I'll go with CRANE as it covers:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: correct position, 3rd letter (✓)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. The word has an A in position 3.
2. It contains N, but N cannot be in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain C, R, or E.
4. We still have no info about B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good letters to try now: anything except C, R, E. Since we know A is fixed in spot 3 and N is somewhere else, we can try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3
- Uses N in a new position
- Uses other common letters

Possible next word: SLANT
- S, L, N, T are all new letters
- N is moved from position 4 to position 4 (still invalid), so let's adjust
- STAND: A is fixed at 3, N is now at 4 (invalid) or 1/2/5
- Let's put N in position 1: NASTY (but Y is less common)
- PLANK: A at 3, N at 4 (invalid)
- PLANT: A at 3, N at 4 (invalid)
- Let's move N to position 2: BANDS
- SPANK: A at 3, N at 2 (valid)

I'll choose SPANK as it tests new letters S, P, K and places N in position 2 (valid since it wasn't in position 4 before).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPANK -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now have:

Known facts
1. Letter in position 3 is A (✓ twice).
2. Letter N is somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (both guesses placed it there and got “-”).
3. Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, S, P, K.

So:

- A is fixed at position 3: _ _ A _ _
- N must appear once, and its only legal positions now are 1 or 5.
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
- keeps A in position 3,
- contains N only in position 1 or 5,
- introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Let’s try N in position 1:

N _ A _ _

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T.
Vowels left: I, O, U, Y.

A good candidate is NATAL – but T is repeated and we don’t know about double letters.
Another candidate: NAVAL – V is still possible.
Yet another: NAMAZ – but Z is rare.

Let’s pick NAVAL:
- N at 1, A at 3, V at 4, L at 5.
- Contains only letters not yet ruled out.
- Good spread of consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPANK -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x)
Guess 3: NAVAL -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) V(x) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - N is somewhere in the word, but not positions 2 or 4.
   - C, R, E are not in the word.

2. SPANK → S(x) P(x) A(✓) N(-) K(x)
   - A is still fixed in position 3.
   - N is still somewhere in the word, but not positions 2 or 4 (from both CRANE and SPANK).
   - S, P, K are not in the word.

3. NAVAL → N(-) A(-) V(x) A(-) L(x)
   - A is NOT in positions 2 or 4 (it got ""-"" in both spots).
   - N is still somewhere in the word, but not positions 1, 2, or 4 (from CRANE, SPANK, NAVAL).
   - V and L are not in the word.

Summary of facts:
- Pattern is: _ _ A _ _
- N must be in the word and cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4. The only remaining possible positions for N are 3 or 5.
- However, position 3 is already A, so N must be in position 5.
- Therefore, the word ends with N: _ _ A _ N
- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, E, S, P, K, V, L
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we should prioritize common ones).

So we need a word of the form: _ _ A _ N, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- HUMAN (H, M, U allowed)
- GAMIN (G, M, I allowed)
- BATAN (but TAN is a suffix, B, T allowed)
- DAMAN (D, M allowed)
- JAMAN (but J is less common)

The most common and test-rich word here is HUMAN:
- H, U, M are all new letters not yet tested.
- Fits the pattern _ _ A _ N with N in position 5.
