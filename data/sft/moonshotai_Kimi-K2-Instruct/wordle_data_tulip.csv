For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words often use letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This helps quickly determine which of these letters are in the word and whether they're in the correct position.

From the two prior guesses we know:

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, N, Y  
Letters that are present but not yet placed: U, I, T  
Positions so far:  
- The word does not start with U (because U was “-” in position 1).  
- I is somewhere other than position 3.  
- T is somewhere other than position 4.

With those constraints, a good next guess should:
1. Use only allowed letters (no A, R, O, S, E, N, Y).  
2. Include U, I and T so we can pin down their correct positions.  
3. Introduce a couple of new common consonants we haven’t tried.

The letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the known “in-word” letters U, I, T.

A balanced word that satisfies everything is “BUILD”:
- B and L are new high-frequency consonants.  
- U, I, D satisfy the known letters (U and I must appear, D is new).  
- U is placed in position 2 (different from the prior position 1).  
- I is placed in position 3 (allowed because earlier it was only ruled out of position 3 in “UNITY”).  
- T is notably absent, but we can test T next if needed; for now we’re trying to locate U and I more precisely.

Hence I’ll guess BUILD.

From the feedback so far:

Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, E, N, Y, B, D  
Fixed position: U in spot 2  
Letters that must appear somewhere else: I, T  
Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L (L already tried but only “-”), M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus C, G, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z etc.

The guess must:
- Have U in position 2.  
- Include both I and T somewhere other than their prior “-” spots.  
  – I cannot be in position 3.  
  – T cannot be in position 4.  
- Use only letters from the allowed set.

A simple word satisfying these constraints is “QUITE”:
- Q is still allowed.  
- U is in position 2 (fixed).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed: old feedback only said I is not in position 3 in UNITY, but that was a different word; the feedback on BUILD said I is present but wrong position 3, which means it is NOT in position 3, so position 3 is now doubly forbidden for I).  
Unfortunately, I just realized I would place I in position 3 again, which is already ruled out. Let’s correct:

We need I not in position 3 and T not in position 4.  
Another candidate is “QUIET”:
- Q, E are still excluded (E is out from guess 1), so no good.

Try “QUILT”:
- Letters Q, U, I, L, T.  
- U is in position 2 (correct).  
- I is in position 3 (still forbidden).  
Not good.

Try “GUILT”:
- G, U, I, L, T.  
- U in position 2 (correct).  
- I in position 3 (again forbidden).

Try “QUINT”:
- Q, U, I, N, T – N is out.

Try “FUTILE” – too many letters.

We need a 5-letter word with U in spot 2, containing I and T in legal positions.  
Let’s try “CUBIT”:
- C, U, B, I, T – B is out.

“HUTCH” – no I or T.

“JURIT” – not a valid word.

“VULIC” – not valid.

“MUSIC” – no T.

“PULIT” – not valid.

“LUPIN” – no T.

“TULIP” – T in 1, U in 2, L in 3, I in 4, P in 5.  
Check constraints:
- T is in 1 (allowed; old feedback only said T is not in 4).  
- I is in 4 (allowed; old feedback only said I is not in 3).  
All letters used are not yet excluded (T, U, L, I, P).  
Word must be valid: TULIP is a valid 5-letter word.

Fixed position: U in spot 2  
Letters that must appear somewhere else: I, T  
Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L (L already tried but only “-”), M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus C, G, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z etc.

The guess must:
- Have U in position 2.  
- Include both I and T somewhere other than their prior “-” spots.  
  – I cannot be in position 3.  
  – T cannot be in position 4.  
- Use only letters from the allowed set.

A simple word satisfying these constraints is “QUITE”:
- Q is still allowed.  
- U is in position 2 (fixed).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed: old feedback only said I is not in position 3 in UNITY, but that was a different word; the feedback on BUILD said I is present but wrong position 3, which means it is NOT in position 3, so position 3 is now doubly forbidden for I).  
Unfortunately, I just realized I would place I in position 3 again, which is already ruled out. Let’s correct:

We need I not in position 3 and T not in position 4.  
Another candidate is “QUIET”:
- Q, E are still excluded (E is out from guess 1), so no good.

Try “QUILT”:
- Letters Q, U, I, L, T.  
- U is in position 2 (correct).  
- I is in position 3 (still forbidden).  
Not good.

Try “GUILT”:
- G, U, I, L, T.  
- U in position 2 (correct).  
- I in position 3 (again forbidden).

Try “QUINT”:
- Q, U, I, N, T – N is out.

Try “FUTILE” – too many letters.

We need a 5-letter word with U in spot 2, containing I and T in legal positions.  
Let’s try “CUBIT”:
- C, U, B, I, T – B is out.

“HUTCH” – no I or T.

“JURIT” – not a valid word.

“VULIC” – not valid.

“MUSIC” – no T.

“PULIT” – not valid.

“LUPIN” – no T.

“TULIP” – T in 1, U in 2, L in 3, I in 4, P in 5.  
Check constraints:
- T is in 1 (allowed; old feedback only said T is not in 4).  
- I is in 4 (allowed; old feedback only said I is not in 3).  
All letters used are not yet excluded (T, U, L, I, P).  
Word must be valid: TULIP is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with TULIP.",Guess 4: TULIP -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(✓) L(✓) I(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
