For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, T, N, S, L.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. One of the best starting words is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might be even better as it has:
- The most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

But then I recall that ""AROSE"" doesn't have the letter I which is also very common. After reconsidering, I think ""RAISE"" might be optimal as it has:
- R (very common consonant)
- A, I, E (3 common vowels)
- S (very common consonant)

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

After weighing these options, I believe ""AROSE"" strikes the best balance of common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 2 (✓).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints for the secret word:
- Length: 5 letters
- Position 2 = A
- Contains S somewhere (but not in position 1 or 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N, T

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions:
- 2 is A
- S must appear in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)
- 1, 3, 4, 5 can be any of the allowed letters (with S appearing once more)

To maximize information in the next guess, we want to test as many new common letters as possible while keeping A fixed in position 2 and placing S in a new spot. A good choice is “BASAL”:

- B (new common consonant)
- A (fixed in position 2)
- S (moved to position 3)
- A (already known, but we can repeat for position 4)
- L (new common consonant)

This tests positions for S and L while keeping A locked.

Let’s consolidate the updated constraints:

Known facts from all feedback

2. Position 3 = S (✓ in Guess 3)
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T, B, L (from all x feedback)
4. Letters still allowed (excluding the forbidden ones): A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
5. The word template is now:

   _  A  S  _  _

   (positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled with allowed consonants; no repeats are required unless evidence changes)

To maximize information on the next guess, we want to test several new consonants in positions 1, 4, 5 while locking in the known A-S sequence. A common high-information consonant set is C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P. Choosing one that forms a valid English word, we can use:

- C A S H Y  (but Y is less common and H hasn’t been tested yet) – not ideal
- C A S K S  – repeats S, but S already confirmed and positions matter.
- C A S H Y  – invalid (Y may be too speculative).
- C A S E D  – E is banned.
- D A S H S  – repeats S and H is new.
- F A S C O – O banned.
- C A S H S – repeats S.
- M A S K S – repeats S but tests M and K.

“CASKS” repeats S but still tests C and K positions without violating any ban.
“CASHY” is speculative.
“DASHS” is not a standard word.

The cleanest legitimate word that introduces two new consonants in positions 1,4,5 is “CASKS”.

However, S already appears once, and we can’t have two S’s because we’ve only seen evidence of one S in the word.

Next idea: “CASKY” – but Y might be wasted.
“CASKS” is actually 5 letters and valid, but we suspect only a single S.

Better: “CASKS” is okay as test of positions 1,4,5 with C, K, and the final S serving to confirm 5th position. But let’s see an alternative.

Another valid word: “GASKS” – same issue.

We need a word that keeps A in position 2, S in position 3, and introduces new consonants in positions 1,4,5 without repeats of forbidden letters.

“CASKS” is acceptable – it is a real word, uses C and K, and the final S is a new placement check.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, T, N, S, L.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. One of the best starting words is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might be even better as it has:
- The most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

But then I recall that ""AROSE"" doesn't have the letter I which is also very common. After reconsidering, I think ""RAISE"" might be optimal as it has:
- R (very common consonant)
- A, I, E (3 common vowels)
- S (very common consonant)

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

After weighing these options, I believe ""AROSE"" strikes the best balance of common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Letters left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known A and S.

- S is moved to position 1 (previously it was position 4)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,NASTY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) along with consonants like R, T, N, S, L.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. One of the best starting words is ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

However, I think ""AROSE"" might be even better as it has:
- The most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)

But then I recall that ""AROSE"" doesn't have the letter I which is also very common. After reconsidering, I think ""RAISE"" might be optimal as it has:
- R (very common consonant)
- A, I, E (3 common vowels)
- S (very common consonant)

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

After weighing these options, I believe ""AROSE"" strikes the best balance of common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1  
R(x) : R is NOT in the word  
O(x) : O is NOT in the word  
S(-) : S is in the word but not in position 4  
E(x) : E is NOT in the word  

So the secret word:
- does NOT contain R, O, E  
- does contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4  

Letters left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known A and S.

A reasonable next step is to try another high-information word. Since A and S are confirmed, I want to place them in new positions and introduce other high-frequency letters. A strong choice is “SAINT”:

- S is moved to position 1 (previously it was position 4)  
- A is moved to position 2 (previously it was position 1)  
- Adds I, N, T – all fairly common letters we haven’t tried yet  

If any of I, N, T are present (even in wrong positions) we will quickly learn. And we’ll confirm new positions for S and A.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s synthesize all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are NOT in the word.
   - S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. SAINT → S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 2 (✓).
   - I, N, T are NOT in the word.

Summary of constraints for the secret word:
- Length: 5 letters
- Position 2 = A
- Contains S somewhere (but not in position 1 or 4)
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N, T

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions:
- 2 is A
- S must appear in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)
- 1, 3, 4, 5 can be any of the allowed letters (with S appearing once more)

To maximize information in the next guess, we want to test as many new common letters as possible while keeping A fixed in position 2 and placing S in a new spot. A good choice is “BASAL”:

- B (new common consonant)
- A (fixed in position 2)
- S (moved to position 3)
- A (already known, but we can repeat for position 4)
- L (new common consonant)

This tests positions for S and L while keeping A locked.

Guess 3: BASAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(✓) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the updated constraints:

Known facts from all feedback
1. Position 2 = A (✓ in Guess 2 & 3)
2. Position 3 = S (✓ in Guess 3)
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T, B, L (from all x feedback)
4. Letters still allowed (excluding the forbidden ones): A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
5. The word template is now:

   _  A  S  _  _

   (positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled with allowed consonants; no repeats are required unless evidence changes)

To maximize information on the next guess, we want to test several new consonants in positions 1, 4, 5 while locking in the known A-S sequence. A common high-information consonant set is C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P. Choosing one that forms a valid English word, we can use:

- C A S H Y  (but Y is less common and H hasn’t been tested yet) – not ideal
- C A S K S  – repeats S, but S already confirmed and positions matter.
- C A S H Y  – invalid (Y may be too speculative).
- C A S E D  – E is banned.
- D A S H S  – repeats S and H is new.
- F A S C O – O banned.
- C A S H S – repeats S.
- M A S K S – repeats S but tests M and K.

“CASKS” repeats S but still tests C and K positions without violating any ban.
“CASHY” is speculative.
“DASHS” is not a standard word.

The cleanest legitimate word that introduces two new consonants in positions 1,4,5 is “CASKS”.

However, S already appears once, and we can’t have two S’s because we’ve only seen evidence of one S in the word.

Next idea: “CASKY” – but Y might be wasted.
“CASKS” is actually 5 letters and valid, but we suspect only a single S.

Better: “CASKS” is okay as test of positions 1,4,5 with C, K, and the final S serving to confirm 5th position. But let’s see an alternative.

Another valid word: “GASKS” – same issue.

We need a word that keeps A in position 2, S in position 3, and introduces new consonants in positions 1,4,5 without repeats of forbidden letters.

“CASKS” is acceptable – it is a real word, uses C and K, and the final S is a new placement check.

I’ll go with “CASKS”.

But let’s see an alternative.\n\nAnother valid word: “GASKS” – same issue.\n\nWe need a word that keeps A in position 2, S in position 3, and introduces new consonants in positions 1,4,5 without repeats of forbidden letters.\n\n“CASKS” is acceptable – it is a real word, uses C and K, and the final S is a new placement check.\n\nI’ll go with “CASKS”.\n\n<guess>CASKS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SAINT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: BASAL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(✓) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 4: CASKS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) S(✓) K(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From all feedback so far:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = S
- Position 5 = Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
R, O, E, I, N, T, B, L, C, K, D, H

Remaining letters to test:
F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Current word structure:
_ A S _ Y

Only position 1 and 4 remain to be filled with the remaining letters. We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern with the remaining letters.

Looking at possible combinations:
- F A S F Y – invalid (repeats F)
- F A S M Y – invalid (not a word)

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits the pattern _ A S _ Y with the remaining letters is ""GASP Y"" but that's two words. 

Looking at the remaining letters: F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

The only common word that fits is ""GASPY"" but that's not a valid word. 

However, ""GASHY"" was already tested with DASHY feedback. 

Let's re-examine the remaining letters and possible combinations. 

The valid word must be _ A S _ Y with the remaining letters. 

After checking, the only valid word is ""GASPY"" but it's not recognized. 

Wait, let me think differently. The letters allowed are F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words with pattern _ A S _ Y:

- ""GASPY"" – not a word
- ""GAS Y"" – not 5 letters
- ""FASPY"" – not a word
- ""JASPY"" – not a word
- ""MASPY"" – not a word
- ""PASPY"" – not a word
- ""VASPY"" – not a word
- ""WASPY"" – valid word meaning ""resembling a WASP""

So ""WASPY"" fits perfectly:
- W (position 1)
- A (position 2, confirmed)
- S (position 3, confirmed)
- P (position 4, new test)
- Y (position 5, confirmed)

This tests P in position 4 and W in position 1. Both letters are from the allowed set.

With positions 2, 3, and 5 locked as A, S, Y respectively, and the remaining allowed letters (F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) for positions 1 and 4, the valid word that fits is:
