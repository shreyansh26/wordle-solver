Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with unique letters that cover these common ones.

Looking at common 5-letter words that use these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains 5 unique very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

From the three guesses we’ve collected the following:

1. Absolutely ruled-out letters: A, S, T, N, C, V  
2. Locked-in letters and positions:  
   – 2nd letter = O  
   – 4th letter = E  
   – 5th letter = R  
3. Still unknown positions: 1st and 3rd letters.

So the current pattern is: _ O _ E R

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the remaining common letters that have not yet been tested (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.).

Let me list a few legal candidate words that fit _ O _ E R and only use allowed letters:

- BOWER (B, W)  
- HOMER (H, M)  
- LOWER (L, W)  
- GONER – but N is out  
- DOVER – V out  
- POWER (P, W)  
- BOXER – X is uncommon and X + B both untested, but B is more common than W or M; still, W and M are reasonable.

Among the most common remaining consonants, B and M appear frequently. “HOMER” uses H and M, both still valid; “BOWER” uses B and W. Between the two, “HOMER” is slightly more common, so I’ll go with it.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with unique letters that cover these common ones.

Looking at common 5-letter words that use these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains 5 unique very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3

- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The letters A and S are completely absent.
- The letters R, O, E are present somewhere in the word, but not in the positions guessed.
- We still have no information about many other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

I need a second guess that:
1. Does not contain A or S.
2. Uses the known-good letters R, O, E in different positions than before.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate would be ""TONER"":
- Contains T, O, N, E, R
- Uses O (known good) in position 2 instead of 3
- Uses R (known good) in position 5 instead of 2
- Uses E (known good) in position 4 instead of 5
- Introduces T and N which are both very common
- Uses no A or S

A good candidate is ""COVER"":
- C is a common unused consonant
- V is being tested
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 5 (✓)
- No forbidden letters A, S, T, N

Another candidate is ""GONER"", but N is already ruled out, so that's invalid.
Another is ""HOPER"", but P is less common than C.
""LOPER"" - L is good but P is less common.
""COYER"" - but Y is less common.
""COMER"" - M is good but we already know R is in position 5.

COVER seems optimal as it tests C and V with the known pattern.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- No forbidden letters A, S, T, N

Another candidate is ""GONER"", but N is already ruled out, so that's invalid.
Another is ""HOPER"", but P is less common than C.
""LOPER"" - L is good but P is less common.
""COYER"" - but Y is less common.
""COMER"" - M is good but we already know R is in position 5.

COVER seems optimal as it tests C and V with the known pattern.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: toner -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we’ve collected the following:

1. Absolutely ruled-out letters: A, S, T, N, C, V  
2. Locked-in letters and positions:  
   – 2nd letter = O  
   – 4th letter = E  
   – 5th letter = R  
3. Still unknown positions: 1st and 3rd letters.

So the current pattern is: _ O _ E R

We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the remaining common letters that have not yet been tested (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.).

Let me list a few legal candidate words that fit _ O _ E R and only use allowed letters:

- BOWER (B, W)  
- HOMER (H, M)  
- LOWER (L, W)  
- GONER – but N is out  
- DOVER – V out  
- POWER (P, W)  
- BOXER – X is uncommon and X + B both untested, but B is more common than W or M; still, W and M are reasonable.

Among the most common remaining consonants, B and M appear frequently. “HOMER” uses H and M, both still valid; “BOWER” uses B and W. Between the two, “HOMER” is slightly more common, so I’ll go with it.

Pattern check: H O M E R  
- 1st letter = H (new)  
- 2nd letter = O (✓)  
- 3rd letter = M (new)  
- 4th letter = E (✓)  
- 5th letter = R (✓)  

No forbidden letters are used.

Guess 4: homer -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of all feedback so far:

Letters completely ruled-out:
A, C, H, M, N, S, T, V

Locked-in letters and positions:
O (2nd), E (4th), R (5th)

Current pattern: _ O _ E R

Still-valid letters (not yet shown to be absent):  
B D F G I J K L P Q U W X Y Z

We need two different letters for positions 1 and 3 from that list that form a valid English word.

Candidate words that fit _ O _ E R and use only allowed letters:

- BOWER → B, W
- JOKER → J, K
- LOWER → L, W
- POKER → P, K
- GONER → N already out
- BOXER → X possible but less common
- FOYER → F, Y

Among these, “BOWER” has very common letters (B and W) and is a legitimate word. It introduces B and W, neither of which have been ruled out.

Check: B O W E R
- B: new, allowed
- O: ✓
- W: new, allowed
- E: ✓
- R: ✓
- No forbidden letters are used.

Therefore BOWER is the best next guess.

At this point we know:

Fixed letters & positions:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

Completely eliminated letters so far: A, B, C, H, M, N, S, T, V, W

We therefore need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E R that uses only the still-possible letters for the 1st and 3rd slots. The viable consonants not yet ruled out include (among others) D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, Y, Z.

A quick scan of common English words matching _ O _ E R with no disallowed letters immediately gives:

- JOKER  (J, K)
- POKER  (P, K)
- FOYER  (F, Y)
- DOZER  (D, Z)
- GONER  (invalid – N is out)

Of these, “JOKER” is very common and tests two new high-frequency consonants (J, K). It satisfies the pattern and contains no eliminated letters.
