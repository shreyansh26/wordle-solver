For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common consonants and vowels to quickly eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""SLICE"". These words cover frequently used letters and provide good feedback. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common ending letter
- E: Most common vowel

This gives a good spread of frequently used letters across different positions.

The feedback for SLATE was all “x”, so none of those five letters (S, L, A, T, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a big chunk of common letters.  
Next, I want a word that avoids those letters entirely and still uses other frequent vowels and consonants to maximize information.  
Good letters still available include R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  
A popular second-guess pattern is to use “ROBIN” or “CHURN” style words, but since I need to skip S L A T E, I’ll pick:

- R, O, U, N, D → ROUND  
  – Contains R, O, U, N, D, none of which have been ruled out.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (from SLATE): S, L, A, T, E  
Letters that ARE in the word, at least once:
- O is in the word and currently in position 2 (✓).
- R, N, D are each in the word but in wrong positions (-).

Thus every letter of ROUND is actually in the word somewhere, but we have to rearrange them (plus any other letters still allowed).

Remaining available letters (excluding S, L, A, T, E, U):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (only vowel left besides O)

The word must contain O, R, N, D and exactly one more letter (or a repeat of one of them), for a total of five letters, with O fixed in position 2.  
Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ where the blanks are filled from {R, N, D} plus any allowed extra letter.

Let’s try to place R, N, D into positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and see if a plausible word appears.

One simple rearrangement that puts each of R, N, D into new positions:  
D O R N _  — but we need one more letter.  
D O N R _  
B O R N D — uses B, which is allowed.  
N O R D _  

Checking common English words, “BROOD” uses two O’s but we only know one O is confirmed, so that’s risky.  
“DONOR” uses D, O, N, O, R — again two O’s.

A safer single-O word: “DORIC” (but uses C and I).  
Let’s pick a word that still has single O and the three displaced letters:  
“FROND” — but F isn’t yet ruled out, and we have R, N, D plus new F.  
But we have to guess, so let’s try “FROND”.

Wait, we already know R, N, D are in the word; we just need to rearrange them around O.  
How about “DORIC”? Uses C and I, both allowed.

Actually a simpler guess is “DONOR” (but it has two O’s).  
Let me pick “FROND” because it uses F (new letter) and places R, N, D in new positions, and keeps O in position 2.

But wait, in “FROND” the O is in position 2, which is correct (✓), and we have F(new), R, N, D repositioned.

So my guess: FROND

So far we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, F

Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions):
- O must appear at least once.
- R must appear at least once.
- N must appear at least once.
- D must appear at least once.

That actually gives us four of the five letters: O, R, N, D.  
The fifth letter must be one of the letters that hasn’t been guessed or ruled out yet.  
Available letters (excluding the seven ruled out above):  
B, C, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- O is NOT in position 2 (from FROND feedback).
- R is NOT in position 2 (from ROUND) nor position 2 or 3 (from FROND).
- N is NOT in position 4 (from ROUND) nor position 4 (from FROND).
- D is NOT in position 5 (from ROUND) nor position 5 (from FROND).

Let’s put O in position 1 and see if we can make a valid word:
O _ _ _ _ must contain R, N, D plus one new letter.

Candidate: O R D N _ — needs a fifth letter; “ORDEN” isn’t a word.  
Another candidate: O R N D _ — “ORND_” doesn’t work either.

Try O in position 3 instead:
_ _ O _ _

Candidate: B R O N D — but D is already in position 5 which we know is invalid.

Try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _

Candidate: B R N O _ — “BRON_” needs a letter; “BRONK” isn’t valid.  
“BRONX” is a proper noun, but not allowed.

Try O in position 5:
_ _ _ _ O

Candidate: B R N D O — valid word “BRNDO” isn’t a real word.

Alternative: Put R in position 1:
R _ _ _ _ must contain O, N, D plus one new letter.

Candidate: R O N D _ — “RONDB” isn’t a word.  
“ROND_” isn’t valid.

Try R in position 3:

Candidate: B O N D R — valid word “BONDR” isn’t valid.

Try D in position 1:
D _ _ _ _ must contain O, R, N plus one new letter.

Candidate: D O R N _ — “DORN_” isn’t a word.  
“DRO N _” isn’t valid.

Try D in position 2:

Candidate: B D R O N — valid word “BDRON” isn’t valid.

Try D in position 3:

Candidate: B O D R N — valid word “BODRN” isn’t valid.

Try D in position 4:
_ _ _ D _

Candidate: B O N D R — D in 4 is allowed, R in 5 is allowed.  
Word: “BONDR” — not valid.

Try N in position 1:
N _ _ _ _ must contain O, R, D plus one new letter.

Candidate: N O R D _ — “NORD_” isn’t valid.

Try N in position 2:
_ N _ _ _

Candidate: B N O R D — valid word “BNORD” isn’t valid.

Try N in position 3:

Candidate: B O N R D — D in 5 invalid.

Try N in position 5:

Candidate: B O R D N — valid word “BORDN” isn’t valid.

Let’s try I as the new fifth letter and rearrange:
Possible word: D R I N O — invalid.  
B R I N O — valid word “BRINO” isn’t valid.  
C R I N O — “CRINO” isn’t valid.  
H O R N D — “HORND” isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s try C as the new letter:
Possible word: C R O N D — valid word “CROND” isn’t valid.

Try M:
M O R N D — “MORND” isn’t valid.

Try P:
P R O N D — valid word “PROND” isn’t valid.

Try G:
G R O N D — “GROND” isn’t valid.

Try H:
H O R N D — “HORND” isn’t valid.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words with O, R, N, D plus one new letter from the allowed set.

Valid English words fitting:
- D R O N E — but E is ruled out.  
- D O N O R — has two O’s; we don’t know if O repeats.  
- R O N D O — has two O’s.  
- C O R N D — invalid.  
- H O R N D — invalid.  
- B O R N D — invalid.

Actually, the only plausible valid word I see is “DONOR” (but it has two O’s).  
We don’t know if O repeats, but we have no evidence against it.

Thus, the best next guess is “DONOR” because it uses the four known letters and a double O is permissible until proven otherwise.
