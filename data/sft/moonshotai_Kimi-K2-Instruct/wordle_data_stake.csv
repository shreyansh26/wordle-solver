I'm starting a new game of Wordle with no prior feedback. My goal is to choose a 5-letter word that will help me quickly eliminate many possibilities and narrow down the correct letters. Many players use starting words with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A popular and effective strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, L, or N.

One of the most commonly recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes the vowels A and E, along with common consonants S, L, and T. Another good choice might be ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" for vowel-heavy options. However, ""SLATE"" seems balanced between vowels and consonants.

After considering a few options, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first guess to start gathering information about the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
1. Pattern: S _ A _ E
2. Letters definitely not present: L
3. Letter T appears somewhere else (not in position 4)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in 3rd place, ends with E, contains T somewhere (but not in 4th place), and does not contain L.

Possible T positions: 2 or 5. But 5 is already E, so T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word must be S T A _ E. The missing letter (position 4) must be a consonant that hasn't been eliminated (not L). Common consonants left: R, N, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""SNARE"":
- S T A _ E with T in position 2 gives S T A R E (but we need to verify T is in word somewhere)
Actually, since T must be in the word, and position 2 is the only available place, the word must be S T A _ E.

Looking at common words: ""STARE"" fits perfectly:
- S ✓ position 1
- T in position 2 (must be correct since T needs to be in word and only position 2 is available)
- A ✓ position 3
- R is new (not eliminated)
- E ✓ position 5

This satisfies all constraints.

Step-by-step deductions:

1. Positions already locked:
   - 1st letter = S
   - 3rd letter = A
   - 5th letter = E

   So the pattern is: S _ A _ E

2. Letters known to be in the word somewhere:
   - T must appear (because in Guess 1 it got “-” and in Guess 2 it got “✓” in position 2).

   Therefore T is in position 2.

   That pins the second letter as T, giving: S T A _ E

3. Letters definitely not in the word at all:
   - L (from Guess 1)
   - R (from Guess 2)

4. Only the 4th position is still open.  
   We need a consonant not yet eliminated and that makes a valid 5-letter English word of the form S T A ? E.

   Remaining common consonants (excluding L and R): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

   - STALE (but L is forbidden)  
   - STANE (old form of “stone”, uncommon)  
   - STAVE (V)  
   - STAPE (not a standard word)  

   The most common and likely candidate is STAGE.

5. Checking STAGE:
   - S T A G E  
   - Letters used: S, T, A, G, E  
   - No forbidden letters (L, R).  
   - T is correctly in position 2.

Therefore, STAGE is the logical next guess.

   - STAKE (K)  
   - STALE (but L is forbidden)  
   - STANE (old form of “stone”, uncommon)  
   - STAVE (V)  
   - STAPE (not a standard word)  

   The most common and likely candidate is STAGE.

5. Checking STAGE:
   - S T A G E  
   - Letters used: S, T, A, G, E  
   - No forbidden letters (L, R).  
   - T is correctly in position 2.

Therefore, STAGE is the logical next guess.

My goal is to choose a 5-letter word that will help me quickly eliminate many possibilities and narrow down the correct letters. Many players use starting words with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A popular and effective strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, L, or N.\n\nOne of the most commonly recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes the vowels A and E, along with common consonants S, L, and T. Another good choice might be ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"" for vowel-heavy options. However, ""SLATE"" seems balanced between vowels and consonants.\n\nAfter considering a few options, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first guess to start gathering information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- S is in position 1 (✓)\n- L is not in the word at all (x)\n- A is in position 3 (✓)\n- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is in position 5 (✓)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

From all feedback so far we know:

1. Pattern: S T A _ E  (positions 1,2,3,5 are locked)
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, R, G
3. The 4th letter must be a consonant that has not yet been ruled out.

Common consonants that remain available and can fit: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words of the form S T A ? E:

- STADE – uncommon, an old unit of length, but valid
- STAKE – fits perfectly (K is still allowed)
- STAVE – V is still allowed, but we have no info on V yet
- STANE – archaic, less likely
- STAPE – non-word
- STASE – non-word

Among these, STAKE is the most common English word and uses the consonant K, which has not been eliminated.  
So STAKE is the best next guess.
