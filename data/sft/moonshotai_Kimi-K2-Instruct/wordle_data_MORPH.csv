- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. According to letter frequency analysis in 5-letter English words:
- The most common consonants are S, T, N, R, L
- The most common vowels are E, A, O, I
- Good starting words often include a mix of these common letters

I'll choose ""STARE"" because:
1. It contains 5 distinct letters (S, T, A, R, E)
2. These are all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good vowel-consonant balance (2 vowels, 3 consonants)
4. The letter positions are varied (S and T are common first letters, A is common middle, etc.)
This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From Guess 1 (STARE) we learned:
- S, T, A, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in 4th, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Since R must appear somewhere (and the word is 5 letters), I want to:
1. Keep R but move it to a new spot.
2. Avoid the letters S, T, A, E entirely.
3. Choose new common consonants and vowels to test (likely candidates among the common letters that weren’t just eliminated).

Good remaining common consonants: N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good remaining common vowels: I, O, U.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “ROUND”:
- R (moved to position 1)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)

Current deductions:
- Still no S, T, A, E, U, N, D.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from STARE and ROUND).
- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5.
- Possible vowels left: I, Y (sometimes).
- Common consonants still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We need:
– R must be in 3, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 4 from earlier).
– O is fixed at 2.
– Need three more letters (none of S, T, A, E, U, N, D).

Let’s try “PROXY”:
- P (new consonant)
- R in position 2 would conflict with fixed O, so place R in 3.
- O at 2 (known ✓).
- X (not yet tested, but acceptable).
- Y (semi-vowel, not yet used).

But that puts R in 3, which is allowed.

Wait, we have to place R somewhere it hasn’t been yet: positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out). But 2 is O. So R must be in 3 or 5.

Alternative: “CROWN” has N which is out. “FROCK” has F, R, O, C, K but C and K are fine. But let’s try simpler.

“HORNY” is fun but Y might be risky. Let’s try “WORLD” but D is out. “WORRY” has two R’s, unlikely.

Better choice: “MORPH”:
- M, O, R, P, H – all allowed.
- O at 2 ✓.
- R in 3 (new position).
- M, P, H not yet tested.
