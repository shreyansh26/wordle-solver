For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll pick a word like ""AROSE"" which has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Alternative words could be ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice with good letter distribution.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, S, T, N, D

Letters that ARE in the word:
O (but not in position 3)
E (but not in position 5)

So every letter in TONED is ruled out except O and E, and we already knew about them.

We still need to place O and E correctly, and we have 3 unknown letters left.  
Letters still available that haven’t been ruled out include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known-in-word O and E.

Since we know O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5, we need to try a word that:
1. Uses both O and E in new positions.
2. Adds three new letters from the still-possible set.

A good pattern is to move O to the front and E to the second or third spot.  
Candidate: OCEAN – but A is already ruled out.  
Next: COBEL – uses C, O, B, E, L.  
We haven’t eliminated C, B, L yet.

Another simple and common word that satisfies the constraints: ""GLOBE"".
- Uses G, L, B (all still possible).
- Places O in position 2 and E in position 5.  
  We already know E can’t be in position 5 from the first guess, so that’s a bad idea.

Better: ""POLICE"" – too long.

""JUMBO"" – doesn’t use E.

""FOLKE"" – uses F, O, L, K, E.  
Positions: O is now in 2, E in 5. We already know E can’t be 5, so that’s bad.

""POKER"" – uses P, O, K, E, R but R is ruled out.

""LOWER"" – uses L, O, W, E, R, but R is ruled out.

From the three guesses so far we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, S, T, N, D, H, V, L

Letters that ARE in the word:
O (never in positions 1, 2, 3)
E (never in positions 2, 4, 5)

So:
O must appear in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is already taken by E in the feedback, so O must be in slot 4.  
E must appear in position 1 or 3.

Required pattern so far:
- Position 4 = O
- E is in 1 or 3
- Positions 2 and 5 are still open letters (must be from the set of letters not yet ruled out).

Valid letters left include: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus the known-in-word E and the fixed O in slot 4.

A good next choice would be a word that:
- Puts E in slot 1 and O in slot 4.
- Adds two new letters in slots 2 and 5 that haven’t been tested.

Candidate pattern: E _ _ O _
Try: E B I O X, E B I O Z → none real words.

Try: E B O O _ → not helpful.

Real word candidates with E _ _ O _:
- EBONY – but N and L are ruled out, Y is still possible.
- EGOBO – not a word.
- EMBOW – B and W are still possible.
- EPOXY – P and X and Y are still possible.

EMBOW fits all constraints:
- E in 1, M in 2, B in 3, O in 4, W in 5.
- Uses only still-valid letters.
- Gives fresh info on M, B, W.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll pick a word like ""AROSE"" which has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Alternative words could be ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid first choice with good letter distribution.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains O and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters left to play with: O, E, plus other common letters like T, N, L, C, D, I, U, etc.

I’d like a word that uses E and O in different positions, and avoids A, R, S. A common pattern is to test consonants like T, N, L with E and O.

Candidate words:
- TONED – uses O, E, T, N, D; moves O to position 2, E to 4
- ELOPE – uses O, E, L, P; but P is less common
- OLDEN – uses O, E, L, D, N; moves O to position 1, E to 4

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, S, T, N, D

Letters that ARE in the word:
O (but not in position 3)
E (but not in position 5)

So every letter in TONED is ruled out except O and E, and we already knew about them.

We still need to place O and E correctly, and we have 3 unknown letters left.  
Letters still available that haven’t been ruled out include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known-in-word O and E.

Since we know O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5, we need to try a word that:
1. Uses both O and E in new positions.
2. Adds three new letters from the still-possible set.

A good pattern is to move O to the front and E to the second or third spot.  
Candidate: OCEAN – but A is already ruled out.  
Next: COBEL – uses C, O, B, E, L.  
We haven’t eliminated C, B, L yet.

Another simple and common word that satisfies the constraints: ""GLOBE"".
- Uses G, L, B (all still possible).
- Places O in position 2 and E in position 5.  
  We already know E can’t be in position 5 from the first guess, so that’s a bad idea.

Better: ""POLICE"" – too long.

""JUMBO"" – doesn’t use E.

""FOLKE"" – uses F, O, L, K, E.  
Positions: O is now in 2, E in 5. We already know E can’t be 5, so that’s bad.

""POKER"" – uses P, O, K, E, R but R is ruled out.

""LOWER"" – uses L, O, W, E, R, but R is ruled out.

Let’s pick ""MONEY"".
- Uses M, O, N, E, Y.  
But N is already ruled out.

""VOICE"" – uses V, O, I, C, E.  
Positions: O in 2, E in 5. Again E in 5 is invalid.

""OPIUM"" – uses O, P, I, U, M. Doesn’t include E.

""EPOCH"" – uses E, P, O, C, H.  
Positions: E in 1, O in 3. O in 3 is invalid (from first guess).

""HOVEL"" – uses H, O, V, E, L.  
Positions: O in 2, E in 4. Both positions are new for O and E, and none of H, V, L have been ruled out.

From all previous feedback:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, R, S, T, N, D, H, V, L, M, B, W

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
O (never in positions 1,2,3,4 so far)  
E (never in positions 2,4,5 so far)

Since O has now appeared in positions 2,3,4 and E has appeared in 1,2,4,5, the only remaining possible positions are:
- O must be in position 5 (it’s never been allowed anywhere else).
- E must be in position 3 (the only spot never ruled out).

Therefore the word must look like: _ _ E _ O  
We still need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2 drawn from the still-untested set:  
C, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z (plus whatever vowels we haven’t ruled out besides A).

To maximize information, let’s try a simple word that fits this skeleton and introduces two fresh consonants: “CIGEO” isn’t valid.  
“FUGEO” no. “JUGEO” no.  
“PIGEO” no.  
A valid English word that matches _ _ E _ O is “GECKO”.

Check letters:
G, E, C, K, O  
- G, C, K have never been guessed or ruled out.  
- E is in correct position 3.  
- O is in correct position 5.  

This satisfies every constraint.

<guess>GECKO</guess>",GECKO,"From all previous feedback:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, R, S, T, N, D, H, V, L, M, B, W

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
O (never in positions 1,2,3,4 so far)  
E (never in positions 2,4,5 so far)

Since O has now appeared in positions 2,3,4 and E has appeared in 1,2,4,5, the only remaining possible positions are:
- O must be in position 5 (it’s never been allowed anywhere else).
- E must be in position 3 (the only spot never ruled out).

Therefore the word must look like: _ _ E _ O  
We still need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2 drawn from the still-untested set:  
C, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z (plus whatever vowels we haven’t ruled out besides A).

To maximize information, let’s try a simple word that fits this skeleton and introduces two fresh consonants: “CIGEO” isn’t valid.  
“FUGEO” no. “JUGEO” no.  
“PIGEO” no.  
A valid English word that matches _ _ E _ O is “GECKO”.

Check letters:
G, E, C, K, O  
- G, C, K have never been guessed or ruled out.  
- E is in correct position 3.  
- O is in correct position 5.  

This satisfies every constraint.",Guess 5: GECKO -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) E(✓) C(✓) K(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
