For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. A good starting word should ideally include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- Common letters: S, L, A, T, E
- Good spread of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
- Covers both ends of the alphabet and different letter positions

This gives us the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): L, A, E.

We want a word that contains L, A, and E, but avoids S and T. We also have positional constraints:
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- CRANE: has A and E, but not L.
- LEARN: has L, A, E and avoids S, T. 
  - L is in position 1 (allowed, since L was in position 2 before and must move).
  - A is in position 3. This is the same position as before, so A would get the same ""-"" feedback. Not ideal.
- ALIEN: has L, A, E and avoids S, T.
  - L is in position 2 (same as before, so will get ""-"" again). Not ideal.
- PEARL: has P, E, A, R, L. Avoids S, T.
  - E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 5 before).
  - A is in position 3 (same as before, will get ""-""). Still allows us to test other positions for L and E.
- CLEAR: has C, L, E, A, R. Avoids S, T.
  - L is in position 2 (same as before, will get ""-""). Still tests other positions for A and E.

Among these, ""PEARL"" seems best:
- Uses P (new letter), E, A, R, L.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
- A is in position 3 again (might get ""-""), but we still test L and R positions.
- Avoids S, T.

Another option: ""EQUAL"" - has E, U, A, L. But it's 5 letters and fits rules, but U is less common.

""PEARL"" is safer.

Round 2 (PEARL)

- E is in the word AND in the correct position 2.
- L is in the word AND in the correct position 5.

So we now know:
- E is in position 2.
- L is in position 5.

- Letters we can safely rule out: S, T, P, R.

- Position 5 = L
- Position 3 ≠ A (because the first feedback said A is in the word but NOT in position 3)
- Must include A somewhere in positions 1 or 4.

- DEAL? – 4 letters
- HEARL – invalid

- E is in position 2 ✓
- L is in position 5 ✓
- A is in position 3. Wait! The first feedback said A is NOT in position 3.

- HEAL? – 4 letters
- HEALD – valid word, fits _E__L
