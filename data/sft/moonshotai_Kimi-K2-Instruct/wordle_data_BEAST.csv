For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include frequently used letters without repeating any. Popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers all five major vowels (A, E, I, O, U - though I is missing, R and S are high-frequency consonants), giving us a broad initial scan of the alphabet.

- A: letter is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

Also need to avoid R and O which aren't in LEAPS.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it covers all five major vowels (A, E, I, O, U - though I is missing, R and S are high-frequency consonants), giving us a broad initial scan of the alphabet.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. It contains A and E somewhere other than their current positions (A not in 1st, E not in 5th).
3. It does not contain R or O.

Possible vowel-consonant structure: Since A and E must be present and O is out, remaining common vowels are I and U. But we might only need A and E.

Looking for a 5-letter word ending in S, containing A and E, without R or O, and with A not in first position.

Good next guess might be ""LEAPS"" or ""PEALS"" but we need to confirm what letters are left. 

Let's try ""LEAPS"" as it uses common letters and checks for E, A, L, P positions while keeping S fixed at the end.

But wait - E is in the word but not in 5th position (we know this), so putting E in 2nd is fine, A in 3rd, etc.

Also need to avoid R and O which aren't in LEAPS.

This seems like a good next probe.

AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)

Key facts:
- S must be the 5th letter (AROSE confirmed it as ✓ there, LEAPS only shows S is in the word but not necessarily in 5th place, but we already knew S is the 5th letter).  
- E is in the word and must be in position 2 (because it’s ✓ in LEAPS).  
- A is in the word and must be in position 3 (because it’s ✓ in LEAPS).  
So far: _ E A _ S  

Letters excluded: R, O, L, P.  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters for positions 1 and 4, neither of which can be any excluded letter.  
Common patterns: CH, SH, TH, WH for first letter; CK, NT, ND, ST, etc. for 4th.

A very common word that fits _ E A _ S is “BEADS”, but D is allowed.  
Another is “MEANS”, N is allowed.  
Another is “PEAKS”, but P is excluded.  
“TEACH” doesn’t fit.  
“HEAPS” – P excluded.  
“FEAST” – T in 4th: F, E, A, S, T – but T in 5th should be S, so no.  

Actually, “BEANS” fits: B, E, A, N, S.  
Let me check exclusions: B and N are not excluded.

Another is “PEAKS”, but P is excluded.  
“TEACH” doesn’t fit.  
“HEAPS” – P excluded.  
“FEAST” – T in 4th: F, E, A, S, T – but T in 5th should be S, so no.  

Actually, “BEANS” fits: B, E, A, N, S.  
Let me check exclusions: B and N are not excluded.  
Pattern: _ E A _ S → B E A N S.

So let’s guess BEANS.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAPS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x) S(-)
Guess 3: BEANS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

1. **S is the 5th letter** (from AROSE’s last letter being ✓).
2. **E is the 2nd letter** (from LEAPS’s 2nd letter being ✓).
3. **A is the 3rd letter** (from LEAPS’s 3rd letter being ✓).
4. **B is the 1st letter** (from BEANS’s 1st letter being ✓).
5. Letters eliminated so far: R, O, L, P, N.

So the word structure is: **B E A _ S**

We only need the 4th letter. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out and not used): C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English words fitting **BEA _ S**:
- BEADS
- BEAKS
- BEAMS
- BEATS

From the remaining letters (not eliminated), valid candidates include:
- **D** (BEADS)
- **K** (BEAKS)
- **M** (BEAMS)
- **T** (BEATS)

Let’s pick **BEADS** as it’s a common word and D hasn’t been used or eliminated yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: LEAPS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x) S(-)
Guess 3: BEANS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
Guess 4: BEADS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know, from the cumulative feedback:

- Position 1: B ✓  
- Position 2: E ✓  
- Position 3: A ✓  
- Position 5: S ✓ (because AROSE showed S in position 5 and no later guess contradicted that)

Only position 4 remains undetermined.
Eliminated letters for position 4 so far:  
L, P, N, D  (from LEAPS, BEANS, BEADS respectively)  
Also already excluded: R, O.

Therefore the 4th letter can be any consonant except L, P, N, D, R, O.  
Frequent remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, T, etc.

Common 5-letter words of the form B E A _ S:
BEAMS, BEAKS, BEATS, BEACH (but CH would need two letters), BEAKS is promising.

BEAKS uses K, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Let’s try BEAKS.
