For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can provide maximum information about the secret word. Ideally, it should contain common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words to maximize the chance of getting hits. Some good starting words include those with common vowels and consonants like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S) which should give good coverage for the first guess.

- It avoids R, O, S.

We still need to place A and E somewhere in positions 1–4, plus L somewhere, and we don’t yet know the 3rd letter.

- L, E, A are moved to positions 2,3,4 (none in their previous wrong positions).

Some good starting words include those with common vowels and consonants like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S) which should give good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From Guess 1: A R O S E → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n\n- The letters R, O, and S are not in the word at all (all marked with x).\n- The letters A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.\n- Does contain both A and E, but neither of them is in their current guessed positions (A is not in position 1, E is not in position 5).\n\nTo make a strong second guess, I want to:\n1. Keep A and E (since they’re confirmed to be in the word).\n2. Avoid R, O, S (since they’re confirmed not in the word).\n3.

From the latest feedback we now know:

- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are locked: _ L E A T  
- Position 1 is the only unknown.  
- Letters already ruled out: B, R, O, S, N.  
- Letters already confirmed in the word: L, E, A, T.  
- Therefore the only missing letter must be a single consonant in position 1 that hasn’t been used or ruled out yet.  

Remaining usable letters (not yet tried and not forbidden): C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple, common consonant that hasn’t appeared is “C”. Thus the word is “CLEAT”.
