For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common beginning letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good mix of common consonants and vowels, maximizing the chance of getting at least some letters correct or present in the word.

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. L is somewhere inside, but not in the 2nd position.
3. The letters S, A, T are ruled out.

I’ll look for a 5-letter word ending with E that contains L (not in the 2nd slot) and avoids S, A, T.

Candidates:
- OLDER: ends in E, contains L, avoids S/A/T. L is in 2nd slot here – but that’s disallowed.  
- ELBOW: ends in W, not E – discard.  
- FLEET: ends in T – discard.  
- CRUEL: ends in L – discard.  
- NOBLE: ends in E, contains L not in 2nd slot. This meets all constraints.

Let me double-check: N-O-B-L-E  
- Ends with E ✓  
- Contains L in 4th position (not 2nd) ✓  
- No S, A, T ✓
