2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize information gained
3. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters

Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. Good options are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are relatively common in 5-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all  
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all  
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all  
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all  
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position

Takeaways for the next guess:
- We know the word ends in E.
- We must avoid A, R, O, S.
- We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y).

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, I, U, Y, M, H, etc.

A strong second guess that meets these criteria is ""UNTIE"".  
- Ends in E (matches the known position)  
- Uses only new letters (U, N, T, I)  
- No repeats and avoids all eliminated letters  

If that doesn't yield good information, we can pivot quickly based on the new feedback.

- We must avoid: A, R, O, S, T, I

We need two middle letters that are common and have not been eliminated. Good candidates: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, F, H.

Looking at common English patterns starting with UN and ending with E, possible words include:
- UNDUE (but U is already used in position 1 and D is repeated)
- UNCLE (good, uses C and L)
- UNMET (but T is eliminated)
- UNPEG (but G is less common)
- UNFED (good, uses F and D)
