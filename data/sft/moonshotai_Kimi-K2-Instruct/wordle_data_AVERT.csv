For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these common letters and ideally have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (✓) is correct in the first position.
- R (-) is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
- O (x) is not in the word at all.
- S (x) is not in the word at all.
- E (-) is in the word, but not in position 5.

So the word starts with A, contains R and E in some other positions, and does NOT contain O or S.

I need to rearrange R and E into other positions while keeping A fixed at the start. I should avoid O and S entirely. Possible next guesses might be:
- A + _ + _ + _ + E (but E can’t be at 5, so E must be in 2-4)
- A + _ + R + _ + _ or A + _ + _ + R + _
- etc.

Good candidate words:
- ALERT (A ✓, L, E, R, T) – uses known letters and tests L/T
- ACRED (A ✓, C, R, E, D) – tests C/D
- ARENA (A ✓, R, E, N, A) – tests N, reuses A
- ARGUE (A ✓, R, G, U, E) – tests G/U
- AIDER (A ✓, I, D, E, R) – tests I/D

""ALERT"" seems like a strong choice: it keeps A in place, moves R and E to new positions, and introduces L and T which are common.

From the new feedback on ALERT:
- A ✓ – still correct in first position.
- L x – L is not in the word at all.
- E ✓ – now E is locked in position 3.
- R ✓ – now R is locked in position 4.
- T ✓ – now T is locked in position 5.

So the pattern so far: A _ E R T

The only missing letter is the second one. It must be a consonant (since the vowels A and E are already used), and it must be a letter that has not been ruled out (O, S, L are already out). Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Let’s pick a common consonant for position 2. ""D"" is a good candidate because it frequently appears in this position in English words (e.g., ""ADERT"" isn’t a word, but ""A D E R T"" could be ""ADERT"" if it were valid—but it’s not). Actually, let’s think of real 5-letter words that fit the pattern A _ E R T:
- A C E R T – not a word.
- A B E R T – no.
- A F E R T – no.
- A G E R T – no.
- A H E R T – no.
- A M E R T – no.
- A N E R T – no.
- A P E R T – no.
- A W E R T – no.
- A V E R T – yes! ""AVERT"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to turn away or prevent.
