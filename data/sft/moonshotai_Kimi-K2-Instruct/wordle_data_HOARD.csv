For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and has a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word. A common strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives good coverage of frequently used letters in English words while being a valid 5-letter word. It doesn't have any repeated letters, which maximizes the information we can get from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position
- O is in the word but in the wrong position
- S and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and O somewhere (but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain S or E

To form a new word, I need to keep A, R, and O, and add two new consonants that haven’t been ruled out. A strong next step is to move the known letters (A, R, O) to new positions and introduce two fresh consonants to test. Common unused consonants that haven’t been tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let’s try “ROTOR” – but that repeats O and R, which is inefficient.  
Let’s try “RATIO” – but that repeats A (already confirmed) and doesn’t test many new consonants.  
Instead, let’s try “CARTO” – uses C and T as new consonants. However, T is common and C is less common.  

A better word might be “TRAIN” – but that uses I and N, which are new. However, it doesn’t include O.  

Let’s try “CRANE” – but E is already ruled out.  

The best balanced word that moves A, R, O to new positions and introduces two new consonants is “CROAT” – but that’s not a valid English word.  

After reconsidering, a valid word that uses A, R, O and introduces T and N is “RATON” – but that’s also not valid.  

Finally, the valid word “RATIO” includes A, R, O, T, and I. However, it repeats A in position 2.  

A correct valid word is “RATIO” – even though A is in position 2 (which was originally position 1, now ruled out), A could still be in position 2.  

But to avoid repeating A in a position we know is wrong, let’s try “CARGO” – but G is new, and we know O is in the word.  

Another option is “RADIO” – uses D and I, moves R and A to new spots, and keeps O.  

But the simplest valid word that moves A, R, O to new positions and introduces two new consonants is “RATIO”.

Upon reflection, the best next guess is “RATIO” because it moves A to position 2 (unknown yet), R to position 1 (unknown yet), O to position 5 (unknown yet), and introduces T and I.  

However, a better choice is “CARGO” – uses C and G as new consonants, and moves A, R, O to new positions.  

But I realize “CARGO” is valid and fits the constraints. Let’s go with it.

A strong next step is to move the known letters (A, R, O) to new positions and introduce two fresh consonants to test. Common unused consonants that haven’t been tested yet include T, N, L, D, C, etc.

Let’s try “ROTOR” – but that repeats O and R, which is inefficient.  
Let’s try “RATIO” – but that repeats A (already confirmed) and doesn’t test many new consonants.  
Instead, let’s try “CARTO” – uses C and T as new consonants. However, T is common and C is less common.  

A better word might be “TRAIN” – but that uses I and N, which are new. However, it doesn’t include O.  

Let’s try “CRANE” – but E is already ruled out.  

The best balanced word that moves A, R, O to new positions and introduces two new consonants is “CROAT” – but that’s not a valid English word.  

After reconsidering, a valid word that uses A, R, O and introduces T and N is “RATON” – but that’s also not valid.  

Finally, the valid word “RATIO” includes A, R, O, T, and I. However, it repeats A in position 2.  

A correct valid word is “RATIO” – even though A is in position 2 (which was originally position 1, now ruled out), A could still be in position 2.  

But to avoid repeating A in a position we know is wrong, let’s try “CARGO” – but G is new, and we know O is in the word.  

Another option is “RADIO” – uses D and I, moves R and A to new spots, and keeps O.  

But the simplest valid word that moves A, R, O to new positions and introduces two new consonants is “RATIO”.

Upon reflection, the best next guess is “RATIO” because it moves A to position 2 (unknown yet), R to position 1 (unknown yet), O to position 5 (unknown yet), and introduces T and I.  

However, a better choice is “CARGO” – uses C and G as new consonants, and moves A, R, O to new positions.  

But I realize “CARGO” is valid and fits the constraints. Let’s go with it.The secret word contains A, R, and O (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively) and does not contain S or E. I'll try a new word using these letters and introduce fresh consonants.

Letters in the word (positions still unknown):
- A (not in 1st or 2nd position)
- R (not in 2nd or 3rd position)
- O (not in 3rd or 5th position)

Letters NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, G

So far we have three known letters that must appear somewhere (A, R, O) and four letters that we can rule out. We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O once each.
2. Places them only in positions we haven't ruled out for them.
3. Adds two new consonants (not S, E, C, G).

Possible positions left for each:
- A: can be in 3rd, 4th, or 5th
- R: can be in 1st, 4th, or 5th
- O: can be in 1st, 2nd, or 4th

Unused common consonants: T, N, L, D, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word such as “TROAD” – but D is new, and O is in 2nd (allowed), R in 3rd (invalid, ruled out).  

Next candidate: “BOARD” – uses B and D as new consonants.  
Check positions:
- B – new letter  
- O – 2nd position (allowed)  
- A – 3rd position (allowed)  
- R – 4th position (allowed)  
- D – new letter  

This fits all constraints.

This tells us:
- O is in position 2  
- A is in position 3  
- R is in position 4  
- D is in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ O A R D  

Only the first letter is unknown.
