1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common vowels in English
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage to test multiple letters at once and provide helpful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback  
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and already in the correct 2nd position.  
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.  

So far we know:
- Fixed letter: _ R _ _ _  
- Contains the letter O (somewhere other than 3rd).  
- Letters to avoid: A, S, E.  

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in the 2nd spot.  
2. Places O in one of the remaining positions (1st, 4th, or 5th).  
3. Uses new, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
4. Does not use A, S, or E.

Candidates that fit:  
- FROND (but D hasn’t been hinted yet)  
- PROUD (uses P, U, D)  
- CROOK (double O might be risky)  
- GROIN (uses G, I, N)  

Of these, “PROUD” is appealing because P, U, and D are all common and have not been tested; it places R correctly and O in the 1st position (complying with the feedback that O is not in 3rd).  

Therefore, I’ll guess “PROUD”.
