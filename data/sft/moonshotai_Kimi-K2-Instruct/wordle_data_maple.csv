For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, ideally including vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A good starting word would include a mix of these. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

What we now know from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in slot 5.  
   – A exists somewhere else, not slot 1.  
   – R, O, S are absent.

2. PLANE → P(-), L(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
   – P and L are present but in wrong positions.  
   – A is still present but not in slot 3 (so must be slot 2 or 4).  
   – N is absent.

Current constraints (slots 1-4 only, since slot 5=E):
- Slot 1: cannot be A, P, L, R, O, S, N
- Slot 2: cannot be A, P, L, R, O, S, N  (but A might actually be here)
- Slot 3: cannot be A, R, O, S, N
- Slot 4: cannot be P, L, R, O, S, N  (A is allowed here)

Letters still possibly usable across the board: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have to place:
- A somewhere in slots 2 or 4  
- P somewhere not slot 1  
- L somewhere not slot 2  

A compact word satisfying these is “CABLE”:
- C A B L E  
  – Slots: 1=C, 2=A, 3=B, 4=L, 5=E  
  – A is in slot 2 (allowed).  
  – P is not used, but we’ve already learned P; adding new letters is fine.  
  – L is in slot 4 (was in slot 2 before, so new position).

Let's summarize what we now know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is correct in slot 5.
   - A exists but is not in slot 1.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. PLANE → P(-) L(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - P exists but is not in slot 1.
   - L exists but is not in slot 2.
   - A is still present but not in slot 3 (so must be in slot 2 or 4).
   - N is absent.

3. CABLE → C(x) A(✓) B(x) L(✓) E(✓)
   - A is correctly in slot 2.
   - L is correctly in slot 4.
   - B and C are absent.

Now the word looks like: _ A _ L E
Slots:
1: cannot be A, P, L, R, O, S, N, C, B
2: A (fixed)
3: cannot be A, R, O, S, N, C, B, L
4: L (fixed)
5: E (fixed)

Letters still available for slots 1 and 3: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know P must be somewhere in the word, but it can't be in slot 1 (from PLANE feedback), and slots 2,4,5 are taken by A,L,E. So P must be in slot 3.

Thus the word must be: _ A P L E

Now for slot 1, possible letters (from remaining list): D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words ending in APLE:
- APPLE (but P is already in slot 3, so this is invalid)
- MAPLE - M A P L E - this seems valid.

Let's check:
- M is not excluded in any feedback.
- A P L E are all in correct positions based on current constraints.

So the word must be MAPLE.
