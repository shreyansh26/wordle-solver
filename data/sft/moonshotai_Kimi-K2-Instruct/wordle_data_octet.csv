This is the first guess with no prior information, so we want to choose a word that gives us maximum information by testing common vowels and consonants. A good initial strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, T, S, N, etc.

Looking at common letter distribution in 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This will help quickly identify which vowels and some consonants are present in the secret word.

Other good options include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems optimal for testing vowels and consonants together.

- Letters we know ARE in the word: O (position 1), T (position 3), E (position 4)
- We still don’t know positions 2 or 5.

O _ T E _

Possible consonant-vowel combinations for the missing 2nd and 5th letters, avoiding the excluded letters (A, R, S, U, D) and without repeating the known letters unless they are allowed in new positions.

Common choices for the 2nd position: N, L, M, I, C, Y, etc.
Common choices for the 5th position: N, L, M, Y, etc.

Current confirmed pattern:  
O _ T E _  
Letters known to be in the word: O, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, U, D, F, N  

We need a 5-letter word that
- starts with O
- has T in position 3
- has E in position 4
- avoids every excluded letter (A, R, S, U, D, F, N)

Remaining letters we can use for positions 2 and 5:
Vowels: I, O (O already used once–no rule against reuse), Y
Consonants: B, C, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking at the second letter (position 2):
Common English letters left: B, C, G, H, L, M, P, V, W

Looking at the fifth letter (position 5):
Same set plus Y.

We need actual English words that fit O _ T E _ and use only allowed letters.

None of these look like valid English words.

Let’s step back: the pattern is O _ T E _. The only common English word that fits this pattern and uses allowed letters is “OTHER” but H and R are in play. R is excluded; H is not. Let's check if OTHER can work:
- O, T, E are already confirmed in their correct positions.
- H and R are needed.
But R is excluded from the word (from AROSE feedback).

So OTHER is invalid due to R.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words that exactly fit O _ T E _ and eliminate those with excluded letters.

Searching the dictionary for O T E in positions 1, 3, 4:
Only valid candidates are:
- OHTER – invalid (R excluded)
- OTHER – invalid (R excluded)
- OLTEM – not a word
- OLTEC – not a word
- OHTEL – not a word
- OLTEL – not a word
- OHTEX – not a word
- OHTEP – not a word
- OITEY – not a word
- OITEM – not a word

Realizing something: the only common word fitting O _ T E _ seems to be “OTHER”, but R is excluded. Therefore, the next most plausible word fitting the pattern and using allowed letters is “OCTET”, but it repeats T and we already have T in position 3. However, Wordle rules allow repeated letters unless the feedback explicitly indicates otherwise. We have no evidence that T cannot be repeated.

Checking OCTET:
- O, T, E are confirmed in correct positions.
- C and T are new letters to test. C is allowed, T is known to be in the word (position 3) and re-appears in position 5. This is acceptable under Wordle rules.
- No excluded letters are used.

Thus, OCTET is a valid next guess to confirm the final letters.

Final check: O C T E T – valid English word, fits pattern, uses only allowed letters.
