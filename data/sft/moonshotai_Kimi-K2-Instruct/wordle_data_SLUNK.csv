For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us the most information. A good starting word should:
- Use common letters that appear frequently in English words.
- Include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are in the secret word.
- Avoid rare letters like X, Z, Q, or J.

Some popular starting words that meet these criteria include: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S and T (very common consonants)
- L (common consonant)
- A and E (the two most common vowels)

This should give us good information about which letters and vowels are in the word.

From the feedback for SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A, T, E are all absent.
So far we know:
1. The word starts with S and has L in the second position: S L _ _ _  
2. Letters not in the word: A, T, E.
3. We still need three more letters, none of which can be A, T, or E.

Good consonants still available: R, N, D, C, P, M, K, G, B, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, O, U, Y.

I’ll try a word that uses common remaining letters while keeping S and L fixed:
SL + _ _ _

Possible endings:
- “SLIDE” uses I and D (both still possible).
- “SLUMP” uses U, M, P.
- “SLING” uses I, N, G.

Among these, “SLIDE” seems reasonable—it introduces two new common letters I and D, neither of which we’ve ruled out, and the remaining letter E was already ruled out, but since “SLIDE” uses I and D and ends with E, we already know E is out. Let me pick something else. Actually, “SLING” uses I, N, G—none of these letters have been ruled out.

I’ll go with “SLING.”

   - N is in the word (from SLING feedback), but not in position 4 (since it didn’t get ✓ in position 4 in SLING)

So the pattern is S L _ _ _, and we know N must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, the remaining letters cannot be A, T, E, I, G.

We need three more letters (total of five letters in word, two already fixed as S and L). We have N confirmed, so we need to place N and pick two more letters (positions 3 and 5) from remaining available letters.

Available letters (excluding A, T, E, I, G): B, C, D, F, H, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, U, V, W, Y, etc. But S, L, N are already used once, and duplicates are possible unless ruled out.
