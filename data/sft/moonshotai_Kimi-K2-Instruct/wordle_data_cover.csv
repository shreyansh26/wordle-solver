For the first guess, a good strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. This helps narrow down possibilities quickly. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
This combination should provide useful feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

We now have two rounds of feedback.

1. From AROSE:
   - A and S are not in the word (x).
   - R is somewhere but not in position 2 (-).
   - O is somewhere but not in position 3 (-).
   - E is somewhere but not in position 5 (-).

2. From CRONE:
   - C is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓).
   - R is still somewhere but not in position 2 (-).
   - O is still somewhere but not in position 3 (-).
   - E is still somewhere but not in position 5 (-).
   - N is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- First letter is C (✓).
- Letters in the word: C, R, O, E (and two more unknown letters).
- Letters not in the word: A, S, N.
- Positions we still need to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5. 

We know:
- R is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

We need to place R, O, E into the remaining positions while respecting these constraints and introducing new letters. Since we have only four letters to place (positions 2-5) and we know we have R, O, E, we need one more letter. The word must contain C at position 1, then some permutation of R, O, E and one more consonant.

Let’s try a word that uses these letters in new positions:
- C is fixed at position 1.
- Let’s try to place E in position 2.
- R could fit in position 3 or 4 (but not 2, already ok).
- O could fit in position 4 or 5 (but not 3).
- We need one more consonant; let’s try a common one like D or L.

A word that fits: C _ _ E R? Or C _ O _ E? But E cannot be at 5. Let’s try CODER:
- C at 1 (✓).
- O at 2 (new position, not 3, ok).
- D is a new letter.
- E at 4 (new position, not 5, ok).
- R at 5 (new position, not 2, ok).

This places R at 5, O at 2, E at 4. This seems valid.

Or C _ O _ E? But E cannot be at 5. Let’s try CODER:\n- C at 1 (✓).\n- O at 2 (new position, not 3, ok).\n- D is a new letter.\n- E at 4 (new position, not 5, ok).\n- R at 5 (new position, not 2, ok).\n\nThis places R at 5, O at 2, E at 4.

From the latest feedback:

- C(✓) at position 1 — fixed.
- O(✓) at position 2 — fixed.
- D(x) at position 3 — D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) at position 4 — fixed.
- R(✓) at position 5 — fixed.

So we already have four letters locked in place: C _ _ E R.

The only missing letter is at position 3.  
We know the letters already present are C, O, E, R.  
We have not yet tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

The word must be CO _ ER.  
Common 5-letter words fitting CO _ ER:  
- COVER  
- COMER  
- COWER  
- COPER  
- COGER (rare)  
- COYER (rare)

Let’s pick the most common one: COVER.
