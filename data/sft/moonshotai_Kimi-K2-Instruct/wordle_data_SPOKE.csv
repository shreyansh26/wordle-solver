For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common letters in English words to maximize information gain. The goal is to identify as many correct letters as possible or eliminate many letters. Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. 

A popular first guess choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are highly likely to appear in any word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also frequent in English words

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   – A, R are NOT in the word.  
   – O is in the word and in the 3rd position (✓).  
   – S is in the word but NOT in 4th position (-).  
   – E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

2. From Guess 2 (HOUSE):
   – H is NOT in the word (x).  
   – O(-) tells us O is in the word but NOT in 3rd position.  This contradicts the earlier feedback, but since the first feedback already locked O in the 3rd position, this must be a mis-interpretation.  Actually, the feedback shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in 2nd position.  (We already know O is in 3rd position from Guess 1, so this new feedback is consistent with that.)  
   – U is NOT in the word (x).  
   – S(-) again confirms S is in the word but NOT in 4th position.  
   – E(✓) confirms E is in 5th position.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ O _ E, and S is somewhere in the word but not in 4th position.  Also, the letters A, R, H, U are out, and we still need to test other common consonants.

To maximize information, we now want to include S (which must move to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position, but 3rd is already O) and some of the yet-untested common consonants: D, L, N, T, C, W, Y, etc.

A good word that places S in 1st position and tests new consonants is “STONE”:
- S in 1st position (new spot for S).  
- T new consonant.  
- O already known in 3rd.  
- N new consonant.  
- E already known in 5th.

No forbidden letters (A, R, H, U) appear.  This should tell us if S belongs in 1st position and reveal the mystery letters in 2nd and 4th spots.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The goal is to identify as many correct letters as possible or eliminate many letters. Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. 

A popular first guess choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are highly likely to appear in any word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also frequent in English words

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on.

- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ E
2. It contains S somewhere, but NOT in 4th position (since it was - in 1st guess).
3. It does NOT contain A or R.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ O _ E, has an S not in the 4th position, and avoids A/R. A good next guess would be ""HOUSE"":
- H: new letter, good to test
- O: matches known position
- U: new vowel

1. From Guess 1 (AROSE):
   – A, R are NOT in the word.  
   – O is in the word and in the 3rd position (✓).  
   – S is in the word but NOT in 4th position (-).  
   – E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

2. From Guess 2 (HOUSE):
   – H is NOT in the word (x).  
   – O(-) tells us O is in the word but NOT in 3rd position.

   – U is NOT in the word (x).  
   – S(-) again confirms S is in the word but NOT in 4th position.  
   – E(✓) confirms E is in 5th position.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ _ O _ E, and S is somewhere in the word but not in 4th position.  Also, the letters A, R, H, U are out, and we still need to test other common consonants.

To maximize information, we now want to include S (which must move to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position, but 3rd is already O) and some of the yet-untested common consonants: D, L, N, T, C, W, Y, etc.

A good word that places S in 1st position and tests new consonants is “STONE”:
- S in 1st position (new spot for S).  
- T new consonant.  
- O already known in 3rd.  
- N new consonant.  
- E already known in 5th.

No forbidden letters (A, R, H, U) appear.  This should tell us if S belongs in 1st position and reveal the mystery letters in 2nd and 4th spots.
