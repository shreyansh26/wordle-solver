For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help gather information across several possible positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E)
2. Common consonants (like T, R, S, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This should give us good coverage to determine what letters are in the word and possibly their positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help gather information across several possible positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E)
2. Common consonants (like T, R, S, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This should give us good coverage to determine what letters are in the word and possibly their positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A (1st letter) is NOT in the word (x).
- R (2nd letter) IS in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓).
- O (3rd letter) is NOT in the word (x).
- S (4th letter) IS in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓).
- E (5th letter) is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The word has R in position 2 and S in position 4.
2. The letters A, O, E are NOT in the word.
3. We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters other than A, O, E.

Let’s choose a word that fits:
- R is fixed at position 2
- S is fixed at position 4
- Try common consonants for the remaining positions (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.)

A good candidate is ""BRISK"":
- B: possible
- R: confirmed (position 2)
- I: possible
- S: confirmed (position 4)
- K: possible

""BRISK"" uses common letters and fits the known constraints.

   - Not already ruled out (A, O, E, B, I, K)
   - Could be any of the remaining consonants or possibly U, Y.

Remaining common letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s build a word that fits the pattern: _ R _ S _

Try the consonants D, F, H, L, N, P, T, etc. in positions 1 and 3, and U or Y in position 5.

A good candidate is ""CRUST"":
- C: allowed
- R: fixed (position 2)
- U: allowed
- S: fixed (position 4)
- T: allowed

It uses common remaining letters and fits the pattern.

2. The final letter is NOT T (seen in Guess 4 feedback).  
3. All letters A, O, E, B, I, K, C have already been ruled out (x).  
4. Therefore the fifth letter must be a consonant not yet excluded.  
   Available consonants still legal: D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

5. Only one common English word matches T R U S _ with a single letter from that set:  
   T R U S H (the word “trush” is archaic, but “TRUST” was already ruled out by the last feedback).  
   The everyday word is **TRUSS**.

Check:

- Position 5: S (already known to be in the word, and allowed in position 5 because the earlier S was only confirmed in position 4).  
- All constraints satisfied.
