1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with as many of these high-frequency letters as possible, ideally avoiding repeated letters to get more unique feedback. Classic good starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or STARE. 

I'll choose ""STARE"" because it contains S, T, A, R, E - all very common letters positioned in ways that could reveal a lot about the secret word's structure.

From the feedback:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- must contain T and E somewhere, but not at positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- does NOT contain S, A, or R.

Good next guesses should re-use the known letters T and E (placed in new positions) and incorporate other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., I, N, O, L, C, D, etc.) while avoiding S, A, R.

Possible words: T and E must appear once each, not at positions 2 and 5 respectively.

Let’s list what we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, R, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose correct positions are still unknown: T, E, I, H

From the second guess EIGHT we have:
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 1.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.
- H(-) – H is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word must contain the letters T, E, I, H each exactly once and no S, A, R, G.

The only unused common letters left to fill the fifth spot are among N, O, L, C, D, U, Y, etc.

Since we have four required letters (T, E, I, H), we need one more consonant or vowel to make a valid 5-letter word. A good next step is to rearrange these four letters plus one new, common letter, trying to place each of T, E, I, H into positions they have not yet occupied.

Let’s try the word “WHITE”:
- It uses the known letters W (new), H, I, T, E.
- The letters T and E are both in new positions (T in 4, E in 5) compared to previous feedback.
- If any of these letters are correct, we’ll get more positional information.

However, we must ensure we include ONLY the known letters (T, E, I, H) plus one new letter, and form a valid 5-letter word. Another possible candidate is “ETHIC” (but C is not yet ruled out, but is okay). But since G is already ruled out, C is still possible.

But to keep it simple and stick to the known letters plus one new, let’s try “WHITE” first, as it includes W (a new letter) and tests H, I, T, E in new positions.

But wait, in Guess 1 T was in position 2 (feedback T(-)), and in Guess 2 T was in position 5 (feedback T(-)). So T cannot be in positions 2 or 5. Similarly, E cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from Guess 1: E was in position 5 (feedback E(-)), so E cannot be in position 5). So in ""WHITE"":
- W (new)
- H is in position 2 (new for H)
- I is in position 3 (new for I)
- T is in position 4 (new for T – was in 2 and 5 before, now 4)
- E is in position 5 – but E was in position 5 in Guess 1 and got (-), so E cannot be in position 5. Thus ""WHITE"" is invalid because it puts E in position 5 which we know is wrong.

Let’s try “THIEF”:
- T in position 1 (new for T – was in 2 and 5)
- H in position 2 (new for H – was in 4)
- I in position 3 (new for I – was in 2)
- E in position 4 (new for E – was in 5 and 1)
- F is a new letter (but we need to include only one new letter, and F is okay as it hasn’t been ruled out).

This seems valid and tests all known letters in new positions plus one new letter F.

So, the guess is “THIEF”.
