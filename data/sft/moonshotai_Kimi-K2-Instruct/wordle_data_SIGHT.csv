For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

After considering options like SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters in the secret word.

- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

- S is in position 1; this is allowed since only position 4 is disallowed for S.

However, I want to maximize information and avoid repeating S in the same place. I’ll pick a word that moves S to a different spot and adds other common letters.

I’ll choose “LUSTY”:

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. \n\nAfter considering options like SLATE, CRANE, or AUDIO, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.\n- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo the word does NOT contain A, R, O, E.\nIt DOES contain S somewhere other than position 4.\n\nLetters remaining to test: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.\n\nI want a new word that:\n- Uses S (and places it somewhere other than the 4th slot).\n- Avoids A, R, O, E.\n- Introduces several new common letters.\n\nA good candidate is “UNITY”:\n- U, N, I, T, Y are all still possible letters.\n- S is not included, so I’ll pick another word with S.\n\nA better candidate is “SLUMP”:\n- S, L, U, M, P – none of these are ruled out except R, O, A, E.\n- S is in position 1; this is allowed since only position 4 is disallowed for S.\n\nHowever, I want to maximize information and avoid repeating S in the same place.

Let's summarize what we know after three guesses.

Letters OUT of the word: A, R, O, E, L, U, Y, N, K  
Letters IN the word: S, T, I  
Known exact positions: S must be in position 1 (since it was marked ✓ in STINK).  
Known wrong positions: T cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 3.

So the word starts with S _ I _ _. The remaining two slots must use letters from the still-available pool (excluding the eliminated ones). Available consonants include C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, X, Z and vowels include only I (already placed) – no A, E, O, U, Y. So we have only the vowel I and need two more consonants from the remaining set.

We also know T is in the word but not in position 2. Possible positions for T are 3, 4, or 5. However position 3 is already taken by I. So T must be in position 4 or 5.

Let's try S I _ T _. We need one more consonant for position 3. Available options: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, X, Z. Let's pick a common one: M. So the word would be S I M T _, but we need a 5-letter word. That doesn't work.

Let's try S I _ _ T. Then position 3 and 4 need consonants. Possible word: S I G H T - but H is available. Let's check: S, I, G, H, T. None of the eliminated letters appear. This seems valid.

Another option: S I X T H - but X is less common and the word SIXTH is valid.

Let's choose SIGHT as our next guess.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters known OUT: A, R, O, E, L, U, Y, N, K
- Letters known IN: S (position 1), I (position 3), T (must be in 4 or 5)
- So the pattern is S _ I _ _

We need T in either position 4 or 5, and a consonant for position 2 and possibly position 4/5. The word S I G H T fits all constraints.
