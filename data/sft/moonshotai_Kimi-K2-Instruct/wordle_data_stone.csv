For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information possible. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word that combines several of these would be ideal. Some popular starting words are:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), with no repeated letters. This should give me good information about the positions of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends in E.

So far we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. The letter S is somewhere in positions 1-4 but not in position 4 (since it was marked wrong-position in position 4 of RAISE).
3. We must avoid R, A, and I entirely.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, B, F, G, H.
Common vowels left: O, U (since E is already fixed at the end and A/I are out).

A five-letter word ending in E, containing S in positions 1-3, and avoiding R, A, I could be something like:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E)
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E)
- SCONE (S, C, O, N, E)

""STONE"" uses S in position 1, T (common consonant), O (remaining common vowel), N (common consonant), and ends in E. This seems like a strong choice for maximizing information.
