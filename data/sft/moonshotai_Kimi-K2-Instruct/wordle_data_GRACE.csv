- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that's likely to give me useful information regardless of the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

Some good options would be words like:
- CRANE (using C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE because it uses very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. The vowels A and E are especially useful to test early, and C, R, N are common consonants. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and where they might be positioned.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (currently second).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (currently third).
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (currently fifth).

So the pattern so far is: _ R A _ E, with the constraint that C must appear somewhere besides the first position, and N is out.

Letters still available for the 1st and 4th positions: any except C (position 1), R, A, N, E.

I need a 5-letter word that fits _ R A _ E, contains C somewhere (not first), and uses no N.

Possible words:
- CRATE (but C is first – invalid)
- GRACE (C is 4th – valid)
- BRACE (C is 4th – valid)
- TRACE (C is 1st – invalid)

Between GRACE and BRACE, both fit the constraints. GRACE has G (common), while BRACE has B (also common). I'll pick GRACE because it tests G, which wasn't in the first guess.
