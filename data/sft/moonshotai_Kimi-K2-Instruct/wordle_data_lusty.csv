For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. A good starting word should have no repeating letters and include several of these common letters. 

Some popular starting choices include:
- AROSE (uses 5 top letters)
- SLATE
- CRANE
- RAISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - which are all among the top 10 most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word  
- R(x): R is not in the word
- O(x): O is not in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is not in the word

So we know the word contains S (but not in position 4) and does not contain A, R, O, or E.  
That eliminates many common vowels and consonants.

Next, I should pick a word that:
- Includes S somewhere other than position 4
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, D, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is ""SLING"":
- S, L, I, N, G all allowed
- S is in position 1 (different from the forbidden position 4)
- No forbidden letters

Another candidate could be ""STINK"" or ""SPUNK"" but ""SLING"" gives us a nice mix of consonants and a single vowel.

I'll go with SLING.

Let’s update what we know after both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but **not in position 1 or 4**.
   - The letters A, R, O, E are **not** in the word.

2. SLING → S(-) L(-) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - S is again marked “-” → it is in the word but **not in position 1** (consistent with earlier).
   - L is marked “-” → L is in the word but **not in position 2**.
   - I, N, G are **not** in the word.

Combining these facts:

Letters in the word so far: S and L  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, I, N, G  
Positions ruled out for S: 1 and 4  
Positions ruled out for L: 2  

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet include T, U, C, H, D, M, Y, P, B, K.

We still need three more letters (remember, the word is 5 letters). We want to place S and L while avoiding the forbidden letters and ruled-out positions.

Let’s try placing S in position 3 and L in position 5, and fill the rest with untested common letters:

Possible candidate: DUSTY  
- D, U, T, Y are all allowed.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- L is missing, so that’s no good.

Another candidate: PLUSH

Next candidate: PLUMS
