For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S
- All letters are among the most frequently used

This gives us maximum chance of hitting some letters in the secret word early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 → A _ _ _ _
- O is correct in position 3 → A _ O _ _
- E is correct in position 5 → A _ O _ E
- R is in the word but wrong position (not 2) → R must appear somewhere in positions 3,4,5 (but 3 and 5 are already O and E) → so R must be in position 4 → A _ O R E
- S is not in the word at all.

So the pattern we now have is: A _ O R E

Now we need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. The only missing letter is the second position. 

Looking for common English words that fit A _ O R E:
- ABORE is an archaic word (past tense of ""abear"") but not common
- ADORE is a common word
- AFIRE is common
- ALONE is common
- AMORE is Italian, not English
- AFORE is common

Among these, ADORE, AFIRE, ALONE, and AFORE are all valid. Let's pick one that’s most common and likely: ADORE.
