For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that are among the most common. One such word is ""RAISE"" - it has R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: wrong position (it exists but not at position 1)
- A: correct position (position 2)
- I: not in the word
- S: not in the word
- E: correct position (position 5)

So we now know:
- Word has the pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Contains an R somewhere other than position 1
- Does not contain I, S

Good next-step strategy: pick a word that keeps A in position 2, E in position 5, and tries other common letters in the remaining spots while also placing the known R in a new spot. A word like ""BARGE"" would fit, but 'G' is already not in the word (since S was marked as not in the word, and G wasn't tested, but we should try other consonants).

A better choice is ""LARGE"" - it keeps A and E in correct positions, places R in position 3 (which is now allowed), and tests L and G. However, 'G' might be risky since we have no info. Instead, ""MARGE"" would test M and R in new positions, but M isn't super common.

A more balanced choice is ""CARTE"" - it keeps A in position 2, E in position 5, moves R to position 3, and tests C and T which are common consonants. But 'T' wasn't in RAISE so it's a good test.

However, looking at common 5-letter words fitting _A_E, ""MADRE"" might work - but it's less common. A commoner word is ""PARGE"" but G is uncertain.

After reconsidering, ""CARTE"" seems strong - it maximizes common letters while respecting known constraints (A at 2, E at 5, R exists but not at 1, no S/I).

Wait, let me check: CARTE would test C, A (known), R (known exists), T, E (known). This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- R: ✓ in position 3

So the secret word is C A R _ E and we only have to find the missing 4th letter.  
Letters still unused and that haven’t been ruled out by any feedback include B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Among these, common letters that often appear in the 4th position of five-letter words ending in E include B, D, G, L, M, N, P.

C A R B E  
C A R D E  
C A R G E  
C A R L E  
C A R M E  
C A R N E  
C A R P E  

All are valid English words. Let’s pick the one that feels most common and balanced: CARLE is a variant spelling, CARGE is obscure, CARNE is Spanish for meat, CARPE is Latin (carpe diem). Between CARBE, CARDE, CARME – none are standard words. The only everyday word in the list is actually C A R V E.
