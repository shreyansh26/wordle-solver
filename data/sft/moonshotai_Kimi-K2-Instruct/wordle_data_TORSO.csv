For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should use several of these letters to help eliminate possibilities. 

Popular starting words include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ""SLATE"" (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers five of the most common letters and includes both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (✓) – S is in position 4.
- E (x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Position 4 is S.
- R and O must appear somewhere in the other four positions (but not where they were in AROSE).
- Letters A and E are eliminated.

Letters left to place: R, O, plus other common consonants/vowels (T, N, I, L, C, etc.)

I want a word that:
1. Keeps S in position 4.
2. Uses R and O in new positions.
3. Avoids A and E.
4. Introduces new common letters to gather more info.

A strong next guess would be ""TORSI"":
- T (new letter)
- O (must be here or 1/5)
- R (must be here or 1/5)
- S (fixed in 4)
- I (new vowel)

1. Position 1 = T (✓)  
2. Position 2 = O (✓)  
3. Position 3 = R (✓)  
4. Position 4 = S (✓)

We already know the word does NOT contain A, E, or I (all x-marked).  
Remaining frequent consonants to test for position 5: K, L, N, M, H, D, Y, etc.

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words that are T O R S _ gives “TORSK”, but TORSK is uncommon.  
Another good candidate is “TORSH”, but that’s also rare.  
The most common English word that fits the pattern T O R S _ is “TORSI”, but we’ve already tried that and I was rejected.

So next simplest reasonable letter is K, giving “TORSK”.

However, since the puzzle seems to want the *exact* 5-letter English word, and given the feedback pattern, the intended word may instead be “TORSE” (but E is already ruled out), or “TORSO”. Let’s check “TORSO”:

- T O R S O: uses O twice, but second O is in position 5.  
Letters used so far: A(x), R(-→✓), O(-→✓), S(✓), E(x), T(✓), I(x).  
O is allowed to appear twice; it’s not ruled out.

Common English word: “TORSO”.
