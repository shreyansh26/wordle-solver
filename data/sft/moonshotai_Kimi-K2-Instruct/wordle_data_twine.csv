For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good starting word should contain several of these. Common choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""STARE"" because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, R). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possible words.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S, A, R are not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

So we now know:
- The word ends in E.
- T is somewhere in positions 1-4.
- No S, A, or R.

A good next guess should include T (in a new position) and try other common letters not yet ruled out. Common consonants remaining: N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F. Vowels remaining: I, O, U (since A is out, E is fixed in position 5).

Let’s try a word that places T in a new spot and uses other common letters. ""OINTE"" isn’t valid (no O in position 2). ""UNTIE"" has T in position 4, which is new. ""UNTIE"" also uses I and N, common letters.

Another option: ""THINE"" – but H is less common. ""PLATE"" – but A is already out. ""ELITE"" – but we don’t know about L/I yet. 

""UNTIE"" seems good: T in position 4, uses I and N.

From the two guesses we have:

1. STARE → E ✓ in position 5, T – somewhere else, S, A, R x.
2. UNTIE → E ✓ in position 5 again, U x, N – somewhere else, T – somewhere else, I – somewhere else.

So far we know:
- Last letter is E.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, R, U.
- Letters IN the word but position unknown: T, N, I.
- No duplicates of these letters in positions we’ve tried.

Possible slots for T, N, I are positions 1-4 (since 5 is E).

A good third guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Re-use T, N, I but in new slots.
- Add new common consonants not yet tried (like L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.).

Let’s try a word like TONER: but R is already out, and O hasn’t been tested yet. Alternatively, ""INLET"": but L hasn’t been used, and it uses I, N in new spots.

But we need to make sure we’re using T, N, I. 

Another approach: since T, N, I must be in the word, let’s try a word that arranges them with a new consonant and keeps E at the end.

Consider ""TINE?"" – but needs to be 5 letters ending in E. ""TINKE"" isn’t a word. ""MINCE"" – but M, C, E are new, and we have N, but not I or T.

Better: ""CITED"" – but E is at position 4 here, not 5. We need E at 5.

Let’s try ""NITRE"" – but R is already out. ""INTEL"" – L is new, but E is not at position 5. 

Wait, we need to keep E at position 5. So words like:
- _ _ _ _ E, using T, N, I in positions 1-4.

Possible word: ""INNER"" – but R is out. ""NIECE"" – but C is new, and uses I, N, E at 5.

""NIECE"" uses N, I, C, E. But we need T in the word. So this misses T.

Alternative: ""TINED"" – but D is new, and uses T, I, N, E at 5. But ""TINED"" is a valid word (past tense of tine).

But let’s check: T, I, N, E in TINED: positions 1, 3, 4, 5. This covers T, I, N, E. 

But we need to confirm ""TINED"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""tined"" is valid (having tines).

So I will guess TINED.

But wait – D is new, and we’re testing T, I, N in new positions. 

However, let’s think of another possibility: ""TIGNE"" – but G is new, and uses T, I, N, E at 5. But ""TIGNE"" isn’t a word.

Another word: ""TWINE"" – W is new, and uses T, W, I, N, E. But W hasn’t been used, and this covers T, I, N, E.

""TWINE"" is valid and uses T, W, I, N, E with E at 5. T, I, N are in new spots.

This seems better.

Therefore, I choose TWINE.
