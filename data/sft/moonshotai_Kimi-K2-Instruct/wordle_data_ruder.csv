For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with the letters:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

However, another highly recommended word is ""AROSE"" as it contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). But since we can only guess one word at a time, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly better for narrowing down consonants early.

Another strong contender is ""CRANE"" which has good letter coverage, but ""SLATE"" feels more balanced.

After reconsidering, ""AROSE"" might actually be better for first guess because it covers three vowels and two very common consonants (R, S), giving more immediate feedback on vowel positions.

But since we need to pick one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Round 1 – AROSE

Round 2 – NERDY

What we know so far:
- Letters definitely **not** in the word: A, O, S, N, Y, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E (each appears at least once, positions still flexible)  
- Therefore the hidden word contains both R and E (and possibly others), but not any of AOSNYD.

We need a new guess that:
1. Uses R and E somewhere other than the positions already ruled out:  
   – R cannot be in 3rd position (from both guesses)  
   – E cannot be in 2nd or 5th position (from both guesses)  
2. Introduces several new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
   Remaining common letters include T, L, I, C, H, M, U, etc.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that obeys:
- Must contain both R and E.  
- R must not be in 3rd position.  
- E must not be in 2nd or 5th position.  
- Must not contain A, O, S, N, Y, D.

A quick scan of possible patterns:

Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for R: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

A good candidate is “UTTER”:
- Contains both R and E.  
- U, T are fresh letters.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  
- No banned letters.

Another candidate is “ETHER”, but E in position 2 is disallowed.  
“TRITE” repeats T and has E in 5, which is disallowed.  
“CRUEL” lacks R in a valid spot and has no E.

“UTTER” fits all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

2. NERDY → N(x) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x)
   - Confirms E and R are in the word, but not in positions 2, 3 (for R), or 5 (for E).

3. UTTER → U(-) T(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - R is confirmed in position 5.
   - T is not in the word (both instances marked x).
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.

So now we know:
- The word ends in -ER (positions 4=E, 5=R).
- U is somewhere in the word but not at the start.
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, Y, D, T.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we need common ones.

Possible word structure: _ _ _ E R, with U in positions 2 or 3.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in -ER with U in them:
- LUGER: L, U, G, E, R – fits pattern _ U _ E R, but we don't know about G or L yet.
- SUPER: S is already excluded.
- PURER: P, U, R, E, R – but R is already in position 5, and we have it confirmed there, so this might have redundant info.
- MUGGER: too long.
- CUBER: C, U, B, E, R – fits _ U _ E R.

Between LUGER and CUBER, both fit the current constraints. Let's check:
- LUGER: L and G are new letters.
- CUBER: C and B are new letters.

Both are valid, but CUBER introduces C and B, which are common and haven't been tested yet.

Another check: any other U-containing -ER words?
- FLUER: but FLUER isn't a common word (and F and L are new).
- PUKER: P, U, K, E, R – but K is less common than C or L.

Between CUBER and LUGER, CUBER seems slightly better as it tests C and B.

But wait, the word structure must be _ _ _ E R with U in position 2 or 3.

Let's list possible words:
- _ U _ E R: CUBER, LUGER, MUGER (not common), TUBER (T is out), FUBER (not a word).
- _ _ U E R: CRUEL (but ends in EL, not ER), GRUEL (ends in EL), etc. – none fit.

So the only realistic patterns are:
- C U B E R
- L U G E R

Between these, CUBER seems slightly better for letter coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBER.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with the letters:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

However, another highly recommended word is ""AROSE"" as it contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). But since we can only guess one word at a time, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly better for narrowing down consonants early.

Another strong contender is ""CRANE"" which has good letter coverage, but ""SLATE"" feels more balanced.

After reconsidering, ""AROSE"" might actually be better for first guess because it covers three vowels and two very common consonants (R, S), giving more immediate feedback on vowel positions.

But since we need to pick one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

So we know:

- Letters we must use somewhere: R, E (and they are not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

3. Avoid A, O, S.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,ruder,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with the letters:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

However, another highly recommended word is ""AROSE"" as it contains all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S). But since we can only guess one word at a time, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's slightly better for narrowing down consonants early.

Another strong contender is ""CRANE"" which has good letter coverage, but ""SLATE"" feels more balanced.

After reconsidering, ""AROSE"" might actually be better for first guess because it covers three vowels and two very common consonants (R, S), giving more immediate feedback on vowel positions.

But since we need to pick one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S.
- Letters we must use somewhere: R, E (and they are not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R and E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) to test quickly.
3. Avoid A, O, S.

Possible pattern: _ R _ _ E won’t work because E can’t be last.
Try E in position 1 or 3 early.

Let’s pick a word like “TIRED”:
- T, I, D are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 → but feedback says E is not in position 5. This is invalid.

Next choice: “NERDY”:
- N, D, Y are new.
- E in position 2, R in position 3 – both positions are allowed for E and R. 
- No A, O, S. 

“NERDY” satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: NERDY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(x)  R(-)  O(x)  S(x)  E(-)

Round 2 – NERDY  
N(x)  E(-)  R(-)  D(-)  Y(x)

What we know so far:
- Letters definitely **not** in the word: A, O, S, N, Y, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E (each appears at least once, positions still flexible)  
- Therefore the hidden word contains both R and E (and possibly others), but not any of AOSNYD.

We need a new guess that:
1. Uses R and E somewhere other than the positions already ruled out:  
   – R cannot be in 3rd position (from both guesses)  
   – E cannot be in 2nd or 5th position (from both guesses)  
2. Introduces several new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
   Remaining common letters include T, L, I, C, H, M, U, etc.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that obeys:
- Must contain both R and E.  
- R must not be in 3rd position.  
- E must not be in 2nd or 5th position.  
- Must not contain A, O, S, N, Y, D.

A quick scan of possible patterns:

Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for R: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)

A good candidate is “UTTER”:
- Contains both R and E.  
- U, T are fresh letters.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  
- No banned letters.

Another candidate is “ETHER”, but E in position 2 is disallowed.  
“TRITE” repeats T and has E in 5, which is disallowed.  
“CRUEL” lacks R in a valid spot and has no E.

“UTTER” fits all constraints.

Guess 2: NERDY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: UTTER -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

2. NERDY → N(x) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x)
   - Confirms E and R are in the word, but not in positions 2, 3 (for R), or 5 (for E).

3. UTTER → U(-) T(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - R is confirmed in position 5.
   - T is not in the word (both instances marked x).
   - U is in the word but not in position 1.

So now we know:
- The word ends in -ER (positions 4=E, 5=R).
- U is somewhere in the word but not at the start.
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, Y, D, T.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we need common ones.

Possible word structure: _ _ _ E R, with U in positions 2 or 3.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in -ER with U in them:
- LUGER: L, U, G, E, R – fits pattern _ U _ E R, but we don't know about G or L yet.
- SUPER: S is already excluded.
- PURER: P, U, R, E, R – but R is already in position 5, and we have it confirmed there, so this might have redundant info.
- MUGGER: too long.
- CUBER: C, U, B, E, R – fits _ U _ E R.

Between LUGER and CUBER, both fit the current constraints. Let's check:
- LUGER: L and G are new letters.
- CUBER: C and B are new letters.

Both are valid, but CUBER introduces C and B, which are common and haven't been tested yet.

Another check: any other U-containing -ER words?
- FLUER: but FLUER isn't a common word (and F and L are new).
- PUKER: P, U, K, E, R – but K is less common than C or L.

Between CUBER and LUGER, CUBER seems slightly better as it tests C and B.

But wait, the word structure must be _ _ _ E R with U in position 2 or 3.

Let's list possible words:
- _ U _ E R: CUBER, LUGER, MUGER (not common), TUBER (T is out), FUBER (not a word).
- _ _ U E R: CRUEL (but ends in EL, not ER), GRUEL (ends in EL), etc. – none fit.

So the only realistic patterns are:
- C U B E R
- L U G E R

Between these, CUBER seems slightly better for letter coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBER.

Let's check:\n- LUGER: L and G are new letters.\n- CUBER: C and B are new letters.\n\nBoth are valid, but CUBER introduces C and B, which are common and haven't been tested yet.\n\nAnother check: any other U-containing -ER words?\n- FLUER: but FLUER isn't a common word (and F and L are new).\n- PUKER: P, U, K, E, R – but K is less common than C or L.\n\nBetween CUBER and LUGER, CUBER seems slightly better as it tests C and B.\n\nBut wait, the word structure must be _ _ _ E R with U in position 2 or 3.\n\nLet's list possible words:\n- _ U _ E R: CUBER, LUGER, MUGER (not common), TUBER (T is out), FUBER (not a word).\n- _ _ U E R: CRUEL (but ends in EL, not ER), GRUEL (ends in EL), etc. – none fit.\n\nSo the only realistic patterns are:\n- C U B E R\n- L U G E R\n\nBetween these, CUBER seems slightly better for letter coverage.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is CUBER.\n\n<guess>CUBER</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: NERDY -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) R(-) D(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: UTTER -> FEEDBACK: U(-) T(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: CUBER -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the four rounds we now know exactly:\n\nPattern: _ U _ E R  \n- E is fixed in position 4.  \n- R is fixed in position 5.  \n- U is fixed in position 2.  \nLetters already ruled out: A, O, S, N, Y, D, T, C, B (plus any others from earlier).\n\nThe word has the form  \n  1  2  3  4  5  \n  ?

Current confirmed facts:
- Word ends in “-UGER” is impossible because G was marked (x) in position 3.
- The only remaining pattern we haven’t contradicted is _ U _ E R with positions 1 & 3 still open among untested consonants.

List of already-eliminated letters:
A, O, S, N, Y, D, T, C, B, H, G

Common consonants not yet tried: L, M, P, V, F, K, W, etc.

Possible real words:
– L U _ E R → “LURER” (but R already used, and double R would show ✓ twice)  
– M U _ E R → “MUSER” (S already eliminated)  
– P U _ E R → “PURER” (R already in 5)  
– V U _ E R → no common word  
– F U _ E R → “FURER” (not common)  
– L U C E R (C eliminated)

Only ordinary word left is “LURER”.

(Note: “LURER” is valid: comparative of “lure,” meaning “more lure-like” in poetic or archaic use, and accepted in Scrabble dictionaries.)
