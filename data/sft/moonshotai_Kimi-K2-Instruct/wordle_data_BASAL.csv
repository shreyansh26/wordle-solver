When making a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. The best starting words typically have a good mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because:
1. It contains three vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
2. It includes very common consonants (C, R, N) that appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It has a good balance of letters that can eliminate many possibilities based on the feedback

This should provide substantial information regardless of the secret word.

- A - → A is in the word but **not** in position 3.
- N x → N is **not** in the word.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

2. STOMA → S(-) T(x) O(x) M(x) A(-)
   - Letters not in the word: T, O, M (also re-confirms C, R, N, E are out)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 5

So the secret word:
- Contains A (not in positions 3 or 5) ⇒ A must be in position 1, 2, or 4
- Contains S (not in position 1) ⇒ S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, O, M

Remaining common letters that are allowed: S (already known), A (already known), plus B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and S
- A is in position 1, 2, or 4
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not both A and S in 2 or 4 simultaneously)

Good candidate: ""SALAD"" - but L and D are allowed, and it places A in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 (not allowed, since S cannot be in position 1). So SALAD is invalid.

Another candidate: ""HAPAS"" - but P is allowed (not in forbidden list), A in position 2 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). However, ""HAPAS"" is not a common English word and may not be valid.

Better common word: ""FASAD"" - but this is a less common spelling of ""facade"" and may not be accepted.

Another common word: ""BASAL"" - A is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 2 (but A is already there), so conflict.

Wait, let's think more systematically:

We know:
- A must be at 1, 2, or 4
- S must be at 2, 3, 4, or 5
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, T, O, M

Good structure might be to put A in position 1 or 2, and S in a later position.

Try ""A"" + S + ... or ""S"" + A + ... but S cannot be in position 1.

Let's try ""A"" in position 1: A _ _ _ _
- Then S must be in 2,3,4, or 5
- Possible: A S _ _ _, A _ S _ _, A _ _ S _, A _ _ _ S

Looking for common words:
- A S P I D (but P is allowed, D is allowed, I is allowed) - but this is not a common English word
- A S H E D - but E is forbidden
- A S H E S - E is forbidden
- A S S E T - E is forbidden
- A S I D E - E is forbidden
- A S K E D - E is forbidden
- A S K E R - E is forbidden
- A S H Y L - not a word

Try A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- S must be in 3,4, or 5
- Possible: B A S _ _, D A S _ _, F A S _ _, G A S _ _, etc.

Common words:
- B A S A L - A is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), L is allowed
- B A S I L - I is allowed, L is allowed
- B A S A L seems good - let's check if it fits all constraints:
   - Letters: B, A, S, A, L
   - No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, T, O, M) - correct
   - A is in position 2 (not 3 or 5) - correct
   - S is in position 3 (not 1) - correct

""BASAL"" seems like a strong candidate.

Based on the feedback:
