For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives a good spread of common letters and positions that can provide maximum information gain for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.  
- A(✓) – A is in the word AND is in the 3rd position.  
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.  
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word has an A in spot 3.  
- It contains L and E somewhere except positions 2 and 5 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain S or T.  

A good next word would use remaining common letters while placing A correctly, and probing new consonants and vowels. The word “CLEAR” is promising because:
- C, R are new letters.  
- L is reused but moved away from position 2.  
- E is reused but moved away from position 5.  
- A stays fixed in position 3.

That should give more information about the remaining letters and positions.

   - R is NOT in position 5 (from CLEAR)
3. Letters S, T, C are NOT in the word at all.

Since L, E, R must appear somewhere else, and we still need to fill 4 unknown positions, a good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3
- Place L, E, R in new possible positions
- Include new common letters to narrow down possibilities

- R can be tested in position 1

Let’s list everything we now know:

Known letters and positions:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- E is in the word and is in position 2.

Known letters but unknown positions:
- L: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from SLATE, CLEAR, REALM)
- R: cannot be in positions 1, 5 (from CLEAR, REALM)

Forbidden letters: S, T, C, M

Undetermined positions: 1, 4, 5  
Undetermined letters among L and R must appear exactly once each in the remaining slots, plus any new letters we haven’t tried yet.

Possible positions so far:
1: not R, not L (L already excluded from 1 by REALM feedback)
2: E (fixed)
3: A (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

So L can only be in position 5 (since 1,2,3,4 are all excluded).  
R must appear once and is only allowed in position 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded).

Therefore the pattern must be: _ E A R L

The only remaining letter to determine is position 1. We have not yet tested common consonants like B, D, F, G, H, etc.

A quick check of common 5-letter words matching “?EARL” gives a short list: BEARL (invalid), DEARL (invalid), HEARL (invalid), PEARL is a valid word.

So the most likely word is PEARL.

All forced placements now give us the pattern ? E A R L. The only common word fitting is PEARL.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter and consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives a good spread of common letters and positions that can provide maximum information gain for subsequent guesses.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.  
- A(✓) – A is in the word AND is in the 3rd position.  
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.  
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word has an A in spot 3.  
- It contains L and E somewhere except positions 2 and 5 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain S or T.  

A good next word would use remaining common letters while placing A correctly, and probing new consonants and vowels. The word “CLEAR” is promising because:
- C, R are new letters.  
- L is reused but moved away from position 2.  
- E is reused but moved away from position 5.  
- A stays fixed in position 3.

That should give more information about the remaining letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CLEAR -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

1. Position 3 is A (from SLATE).
2. Letters L, E, R are all in the word but NOT in the positions we placed them:
   - L is NOT in position 2 (from SLATE) and also NOT in position 1 (from CLEAR)
   - E is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE) and also NOT in position 3 (from CLEAR)
   - R is NOT in position 5 (from CLEAR)
3. Letters S, T, C are NOT in the word at all.

Since L, E, R must appear somewhere else, and we still need to fill 4 unknown positions, a good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3
- Place L, E, R in new possible positions
- Include new common letters to narrow down possibilities

One good candidate is ""REALM"" because:
- R can be tested in position 1
- E can be tested in position 2
- A stays in position 3 (known correct)
- L can be tested in position 4
- M is a new common consonant to test

This gives us maximum information about the positions of R, E, and L while testing a new letter.

Possible positions so far:
1: not R, not L (L already excluded from 1 by REALM feedback)
