For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and frequently used consonants like R, T, L, N, S. A good balance is to pick a word that covers a mix of these without repeating letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.

- The word has the form ? R ? ? ?.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Position 2 is R.
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)
   - R at position 2 remains correct.
   - A, I, N are all correct letters and are in the exact positions shown: positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.
   - T is not in the word.

Putting this together, positions 2–5 are now fixed: R, A, I, N.  
The only unknown is position 1.  

So the word must be _ R A I N.

We need a 5-letter English word with this pattern. Common first letters that make valid 5-letter words before “RAIN” include:

- T → TRAIN (already eliminated because T came back as ‘x’)
- B → BRAIN
- D → DRAIN
- P → PRAIN (not a valid word)
- C → CRAIN (also not valid; “CRANE” was considered but we know E is out)

Among these, “GRAIN”, “BRAIN”, and “DRAIN” are valid.  
Looking at letters we have not yet tested:
- We have not tested B, D, G yet (none appeared in AROSE or TRAIN).

But wait! We already have the entire word pattern _RAIN with positions 2-5 locked in and only position 1 missing. Testing GRAIN would confirm G, but we can actually directly deduce the word by filling in position 1 with the remaining valid letter.

Since T is invalid (from TRAIN feedback), and we have not tested G, B, or D, we can try one.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and frequently used consonants like R, T, L, N, S. A good balance is to pick a word that covers a mix of these without repeating letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first choice because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has the form ? R ? ? ?.
- No O, S, or E anywhere.
- A exists somewhere other than position 1.
- Other letters to still test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we know A is present but not in position 1, and we confirmed R in position 2, we need a word that:
- Has A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

A good next guess would be ""TRAIN"":
- T: common consonant we haven't tested yet.
- R: stays in position 2.
- A: placed in position 3 (since we know A is somewhere but not position 1).
- I: another common vowel not yet tested.
- N: common consonant.

This tests new letters efficiently while respecting the constraints from feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Position 2 is R.
   - A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 1.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(✓) N(✓)
   - R at position 2 remains correct.
   - A, I, N are all correct letters and are in the exact positions shown: positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.
   - T is not in the word.

Putting this together, positions 2–5 are now fixed: R, A, I, N.  
The only unknown is position 1.  

So the word must be _ R A I N.

We need a 5-letter English word with this pattern. Common first letters that make valid 5-letter words before “RAIN” include:
- G → GRAIN
- T → TRAIN (already eliminated because T came back as ‘x’)
- B → BRAIN
- D → DRAIN
- P → PRAIN (not a valid word)
- C → CRAIN (also not valid; “CRANE” was considered but we know E is out)

Among these, “GRAIN”, “BRAIN”, and “DRAIN” are valid.  
Looking at letters we have not yet tested:
- We have not tested B, D, G yet (none appeared in AROSE or TRAIN).

Any of GRAIN, BRAIN, or DRAIN would fit the pattern.  
Let’s pick “GRAIN” as our next guess because:
- G has not been used.
- GRAIN is a common word.

But wait! We already have the entire word pattern _RAIN with positions 2-5 locked in and only position 1 missing. Testing GRAIN would confirm G, but we can actually directly deduce the word by filling in position 1 with the remaining valid letter.

Since T is invalid (from TRAIN feedback), and we have not tested G, B, or D, we can try one.

Let me choose BRAIN as the guess, since it’s a common word and B hasn’t been tested yet.
