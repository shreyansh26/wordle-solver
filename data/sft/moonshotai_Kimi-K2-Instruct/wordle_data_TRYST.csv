For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. Good letter distribution to test multiple possibilities

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English
- It can quickly give information about vowel placement and common consonants

Current facts:
- Position 2 = R (✓ from both guesses)

We have the pattern: T R _ _ _

Let’s try “TRUST”:
- Fits T R _ _ _
- Puts S into position 4 (a new slot)
- Introduces U as a new vowel in position 3
- Introduces a second U, but that’s not strictly necessary; better to make a word that tests another consonant. 

Actually, let’s pick “TRUSS”:
- Keeps T R _ _ _
- Places S in both positions 3 and 5. Since we know S must appear exactly once, this is wasteful.

- T R _ _ _ fixed
- Tests C and K (both new consonants)
- Puts U in position 3
- S is not present; that’s okay because we’re now confident S must be in position 4 (since position 5 is out).

“TRUST” – best available, despite second T.

But TRUST:
- T (✓ already)
- R (✓ already)
- U (new vowel)
- S (moves to position 4)
- T (redundant)

Confirming S in 4 and testing U is valuable. Let’s go with “TRUST”.

Let’s summarize what the three guesses have told us.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – R is fixed in position 2.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. TRIMS → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – T is fixed in position 1.  
   – S is still not in position 4 (now also not in position 5).  
   – Therefore S must be in position 3.

3. TRUST → T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)  
   – Confirms position 1 = T, position 2 = R, position 4 = S, position 5 = T.  
   – So the pattern is now T R S _ T.

Only position 4 is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, I, M, U.  
Valid remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, W, Y.

A real English word that fits T R S _ T is “TRUST” → but U was ruled out and we already tried it.  
Other possibilities:  
- TRSBT – invalid  
- TRSCT – invalid  
- TRSDT – invalid  
- TRSET – invalid (E ruled out)  
- TRSFT – invalid  
- TRSGT – invalid  
- TRSHT – invalid  
- TRSKT – invalid  
- TRSLT – invalid  
- TRSNT – invalid  
- TRSPT – invalid  
- TRSWT – invalid  
- TRSYT – invalid  

Wait—only legitimate 5-letter word with pattern TRS_T is “TRUST”, but we used it and the U was rejected. This means the mystery word must be “TRS_T” with a letter we have not yet tried in position 4.

The only remaining common consonant that makes a valid English word is “TRUST” again, but we’ve exhausted that. Rechecking the English lexicon, the only real word matching T R S _ T is “TRUST”, which we already eliminated because U was rejected.

But the feedback on TRUST was:  
T(✓) R(✓) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)  
This shows S is confirmed in position 4, not 3. My earlier deduction that S must be in 3 was wrong.  
Let me re-express the facts:

1. AROSE → R(✓) in position 2, S(-) not in position 4.  
2. TRIMS → T(✓) in position 1, S(-) not in position 5.  
3. TRUST → S(✓) in position 4, T(✓) in position 5.

So now we have:
Position 1: T  
Position 2: R  
Position 4: S  
Position 5: T  

Only position 3 is unknown.  
Pattern: T R _ S T  

Known ruled-out letters for position 3: A, O, E, I, U, M.  
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, W, Y.

- TRBST – invalid

- TRLST – invalid
