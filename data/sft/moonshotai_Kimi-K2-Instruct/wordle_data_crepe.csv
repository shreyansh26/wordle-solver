Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. I'll choose a word with multiple common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

So far:
- Position 2 is R (✓ in both guesses).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.
- Letters ruled out: A, O, S, U, I, N.

Therefore:
- Word template: _ R _ _ _
- E must be in position 1 or 3 (only two unused spots left for E).
- We still need to test other common consonants (T, L, C, H, D, etc.) and the remaining vowel Y (since A, O, U, I are out).

Let’s choose a word that places E in position 3 and introduces the very common letters T and L:
- Position 1: try a high-frequency consonant like T.
- Position 3: E.
- Positions 4-5: try two more common consonants, say L and D.

T R E L D → “TRELD” isn’t a valid English word.
Instead, a valid 5-letter word that fits _ R E _ _ and uses common letters is “TREAD”.
- T: new consonant, position 1.
- R: already confirmed position 2.
- E: position 3 (new spot).
- A and D: A was already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next idea: place E in position 1 and test consonants after R.
Valid English word with E first, R second: “ERUPT” – but we already know U is out.

Instead, place E in position 3 and test consonants around it.
A valid word: “CREPT” – but P hasn’t been tested yet and C is common.
But we know P hasn’t been ruled out and neither has C.

However, we have to ensure letters are not already eliminated: P, C, T are all still possible.
So let’s try “CREPT”.

Word structure:
- C (new consonant)
- R (✓)
- E (moved to position 3)
- P (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.

So we know:

Let’s choose a word that places E in position 3 and introduces the very common letters T and L:
- Position 1: try a high-frequency consonant like T.

T R E L D → “TRELD” isn’t a valid English word.

- T: new consonant, position 1.
- R: already confirmed position 2.
- E: position 3 (new spot).
- A and D: A was already ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next idea: place E in position 1 and test consonants after R.

But:
- CREED → ends with D (allowed) but has two D’s not yet hinted at.  
- CREEK → ends with K (allowed).  
- CREEL → ends with L (allowed).  
- CREEP → ends with P again (but P is already known in 4th place, so 5th P unlikely since no double P feedback).

Among these, the most common English word ending with a still-allowed letter is **CREEK**.

Let me check: C R E E K  
All letters allowed (E can appear twice), and K hasn’t been ruled out.

From the feedback:

- C R E P _ is fixed in positions 1-4  
- The 5th letter is not T, Y, or K  
- The previous guess CREEK showed the second E in position 5 is in the word but *wrong position* — so E must appear elsewhere in the word besides position 5, but we already have E in position 3. This implies the word must have another E, but positions 1-4 are already set as C R E P, so the only remaining slot is position 5.

However, the feedback from CREEK says E in position 5 is in the word but wrong position — meaning E must appear in the word but not at position 5. Since positions 1-3 are C, R, E, the only possible new position for E is position 4. But position 4 is P, which is confirmed correct.

This contradiction indicates a misinterpretation. Reviewing the feedback:

- CREEK feedback: C(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(-) K(x)  
  - The second E (position 4) is marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position), but position 4 is P in our locked pattern. This means P is correct in position 4, so E cannot be in position 4. The ""-"" must refer to the letter E existing somewhere else in the word, but positions 1-4 are fixed as C R E P. Therefore, the word must be C R E P E.

But ""CREPE"" is a valid 5-letter word, and it fits all constraints:
- C R E P _  
- Ends with E (only remaining allowed letter not yet tried)  
- No conflicting letters from previous feedback.

Thus, the only possible word left is CREPE.
