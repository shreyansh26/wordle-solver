For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses a variety of common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""STARE"", I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

- O(x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains both A and R, but neither O nor S nor E.
- The remaining alphabet letters to test include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not O, S, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. Puts A somewhere other than 1st position.
4. Puts R somewhere other than 2nd position.

A good next step is to test new common consonants and possibly a second vowel (likely I or U). The word RATIO comes to mind, but it has an O which we know is absent. Instead, let’s choose a word that has A, R and introduces other common letters like T and I. The word TRIAL fits these constraints:
- T, R, I, A, L
- Contains A and R with no O, S, E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1st), R is in position 2 (but second position was already forbidden for R, so this is bad).

Next idea: TRAIN — but R is again in position 2. Need to avoid R in 2nd place.

How about ""DRAIN""? R is in 2nd position again. Not ideal.

How about ""TRUNK""? No, we must include A.

How about ""GRAIN""? Again R in 2nd.

How about ""FAIRY""? No R.

How about ""RAFTY""? R in 1st position, A in 2nd. A is forbidden in 1st but allowed in 2nd. R is forbidden in 2nd but allowed in 1st. Could work.

Wait, let’s pick ""TRAIL"" and just accept R in 2nd since we need to test new consonants and the feedback will still guide us. But actually the feedback says R is in the word but NOT in 2nd position, so we must avoid R in 2nd.

A good next step is to test new common consonants and possibly a second vowel (likely I or U). The word RATIO comes to mind, but it has an O which we know is absent. Instead, let’s choose a word that has A, R and introduces other common letters like T and I. The word TRIAL fits these constraints:
- T, R, I, A, L
- Contains A and R with no O, S, E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1st), R is in position 2 (but second position was already forbidden for R, so this is bad).

Next idea: TRAIN — but R is again in position 2. Need to avoid R in 2nd place.

How about ""DRAIN""? R is in 2nd position again. Not ideal.

How about ""TRUNK""? No, we must include A.

How about ""GRAIN""? Again R in 2nd.

How about ""FAIRY""? No R.

How about ""RAFTY""? R in 1st position, A in 2nd. A is forbidden in 1st but allowed in 2nd. R is forbidden in 2nd but allowed in 1st. Could work.

But let’s try to cover more letters first. A better choice might be ""TRAMP"" but again R in 2nd.

Wait, let’s pick ""TRAIL"" and just accept R in 2nd since we need to test new consonants and the feedback will still guide us. But actually the feedback says R is in the word but NOT in 2nd position, so we must avoid R in 2nd.

Alternative: ""CRAFT"" — C, R, A, F, T. Here R is in 2nd position — again bad.

How about ""CRATE""? Same issue.

How about ""PARTY""? P, A, R, T, Y.
- Contains A (correct), R (correct), and new consonants P, T, Y.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since forbidden only in 1st).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since forbidden only in 2nd).
- No O, S, E.

This seems like a solid second guess.

1. The word contains A and R.
2. It definitely does NOT contain O, S, E, P, T, Y.
3. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from PARTY feedback: A(-)).
4. R is in the word and IS in position 3 (from PARTY feedback: R(✓)).
5. From the first guess, A is NOT in position 1.

So the 3rd letter of the secret word is R.

Possible positions for A:
- Allowed positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- But 3 is already taken by R, so A could be in 2, 4, or 5.
- From Guess 1, A is not in position 1.
- From Guess 2, A is not in position 2.  
Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3.
- Contains A in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out yet (no O, S, E, P, T, Y).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus A, R.

A good candidate is ""BURAN"":
- B, U, R, A, N
- R is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains no forbidden letters.

Another candidate is ""CURAN"" or ""LURAN"" but ""BURAN"" seems more common.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Forbidden letters (never appear): O, S, E, P, T, Y, B, N.
2. Required letters and positions:
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - U is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
3. The word therefore looks like: _ U R A _

Remaining letters to test (from what’s left in the alphabet, excluding already-used and forbidden ones):
- Consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Vowels left: I (since A, U already used; E, O forbidden)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2, R in 3, A in 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Ends with a valid consonant.

Common choices: CUR, FUR, LUR, MUR, etc., combined with endings.

Looking for real words:
- CURIA → C U R I A → fits positions 2-4 (U, R, A) and has C in 1st, I in 5th. All letters allowed.
- FURIA → F U R I A → also fits.
- MURAL → but L is in 5th and A is already in 4th, but L is allowed. However it repeats A which is fine but not needed.

""CURIA"" is a valid word and covers C, I which are untested and common.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: C, U, R, I, A — none are forbidden.
- Positions: C _ (1st), U (2nd), R (3rd), A (4th), I (5th) → matches required positions for U, R, A.

Thus, CURIA is a logical next guess.

1. Forbidden letters (not in the word):

   - U is in position 2 (from Guess 3: U(✓))
   - A is in the word but **not** in position 4 (from Guess 4: A(-) despite being in position 4)

3. Therefore, the word must be structured as:
   _ U R A _   OR   _ U R _ A

   Position 1: ?

   Position 5: A

4. The final form is: _ U R _ A

5. Allowed letters for the remaining blanks (positions 1 & 4):
   From the alphabet, excluding all forbidden letters (O,S,E,P,T,Y,B,N,C,I) and using the remaining:
   D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus A, U, R already used)

6. We need common 5-letter words fitting: D/F/G/H/J/K/L/M/Q/V/W/X/Z + U + R + (allowed letter) + A

7. Testing common words:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,RURAL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses a variety of common consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""STARE"", I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess:
- A(-) : the letter A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(-) : the letter R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x) : the letter O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : the letter S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : the letter E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains both A and R, but neither O nor S nor E.
- The remaining alphabet letters to test include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not O, S, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E.
3. Puts A somewhere other than 1st position.
4. Puts R somewhere other than 2nd position.

A good next step is to test new common consonants and possibly a second vowel (likely I or U). The word RATIO comes to mind, but it has an O which we know is absent. Instead, let’s choose a word that has A, R and introduces other common letters like T and I. The word TRIAL fits these constraints:
- T, R, I, A, L
- Contains A and R with no O, S, E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1st), R is in position 2 (but second position was already forbidden for R, so this is bad).

Next idea: TRAIN — but R is again in position 2. Need to avoid R in 2nd place.

How about ""DRAIN""? R is in 2nd position again. Not ideal.

How about ""TRUNK""? No, we must include A.

How about ""GRAIN""? Again R in 2nd.

How about ""FAIRY""? No R.

How about ""RAFTY""? R in 1st position, A in 2nd. A is forbidden in 1st but allowed in 2nd. R is forbidden in 2nd but allowed in 1st. Could work.

But let’s try to cover more letters first. A better choice might be ""TRAMP"" but again R in 2nd.

Wait, let’s pick ""TRAIL"" and just accept R in 2nd since we need to test new consonants and the feedback will still guide us. But actually the feedback says R is in the word but NOT in 2nd position, so we must avoid R in 2nd.

Alternative: ""CRAFT"" — C, R, A, F, T. Here R is in 2nd position — again bad.

How about ""CRATE""? Same issue.

How about ""PARTY""? P, A, R, T, Y.
- Contains A (correct), R (correct), and new consonants P, T, Y.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since forbidden only in 1st).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since forbidden only in 2nd).
- No O, S, E.

This seems like a solid second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PARTY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now know:

1. The word contains A and R.
2. It definitely does NOT contain O, S, E, P, T, Y.
3. A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from PARTY feedback: A(-)).
4. R is in the word and IS in position 3 (from PARTY feedback: R(✓)).
5. From the first guess, A is NOT in position 1.

So the 3rd letter of the secret word is R.

Possible positions for A:
- Allowed positions: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- But 3 is already taken by R, so A could be in 2, 4, or 5.
- From Guess 1, A is not in position 1.
- From Guess 2, A is not in position 2.  
Therefore, A must be in position 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3.
- Contains A in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out yet (no O, S, E, P, T, Y).

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus A, R.

A good candidate is ""BURAN"":
- B, U, R, A, N
- R is in position 3 (✓).
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains no forbidden letters.

Another candidate is ""CURAN"" or ""LURAN"" but ""BURAN"" seems more common.

Let’s go with BURAN.

2. Required letters and positions:
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - U is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
3. The word therefore looks like: _ U R A _

Remaining letters to test (from what’s left in the alphabet, excluding already-used and forbidden ones):
- Consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Vowels left: I (since A, U already used; E, O forbidden)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2, R in 3, A in 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Ends with a valid consonant.

Common choices: CUR, FUR, LUR, MUR, etc., combined with endings.

Looking for real words:
- CURIA → C U R I A → fits positions 2-4 (U, R, A) and has C in 1st, I in 5th. All letters allowed.
- FURIA → F U R I A → also fits.
- MURAL → but L is in 5th and A is already in 4th, but L is allowed. However it repeats A which is fine but not needed.

""CURIA"" is a valid word and covers C, I which are untested and common.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: C, U, R, I, A — none are forbidden.
- Positions: C _ (1st), U (2nd), R (3rd), A (4th), I (5th) → matches required positions for U, R, A.

Thus, CURIA is a logical next guess.

Let’s consolidate every constraint revealed so far:

1. Forbidden letters:  
   O, S, E, P, T, Y, B, N, C, I, D

2. Required letters and positions:  
   - R is in position 3 (✓)  
   - U is in position 2 (✓)  
   - A is in the word, but **not** in positions 4 or 5 (last two guesses both gave A(-) when it was in 4th or 5th).  
   Therefore A must be in position 1.

3. The word structure is now fixed:  
   Position 1: A  
   Position 2: U  
   Position 3: R  
   Positions 4 & 5: two letters drawn from the still-allowed set (none of the forbidden letters).

4. Remaining allowed letters (alphabet minus O,S,E,P,T,Y,B,N,C,I,D):  
   F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus A, U, R already placed.

5. We need a real 5-letter word fitting: A U R _ _

6. Common real words that fit:
   - AURIC → C is forbidden  
   - AURUM → M allowed, U appears twice (but second U is allowed)  
   - AURAE → E forbidden  
   - AURAS → S forbidden  
   - AURAR → ends with R, already used in position 3  
   - AURIC already ruled out  
   - AURUM is valid and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next logical guess is AURUM.
