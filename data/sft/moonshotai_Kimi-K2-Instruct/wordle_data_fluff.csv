For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me useful information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that contains several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me information about whether any of these letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems to cover a good range of vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can ignore every one of them and look for a word built only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

We still want a mix of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
The next most frequent letters (excluding A,R,O,S,E) are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, etc.  
I’ll choose a word that introduces several of these high-frequency letters at once.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L – all still in play.  
Another good candidate is “CHIMP,” but “UNTIL” keeps the vowel-consonant balance I prefer for an early guess.

Therefore, I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

1. Uses U and L in new positions.
2. Brings in other common, still-untested letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “LUMPY”:
- L moves to position 1 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong for position 5).  
- U moves to position 2 (allowed, since U was only marked wrong for position 1).  
- Adds three new high-frequency consonants: M, P, Y.

- U (tried in position 1 and 2 ⇒ cannot be there)
- L (tried in position 5 and 1 ⇒ cannot be there)

Thus U and L must occupy positions 3 or 4 (or perhaps 2 for L), but never 1, 2, 5 for U, and never 1, 5 for L.

Remaining common letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Among these, the most frequent are B, C, D, G, H, K.

We need a 5-letter word that
- contains both U and L,
- places U not in 1 or 2, and L not in 1 or 5,
- avoids every excluded letter.

Possible placements:
- U must be in 3 or 4
- L can be in 2, 3, 4 (but 3 or 4 might already be taken by U), so either U3/L4, U4/L2, U4/L3.

Let’s build a word that satisfies this and uses new common consonants.

For example:
U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _
Try C, D, B for the other slots.
- DUBLY? no, contains Y (excluded)
- BULKY? contains K (ok) and Y (excluded) – no
- CUBIC? has I (excluded) – no
- DULCK? not a valid word
- BULCH? not valid
- HULKY? has Y – no
- GULCH? has G, C, H – all still allowed.

GULCH:

BUT U was marked “-” in position 2 (Guess 2: UNTIL ⇒ U in pos 1 was “-”, but pos 2 was untested).  
Wait: Guess 2 was U N T I L ⇒ U was in pos 1 and marked “-” (in word, wrong spot).  
In Guess 3 was L U M P Y ⇒ U was in pos 2 and marked “-” again.  
Therefore U cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so U must be in 3 or 4.  
So GULCH would place U in 2 ⇒ invalid.

Try U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me useful information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these, I'll choose a word that contains several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me information about whether any of these letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems to cover a good range of vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can ignore every one of them and look for a word built only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

We still want a mix of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
The next most frequent letters (excluding A,R,O,S,E) are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, etc.  
I’ll choose a word that introduces several of these high-frequency letters at once.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L – all still in play.  
Another good candidate is “CHIMP,” but “UNTIL” keeps the vowel-consonant balance I prefer for an early guess.

Therefore, I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters completely absent: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I  
Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions so far: U and L  
Positions that are impossible for U: position 1  
Positions that are impossible for L: position 5  

The remaining alphabet is still quite large, so we want a word that:
1. Uses U and L in new positions.
2. Brings in other common, still-untested letters.

Among the most frequent letters not yet tested: D, C, M, P, B, G, Y, K, H.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “LUMPY”:
- L moves to position 1 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong for position 5).  
- U moves to position 2 (allowed, since U was only marked wrong for position 1).  
- Adds three new high-frequency consonants: M, P, Y.

This should give maximal new information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we know from the three previous guesses.

Letters completely EXCLUDED so far:
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, M, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word, but we don’t yet know their exact positions:
- U (tried in position 1 and 2 ⇒ cannot be there)
- L (tried in position 5 and 1 ⇒ cannot be there)

Thus U and L must occupy positions 3 or 4 (or perhaps 2 for L), but never 1, 2, 5 for U, and never 1, 5 for L.

Remaining common letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Among these, the most frequent are B, C, D, G, H, K.

We need a 5-letter word that
- contains both U and L,
- places U not in 1 or 2, and L not in 1 or 5,
- avoids every excluded letter.

Possible placements:
- U must be in 3 or 4
- L can be in 2, 3, 4 (but 3 or 4 might already be taken by U), so either U3/L4, U4/L2, U4/L3.

Let’s build a word that satisfies this and uses new common consonants.

For example:
U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _
Try C, D, B for the other slots.
- DUBLY? no, contains Y (excluded)
- BULKY? contains K (ok) and Y (excluded) – no
- CUBIC? has I (excluded) – no
- DULCK? not a valid word
- BULCH? not valid
- HULKY? has Y – no
- GULCH? has G, C, H – all still allowed.

GULCH:
Positions: G(1) U(2) L(3) C(4) H(5)
BUT U was marked “-” in position 2 (Guess 2: UNTIL ⇒ U in pos 1 was “-”, but pos 2 was untested).  
Wait: Guess 2 was U N T I L ⇒ U was in pos 1 and marked “-” (in word, wrong spot).  
In Guess 3 was L U M P Y ⇒ U was in pos 2 and marked “-” again.  
Therefore U cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so U must be in 3 or 4.  
So GULCH would place U in 2 ⇒ invalid.

Try U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _
Need three-letter start and end, all letters allowed.
C H U L K → CHULK? not a real word.
B U L C H? B is allowed, U is in 3, L in 2 (but 2 is ok), C, H ok → BULCH? not valid.
D U L C H? D U L C H → DULCH? no.
F U L C H? FULCH? no.

Try U in 4, L in 2 → _ L _ U _
Example: B L O U D? O excluded.
C L O U D? O excluded.
B L A D U? A excluded.
G L U C K? G L U C K: positions G(1) L(2) U(3) C(4) K(5).  
U is now in 3 – allowed.  
L is in 2 – allowed.

""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me information about whether any of these letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems to cover a good range of vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can ignore every one of them and look for a word built only from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

We still want a mix of very common consonants and vowels to maximize information.  
The next most frequent letters (excluding A,R,O,S,E) are: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, etc.  
I’ll choose a word that introduces several of these high-frequency letters at once.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L – all still in play.  
Another good candidate is “CHIMP,” but “UNTIL” keeps the vowel-consonant balance I prefer for an early guess.

Therefore, I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters completely absent: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I  
Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions so far: U and L  
Positions that are impossible for U: position 1  
Positions that are impossible for L: position 5  

The remaining alphabet is still quite large, so we want a word that:
1. Uses U and L in new positions.
2. Brings in other common, still-untested letters.

Among the most frequent letters not yet tested: D, C, M, P, B, G, Y, K, H.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “LUMPY”:
- L moves to position 1 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong for position 5).  
- U moves to position 2 (allowed, since U was only marked wrong for position 1).  
- Adds three new high-frequency consonants: M, P, Y.

This should give maximal new information.

Guess 3: LUMPY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(-) M(x) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we know from the three previous guesses.

Letters completely EXCLUDED so far:
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, M, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word, but we don’t yet know their exact positions:
- U (tried in position 1 and 2 ⇒ cannot be there)
- L (tried in position 5 and 1 ⇒ cannot be there)

Thus U and L must occupy positions 3 or 4 (or perhaps 2 for L), but never 1, 2, 5 for U, and never 1, 5 for L.

Remaining common letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Among these, the most frequent are B, C, D, G, H, K.

We need a 5-letter word that
- contains both U and L,
- places U not in 1 or 2, and L not in 1 or 5,
- avoids every excluded letter.

Possible placements:
- U must be in 3 or 4
- L can be in 2, 3, 4 (but 3 or 4 might already be taken by U), so either U3/L4, U4/L2, U4/L3.

Let’s build a word that satisfies this and uses new common consonants.

For example:
U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _
Try C, D, B for the other slots.
- DUBLY? no, contains Y (excluded)
- BULKY? contains K (ok) and Y (excluded) – no
- CUBIC? has I (excluded) – no
- DULCK? not a valid word
- BULCH? not valid
- HULKY? has Y – no
- GULCH? has G, C, H – all still allowed.

GULCH:
Positions: G(1) U(2) L(3) C(4) H(5)
BUT U was marked “-” in position 2 (Guess 2: UNTIL ⇒ U in pos 1 was “-”, but pos 2 was untested).  
Wait: Guess 2 was U N T I L ⇒ U was in pos 1 and marked “-” (in word, wrong spot).  
In Guess 3 was L U M P Y ⇒ U was in pos 2 and marked “-” again.  
Therefore U cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so U must be in 3 or 4.  
So GULCH would place U in 2 ⇒ invalid.

Try U in 3, L in 4 → _ _ U L _
Need three-letter start and end, all letters allowed.
C H U L K → CHULK? not a real word.
B U L C H? B is allowed, U is in 3, L in 2 (but 2 is ok), C, H ok → BULCH? not valid.
D U L C H? D U L C H → DULCH? no.
F U L C H? FULCH? no.

Try U in 4, L in 2 → _ L _ U _
Example: B L O U D? O excluded.
C L O U D? O excluded.
B L A D U? A excluded.
G L U C K? G L U C K: positions G(1) L(2) U(3) C(4) K(5).  
U is now in 3 – allowed.  
L is in 2 – allowed.  
Letters used: G, L, U, C, K – none are excluded.  
GLUCK is a valid 5-letter word.

We will guess GLUCK.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(x) L(-)
Guess 3: LUMPY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(-) M(x) P(x) Y(x)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current status:
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position: L in position 2, U in position 3  
- Letters excluded so far: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, M, P, Y, G, C, K  

Therefore the secret word looks like: _ L U _ _  
Letters still allowed to fill blanks: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any other untested letters of the alphabet that haven’t been ruled out)

However, we’ve only tested: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, U, M, P, Y, G, C, K.  
That leaves: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5, and they must come from the remaining untested set. Let’s pick common ones first: B, D, F, H.

Let’s list valid five-letter words matching _ L U _ _ with remaining letters:
- BLURB (but R is excluded) → invalid  
- BLUNT (N excluded) → invalid  
- BLUFF → uses F twice, F is allowed, but we need to check validity. BLUFF is a valid word.  
- BLUSH → S excluded → invalid  
- FLUFF → F is allowed, but let’s check if this uses only allowed letters: F, L, U, F, F. All allowed.  
- FLUME → E excluded → invalid  
- FLUBS → S excluded → invalid  
- FLUNK → K excluded → invalid  

Between BLUFF and FLUFF, let’s pick BLUFF because B has not been tested yet while F has not been used either. Both are valid, but BLUFF uses B which is untested.

So first choice: BLUFF.

Remaining possible letters: D, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, and F (which we know appears twice)

Since we have two Fs confirmed in the word, and positions 1, 4, 5 are unknown, the two Fs must occupy two of these three positions. The most straightforward placement is positions 4 and 5, making the word end with ""FF"".

This gives us the pattern: _ L U F F

Now we just need to determine the first letter from the remaining possible letters (D, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z).

The only valid English word matching this pattern is ""FLUFF"", but:
- F is already confirmed in positions 4 and 5
- We can't have F in position 1 because we know F is only in positions 4 and 5 (from BLUFF feedback showing F in correct positions 4 and 5)

Looking at the remaining letters for position 1:
- D would make ""DLUFF"" - not a word

This suggests the Fs must be split between positions 1 and 5, making the pattern: F L U _ F

The only remaining letter for position 4 from the allowed set (D, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z) that forms a valid word is D, making ""FLUDF"" - but this isn't a word.

Realizing my mistake - the word must be ""FLUFF"" with the first F in position 1, but we know from BLUFF feedback that F is in positions 4 and 5. This indicates the word must be ""_LUFF"" with F in positions 4 and 5, meaning the first letter must be something else.

However, none of the remaining letters form valid words with ""LUFF"". This suggests we need to reconsider the placement of Fs.

Alternative placement: one F in position 1 and one F in position 4, making: F L U F _

- D: ""FLUFD"" - not valid

- V: ""FLUFV"" - not valid

This leads me to realize the only possible word is ""FLUFF"" with both Fs in positions 4 and 5, and the first letter must be F, but this contradicts our feedback. 

Upon closer inspection, the correct interpretation is that the word must be ""FLUFF"" with:
- F in position 1
