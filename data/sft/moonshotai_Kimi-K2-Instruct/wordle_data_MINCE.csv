For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the amount of information gained. Words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) are good choices. 

Looking at frequency analysis of letters in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good starting word would use several of these to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

The word ""AROSE"" contains five very common letters - A, R, O, S, E - which are all among the top 10 most common letters in English. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the first guess AROSE, we learned:
- E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).

That leaves us with these remaining letters:
- Vowels: I (since A and O are out, E is already placed, and U is possible but less common)
- Consonants: Everything except R and S

Since E is fixed at position 5, we now need to choose 4 more letters that haven't been ruled out. Good common letters that haven't been used yet include T, N, L, I, C, M, D, etc.

A good strategy now is to pick a word that uses several of these remaining common consonants along with I (the remaining common vowel). The word ""UNTIE"" would be good, but E is already fixed at position 5 so we can't use that. 

Looking at possible patterns, words ending in E that don't contain A, R, O, S: 
- ""INLET"" - uses I, N, L, T (all good unused consonants) + E at end
- ""TILED"" - similar letters
- ""CITED"" - uses C, I, T, D

I'll go with ""INLET"" as it uses I, N, L, T which are all common remaining letters.

We now know more:

- E is in the word, but **NOT** in position 5 (from Guess 2: E was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- I is in the word, but not in position 1 (“-” at position 1).
- N is in the word, but not in position 2 (“-” at position 2).
- L and T are not in the word (x).

Letters still excluded: A, R, O, S, L, T.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E (somewhere inside, not last).

We also know:
- E must be in positions 1–4.
- I must be in positions 2–5 (not 1).
- N must be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2).

So the word looks like:
- One of the four slots is E.
- One of the remaining slots is I (but not position 1).
- One of the remaining slots is N (but not position 2).

A good next step is to pick a word that re-tests I, N, and E in new positions while introducing other common letters we haven’t tried yet. Common unused consonants: C, D, H, M, K, G, etc.

Example candidates:
- MINCE – positions E at 4, I at 2, N at 3. (Uses C and M.)
- NICHE – positions E at 4, I at 1 (invalid), so skip.
- PINED – positions E at 4, I at 2, N at 3. (Uses P and D.)
- WINED – same pattern but W and D.

I’ll pick MINCE as it has M and C (both common and untested) while placing E, I, N in new spots.
