This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the word. A good strategy is to start with a word that contains common letters and gives a lot of information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

A better choice is ""ROTES"" - it contains R, O, T, E, S where:

- T is new

- O – not in position 3 (AROSE) but IS in position 2 (ROTES) ⇒ O is in position 2!
- S – not in position 4 (AROSE) nor position 5 (ROTES)
- E – not in position 5 (AROSE) but IS in position 4 (ROTES) ⇒ E is in position 4!

So the word looks like: _ O _ E _ 

Letters still to place: R and S (we already placed O and E and T is out).

Constraints:

- S cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Thus:
- R must be in position 3 or 5 (but position 3 is still open).
- S must be in position 1 or 3.

1. If R is in position 3, then S must be in position 1 → S O R E ?

2. If R is in position 5, then S must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is open so S could be there → ? O S E R.

The second pattern fits all constraints and uses a common letter (S in 3, R in 5). We still need a letter for position 1. Common unused letters: N, I, D, L, C...

L in 1, O in 2, S in 3, E in 4, R in 5 → ""LOSER"" is valid and fits all constraints.

Let's verify constraints:

- O is in position 2 (matches ✓ from ROTES).
- E is in position 4 (matches ✓ from ROTES).
- R is not in 1 or 2 (it's in 5) - ok.

- S is not in 4 or 5 (it's in 3) - ok.
- T is not in the word - ok (x from ROTES).
- A is not in the word - ok (x from AROSE).

""LOSER"" satisfies everything.

From the latest feedback on LOSER:
- L: x – not in the word.
- O: ✓ – in the correct position (position 2).
- S: ✓ – in the correct position (position 3).
- E: ✓ – in the correct position (position 4).
- R: ✓ – in the correct position (position 5).

So the known letters and positions are:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

Only the first position is unknown. The letters used so far that are confirmed in the word are O, S, E, R. The letters confirmed not in the word are A, T, L.

The first position must be a letter that hasn't been tested yet (or at least hasn't been ruled out). Common letters not yet ruled out include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good strategy is to pick a common letter for the first position. The most common unused letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P.

Possible words:
- BOSER – ""BOSER"" is a valid word (though uncommon).
- COSER – not valid.
- DOSER – valid.
- FOSER – not valid.
- GOSER – not valid.
- HOSER – valid.
- IOSER – not valid.
- KOSER – not valid.
- MOSER – valid (name).
- NOSER – valid (slang for ""nose"").
- POSER – valid.

Among these, ""POSER"" is a common word and uses P, which is a common letter. Let's go with ""POSER"".
