For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common consonants and vowels to maximize the feedback I receive. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

A good strategy is to use a word with:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Based on this, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words

This will give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter O (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT use A, R, S, E.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already in).

A strong next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing O in a different position. ""POINT"" is a good option because:
- Uses O in position 2 (different from first guess)
- Uses common consonants P, N, T
- Uses I (another vowel we haven't tested)
- Does not use any of the excluded letters (A, R, S, E)

3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3. Therefore, O must appear in position 1, 4, or 5.  However, position 5 is already T, so O must be in position 1 or 4.

- Places I in position 3 and T in position 5 (already fixed).
- Places O in position 1 (to test).
- Introduces new common consonants we haven’t tried yet (e.g., D, L, C, M, G, etc.) while avoiding the already excluded letters.

- O is in position 1 (testing that placement).
- I is in position 3 (matches ✓).
- L is a new consonant.
- Y is a new letter (not yet tested, and allowed since Y can sometimes function as a vowel).
- Avoids all known excluded letters.

Let’s update the constraints based on all feedback so far.

Letters definitely NOT in the word (x on all appearances):
A, R, S, E, P, N, L, Y

Letters definitely IN the word:
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 5 (✓)
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback on AROSE and DOILY).  
  Therefore, O must be in position 4.

Current confirmed pattern: _ _ I O T

Letters remaining to test (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Of these, common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, U.

We need 2 distinct letters for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set.

Candidate combinations:
- C and H → CHIOT (invalid word)
- M and I → already I used
- B and I → BI***, but I used
- C and O → O already used
- M and O → O already used

Let’s pick real, common 5-letter words that fit _ _ I O T:

Possible words:
- B I O T? → BIOT? (BIOT is a valid 5-letter word, short for biotin)
- C H I O T → CHIOT (not recognized)
- F I O T? → FIOT? (invalid)
- M I O T? → MIOT? (invalid)
- H I O T? → HIOT? (invalid)
- G I O T? → GIOT? (invalid)

Wait, let me double-check valid words ending in IOT.

Common valid words ending in IOT:
- IDIOT
- PIOT? (invalid)
- BIOT? (valid: short for biotin, also a unit prefix)

But we cannot use I in positions 1 or 2 because we already have I in position 3. So we need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 2.

Valid word: IDIOT  
But this would have I in position 1 and 3, which is allowed because letters can repeat (though feedback does not indicate repetition yet). However, we need to test new letters.

But we already have O in position 4 and T in position 5. The word must be _ _ I O T.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in IOT:
- IDIOT
- PIOT? (invalid)
- BIOT? (invalid)

Valid word: IDIOT

But:
- I in position 1 is allowed (not ruled out)
- D in position 2 was marked (-) in DOILY, suggesting D is present but not in position 1. So D could be in position 2.

Thus, IDIOT fits the pattern _ _ I O T with:
- I in 3 (✓), O in 4, T in 5
- Uses D in position 2 (allowed, since D was marked - not in position 1)
- Uses I in position 1 (allowed, not yet ruled out)

So the guess should be IDIOT.
