For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should ideally include a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters C, R, A, N, E and has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)  
- A is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains:
- A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Definitely does NOT contain C, R, or E.

We still need to discover the other three letters. Good next letters to test (high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out) are S, T, L, O, I, D, U.

A five-letter word that includes both A and N, plus three new high-frequency letters, would be ideal. One such word is “STAND”: it keeps A and N active while testing S, T, and D.

A quick check:
- S, T, and D have not been tested yet.
- A and N are present but will be in different positions (A now in slot 2, N in slot 5).

Let's re-examine all the information we have so far.

Letters KNOWN to be in the word:
- A (exists, but cannot be in positions 2, 3)
- N (exists, but cannot be in positions 4, 5)
- T (exists, but cannot be in position 2, 5)

Letters KNOWN **not** to be in the word:
- C, R, E, S, D, P, L

So the secret word must contain A, N, T and only letters from the remaining alphabet.  
Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out:  
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions left for each known letter:
- A: allowed in positions 1, 4, 5 (but NOT 2, 3)
- N: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3 (but NOT 4, 5)
- T: allowed in positions 1, 3, 4 (but NOT 2, 5)

A, N, T must all appear in the word, so the word is some permutation of three of the five positions with two additional, as-yet untested letters.

Let’s pick high-frequency remaining consonants: B, F, H, M, G, K.  
Vowels we haven’t tried yet: I, O, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that fits these constraints:
- Must include A, N, T
- Must not use any of the forbidden letters
- Must place A, N, T in legal positions

Good candidates:
A N T plus two new letters. Let’s try “FAINT”:
- F, A, I, N, T
- A in position 2 (but A cannot be in position 2 according to feedback) → invalid.

Next, try “GIANT”:
- G, I, A, N, T
- A in position 3 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “ANTIC” (but C is forbidden).

Next, try “ANTSY”:
- A, N, T, S, Y → S is forbidden.

Next, try “MANTA” (but A is position 3/5, N position 2, T position 4):
- M, A, N, T, A
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “TANGY”:
- T, A, N, G, Y
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “TULAN” (not a real word).

Next, try “HANTA” (not a real word).

Next, try “TANGO”:
- T, A, N, G, O
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “NATAL” (but L is forbidden).

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

A cannot be in 2,3  
N cannot be in 4,5  
T cannot be in 2,5  

Let’s find a 5-letter word with A, N, T and two new letters (from B,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,U,Y).

Let’s try “TALON” — but L and O are not tested, but L is forbidden (from PLANT feedback).

Next, try “BAHTN” (not a word).

Next, try “YAMNT” (not a word).

This is tricky. Let’s look for real English words:

Possible real words containing A, N, T and using only remaining letters:
- “MANTY” (not a real standard word)
- “TAUNT” — T, A, U, N, T
  - T is in positions 1 and 5 (but T cannot be in position 5) → invalid.

- “GAUNT” — G, A, U, N, T
  - A is position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

- “HANT” (4 letters) — too short.

- “VAUNT” (V is unused)
  - A in position 2 (forbidden).

- “BATON” — B, A, T, O, N
  - A in position 2 (forbidden).

- “UNAPT” — U, N, A, P, T
  - P is forbidden.

- “YANTA” (not a word).

- “KANT” (4 letters)

- “WANT” — W, A, N, T (4 letters)

- “AUNTY” — A, U, N, T, Y
  - A in position 1 (allowed)
  - N in position 3 (allowed)
  - T in position 4 (allowed)
  - U and Y are new letters, both not forbidden yet.

This seems valid! Let’s check:
AUNTY:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- U new letter
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- T in position 4 (allowed)
- Y new letter
All letters are from the allowed set (A, N, T, U, Y), and none of the forbidden letters are used.

So the guess will be AUNTY.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should ideally include a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters C, R, A, N, E and has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)  
- A is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains:
- A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Definitely does NOT contain C, R, or E.

We still need to discover the other three letters. Good next letters to test (high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out) are S, T, L, O, I, D, U.

A five-letter word that includes both A and N, plus three new high-frequency letters, would be ideal. One such word is “STAND”: it keeps A and N active while testing S, T, and D.

A quick check:
- S, T, and D have not been tested yet.
- A and N are present but will be in different positions (A now in slot 2, N in slot 5).

<guess>STAND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
- The word contains A and N but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain C, R, or E.

Guess 2: STAND → S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)  
- The word contains T and N but NOT in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain S or D.

So we now know:
Letters in the word: A, N, T  
Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, D  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from CRANE) or 2 (from STAND).  
- N cannot be in positions 4 (from CRANE) or 4 (from STAND).  
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STAND).

Remaining letters to test (high-frequency ones we haven’t ruled out): L, I, O, U, Y, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a word that uses A, N, T and introduces new, common letters. A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- It includes P, L, A, N, T.  
- A is now in position 3 (no conflict with previous feedback).  
- N is now in position 4 (no conflict with previous feedback).  
- T is now in position 5 (no conflict with previous feedback).

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word (at least once each):
- A, N, T

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
C, R, E, S, D, P, L, U, Y

Positions already ruled out:
A : cannot be in 1, 2, 3  (from CRANE 3, STAND 2, AUNTY 1)
N : cannot be in 3, 4, 5  (from CRANE 4, STAND 4, AUNTY 3)
T : cannot be in 2, 4, 5  (from STAND 2, PLANT 5, AUNTY 4)

So the only possible positions are:
A : 4 or 5
N : 1 or 2
T : 1 or 3

We need a real 5-letter word that contains A, N, T exactly once each (since no duplicates have been indicated), uses only the still-allowed letters, and obeys the position restrictions.

Still-allowed consonants we haven’t used: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Z
Still-allowed vowels we haven’t used: I, O

We need two filler letters from these sets.

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: N in 1, T in 3  
Positions: N _ T A _  or  N _ T _ A  
If we fill position 2 and 5 with allowed consonants/vowels.

We need real words.  
Try “NITTA” – invalid (double T)  
Try “BITTA” – invalid  
Try “FANTA” – uses forbidden A in 2  
Try “NOTTA” – uses O (allowed), but double T is invalid  
Try “NATIO” – uses I and O, both allowed  
Let’s check “NATIO”  
N in 1 (allowed)  
A in 2 (forbidden) – invalid  

Case 2: N in 2, T in 1  
Positions: T N _ A _  or  T N _ _ A  
Try “TINNY” – uses Y (forbidden)  
Try “TINNY” – invalid  
Try “TANGO” – G, O new, but A in 2 (forbidden)  
Try “TANKO” – K, O new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “TAMBO” – B, O new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “TALON” – L (forbidden)

Try “BANTU” – U (forbidden)  
Try “MANTA” – A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “VANTA” – V new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “HANTA” – H new, A in 3 (forbidden)  

Case 4: N in 1, T in 1 – impossible (both can’t be in 1)

We’re running out of possibilities. Let’s look for a real word that satisfies:
- Contains A, N, T  
- Obeying all position bans  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters (no C,R,E,S,D,P,L,U,Y)  
- Needs two more letters from {B,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,V,W,X,Z}

A promising candidate is “FAINT”:
F, A, I, N, T  
Check positions:  
A in 2 – forbidden (from STAND) – invalid.

Next “BANTU” – uses U (forbidden)

Next “GONAT” – not a real word

Next “KANTA” – A in 3 (forbidden)

Next “MANTO”  
M, A, N, T, O  
Check positions:  
M (new)  
A in 2 (forbidden) – invalid

Next “TANGO” – A in 2 (forbidden)

Next “WANTO” – A in 2 (forbidden)

Next “VINTA” – A in 4 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed)  
But we need to check if V is allowed – yes, not forbidden.  
I is allowed (new vowel).  
So “VINTA” looks valid.

Let’s verify:
V new letter  
I new letter  
N in 2 (allowed)  
T in 3 (allowed)  
A in 4 (allowed)

All constraints satisfied.

So the next guess is VINTA.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BATON,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should ideally include a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple possibilities.

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)

I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers common letters C, R, A, N, E and has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)  
- A is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains:
- A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Definitely does NOT contain C, R, or E.

We still need to discover the other three letters. Good next letters to test (high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out) are S, T, L, O, I, D, U.

A five-letter word that includes both A and N, plus three new high-frequency letters, would be ideal. One such word is “STAND”: it keeps A and N active while testing S, T, and D.

A quick check:
- S, T, and D have not been tested yet.
- A and N are present but will be in different positions (A now in slot 2, N in slot 5).

<guess>STAND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
- The word contains A and N but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain C, R, or E.

Guess 2: STAND → S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)  
- The word contains T and N but NOT in positions 2 and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain S or D.

So we now know:
Letters in the word: A, N, T  
Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, D  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 3 (from CRANE) or 2 (from STAND).  
- N cannot be in positions 4 (from CRANE) or 4 (from STAND).  
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STAND).

Remaining letters to test (high-frequency ones we haven’t ruled out): L, I, O, U, Y, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a word that uses A, N, T and introduces new, common letters. A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- It includes P, L, A, N, T.  
- A is now in position 3 (no conflict with previous feedback).  
- N is now in position 4 (no conflict with previous feedback).  
- T is now in position 5 (no conflict with previous feedback).  
- All letters P, L are new and common.

Let’s go with PLANT.

<guess>PLANT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's re-examine all the information we have so far.

Letters KNOWN to be in the word:
- A (exists, but cannot be in positions 2, 3)
- N (exists, but cannot be in positions 4, 5)
- T (exists, but cannot be in position 2, 5)

Letters KNOWN **not** to be in the word:
- C, R, E, S, D, P, L

So the secret word must contain A, N, T and only letters from the remaining alphabet.  
Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out:  
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions left for each known letter:
- A: allowed in positions 1, 4, 5 (but NOT 2, 3)
- N: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3 (but NOT 4, 5)
- T: allowed in positions 1, 3, 4 (but NOT 2, 5)

A, N, T must all appear in the word, so the word is some permutation of three of the five positions with two additional, as-yet untested letters.

Let’s pick high-frequency remaining consonants: B, F, H, M, G, K.  
Vowels we haven’t tried yet: I, O, U, Y.

Let’s try a word that fits these constraints:
- Must include A, N, T
- Must not use any of the forbidden letters
- Must place A, N, T in legal positions

Good candidates:
A N T plus two new letters. Let’s try “FAINT”:
- F, A, I, N, T
- A in position 2 (but A cannot be in position 2 according to feedback) → invalid.

Next, try “GIANT”:
- G, I, A, N, T
- A in position 3 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “ANTIC” (but C is forbidden).

Next, try “ANTSY”:
- A, N, T, S, Y → S is forbidden.

Next, try “MANTA” (but A is position 3/5, N position 2, T position 4):
- M, A, N, T, A
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “TANGY”:
- T, A, N, G, Y
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “TULAN” (not a real word).

Next, try “HANTA” (not a real word).

Next, try “TANGO”:
- T, A, N, G, O
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

Next, try “NATAL” (but L is forbidden).

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

A cannot be in 2,3  
N cannot be in 4,5  
T cannot be in 2,5  

Let’s find a 5-letter word with A, N, T and two new letters (from B,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,U,Y).

Let’s try “TALON” — but L and O are not tested, but L is forbidden (from PLANT feedback).

Next, try “BAHTN” (not a word).

Next, try “YAMNT” (not a word).

This is tricky. Let’s look for real English words:

Possible real words containing A, N, T and using only remaining letters:
- “MANTY” (not a real standard word)
- “TAUNT” — T, A, U, N, T
  - T is in positions 1 and 5 (but T cannot be in position 5) → invalid.

- “GAUNT” — G, A, U, N, T
  - A is position 2 (forbidden) → invalid.

- “HANT” (4 letters) — too short.

- “VAUNT” (V is unused)
  - A in position 2 (forbidden).

- “BATON” — B, A, T, O, N
  - A in position 2 (forbidden).

- “UNAPT” — U, N, A, P, T
  - P is forbidden.

- “YANTA” (not a word).

- “KANT” (4 letters)

- “WANT” — W, A, N, T (4 letters)

- “AUNTY” — A, U, N, T, Y
  - A in position 1 (allowed)
  - N in position 3 (allowed)
  - T in position 4 (allowed)
  - U and Y are new letters, both not forbidden yet.

This seems valid! Let’s check:
AUNTY:
- A in position 1 (allowed)
- U new letter
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- T in position 4 (allowed)
- Y new letter
All letters are from the allowed set (A, N, T, U, Y), and none of the forbidden letters are used.

So the guess will be AUNTY.

Try “TINNY” – uses Y (forbidden)  
Try “TINNY” – invalid  
Try “TANGO” – G, O new, but A in 2 (forbidden)  
Try “TANKO” – K, O new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “TAMBO” – B, O new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “TALON” – L (forbidden)  

Case 3: N in 2, T in 3  
Positions: _ N T A _ or _ N T _ A  
Try “BANTU” – U (forbidden)  
Try “MANTA” – A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “VANTA” – V new, A in 3 (forbidden)  
Try “HANTA” – H new, A in 3 (forbidden)  

Case 4: N in 1, T in 1 – impossible (both can’t be in 1)

We’re running out of possibilities. Let’s look for a real word that satisfies:
- Contains A, N, T  
- Obeying all position bans  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters (no C,R,E,S,D,P,L,U,Y)  
- Needs two more letters from {B,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,V,W,X,Z}

A promising candidate is “FAINT”:
F, A, I, N, T  
Check positions:  
A in 2 – forbidden (from STAND) – invalid.

Next “BANTU” – uses U (forbidden)

Next “GONAT” – not a real word

Next “KANTA” – A in 3 (forbidden)

Next “MANTO”  
M, A, N, T, O  
Check positions:  
M (new)  
A in 2 (forbidden) – invalid

Next “TANGO” – A in 2 (forbidden)

Next “WANTO” – A in 2 (forbidden)

Next “VINTA” – A in 4 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed)  
But we need to check if V is allowed – yes, not forbidden.  
I is allowed (new vowel).  
So “VINTA” looks valid.

Let’s verify:
V new letter  
I new letter  
N in 2 (allowed)  
T in 3 (allowed)  
A in 4 (allowed)

All constraints satisfied.

So the next guess is VINTA.
