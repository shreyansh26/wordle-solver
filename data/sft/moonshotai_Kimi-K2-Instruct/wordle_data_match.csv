For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gained. Common starting words include those with letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. Good options are words like SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. 

After considering these, ""CRANE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common letter
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This combination should help reveal or eliminate several key letters early on.

Based on the feedback:

C(-): C is in the word but wrong position.  
R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.  
A(-): A is in the word but wrong position.  
N(x): N is NOT in the word.  
E(x): E is NOT in the word.  

So we know:
- The word must contain C and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain R, N, or E.  
- We need a 5-letter word meeting these constraints and using new letters (since we've eliminated R, N, and E).

Looking for 5-letter words with C and A, not in positions 1 and 3, avoiding R/N/E:
Possible candidates: MACHO (but has H), COAST (has E), CARTS (has R).  
Better: First position can't be C (feedback says C is wrong position), but C is elsewhere. Second position could be A.  
Let's try ""MUSIC"" - but no A.  
""CLOUD"" - no A.  
""LACED"" - has E.  
""SALTY"" - no C.  
""CHALK"" - has K (new), C is 1st position (but feedback says C is wrong in 1st).  
""COBIA"" - has E? No.  
""CHASM"" - has S, M, H, A. C is 1st position (invalid per feedback).  

Alternative approach: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
Possible word: ""SCAMP"" - but has P.  
""SCALD"" - has D.  
""SCARF"" - has R (invalid).  
""SCANT"" - has N (invalid).  
""SCAFF"" - invalid.  
""SPACE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CABIN"" - has N (invalid).  
""CAMPS"" - has P, S. C is 1st (invalid).  
""SCAMP"" - same issue.  
""SCARF"" - invalid R.  

Better candidate: ""SCAMP"" is invalid (N).  
Try ""CLASP"" - has L, S, P. C is 1st (invalid).  
""CARPS"" - has R (invalid).  

Re-evaluate: C cannot be 1st, A cannot be 3rd.  
Possible: ""MACAW"" - has W.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  
""SCARF"" - R invalid.  
""ACORN"" - has R, N invalid.  

Wait, let's try ""SCAMP"" again - no N. S C A M P.

""CHASM"" - C 1st invalid.

Realize: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
""SPACE"" - E invalid.  
""SCAMP"" - A invalid at 3rd.  
""SCALD"" - A at 3rd invalid.  
""SACCO"" - C at 4th, A at 2nd. Letters: S, A, C, C, O. Valid letters (no R/N/E).  
But ""SACCO"" has double C. Is it valid? Word must be 5-letter English word. ""SACCO"" is acceptable (meaning: savings and loan association).  

Check constraints:
- C is at positions 3 and 4 (feedback said C is in word but not 1st position - allowed).  
- A is at position 2 (feedback said A is in word but not 3rd - allowed).  
- Contains no R, N, E.

  - R, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: SACCO → S(x) A(✓) C(-) C(✓) O(x)
  - A is in position 2 (✓) — so the word has A in slot 2.
  - First C is in position 3 (-) — so C is somewhere else (not 3).
  - Second C is in position 4 (✓) — so C is in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Based on the feedback:

C(-): C is in the word but wrong position.  
R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.  
A(-): A is in the word but wrong position.  
N(x): N is NOT in the word.  
E(x): E is NOT in the word.  

So we know:
- The word must contain C and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.  
- The word does NOT contain R, N, or E.  
- We need a 5-letter word meeting these constraints and using new letters (since we've eliminated R, N, and E).

Looking for 5-letter words with C and A, not in positions 1 and 3, avoiding R/N/E:
Possible candidates: MACHO (but has H), COAST (has E), CARTS (has R).  
Better: First position can't be C (feedback says C is wrong position), but C is elsewhere. Second position could be A.  
Let's try ""MUSIC"" - but no A.  
""CLOUD"" - no A.  
""LACED"" - has E.  
""SALTY"" - no C.  
""CHALK"" - has K (new), C is 1st position (but feedback says C is wrong in 1st).  
""COBIA"" - has E? No.  
""CHASM"" - has S, M, H, A. C is 1st position (invalid per feedback).  

Alternative approach: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
Possible word: ""SCAMP"" - but has P.  
""SCALD"" - has D.  
""SCARF"" - has R (invalid).  
""SCANT"" - has N (invalid).  
""SCAFF"" - invalid.  
""SPACE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CABIN"" - has N (invalid).  
""CAMPS"" - has P, S. C is 1st (invalid).  
""SCAMP"" - same issue.  
""SCARF"" - invalid R.  

Better candidate: ""SCAMP"" is invalid (N).  
Try ""CLASP"" - has L, S, P. C is 1st (invalid).  
""CARPS"" - has R (invalid).  

Re-evaluate: C cannot be 1st, A cannot be 3rd.  
Possible: ""MACAW"" - has W.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  
""SCARF"" - R invalid.  
""ACORN"" - has R, N invalid.  

Wait, let's try ""SCAMP"" again - no N. S C A M P.  
C is 2nd position (allowed), A is 3rd position (but feedback said A is wrong position, so A cannot be 3rd). Thus invalid.  

Next: ""CACHE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CAMPO"" - has O, P. C 1st (invalid), A 2nd (allowed).  
""CHASM"" - C 1st invalid.  
""CLAMS"" - C 1st invalid.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  

Realize: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
""SPACE"" - E invalid.  
""SCAMP"" - A invalid at 3rd.  
""SCALD"" - A at 3rd invalid.  
""SACCO"" - C at 4th, A at 2nd. Letters: S, A, C, C, O. Valid letters (no R/N/E).  
But ""SACCO"" has double C. Is it valid? Word must be 5-letter English word. ""SACCO"" is acceptable (meaning: savings and loan association).  

Check constraints:
- C is at positions 3 and 4 (feedback said C is in word but not 1st position - allowed).  
- A is at position 2 (feedback said A is in word but not 3rd - allowed).  
- Contains no R, N, E.  
- Uses new letters S, O.  

Thus ""SACCO"" seems valid.

Let's try ""MUSIC"" - but no A.  
""CLOUD"" - no A.  
""LACED"" - has E.  
""SALTY"" - no C.  
""CHALK"" - has K (new), C is 1st position (but feedback says C is wrong in 1st).  
""COBIA"" - has E? No.  
""CHASM"" - has S, M, H, A. C is 1st position (invalid per feedback).  

Alternative approach: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
Possible word: ""SCAMP"" - but has P.  
""SCALD"" - has D.  
""SCARF"" - has R (invalid).  
""SCANT"" - has N (invalid).  
""SCAFF"" - invalid.  
""SPACE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CABIN"" - has N (invalid).  
""CAMPS"" - has P, S. C is 1st (invalid).  
""SCAMP"" - same issue.  
""SCARF"" - invalid R.  

Better candidate: ""SCAMP"" is invalid (N).  
Try ""CLASP"" - has L, S, P. C is 1st (invalid).  
""CARPS"" - has R (invalid).  

Re-evaluate: C cannot be 1st, A cannot be 3rd.  
Possible: ""MACAW"" - has W.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  
""SCARF"" - R invalid.  
""ACORN"" - has R, N invalid.  

Wait, let's try ""SCAMP"" again - no N. S C A M P.  
C is 2nd position (allowed), A is 3rd position (but feedback said A is wrong position, so A cannot be 3rd). Thus invalid.  

Next: ""CACHE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CAMPO"" - has O, P. C 1st (invalid), A 2nd (allowed).  
""CHASM"" - C 1st invalid.  
""CLAMS"" - C 1st invalid.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  

Realize: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
""SPACE"" - E invalid.  
""SCAMP"" - A invalid at 3rd.  
""SCALD"" - A at 3rd invalid.  
""SACCO"" - C at 4th, A at 2nd. Letters: S, A, C, C, O. Valid letters (no R/N/E).  
But ""SACCO"" has double C. Is it valid? Word must be 5-letter English word. ""SACCO"" is acceptable (meaning: savings and loan association).  

Check constraints:
- C is at positions 3 and 4 (feedback said C is in word but not 1st position - allowed).  
- A is at position 2 (feedback said A is in word but not 3rd - allowed).  
- Contains no R, N, E.  
- Uses new letters S, O.  

Thus ""SACCO"" seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SACCO -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) C(-) C(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know from the two guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - C is present but not in position 1.
  - A is present but not in position 3.
  - R, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: SACCO → S(x) A(✓) C(-) C(✓) O(x)
  - A is in position 2 (✓) — so the word has A in slot 2.
  - First C is in position 3 (-) — so C is somewhere else (not 3).
  - Second C is in position 4 (✓) — so C is in position 4.
  - S and O are absent.

Positions so far:
1: unknown (not S, O, R, N, E, C, A)
2: A
3: unknown (not C, A)
4: C
5: unknown (not S, O, R, N, E)

Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already eliminated ones).

We need a five-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- C in position 4
- No S, O, R, N, E
- C not in position 1 or 3 (already handled by C in 4)
- A not in position 3 (already handled)

Let’s list possible candidates fitting this pattern: _ A _ C _

Try TACIT – no, contains T, A, C, I, T; but T is allowed, I is allowed. TACIT uses A in slot 2 and C in slot 4, and only letters not yet excluded. It’s a common English word.

Check exclusions:
- T, A, C, I, T – none of S, O, R, N, E appear, and C is in position 4, A in 2.

Looks good.

Guess 3: TACIT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) C(-) I(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 2 = A (from Guess 2)
   - Position 4 = C (from Guess 2)

   So the pattern is: _ A _ C _

2. Letters confirmed present somewhere:
   - C (already placed at 4)
   - A (already placed at 2)
   - T (Guess 3: T(-) means T is in the word but **not** positions 1 or 5)
   - I (Guess 3: I(x) means I is **not** in the word)

3. Letters completely eliminated so far:
   - R, N, E, S, O, I

4. Therefore, remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5:
   - Allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Constraints:
     – Position 1: may be T (but T(-) says T is elsewhere, i.e. in 3)
     – Position 3: must be T (since T can only go here now)
     – Position 5: any remaining allowed letter

   So the pattern collapses to: _ A T C _

   Remaining candidates: any valid English word of form (letter) A T C (letter) using only still-allowed letters.

   Possible completions:
   - BATCY (invalid, Y only)
   - HATCH (invalid, H twice, C already at 4)
   - MATCH (invalid, M, A, T, C, H – but C already at 4, H still allowed)
   - PATCH (invalid, P, A, T, C, H – same issue)
   - WATCH (invalid, same reason)
   - CAT... pattern already filled.
   - Actually we need a word like “PATCA” – not valid.

   Let’s look systematically:
   Letters left for positions 1 and 5: any from {B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}

   Valid English five-letter words fitting *A T C *:
   - HATCH – but duplicate H not an issue, but word has C at 4 already (MATCH same)
   - No, we need *exact* pattern _ A T C _.

   Check a dictionary list:
   - BATCK – no
   - FATCA – yes, it’s an acronym (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) treated as a word in Scrabble lists.

   FATCA:
   – F, A, T, C, A
   – Contains only allowed letters (F, A, T, C, A – no eliminated letters)
   – Pattern: F(1) A(2) T(3) C(4) A(5)
   – Satisfies all constraints:
        * A and C placed correctly.
        * T now in position 3 (allowed).
        * No forbidden letters.

   FATCA seems to be the only straightforward valid word left in this narrow slot.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

After considering these, ""CRANE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:

- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This combination should help reveal or eliminate several key letters early on.

""CABIN"" - has N (invalid).  
""CAMPS"" - has P, S. C is 1st (invalid).  
""SCAMP"" - same issue.  
""SCARF"" - invalid R.  

Better candidate: ""SCAMP"" is invalid (N).  
Try ""CLASP"" - has L, S, P. C is 1st (invalid).  
""CARPS"" - has R (invalid).  

Re-evaluate: C cannot be 1st, A cannot be 3rd.  
Possible: ""MACAW"" - has W.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  
""SCARF"" - R invalid.  
""ACORN"" - has R, N invalid.  

Wait, let's try ""SCAMP"" again - no N. S C A M P.  
C is 2nd position (allowed), A is 3rd position (but feedback said A is wrong position, so A cannot be 3rd). Thus invalid.  

Next: ""CACHE"" - has E (invalid).  
""CAMPO"" - has O, P. C 1st (invalid), A 2nd (allowed).  
""CHASM"" - C 1st invalid.  
""CLAMS"" - C 1st invalid.  
""SCAM"" - too short.  

Realize: C must be in positions 2-5, A must be in positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).  
""SPACE"" - E invalid.  
""SCAMP"" - A invalid at 3rd.  
""SCALD"" - A at 3rd invalid.  
""SACCO"" - C at 4th, A at 2nd. Letters: S, A, C, C, O. Valid letters (no R/N/E).  
But ""SACCO"" has double C. Is it valid? Word must be 5-letter English word. ""SACCO"" is acceptable (meaning: savings and loan association).  

Check constraints:
- C is at positions 3 and 4 (feedback said C is in word but not 1st position - allowed).  
- A is at position 2 (feedback said A is in word but not 3rd - allowed).  
- Contains no R, N, E.  
- Uses new letters S, O.  

Thus ""SACCO"" seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SACCO -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) C(-) C(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know from the two guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - C is present but not in position 1.
  - A is present but not in position 3.
  - R, N, E are completely absent.

Guess 2: SACCO → S(x) A(✓) C(-) C(✓) O(x)
  - A is in position 2 (✓) — so the word has A in slot 2.
  - First C is in position 3 (-) — so C is somewhere else (not 3).
  - Second C is in position 4 (✓) — so C is in position 4.
  - S and O are absent.

Positions so far:
1: unknown (not S, O, R, N, E, C, A)
2: A
3: unknown (not C, A)
4: C
5: unknown (not S, O, R, N, E)

Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already eliminated ones).

We need a five-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- C in position 4
- No S, O, R, N, E
- C not in position 1 or 3 (already handled by C in 4)
- A not in position 3 (already handled)

Let’s list possible candidates fitting this pattern: _ A _ C _

Try TACIT – no, contains T, A, C, I, T; but T is allowed, I is allowed. TACIT uses A in slot 2 and C in slot 4, and only letters not yet excluded. It’s a common English word.

Check exclusions:
- T, A, C, I, T – none of S, O, R, N, E appear, and C is in position 4, A in 2.

Looks good.

Guess 3: TACIT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) C(-) I(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 2 = A (from Guess 2)
   - Position 4 = C (from Guess 2)

   So the pattern is: _ A _ C _

2. Letters confirmed present somewhere:
   - C (already placed at 4)
   - A (already placed at 2)
   - T (Guess 3: T(-) means T is in the word but **not** positions 1 or 5)
   - I (Guess 3: I(x) means I is **not** in the word)

3. Letters completely eliminated so far:
   - R, N, E, S, O, I

4. Therefore, remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5:
   - Allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Constraints:
     – Position 1: may be T (but T(-) says T is elsewhere, i.e. in 3)
     – Position 3: must be T (since T can only go here now)
     – Position 5: any remaining allowed letter

   So the pattern collapses to: _ A T C _

   Remaining candidates: any valid English word of form (letter) A T C (letter) using only still-allowed letters.

   Possible completions:
   - BATCY (invalid, Y only)
   - HATCH (invalid, H twice, C already at 4)
   - MATCH (invalid, M, A, T, C, H – but C already at 4, H still allowed)
   - PATCH (invalid, P, A, T, C, H – same issue)
   - WATCH (invalid, same reason)
   - CAT... pattern already filled.
   - Actually we need a word like “PATCA” – not valid.

   Let’s look systematically:
   Letters left for positions 1 and 5: any from {B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}

   Valid English five-letter words fitting *A T C *:
   - HATCH – but duplicate H not an issue, but word has C at 4 already (MATCH same)
   - No, we need *exact* pattern _ A T C _.

   Check a dictionary list:
   - BATCK – no
   - FATCA – yes, it’s an acronym (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) treated as a word in Scrabble lists.

   FATCA:
   – F, A, T, C, A
   – Contains only allowed letters (F, A, T, C, A – no eliminated letters)
   – Pattern: F(1) A(2) T(3) C(4) A(5)
   – Satisfies all constraints:
        * A and C placed correctly.
        * T now in position 3 (allowed).
        * No forbidden letters.

   FATCA seems to be the only straightforward valid word left in this narrow slot.

2. Letter statuses:
   - A is present (fixed at position 2); the second A in FATCA got (-), so the word contains only one A, which is already placed.
   - F, I, S, O, R, N, E are eliminated.
   - We now need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? A T C ? using letters not yet ruled out.

3. Candidates fitting _ A T C _:
   - Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Quick scan of common words:
        BATCY – invalid (no such word)
        DATUM – wrong pattern
        HATCH – C already used at 4
        LATKE – E eliminated
        MATCH – C taken
        PATCH – C taken
        WATCH – C taken
        GATCH – G A T C H (H still allowed, C already at 4)
        But “GATCH” is a recognized informal word (variant of “gatch” = a gate).
        Another common one: “PATCA” – invalid.
        “MATCA” – invalid.
        “LATCA” – invalid.
        “WATCA” – invalid.
        Only “GATCH” seems to fit.

   Double-check:
   - G A T C H → 5 letters, uses allowed letters, and fits the pattern _ A T C _.
   - H has not been eliminated.
