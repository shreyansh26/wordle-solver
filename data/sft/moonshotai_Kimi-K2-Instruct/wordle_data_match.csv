2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants. This helps maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

A popular starting word choice among Wordle players is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five of the most common vowels (A, E, O) and two very common consonants (R, S). This provides good coverage for elimination/confirmation of letters early on.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid first choice given its vowel coverage.

From the first guess AROSE we learned:
- A is in the word but not in the first position (-)
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere except position 1
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E

We need a word that:
- Has A in positions 2–5
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (no R, O, S, E)

Good remaining consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
Let’s choose a word that places A in a new spot and brings in fresh common letters.  
“FAINT” puts A in position 2, adds F, I, N, T—all still possible.

(Any alternative like “PLANT”, “CLAMP”, “GRANT” etc. would be fine too, but FAINT is simple and common.)

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, F, I, N
2. Letters definitely in the word:
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)
3. Therefore, positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be chosen from the remaining letters (excluding the 7 already ruled out).
   Remaining consonants to consider: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   Remaining vowels: none left except A (which is already fixed in position 2).
4. We still need to place T somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can’t be position 5).
5. We want a common word that uses the pattern _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _ or _ _ _ A _ (but A is locked in position 2) with T in one of the remaining slots and three other still-available consonants.

Let’s explore the pattern:
- Position 2 = A
- T must be in 1, 3, or 4
- Remaining consonants we’ll test: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but leaning toward common ones).

A common word that fits: “MATCH”  
- M, A, T, C, H – none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- T is in position 3 (allowed)
- Pattern: _ A T _ _ → valid
- Let’s verify: M, T, C, H not excluded, A fixed in position 2.

Another candidate could be “BATHT” but “BATHT” isn’t a valid word.  
“PATCH” is also valid, but I’ll go with MATCH.

(“PATCH” or “LATCH” would be equivalent backup choices.)
