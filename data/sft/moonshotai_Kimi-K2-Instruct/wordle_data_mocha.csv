For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to get as much information as possible. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize coverage. Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S. This gives us information about 5 very common letters right away.

Feedback recap for AROSE:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Only remaining letter from AROSE that could be elsewhere is O

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E
Letters still possible: A (but not first), O (but not third), plus many others.

We need a word that:
- Contains A somewhere other than first letter
- Contains O somewhere other than third letter
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E
- Uses other common consonants not yet ruled out

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H
Good vowels: we've used A and O, could try I or U

Possible candidates: 
- COULD (but S is out, and E is out, but this has U)
- MOUNT (but has N and T, no A)
- PLAIN (but has N, no O)
- COBIA (but has B and I, meets criteria)

Let's try COBIA - it has:
- C, B (new consonants)
- O (must not be third, here it's second - allowed)
- I (new vowel)
- A (not in first position - here it's fifth - allowed)
- No R, S, E

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize coverage. Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", etc. \n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains the vowels A, O, E and the common consonants R, S. This gives us information about 5 very common letters right away.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Feedback recap for AROSE:\n- A is in the word but NOT in position 1\n- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all\n- O is in the word but NOT in position 3\n- Only remaining letter from AROSE that could be elsewhere is O\n\nLetters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E\nLetters still possible: A (but not first), O (but not third), plus many others.\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Contains A somewhere other than first letter\n- Contains O somewhere other than third letter\n- Does NOT contain R, S, or E\n- Uses other common consonants not yet ruled out\n\nGood consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H\nGood vowels: we've used A and O, could try I or U\n\nPossible candidates: \n- COULD (but S is out, and E is out, but this has U)\n- MOUNT (but has N and T, no A)\n- PLAIN (but has N, no O)\n- COBIA (but has B and I, meets criteria)\n\nLet's try COBIA - it has:\n- C, B (new consonants)\n- O (must not be third, here it's second - allowed)\n- I (new vowel)\n- A (not in first position - here it's fifth - allowed)\n- No R, S, E\n\nSo COBIA seems to satisfy all constraints.\n\n<guess>COBIA</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current confirmed facts:\n- O is in the word and is in position 2.\n- A is in the word and is in position 5.\n- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, B, I.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with:\n- O in position 2.\n- A in position 5.\n- No R, S, E, B, I.\n\nThe pattern is: _ O _ _ A\n\nRemaining consonants available: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.\nRemaining vowels available: U (since A, E, I, O are spoken for).\n\nPossible words:\n- DOUMA (but U is allowed; M is allowed) → but has M and U\n- GONNA (but N is allowed) → but double N and fits\n- POLKA (K is allowed) → but has K and L\n- TOMAN (T, M, N allowed) → fits perfectly\n\nLet\'s pick ""TOMAN"" as it uses new common letters T, M, N and fits the pattern _O__A with no ruled-out letters.\n\n<guess>TOMAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)\nGuess 3: TOMAN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) M(-) A(-) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
Step-by-step deduction from all feedback so far:

1. Position 2 is definitely O → _ O _ _ _
2. Position 5 is definitely A → _ O _ _ A
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, B, I, T, N
4. Letters we know are in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: M, A (but A is fixed at 5), so only M remains floating (and it is NOT in position 3).

Therefore:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ A
- M is somewhere among the blanks except position 3.
- Allowed consonants left (excluding banned R,S,B,T,N): C, D, F, G, H, L, P, W, Y, etc.
- Allowed vowels left: U (only one left).

We need a word with O in slot 2, A in slot 5, and M somewhere in slot 1 or 4.

Possible candidates:
- M O _ _ A → MOCHA (C and H still allowed)
- _ O _ M A → DOUMA (but U is allowed, D and M allowed)
- _ O _ _ A with M in 4 → could be DOUMA, FOULY(no), etc.

Let's pick “MOCHA” because:
- M is in position 1 (allowed; not banned)
- O in 2, A in 5 correct
- C and H are still legal letters
- No banned letters appear
