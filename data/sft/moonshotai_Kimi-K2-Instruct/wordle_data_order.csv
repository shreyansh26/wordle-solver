For my first guess, I want to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels like A and E
2. Common consonants like R, S, T
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters that might be in the secret word.

The feedback tells me:
- R is in the word and in the right position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word is:
_ R _ _ _  (second letter is R)

And it must contain:
- O somewhere (not first or fourth position; original positions were 3rd and 5th)
- E somewhere (not fifth position; original position was 5th)

Also, we can eliminate:
All words with A or S.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep R in position 2.
2. Place O and E in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.).

Possible next words meeting these:
- BROKE (but O is in same 3rd spot, and we know it's wrong there)
- TROPE (O in 3rd again, same issue)
- IRONE (E in 5th again, same issue)
- DROVE (O in 3rd again)
- FROZE (O in 3rd, E in 5th - both wrong positions)
- GROWN (has O in 3rd - but we need to move it)

Better to try:
- PROVE (O in 3rd - no)
- CROWN (O in 3rd - no)
- TRIPE (E in 5th - no)
- GREET (E in 4th - could work, but double E)
- GROUP (O in 3rd - no)

Looking at words where:
- R is fixed in position 2
- O is moved to positions 1, 4, or 5
- E is moved to positions 1, 3, or 4

Best candidates:
- ORIEL (O at 1, E at 4)
- TROKE (O at 3 - but we know that's wrong)
- CRIED (E at 4)
- DRIER (but has R in 5th, might be OK)
- FRIED (E at 4)

""FRIED"" seems good:
- R in correct 2nd spot
- E in 4th spot (different from original 5th)
- I is a new vowel
- F and D are new consonants
- No A or S

But let me check if there's a better word with O moved:
""GROVE"":
- R in 2nd
- O in 3rd - but we know O can't be 3rd (from AROSE feedback)

Looking at words where O is in position 1:

This seems to satisfy:
- R in correct 2nd
- O moved from 3rd to 1st
- E moved from 5th to 4th
- New letters I, L
- No A or S

But is ""ORIEL"" a common enough word? It means a small pointed window.

Alternative: ""GRIOT"" - but has T at end which might not help much.

""CRUEL"":
- R in 2nd

- U is new vowel

- R in correct 2nd
- O moved from 3rd to 1st
- E must also be in word - but PROUD has no E
Wait, E must be in word per feedback (E- means E is in word wrong position)

So E must be somewhere.

Looking back:
We need:
- _ R _ _ _
- Must contain O and E
- O can't be 3rd, E can't be 5th
- No A or S

Possible positions:
O: 1,4,5
E: 1,3,4

Words that fit:
- O R E _ _ (but E would be 3rd - allowed)
- O R _ E _ (E 4th - allowed)
- O R _ _ E (but E can't be 5th)
- _ R O E _ (O 3rd - not allowed)

- _ R E _ O (E 3rd - allowed, O 5th - allowed)
- _ R _ E O (E 4th - allowed, O 5th - allowed)

Good candidates:
- ORECT (but is this a word?)
- OREAD (has A - eliminated)
- ORIEL (O 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, E 4th, L 5th) - valid word
- OREID (not a valid word)
- OREIC (not valid)

- R in 2nd

- E moved to 4th
- New letters I, L

From the two rounds of feedback:

- ORIEL → O(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) L(x)

This tells us:
1. Letters confirmed in their exact positions  
   O   R   _   E   _    (positions 1,2,4 are locked)

2. Letters eliminated  
   I and L are not in the word.

3. Remaining letters to find  
   We still need a 3rd and 5th letter, and we know from earlier that S and A are also out.  
   Common, unused consonants so far: T, N, D, G, C, F, B, M  
   Common, unused vowels: U (since A, I are out and O, E are placed)

4. Try to pick a word that fits O R _ E _  
   Possible completions:  
   - ORTEN (not a word)  
   - ORDER  
   - ORBED  
   - ORFEE (not common)  
   - ORMER (not common)  
   - ORGUE (not valid)  

   The most familiar valid word is ORDER:
   - Letters used: O, R, D, E, R  
   - No A, S, I, L  
   - Will test D in 3rd and R in 5th
