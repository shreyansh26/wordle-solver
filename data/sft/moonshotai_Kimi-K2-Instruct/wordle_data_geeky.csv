Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. I want to pick a word with frequently used letters in the English language - E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'm choosing ""CRANE"" because it contains 5 of the most common English letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across different letter positions. This should provide valuable information regardless of the secret word.

- Letters still out: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, Q, U, I, P
- Remaining viable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

- Uses only the remaining viable letters.

Possible patterns: _E___, __E__, ___E_  
Looking for high-frequency fresh letters among the still-allowed set: D, G, H, M, B, F, K, W

Good candidates:
- HEDGE (H, E, D, G, E) – E appears twice, but both positions 2 and 5 are invalid for E, so E would be in position 2 (valid) and 5 (invalid) – invalid overall.
- JEWEL – E is position 3 (valid), uses J, E, W, E, L – but L is already out.
- FIELD – I and L are out
- MERRY – R is out
- FUMED – U is out
- WEDGE – W, E, D, G, E – E in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 is invalid, so only position 2 counts. However, L is already out and E is repeated in invalid position 5.
- WHELM – no E at all.
- BEGEM – B, E, G, E, M – again E in position 2 (valid) and 4 (valid). But E in position 5 is invalid. Let's check: B(1), E(2), G(3), E(4), M(5). So E appears in positions 2 and 4, both allowed. No eliminated letters. This seems valid.

Actually, let's double-check BEGEM:
- B – allowed
- E – allowed in position 2
- G – allowed
- E – allowed in position 4
- M – allowed

No eliminated letters are used. This seems like a valid guess that places E in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed) and introduces new letters B, G, M.

Another viable option is GEMMY – but M and Y are allowed, E is in position 2 (valid). However, GEMMY has double M which might not be optimal for information gain.

BEGEM seems better as it introduces three fresh consonants (B, G, M) while keeping E in valid positions.

Let's verify:
- B – not eliminated
- E – allowed in positions 2,3,4
- G – not eliminated
- E – allowed in positions 2,3,4

BEGEM contains E in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed), and uses only letters from the allowed set.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,geeky,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. I want to pick a word with frequently used letters in the English language - E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'm choosing ""CRANE"" because it contains 5 of the most common English letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across different letter positions. This should provide valuable information regardless of the secret word.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

1. C is NOT in the word (x)
2. R is NOT in the word (x)
3. A is NOT in the word (x)
4. N is NOT in the word (x)
5. E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

With C, R, A, N eliminated, we want to test new common letters. Good remaining candidates include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P.

Since E must appear somewhere in the word (and can't be last), a solid second guess that uses many fresh common letters and places E in a new spot is:

- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E - places E in position 4
- SLIME: S, L, I, M, E - places E in position 5 (invalid per feedback)
- STOLE keeps E in position 4 (valid), and introduces S, T, O, L.

Another good option is ""STOLE"" as it tests 4 new common letters while respecting that E is not in position 5.

2. STOLE → S, T, O, L are out; E is also not in position 5 (again).

So far we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

We still know E must appear somewhere, and position 5 is forbidden for E.

Letters still in play include: D, I, U, G, H, M, P, F, B, Y, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Because we need to keep E somewhere in positions 1-4, we should choose a word that:
- Uses E in one of positions 1-4.
- Introduces as many fresh high-frequency letters as possible.
- Avoids any of the now-known-eliminated letters.

Good candidates:
- GUIDE: G, U, I, D, E — places E in position 5 → invalid.
- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E — C is out and E repeats. Not ideal.
- BRIEF: B, R, I, E, F — R is out.
- DWELL: D, W, E, L, L — L is out.
- BUDGE: B, U, D, G, E — E in position 5 → invalid.
- EQUIP: E, Q, U, I, P — no eliminated letters, E in position 1 (allowed).

EQUIP contains E in position 1 (allowed), and introduces Q, U, I, P — four new letters not yet tested.

   - E is in position 2.
   - E is NOT in positions 1, 4, 5.
   - G is in the word but not in position 3 (from BEGEM feedback: G-)

Letters still available (besides E):  
D, F, H, J, K, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word of pattern _E___ with:
- E fixed in position 2
- G somewhere (but not in position 3)  
- All other letters chosen from the still-available set

Candidate forms:  
D E _ _ _, F E _ _ _, H E _ _ _, J E _ _ _, K E _ _ _, V E _ _ _, W E _ _ _, Y E _ _ _

We must avoid G in position 3.

Good fresh letters to test: D, F, H, K, V, W, Y

Let’s pick a word that uses G plus three other fresh letters in a pattern that obeys the constraints.

Possibilities:
- WEDGE – W, E, D, G, E → G is in position 4 (allowed), but E repeats in position 5 (invalid) and G is not in position 3 (ok). However, E is already fixed at position 2 so E in position 5 is invalid.
- F E D G Y – not a valid English word.
- V E D G Y – not a word.
- H E D G E – same E-repeat problem as WEDGE.
- D E F G Y – not a word.
- J E D G Y – not a word.

Better to pick a word that keeps G out of position 3 and uses only one E (in position 2).

Looking for real English words:
- VEGAS – A is eliminated.
- VEGAN – A, N eliminated.
- J E G G Y – invalid letters & repetition.

Better: D E G A S – A eliminated.
Looking systematically, few common words follow _E_ _ _ with these letters.

A valid word that fits: “D E G F Y” isn’t valid; “W E G D Y” isn’t valid.

Real word check:
“WEDGE” – but it has E in position 5 → invalid.

“HEDGE” – same problem.

“FEDGE” – not a standard word.

“J E D G Y” – not a word.

“K E G G Y” – G repeats, E in position 2, G not in 3 (second G is in 4), K, G, Y allowed. But is KEGGY a valid word? It’s a colloquial form but probably not the best choice.

“W E G D Y” – not valid.

Next best: “D E G K Y” – not a word.

“V E G D Y” – not a word.

Instead, let’s try:
“V E G D Y” – invalid.

We seem to be stuck with limited choices. Another approach: use G in position 4 or 5, and fill the rest with fresh letters.

Test pattern _E_ _ _ with G in 4:  
D E _ G _ → D E F G Y – not a word.

_ E _ _ G → D E F Y G – not a word.

Real English word that fits: “WEDGY” – W, E, D, G, Y  
- Letters: W, E (pos 2), D, G (pos 4), Y  
- All letters allowed, G not in position 3, E only in position 2, single E.

“WEDGY” is a valid word meaning “wedgelike”.

Therefore:  
W E D G Y – positions 1-5
Positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), Y(5)

This satisfies every constraint we have so far.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,geeky,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. I want to pick a word with frequently used letters in the English language - E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain. Some excellent starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'm choosing ""CRANE"" because it contains 5 of the most common English letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across different letter positions. This should provide valuable information regardless of the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess CRANE, we learned:

1. C is NOT in the word (x)
2. R is NOT in the word (x)
3. A is NOT in the word (x)
4. N is NOT in the word (x)
5. E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

With C, R, A, N eliminated, we want to test new common letters. Good remaining candidates include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P.

Since E must appear somewhere in the word (and can't be last), a solid second guess that uses many fresh common letters and places E in a new spot is:

- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E - places E in position 4
- SLIME: S, L, I, M, E - places E in position 5 (invalid per feedback)
- STOLE keeps E in position 4 (valid), and introduces S, T, O, L.

Another good option is ""STOLE"" as it tests 4 new common letters while respecting that E is not in position 5.

<guess>STOLE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N are out; E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. STOLE → S, T, O, L are out; E is also not in position 5 (again).

So far we have eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

We still know E must appear somewhere, and position 5 is forbidden for E.

Letters still in play include: D, I, U, G, H, M, P, F, B, Y, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Because we need to keep E somewhere in positions 1-4, we should choose a word that:
- Uses E in one of positions 1-4.
- Introduces as many fresh high-frequency letters as possible.
- Avoids any of the now-known-eliminated letters.

Good candidates:
- GUIDE: G, U, I, D, E — places E in position 5 → invalid.
- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E — C is out and E repeats. Not ideal.
- BRIEF: B, R, I, E, F — R is out.
- DWELL: D, W, E, L, L — L is out.
- BUDGE: B, U, D, G, E — E in position 5 → invalid.
- EQUIP: E, Q, U, I, P — no eliminated letters, E in position 1 (allowed).

EQUIP contains E in position 1 (allowed), and introduces Q, U, I, P — four new letters not yet tested.

<guess>EQUIP</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: EQUIP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) Q(x) U(x) I(x) P(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N are out; E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. STOLE → S, T, O, L are out; E is also not in position 5 (again).
3. EQUIP → Q, U, I, P are out; E is not in position 1.

Therefore:
- E must be present, but NOT in positions 1 or 5.
- Letters still out: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, Q, U, I, P
- Remaining viable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E in position 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses only the remaining viable letters.

Possible patterns: _E___, __E__, ___E_  
Looking for high-frequency fresh letters among the still-allowed set: D, G, H, M, B, F, K, W

Good candidates:
- HEDGE (H, E, D, G, E) – E appears twice, but both positions 2 and 5 are invalid for E, so E would be in position 2 (valid) and 5 (invalid) – invalid overall.
- JEWEL – E is position 3 (valid), uses J, E, W, E, L – but L is already out.
- FIELD – I and L are out
- MERRY – R is out
- FUMED – U is out
- WEDGE – W, E, D, G, E – E in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 is invalid, so only position 2 counts. However, L is already out and E is repeated in invalid position 5.
- WHELM – no E at all.
- BEGEM – B, E, G, E, M – again E in position 2 (valid) and 4 (valid). But E in position 5 is invalid. Let's check: B(1), E(2), G(3), E(4), M(5). So E appears in positions 2 and 4, both allowed. No eliminated letters. This seems valid.

Actually, let's double-check BEGEM:
- B – allowed
- E – allowed in position 2
- G – allowed
- E – allowed in position 4
- M – allowed

No eliminated letters are used. This seems like a valid guess that places E in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed) and introduces new letters B, G, M.

Another viable option is GEMMY – but M and Y are allowed, E is in position 2 (valid). However, GEMMY has double M which might not be optimal for information gain.

BEGEM seems better as it introduces three fresh consonants (B, G, M) while keeping E in valid positions.

Let's verify:
- B – not eliminated
- E – allowed in positions 2,3,4
- G – not eliminated
- E – allowed in positions 2,3,4
- M – not eliminated

BEGEM contains E in positions 2 and 4 (both allowed), and uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know from the five guesses:

Letters eliminated so far (never appear):  
C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, Q, U, I, P, B, M, W, D, Y

Fixed letters and positions:
- Position 2: E  (from BEGEM and WEDGY both showing E ✓ in position 2)
- Position 5: Y  (from WEDGY showing Y ✓ in position 5)

Additional constraints on remaining letters:
- G is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from BEGEM and WEDGY showing G - both times).  
  Therefore G must be in position 1.

So the word must be of the form:  
G  E  _  _  Y

Letters still allowed for the two blanks (positions 3 and 4) are the ones that have never been guessed or eliminated.  
Eliminated letters so far include every letter except:  
E, G, Y (already used in fixed positions) and the rare letters F, H, J, K, V, X, Z.

We need two distinct letters from F, H, J, K, V, X, Z to fill positions 3 and 4.

Scanning the remaining combinations for real English words that fit G E _ _ Y:

GECKY – uses C (eliminated)  
GEEKY – uses E in position 3 (but E is already placed at position 2; repetition is not ruled out, but position 3 is open) – CHECK: E is allowed again, but is “GEEKY” valid? Yes, it’s a recognized word. However both letters are already known or allowed.

But we’re looking for new information, so let’s prefer a word that introduces new letters.

GEFJY – not a word  
GEHJY – not a word  
GEKVY – not a word  
GEKFY – not a word  
GEKZY – not a word  
GEKVY – not a word  
GEHVY – not a word  
GEHFY – not a word  
GEHFK – not ending in Y  

The only valid 5-letter English word that fits G E _ _ Y and uses letters from the allowed set is:

G E F K Y – but this isn’t standard.  
G E H K Y – not standard.  
G E K V Y – not standard.  

Actually, “GEEKY” is the only common word of form G E _ _ Y that is in the dictionary, even though it re-uses E. Since no other constraints forbid doubling, and it tests the last remaining common letters, “GEEKY” is the logical next guess.

Therefore:
