1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Since this is the first guess, I have no feedback to work from. The best strategy for an opening guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can quickly reveal useful information about the secret word. I'm choosing a word that includes:
- Common vowels (like A and E)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T)
- No repeated letters to maximize information gain

A strong opening word that fits these criteria is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters in 5-letter English words.

From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains the letter A, but not at position 2. Also, it has none of R, I, S, E. We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in one of positions 1, 3, 4, 5
- Contains none of R, I, S, E
- Other letters must be from the remaining alphabet (T, N, L, C, O, D, B, M, etc.)

A good next guess might be a word like ""COAST"" but that has S which is ruled out. ""PLANT"" has P, L, N, T with A in position 3. ""PLANT"" uses common letters and places A in position 3, and none of the excluded letters.

Let me check: P, L, A, N, T - none are in the excluded set (R, I, S, E), and A is in position 3 which would satisfy it being in the word but not position 2.

So ""PLANT"" seems like a good second guess.

First, summarize what we now know from both pieces of feedback.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: not in the word  
- A: in the word but NOT in position 2  
- I: not in the word  
- S: not in the word  
- E: not in the word  

From Guess 2 (PLANT):
- P: not in the word  
- L: not in the word  
- A: in the word AND in position 3  
- N: in the word but NOT in position 4  
- T: in the word but NOT in position 5  

Combining these facts:
1. The third letter is A.
2. The word contains N (not in position 4) and T (not in position 5).
3. Forbidden letters so far: R, I, S, E, P, L.
4. Therefore positions 1, 2, 4, 5 can be any letters except those six.

Possible remaining letters that are still allowed (common ones to test): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still need to place N and T somewhere else:
- N: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1, 2, 5)
- T: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is A, so 1, 2, 4)

Pick a guess that uses both N and T in new slots and fills the remaining positions with other common, still-allowed letters. A good candidate is “CHANT”:
- C, H, N, A, T  
- A is correctly in position 3.  
- N is in position 2 (new slot).  
- T is in position 5 (new slot).  
- C and H are still-allowed common consonants that haven’t been tested yet.
