For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good starting word should:
1. Use common English letters
2. Have a mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique positions

Some popular and effective starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""ROATE"". These contain common vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, T, R, N, L) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's well-balanced with common letters and no repeats.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is correct in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: S _ A _ E

Letters we know are in the word: S, A, E (all already placed correctly).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T.

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4. Let’s think of common 5-letter words that fit S _ A _ E.

Possible candidates:
- SHADE (but D and H are not yet ruled in or out)
- SPARE (P and R are not yet ruled in or out)
- SCALE (but L is already ruled out)
- STAVE (T is ruled out)
- SHAVE (H and V not ruled out yet)
- SPADE (P and D not ruled out)

The most common letters left for positions 2 and 4 among these are P, R, H, D, V. Let me pick a word that uses common letters and avoids the eliminated ones (L, T).

I’ll go with ""SHARE"" because:
- It keeps S, A, E in their correct places.
- It introduces H and R, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- It fits the pattern S _ A _ E perfectly.

This should give us more information about H and R.
