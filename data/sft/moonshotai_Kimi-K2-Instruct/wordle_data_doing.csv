For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words have a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Looking at the structure, ""SLATE"" is a popular first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that could appear in many possible secret words. Let's go with SLATE as our first guess.

The first guess SLATE got all five letters marked with “x,” which means none of S, L, A, T, or E appear anywhere in the secret word. So we can completely discard any words containing those letters.

Now we need to pick a second guess made entirely from letters NOT in {S, L, A, T, E}. An effective strategy is to choose a word that uses the next most common remaining letters to maximize information gain. The remaining high-frequency letters include R, O, I, N, C, U, D, H, etc.

A well-known second-guess candidate that avoids S, L, A, T, E is “ROUND,” which contains:
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- U (second-most common vowel)
- N and D (common consonants)

Alternatively, “CRONY” or “DUMBO” would also work, but “ROUND” is clean and uses letters with high frequency.

Let’s go with ROUND.

We now know:

- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U
- Letters confirmed in the word: O (position 2) and N (position 4)
- Letter D is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ N _ with D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already taken by N).

Let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ O _ N _ and contain D somewhere in positions 1 or 3.

- D O _ N _: possible third letters (avoiding S, L, A, T, E, R, U): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
- _ O D N _: letters before O can be any not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- DOING (but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is fixed at 4, yet we need to check if any letters are eliminated) — I is allowed, G is allowed, but N is at 4, so DOING is DO I N G — wait, this is 5 letters: D-O-I-N-G. Positions: 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G. This fits _ O _ N _ with D in position 1. No eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, R, U) are used.
- PODGY: but P-O-D-G-Y — D is at 3, which is allowed, but we have to check if P, G, Y are allowed. They are not eliminated.
