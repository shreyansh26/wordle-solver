For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, O, I. 

One popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- These letters appear frequently in English 5-letter words, giving us a good chance to eliminate or confirm several letters early.

This is a well-balanced first guess that should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

The feedback from SLATE was all “x”, meaning none of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates those five letters entirely, so our next guess should avoid them.

We still have 21 letters to work with. To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
- uses entirely new letters (no S,L,A,T,E)
- includes several more common vowels (I, O, U) and high-frequency consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.)

A good balanced choice is “ROUND”:
- vowels: O, U  
- consonants: R, N, D  
None of these letters overlap with the eliminated set.

This should give us good coverage of remaining common letters and further narrow the possibilities.

From the feedback:

- ROUND: R(-) O(x) U(x) N(✓) D(x)

We know:

1. N is in the correct position (5th letter).
2. R is in the word but not in the 1st position.
3. O, U, D are not in the word at all.
4. S, L, A, T, E were already ruled out by the first guess.

So far ruled-out letters: S, L, A, T, E, O, U, D.

Remaining letters (still possible): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in N, containing R somewhere other than the first position, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list some candidate words ending in N:

- BRAIN (but A, I are allowed, but A is ruled out)
- CROWN (O is ruled out)
- CRANE (A, E are ruled out)
- BRING (B, R, I, N, G) - I is allowed, G is allowed, ends in N, R is not first, uses allowed letters
- FRING (F, R, I, N, G) - similar to above
- PRING (P, R, I, N, G)
- CRING (C, R, I, N, G)

BRING seems like a good choice: common letters, tests B, I, G (new), and we already know R is in the word but not 1st.

Let’s verify:
- B: new
- R: must be in word (from ROUND feedback), and not first, so could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th here.
- I: new vowel
- N: fixed at 5th
- G: new consonant

This should give us good coverage.
