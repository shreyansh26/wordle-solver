Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback to work from, the best approach is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. A word that incorporates several of these would be ideal. 

Words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"" are popular first guesses because they contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, O or I)
- Common consonants (R, S, T)
- Good spread across different positions

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- No duplicate letters

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: in word but not in 3rd position (-)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but not in 5th position (-)

What we know so far:
1. The letters A, R, S are NOT in the word at all.
2. The letters O and E are in the word, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new word that:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S
- Does contain both O and E
- Avoids O in position 3 and E in position 5

Common letters left to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, F, H, etc.

Let's think of words with O and E that don't have A/R/S. Possible candidates:
- O in position 1: e.g., OLDEN (but has N, D - let's see)
- O in position 2: e.g., POWER (but has R which is banned)
- O in position 4: e.g., CLOWN (but W is less common)
- O in position 5: e.g., VOGUE (but has G, U)

Looking at positions:
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

A good candidate is ""OLDEN"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O is in position 1 (valid)
- E is in position 4 (valid)
- Uses common letters L, N, D

Another candidate is ""BONEY"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O in position 2, E in position 5 - but we know E cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.

""DEMON"":

""OFTEN"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O in position 1, E in position 4 - both valid
- Uses F, T, N which are common

""OLDEN"" and ""OFTEN"" are both good. ""OFTEN"" uses more common letters (F, T, N) compared to ""OLDEN"" (L, D, N), so I'll go with OFTEN.

From the new feedback on OFTEN:

- O: still in the word but not in position 1 (-)

Updated knowledge:
1. Banned letters: A, R, S, F, T, N
2. O must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 3
3. E is locked in at position 4
4. We still need three more letters, none of which are A, R, S, F, T, N

Useful remaining common letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a word with:
- O in position 2 or 4 or 5 (not 1 or 3)
- E fixed at position 4
- No banned letters

Because E is at 4, O cannot be at 4, so O must be at 2 or 5.

Possibilities:
- O in 2: _ O _ E _ → need two other letters
- O in 5: _ _ _ E O → need two other letters

Possible letter combos for:
O in 2: C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
O in 5: same set

Let’s list some candidates that fit:
- BOGEY (B, G, Y – but E is 4, so BOGEY is B O G E Y) – but Y is common, G is common
- DOGME – has M, E is at 4, but M is allowed, but word validity?
- MOVED – V, D are allowed, but D is allowed
- VOGUE – V, G, U are allowed
- COVEY – C, V, Y are allowed
- WOVEN – W, V, N – but N is banned
- BOGEY: B, O, G, E, Y – all letters allowed, positions fit (O at 2, E at 4)
- LODGE: L, O, D, G, E – O at 2, E at 4, all letters allowed

Between BOGEY and LODGE, BOGEY uses Y which is slightly less common, LODGE uses L, D, G which are all very common. LODGE is also a more common word.

Check LODGE:
- L: allowed
- O: allowed, in position 2 (valid, since banned positions for O are 1 and 3)
- D: allowed

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. A word that incorporates several of these would be ideal. 

Words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"" are popular first guesses because they contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, O or I)
- Common consonants (R, S, T)
- Good spread across different positions

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- No duplicate letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: in word but not in 3rd position (-)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but not in 5th position (-)

What we know so far:
1. The letters A, R, S are NOT in the word at all.
2. The letters O and E are in the word, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new word that:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S
- Does contain both O and E
- Avoids O in position 3 and E in position 5

Common letters left to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, F, H, etc.

Let's think of words with O and E that don't have A/R/S. Possible candidates:
- O in position 1: e.g., OLDEN (but has N, D - let's see)
- O in position 2: e.g., POWER (but has R which is banned)
- O in position 4: e.g., CLOWN (but W is less common)
- O in position 5: e.g., VOGUE (but has G, U)

Looking at positions:
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

A good candidate is ""OLDEN"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O is in position 1 (valid)
- E is in position 4 (valid)
- Uses common letters L, N, D

Another candidate is ""BONEY"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O in position 2, E in position 5 - but we know E cannot be in position 5, so this is invalid.

""DEMON"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O in position 3 - invalid (from feedback)

""OFTEN"":
- Contains O and E
- Does not contain A, R, S
- O in position 1, E in position 4 - both valid
- Uses F, T, N which are common

""OLDEN"" and ""OFTEN"" are both good. ""OFTEN"" uses more common letters (F, T, N) compared to ""OLDEN"" (L, D, N), so I'll go with OFTEN.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OFTEN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) F(x) T(x) E(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on OFTEN:

- O: still in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- F, T, N: not in the word at all (x)
- E: now confirmed in position 4 (✓)

Updated knowledge:
1. Banned letters: A, R, S, F, T, N
2. O must appear somewhere other than positions 1 or 3
3. E is locked in at position 4
4. We still need three more letters, none of which are A, R, S, F, T, N

Useful remaining common letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a word with:
- O in position 2 or 4 or 5 (not 1 or 3)
- E fixed at position 4
- No banned letters

Because E is at 4, O cannot be at 4, so O must be at 2 or 5.

Possibilities:
- O in 2: _ O _ E _ → need two other letters
- O in 5: _ _ _ E O → need two other letters

Possible letter combos for:
O in 2: C, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
O in 5: same set

Let’s list some candidates that fit:
- BOGEY (B, G, Y – but E is 4, so BOGEY is B O G E Y) – but Y is common, G is common
- DOGME – has M, E is at 4, but M is allowed, but word validity?
- MOVED – V, D are allowed, but D is allowed
- VOGUE – V, G, U are allowed
- COVEY – C, V, Y are allowed
- WOVEN – W, V, N – but N is banned
- BOGEY: B, O, G, E, Y – all letters allowed, positions fit (O at 2, E at 4)
- LODGE: L, O, D, G, E – O at 2, E at 4, all letters allowed

Between BOGEY and LODGE, BOGEY uses Y which is slightly less common, LODGE uses L, D, G which are all very common. LODGE is also a more common word.

Check LODGE:
- L: allowed
- O: allowed, in position 2 (valid, since banned positions for O are 1 and 3)
- D: allowed
- G: allowed
- E: fixed at 4

LODGE seems the safest choice.

Updated knowledge after the third guess:

1. Banned letters: A, R, S, F, T, N, D  
2. Letters that are in the word (and their known positions or exclusions):
   - O is confirmed at position 2 (from LODGE feedback)  
   - E is confirmed at position 4 (from OFTEN feedback)  
3. From LODGE feedback:
   - L: in the word but not at position 1 (-)  
   - G: in the word but not at position 4 (-)  

So we know the word looks like:  
_ O _ E _  
and it must contain L and G somewhere *other* than their previous positions.  
Extra constraints: the missing letters must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned letters) and must still be common enough to make a valid 5-letter word.

Allowed letters left:  
B, C, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the letters already confirmed (O, E) and the letters known to be in the word (L, G).

Because L and G must appear, and we already have O at position 2 and E at position 4, the remaining blanks are positions 1, 3, and 5.  
We need to place L and G plus one more allowed letter in those three positions.

Possible permutations:  
- L in 1, G in 3, then need a 5th letter for position 5  
- G in 1, L in 3, then need a 5th letter for position 5  
- L in 1, G in 5, then need a 3rd letter for position 3  
- G in 1, L in 5, then need a 3rd letter for position 3  
- L in 3, G in 5, then need a 1st letter for position 1  
- G in 3, L in 5, then need a 1st letter for position 1  

Let’s list candidate words that fit the pattern and check if they use only allowed letters.

Examples:
- G O L E _ : need a final letter.  “GOLEM” is 5 letters, but M is allowed.  
  G O L E M → letters: G, O, L, E, M — all allowed; positions: G at 1 (allowed), O at 2 (correct), L at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (correct), M at 5 (allowed).  
  No banned letters, no duplicates of banned positions.  This looks valid.

Other possibilities:
- L O G E _ : need last letter. “LOGES” has S (banned) → invalid.  
- B O L E G: G is in position 5 (allowed), but is BOLEG a word? Not standard.  
- P O L E G: POLEG is not a standard word.  

GOLEM is the clearest valid word fitting all constraints.
