For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common consonants and vowels are good starting points. Some strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" because they use frequently occurring letters. 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E

""RAISE"" seems particularly good because it includes R, A, I, S, E - with R, S, and E being very common in 5-letter words, plus A and I which are common vowels. This gives us a good spread of letters to test.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are now known NOT to be in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, for the second guess I should pick a word that contains none of those letters but still uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

The remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, and the remaining vowels are O and U (since A, I, E are out).  
A word that combines several of these high-frequency unused letters is “MOUNT” (M, O, U, N, T).  
This gives us two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (M, N, T) to test in one guess.

We now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, T
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: O, N

So the secret word contains both O and N (each at least once), and none of the 8 letters above.  
Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels (other than O): only Y might serve as a vowel; other vowels A, E, I, U are already out.

Since we know O and N are present, a good next guess places each of them in new positions and adds fresh common letters.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and N
2. Contains none of R, A, I, S, E, M, U, T
3. Uses common remaining letters

Thinking of common 5-letter words that fit:  
- “BLOND” – but D is fine, L and B are allowed, and it has O and N  
- “CONGO” – but C, G are allowed  
- “FONDL” – not common enough  
- “BLOND” looks like the best mix of common letters and new positions for O and N.

Current confirmed information:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, T, B, D
- Letters IN the word and their positions:
  – L is in position 2 (✓).
  – O is in position 3 (✓).
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).

So the pattern so far is:
_ L O _ _  
and N must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is already L, so positions 1, 4, or 5).

Remaining unused common letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z.

No vowels left except maybe Y, so we can treat Y as a vowel. We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5 (since 2 and 3 are fixed as L and O respectively), and N must fit in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5).

Possible structures:
- N _ L O _  
- _ L O N _  
- _ L O _ N  

Looking for common words fitting these:

- F L O W N → uses F, L, O, W, N → check if all letters are allowed (yes), and N is in position 5 (allowed so far).
- C L O C K → but C repeats, and we’d need to test K (possible, but less common).
- G L O W N → same as FLOWN but starts with G (less common than F).

""FLOWN"" seems the most common and uses fresh letters F and W.

Let’s go with FLOWN.
