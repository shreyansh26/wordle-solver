For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are good choices. A well-regarded first guess is ""AROSE"" because it includes the top 5 most common letters in Wordle answers (A, R, O, S, E). This provides a strong foundation to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (x) – R is not in the word.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 5).

So the unknown pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ E, with O somewhere but not in position 3, and no A, R, or S.

Good consonants to test next include T, L, N, M, C, H, D, etc. Since we still have almost all positions unknown, we want a word that:
- ends in E,
- contains O but never in the third position,
- avoids A, R, S.

“T O N E” fits that pattern but is only four letters. A valid five-letter word that meets the constraints is “T O N E” plus a letter, but we need to maintain the ending E. “T O N E” + Y → “TONEY” isn’t a valid word. “O C T E” is only four letters. Let’s try “M O D E” + N → “MONDE” isn’t valid. “D O N E” + ? → “DONNE” is valid. However “DONNE” repeats N twice and doesn’t give new info. 

A cleaner word is “T O N E” + T → “TOTEN” is invalid. Another approach is to use T in position 1, O in position 2, and common consonants in positions 3 and 4 while keeping E in position 5. A valid word is “TOWER”: T in 1, O in 2, W in 3, E in 4, but 4 isn’t E. We need E in position 5. 

Valid word: “T O N E” → “TONE” is too short. “T O N E” plus another letter: “TONEY” isn’t valid. Let’s pick “T O X E” → “TOXEN” isn’t valid. 

Another valid word with O in position 2, E in 5, and no A,R,S: “T O U C E” isn’t valid. “P O U C E” is valid. 

A simpler valid word is “P O U C E” which is 5 letters, ends in E, has O not in position 3, avoids A,R,S.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
2. POUCE → P(x) O(-) U(-) C(✓) E(✓)

Known facts:
- Word ends in E (position 5 is E).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (POUCE) → O must be in position 1 or 4.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (POUCE) → C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so C is in 1, 2, or 3.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (POUCE) → U must be in position 1, 2, 4.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O somewhere in 1 or 4, containing C somewhere in 1-3, and containing U somewhere in 1, 2, 4.

Let’s look for a pattern like:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ C E or O _ C _ E or O C _ _ E
- If O is in position 4: _ _ _ O E (but then C must fit in positions 1-3 and U must fit in 1,2,4. Position 4 is O, so U must be in 1 or 2).

Try position 1 as O:
O _ _ C E → only 3rd and 4th letters unknown, must include U. So O _ U C E → ""OUCE"" is too short, ""OUNCE"" is valid and uses all constraints: O in 1, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5. But C can't be in 4 from POUCE feedback (C was in 4 and got ✓ but position 4 in POUCE was C, so C is not in 4 in the secret word). So C is not in 4. Thus O _ _ C E is invalid.

O _ C _ E → need U in 2 or 3. O U C _ E → ""OUC_E"" → ""OUCH E"" no, ""OUCIE"" invalid. Not working.

O C _ _ E → need U in 2 or 3 or 4. O C U _ E → ""OCU_E"" → ""OCULE"" is 5 letters but ""OCULE"" isn't a valid word. ""OCULI"" ends in I. 

Try position 4 as O:
_ _ _ O E → C must be in 1-3, U must be in 1-2. Possible: C U _ O E → ""C U _ O E"" → ""CUBOE"" invalid. ""CUMOE"" invalid. ""CUNOE"" invalid. ""CUROE"" invalid (R is out). 

C _ U O E → ""C A U O E"" invalid (A is out). ""C H U O E"" invalid. 

_ C U O E → ""B C U O E"" invalid. 

U _ _ O E → U _ C O E → ""U L C O E"" invalid. 

U C _ O E → ""U C L O E"" invalid. 

Alternative: position 1 as O and C in 3:
O _ C _ E → need U in 2 or 4. O U C _ E → ""O U C _ E"" → ""OUCKE"" invalid. O _ C U E → ""O M C U E"" invalid.

Another approach: look for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in 1 or 4, C in 1-3, U in 1,2,4, and no A,R,S,P. 

Scanning vocabulary:
- ""OCEAN"" – C is in 2, but A is out.
- ""OUTER"" – R is out.
- ""OCTET"" – ends in T.
- ""OCHRE"" – R is out.
- ""OUNCE"" – C is in 4, but from POUCE feedback C is not in 4 (POUCE had C in 4 as ✓, so C is not in 4 in secret word). So ""OUNCE"" is invalid.
- ""OUBLIE"" – too long.
- ""COUPE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, U in 3, P is out.
- ""CLOVE"" – ends in E, C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, but O can't be in 3 (from AROSE).
- ""CLOTE"" – O in 3 invalid.
- ""CUBED"" – ends in D.
- ""COMBE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, M in 3, B in 4, E in 5. This fits: no A,R,S,P; O is in 2 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), U is not present but doesn't have to be (only U(-) in POUCE means U is in the word somewhere, so must use U). So ""COMBE"" lacks U.

Wait, POUCE feedback says U(-), so U is in the word but not in position 3. So word must contain U, O, C, E, and no A,R,S,P.

Let’s fit:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (not in 3), C (not in 4), U (not in 3).

Possible pattern: _ _ _ _ E with C, O, U placed appropriately.

Try ""OUNCE"" – but C is in 4, and from POUCE C was in 4 and got ✓ (meaning C is in word but not in 4), so ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Try ""COUDE"" – invalid word.

""COULE"" – invalid.

""COUPE"" – P is out.

""CLOVE"" – O in 3 invalid.

""COTTE"" – no U.

""CUTIE"" – has I and T, but C in 1, U in 2, T in 3, I in 4, E in 5. This has U and C, but O is missing.

""CUTIE"" lacks O, but O must be present.

""CONGE"" – N in 3, O in 2, C in 1, G in 4, E in 5. No U.

""CONTE"" – no U.

""COUDE"" – invalid.

""COULE"" – invalid.

""COVEY"" – ends in Y.

""COUPE"" – P out.

""COURE"" – invalid.

""COUSE"" – C in 1, O in 2, U in 3, S in 4 (S is out), E in 5. Invalid.

""CUTER"" – R out.

""CUTIE"" – lacks O.

""DOUCE"" – D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5. But C in 4 is invalid (from POUCE). 

""DOUCE"" invalid.

""DOUCE"" same issue.

""LOUCE"" – invalid word.

""LOUGE"" – invalid.

""LOUIE"" – lacks C.

""LOUPE"" – P out.

""LOUSE"" – S out.

""MOUCE"" – invalid.

""MOUGE"" – invalid.

""NOUCE"" – invalid.

""NOUGE"" – invalid.

""OUNCE"" – C in 4 invalid.

""TOUCH"" – ends in H.

""TOUCE"" – invalid.

""TOUGE"" – invalid.

""TOUPE"" – P out.

""TOUSE"" – S out.

""VOUCE"" – invalid.

""VOUGE"" – invalid.

""VOULE"" – invalid.

""YOUCE"" – invalid.

""ZOUCH"" – invalid.

Seems stuck. Re-examine constraints:

Word must:
- end in E.
- contain O (not in 3).
- contain C (not in 4).
- contain U (not in 3).
- exclude A,R,S,P.

Possible positions:
O must be in 1,2, or 4 (but not 3).
C must be in 1,2,3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 1,2,3.
U must be in 1,2,4 (not 3 or 5).

Let’s try O in 1:
O _ _ _ E
C must be in 2 or 3.
U must be in 2 or 4.

Case 1: C in 2, U in 4: O C U _ E → ""OCU_E"" → ""OCULE"" invalid.

Case 2: C in 3, U in 2: O U C _ E → ""OUC_E"" → ""OUCK E"" invalid.

Case 3: C in 3, U in 4: O _ C U E → valid word: ""ONCUE"" but that's 5 letters: O,N,C,U,E. But N hasn't been tested. 

""ONCUE"" fits:
- ends in E.
- O in 1 (allowed, not in 3).
- C in 3 (allowed, not in 4).

<guess>ONCUE</guess>",ONCUE,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
2. POUCE → P(x) O(-) U(-) C(✓) E(✓)

Known facts:
- Word ends in E (position 5 is E).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (POUCE) → O must be in position 1 or 4.
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (POUCE) → C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so C is in 1, 2, or 3.
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (POUCE) → U must be in position 1, 2, 4.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O somewhere in 1 or 4, containing C somewhere in 1-3, and containing U somewhere in 1, 2, 4.

Let’s look for a pattern like:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ C E or O _ C _ E or O C _ _ E
- If O is in position 4: _ _ _ O E (but then C must fit in positions 1-3 and U must fit in 1,2,4. Position 4 is O, so U must be in 1 or 2).

Try position 1 as O:
O _ _ C E → only 3rd and 4th letters unknown, must include U. So O _ U C E → ""OUCE"" is too short, ""OUNCE"" is valid and uses all constraints: O in 1, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5. But C can't be in 4 from POUCE feedback (C was in 4 and got ✓ but position 4 in POUCE was C, so C is not in 4 in the secret word). So C is not in 4. Thus O _ _ C E is invalid.

O _ C _ E → need U in 2 or 3. O U C _ E → ""OUC_E"" → ""OUCH E"" no, ""OUCIE"" invalid. Not working.

O C _ _ E → need U in 2 or 3 or 4. O C U _ E → ""OCU_E"" → ""OCULE"" is 5 letters but ""OCULE"" isn't a valid word. ""OCULI"" ends in I. 

Try position 4 as O:
_ _ _ O E → C must be in 1-3, U must be in 1-2. Possible: C U _ O E → ""C U _ O E"" → ""CUBOE"" invalid. ""CUMOE"" invalid. ""CUNOE"" invalid. ""CUROE"" invalid (R is out). 

C _ U O E → ""C A U O E"" invalid (A is out). ""C H U O E"" invalid. 

_ C U O E → ""B C U O E"" invalid. 

U _ _ O E → U _ C O E → ""U L C O E"" invalid. 

U C _ O E → ""U C L O E"" invalid. 

Alternative: position 1 as O and C in 3:
O _ C _ E → need U in 2 or 4. O U C _ E → ""O U C _ E"" → ""OUCKE"" invalid. O _ C U E → ""O M C U E"" invalid.

Another approach: look for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in 1 or 4, C in 1-3, U in 1,2,4, and no A,R,S,P. 

Scanning vocabulary:
- ""OCEAN"" – C is in 2, but A is out.
- ""OUTER"" – R is out.
- ""OCTET"" – ends in T.
- ""OCHRE"" – R is out.
- ""OUNCE"" – C is in 4, but from POUCE feedback C is not in 4 (POUCE had C in 4 as ✓, so C is not in 4 in secret word). So ""OUNCE"" is invalid.
- ""OUBLIE"" – too long.
- ""COUPE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, U in 3, P is out.
- ""CLOVE"" – ends in E, C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, but O can't be in 3 (from AROSE).
- ""CLOTE"" – O in 3 invalid.
- ""CUBED"" – ends in D.
- ""COMBE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, M in 3, B in 4, E in 5. This fits: no A,R,S,P; O is in 2 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), U is not present but doesn't have to be (only U(-) in POUCE means U is in the word somewhere, so must use U). So ""COMBE"" lacks U.

Wait, POUCE feedback says U(-), so U is in the word but not in position 3. So word must contain U, O, C, E, and no A,R,S,P.

Let’s fit:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (not in 3), C (not in 4), U (not in 3).

Possible pattern: _ _ _ _ E with C, O, U placed appropriately.

Try ""OUNCE"" – but C is in 4, and from POUCE C was in 4 and got ✓ (meaning C is in word but not in 4), so ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Word must:
- end in E.
- contain O (not in 3).
- contain C (not in 4).
- contain U (not in 3).
- exclude A,R,S,P.

Possible positions:
O must be in 1,2, or 4 (but not 3).
C must be in 1,2,3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 1,2,3.
U must be in 1,2,4 (not 3 or 5).

Let’s try O in 1:
O _ _ _ E
C must be in 2 or 3.
U must be in 2 or 4.

Case 1: C in 2, U in 4: O C U _ E → ""OCU_E"" → ""OCULE"" invalid.

Case 2: C in 3, U in 2: O U C _ E → ""OUC_E"" → ""OUCK E"" invalid.

Case 3: C in 3, U in 4: O _ C U E → valid word: ""ONCUE"" but that's 5 letters: O,N,C,U,E. But N hasn't been tested. 

""ONCUE"" fits:
- ends in E.
- O in 1 (allowed, not in 3).
- C in 3 (allowed, not in 4).
- U in 4 (allowed, not in 3).
- letters: O,N,C,U,E – no A,R,S,P.

Is ""ONCUE"" a valid word? Yes, it means ""at the right time"" or is a variant of ""on cue"".

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,OUNCE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are good choices. A well-regarded first guess is ""AROSE"" because it includes the top 5 most common letters in Wordle answers (A, R, O, S, E). This provides a strong foundation to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A (x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R (x) – R is not in the word.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 5).

So the unknown pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ E, with O somewhere but not in position 3, and no A, R, or S.

Good consonants to test next include T, L, N, M, C, H, D, etc. Since we still have almost all positions unknown, we want a word that:
- ends in E,
- contains O but never in the third position,
- avoids A, R, S.

“T O N E” fits that pattern but is only four letters. A valid five-letter word that meets the constraints is “T O N E” plus a letter, but we need to maintain the ending E. “T O N E” + Y → “TONEY” isn’t a valid word. “O C T E” is only four letters. Let’s try “M O D E” + N → “MONDE” isn’t valid. “D O N E” + ? → “DONNE” is valid. However “DONNE” repeats N twice and doesn’t give new info. 

A cleaner word is “T O N E” + T → “TOTEN” is invalid. Another approach is to use T in position 1, O in position 2, and common consonants in positions 3 and 4 while keeping E in position 5. A valid word is “TOWER”: T in 1, O in 2, W in 3, E in 4, but 4 isn’t E. We need E in position 5. 

Valid word: “T O N E” → “TONE” is too short. “T O N E” plus another letter: “TONEY” isn’t valid. Let’s pick “T O X E” → “TOXEN” isn’t valid. 

Another valid word with O in position 2, E in 5, and no A,R,S: “T O U C E” isn’t valid. “P O U C E” is valid. 

A simpler valid word is “P O U C E” which is 5 letters, ends in E, has O not in position 3, avoids A,R,S.

“POUCE” is a valid guess.

O C U _ E → ""OCU_E"" → ""OCULE"" is 5 letters but ""OCULE"" isn\'t a valid word. ""OCULI"" ends in I. \n\nTry position 4 as O:\n_ _ _ O E → C must be in 1-3, U must be in 1-2. Possible: C U _ O E → ""C U _ O E"" → ""CUBOE"" invalid. ""CUMOE"" invalid. ""CUNOE"" invalid. ""CUROE"" invalid (R is out). \n\nC _ U O E → ""C A U O E"" invalid (A is out).

O U C _ E → ""O U C _ E"" → ""OUCKE"" invalid. O _ C U E → ""O M C U E"" invalid.\n\nAnother approach: look for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in 1 or 4, C in 1-3, U in 1,2,4, and no A,R,S,P. \n\nScanning vocabulary:\n- ""OCEAN"" – C is in 2, but A is out.\n- ""OUTER"" – R is out.\n- ""OCTET"" – ends in T.\n- ""OCHRE"" – R is out.\n- ""OUNCE"" – C is in 4, but from POUCE feedback C is not in 4 (POUCE had C in 4 as ✓, so C is not in 4 in secret word). So ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n- ""OUBLIE"" – too long.\n- ""COUPE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, U in 3, P is out.\n- ""CLOVE"" – ends in E, C in 1, L in 2, O in 3, but O can\'t be in 3 (from AROSE).\n- ""CLOTE"" – O in 3 invalid.\n- ""CUBED"" – ends in D.\n- ""COMBE"" – ends in E, C in 1, O in 2, M in 3, B in 4, E in 5. This fits: no A,R,S,P; O is in 2 (allowed), C in 1 (allowed), U is not present but doesn\'t have to be (only U(-) in POUCE means U is in the word somewhere, so must use U). So ""COMBE"" lacks U.\n\nWait, POUCE feedback says U(-), so U is in the word but not in position 3. So word must contain U, O, C, E, and no A,R,S,P.\n\nLet’s fit:\n- Ends in E.\n- Contains O (not in 3), C (not in 4), U (not in 3).\n\nPossible pattern: _ _ _ _ E with C, O, U placed appropriately.\n\nTry ""OUNCE"" – but C is in 4, and from POUCE C was in 4 and got ✓ (meaning C is in word but not in 4), so ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\nTry ""COUDE"" – invalid word.\n\n""COULE"" – invalid.\n\n""COUPE"" – P is out.\n\n""CLOVE"" – O in 3 invalid.\n\n""COTTE"" – no U.\n\n""CUTIE"" – has I and T, but C in 1, U in 2, T in 3, I in 4, E in 5. This has U and C, but O is missing.\n\n""CUTIE"" lacks O, but O must be present.\n\n""CONGE"" – N in 3, O in 2, C in 1, G in 4, E in 5. No U.\n\n""CONTE"" – no U.\n\n""COUDE"" – invalid.\n\n""COULE"" – invalid.\n\n""COVEY"" – ends in Y.\n\n""COUPE"" – P out.\n\n""COURE"" – invalid.\n\n""COUSE"" – C in 1, O in 2, U in 3, S in 4 (S is out), E in 5. Invalid.\n\n""CUTER"" – R out.\n\n""CUTIE"" – lacks O.\n\n""DOUCE"" – D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5.

From the latest feedback:

- O(✓) – O is in position 1.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(-) – C is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in position 5.

So the pattern is:
O _ _ _ E

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P.

Possible positions for C, N, U:
- C can be in 2 or 4 (since it can't be in 3 and 1 and 5 are taken).
- N can be in 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 2).
- U can be in 2 or 3 (since it can't be in 4 and 1 and 5 are taken).

Let's check possible combinations:

Option 1: C in 2:
O C _ _ E
Then N and U must fit in 3 and 4.
- U can't be in 4, so U must be in 3, then N in 4: O C U N E → ""OCUNE"" – not a valid word.
- N can't be in 2 (already not), so N in 3 or 4. If N in 3, U must be in 4, but U can't be in 4. So no valid words here.

Option 2: C in 4:
O _ _ C E
Then N and U must fit in 2 and 3.
- N can't be in 2, so N must be in 3, then U in 2: O U N C E → ""OUNCE"" – valid word and fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- O in 1: ✓
- U in 2: allowed (U(-) only said not in 4)
- N in 3: allowed (N(-) only said not in 2)
- C in 4: allowed (C(-) only said not in 3)
- E in 5: ✓
- No A, R, S, P used.
