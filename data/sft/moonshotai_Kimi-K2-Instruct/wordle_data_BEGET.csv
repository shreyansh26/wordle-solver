For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)

I'll go with **SLATE** as it's widely regarded as one of the best starting words due to its coverage of common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). This should provide good initial feedback on multiple fronts.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Therefore the secret word:
- does NOT contain S, L, A
- DOES contain T and E, but:
  – T is not in the 4th position.
  – E is not in the 5th position.

We now want a word that:
- uses T and E in new positions,
- avoids S, L, A,
- introduces other common consonants/vowels to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ETHER – uses E twice (but we already know E exists), and H, R.
- RETCH – uses E, T plus R, C, H.
- CRETE – uses E twice, plus C, R, T.

I’ll pick **RETCH** because it places E in position 2 and T in position 4, testing new positions for both required letters while adding R, C, H.

- T is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (since in SLATE it was position 4 and got (-), and in BETON it was position 3 and got (-))

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)

I'll go with **SLATE** as it's widely regarded as one of the best starting words due to its coverage of common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). This should provide good initial feedback on multiple fronts.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x).
- T and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Therefore the secret word:
- does NOT contain S, L, A
- DOES contain T and E, but:
  – T is not in the 4th position.
  – E is not in the 5th position.

We now want a word that:
- uses T and E in new positions,
- avoids S, L, A,
- introduces other common consonants/vowels to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ETHER – uses E twice (but we already know E exists), and H, R.
- RETCH – uses E, T plus R, C, H.
- CRETE – uses E twice, plus C, R, T.

I’ll pick **RETCH** because it places E in position 2 and T in position 4, testing new positions for both required letters while adding R, C, H.

Letters we know:
- NOT in the word: S, L, A, R, C, H  
- ARE in the word: E (position 2 is correct), T (somewhere, but not 4th)

Word must be 5 letters long and contain:
- E in the 2nd position (✓ from RETCH)
- T somewhere else (cannot be 4th, and cannot be 3rd because RETCH already had T in 3rd and got “-” instead of ✓)

So positions so far:
1: ?
2: E
3: ?
4: not T
5: ? (and E is not here)

A good next word should:
- Hold E at position 2
- Place T in a new valid spot (1, 3, or 5)
- Introduce new common letters (N, D, I, O, U, M, P, etc.)

Candidate words:
- “TENET” – but repeats E and N is unknown.
- “PETER” – P, T, R (R is already out), so bad.
- “DEBIT” – B is okay, but T at 5 is allowed; however E must stay in 2.
- “METER” – M ok, but R is out.
- “BETEL” – L is out.
- “BETON” – uses B, N, O which are still possible and puts T at 3 (acceptable).

Let’s try BETON (B-E-T-O-N).
