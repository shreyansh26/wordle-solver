For the first guess, I don't have any prior information about the secret word, so a good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong opening word would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. Among these, ""RAISE"" contains 5 unique common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage. It's better than words with repeated letters since each letter provides unique feedback. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess because:
1. All letters are unique
2. Uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters
3. Has a good vowel/consonant balance
4. Is a common word (so feedback will be meaningful)

From the first guess (RAISE) the feedback is:

R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position.
A(x)  → A is not in the word.
I(x)  → I is not in the word.
S(x)  → S is not in the word.
E(x)  → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word does not contain A, I, S, or E.
- It must contain an R, but not in position 1.

Since four vowels are ruled out, the remaining vowels are O and U. The common consonants still available include T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, Y, V, W, Z, plus the R we know is present.

A good second guess should:
1. Place the R in a new position (positions 2-5).
2. Use consonants that weren’t in the first guess.
3. Possibly introduce the remaining vowels O or U.

One strong pattern is to place R in position 2 and use common consonants around it. A word like ""FRONT"" uses F (new), R (correct letter, new position), O (new vowel), N (common), T (common). Another candidate is ""BROTH"". Between these, ""BROTH"" has slightly higher letter frequency for B, R, O, T, H.

Let’s go with ""BROTH"" because:
- R is now in position 2 (good test spot).
- Introduces O and H, plus B and T which are common.
- All letters are unique and none are from the eliminated set (A, I, S, E).

Current deductions:
• R is in the word and must be in position 2 (because the second guess BROTH gave R(✓) in slot 2).
• Letters A, I, S, E, B, O, T, H are all absent.
• So the pattern is: _ R _ _ _

Remaining vowels: U (only one vowel left)

We need three more letters from the above set to fill slots 1, 3, 4, 5, with the requirement that the word is valid.

A good next guess would:
- Keep R fixed in position 2.
- Introduce as many fresh high-frequency consonants and the remaining vowel U as possible without repeating eliminated letters.

Candidate words that fit _ R _ _ _ and use new letters:
- CRUMB (C-R-U-M-B) – but B is eliminated.
- DRUNK (D-R-U-N-K) – all letters new and valid.
- FRUMP (F-R-U-M-P) – all letters new and valid.
- GRUNT (G-R-U-N-T) – T is eliminated.
- PRUNE (P-R-U-N-E) – E is eliminated.

Among these, ""DRUNK"" uses D, R, U, N, K. All letters are still allowed and high frequency. It also uses the only remaining vowel U. This is a strong next guess for maximum information.
