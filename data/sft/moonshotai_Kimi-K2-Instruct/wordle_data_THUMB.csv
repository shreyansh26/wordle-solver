For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many possible target words. 

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All these letters are among the most frequently occurring in English
3. It can help identify the presence/absence of these common letters early
4. The arrangement allows for good positional feedback

This is a widely recommended starting word among Wordle enthusiasts for these reasons.

None of the five letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word, so I must now pick a word composed entirely from the remaining 20 letters.

From the feedback:

- Letters known to exist in the word: T, H, U, M  
- Letters known **not** to exist: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, P  
- Correct positions so far:
  – T is in position 1  
  – H is in position 2  
  – U is in position 3  
  – M is in position 4  

So the secret word is:
T H U M ?

We now need to determine the final letter.  
The remaining unused common letters (after eliminating all disqualified ones above) include, for example, B, C, D, F, G, J, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick check of valid 5-letter English words beginning with “THUM”:

THUMB: valid  
THUMP: invalid (P already ruled out)  

“THUMB” uses only letters not yet ruled out and fits the fixed positions.

Thus THUMB is the logical next guess (and almost certainly the correct word).
