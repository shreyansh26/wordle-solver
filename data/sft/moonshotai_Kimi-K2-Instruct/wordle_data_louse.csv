For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters and provides maximum information about potential letter positions.

So far we know:
1. The last two letters are fixed: _ _ _ S E
2. The letters O and U both appear in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 (because in HOUSE and MOUSE they were marked “✓” for those spots, yet neither guess solved the puzzle).
3. Therefore O and U must occupy positions 1 and 2 (in either order) or one of them must be in position 3 (with the other earlier).  
   However, position 3 is the only remaining unknown before the fixed “SE”.  
   The simplest placement is O U in positions 1–2 or U O in positions 1–2.

Let’s test O U _ S E first.  
The blank spot must be a consonant not yet ruled out (not R, A, I, H, M, O, U, S, E).  
Common possibilities: B, C, D, F, G, L, N, P, T, etc.  
A common word that fits: O U S E already ends in OUSE, but we need a consonant in position 3.  
Wait — if O and U are in positions 1 and 2, we’d get O U ? S E.  
The only common English word of that form is “OUPSE” (not common) or “OUNCE” (but that ends in CE, not SE).  
So reversing: U O _ S E.  
A familiar word is “U O ? S E”.  
A common word that matches this pattern is “USAGE” but it ends in AGE, not SE.  
Wait — let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in SE that contain O and U, and don’t contain R, A, I, H, M.  
Valid candidates: DOUSE, GOOSE, JOUSE, LOUSE, NOOSE, POUSE, ROUSE (R out), SOUSE (S already in place), TOUSE.  
From that list we have already tried HOUSE and MOUSE.  
The remaining plausible ones are: DOUSE, LOUSE, NOOSE, TOUSE, GOOSE.  
Among them, LOUSE is common and hasn’t been tried.  
Let’s pick LOUSE.
