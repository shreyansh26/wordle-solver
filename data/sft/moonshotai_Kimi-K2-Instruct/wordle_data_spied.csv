Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters to test their presence
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique positions

Common letters in English words include: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B

A strong starting word is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 unique letters
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

From the first two rounds we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the secret word: A, R, O, T, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the secret word: S and E  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is somewhere other than positions 2 or 4 (it appeared in those places but got “-” both times).  
   - E is somewhere other than positions 2, 5 (from arose) and now also not 4 (from tense).

That means possible positions for E are 1 or 3.  
Possible positions for S are 1, 3, 5 (but can’t be 2 or 4).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E exactly once each (no repeats of letters we already know are out).  
- Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (so avoid A, R, O, T, N).  
- Places E in position 1 or 3.  
- Places S in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s list available letters we haven’t tested yet, avoiding the banned ones:  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (since E is already known to be present, and A, O are out).

A good candidate that fits:
- E in position 1, S in position 5: “E” + _ _ _ + “S” → Let’s try “E” + L + I + D + “S” → “ELIDS” is not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: E in position 3, S in position 1: S _ E _ _ → “SPELL” – but P and L are still allowed. “SPELL” has two L’s, which is okay since we haven’t ruled out L, but it has no second E. However, it also has two L’s, which might waste a letter.  
Another word: “SPICE” – contains C and I, but “I” is acceptable since not ruled out. Let’s check:  
S in 1, P in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5. This satisfies:
- S in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (but we know E can’t be in 5 from Guess 1) – so this is bad.  
Back to constraints: E must be in 1 or 3.

Try E in 1, S in 5: “E” + _ _ _ + “S”. Possible middle letters: use B, I, L, etc.  
“EBILS” – not a word.  
“EDITS” – has D, I, T, but T is banned.  
“ELVES” – has L, V, E, S. E in 1, S in 5. No banned letters (A, R, O, T, N), and L, V are new.  
“ELVES” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s double-check:
- Letters used: E, L, V, E, S – only E and S are known to be in the word; L and V are new tests.  
- Positions: E is in 1 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).  
- No banned letters.

   - E is somewhere other than positions 2, 5 (from arose) and now also not 4 (from tense).

That means possible positions for E are 1 or 3.  
Possible positions for S are 1, 3, 5 (but can’t be 2 or 4).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E exactly once each (no repeats of letters we already know are out).  
- Uses only letters that have NOT been ruled out (so avoid A, R, O, T, N).  
- Places E in position 1 or 3.  
- Places S in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s list available letters we haven’t tested yet, avoiding the banned ones:  
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (since E is already known to be present, and A, O are out).

A good candidate that fits:
- E in position 1, S in position 5: “E” + _ _ _ + “S” → Let’s try “E” + L + I + D + “S” → “ELIDS” is not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: E in position 3, S in position 1: S _ E _ _ → “SPELL” – but P and L are still allowed. “SPELL” has two L’s, which is okay since we haven’t ruled out L, but it has no second E. However, it also has two L’s, which might waste a letter.  
Another word: “SPICE” – contains C and I, but “I” is acceptable since not ruled out. Let’s check:  
S in 1, P in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5. This satisfies:
- S in 1 (allowed), E in 5 (but we know E can’t be in 5 from Guess 1) – so this is bad.  
Back to constraints: E must be in 1 or 3.

Try E in 1, S in 5: “E” + _ _ _ + “S”. Possible middle letters: use B, I, L, etc.  
“EBILS” – not a word.  
“EDITS” – has D, I, T, but T is banned.  
“ELVES” – has L, V, E, S. E in 1, S in 5. No banned letters (A, R, O, T, N), and L, V are new.  
“ELVES” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s double-check:
- Letters used: E, L, V, E, S – only E and S are known to be in the word; L and V are new tests.  
- Positions: E is in 1 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed).  
- No banned letters.

“ELVES” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Use common letters to test their presence
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique positions

Common letters in English words include: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B

A strong starting word is ""AROSE"" because:
- It uses 5 unique letters
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 4th)  
E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th)  

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O
- Letters definitely included: S, E
- S is not in the 4th position
- E is not in the 5th position

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E
2. Does not contain A, R, or O
3. Places S somewhere other than the 4th position
4. Places E somewhere other than the 5th position

I’ll look for a word that re-uses S and E while introducing new common consonants (T, N, L, I, etc.) and keeps the excluded letters out. A good choice is “TENSE”:
- T, N, S, E are all valid letters (no A, R, O)
- S is in the 3rd position (not 4th)
- E is in the 2nd and 4th positions (not 5th)

From the four guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, T, N, L, V, K

Letters KNOWN to be in the correct positions (✓):
S (position 1), P (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 4)

Letters known to be in the word but still needing placement:
E is already fixed at position 4, so no other E needed.
S, P, I, E are all placed correctly in positions 1-4.

We need just one more letter for position 5 that:
- Has NOT been ruled out (not in A, R, O, T, N, L, V, K)
- Hasn't been used yet in these positions (S, P, I, E are already placed)

Available letters not yet used or ruled out:
B, C, D, F, G, H, M, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern: S P I E _

Looking at valid English words:
- SPIES - but S is already used in position 1
- SPIEL - L is ruled out
- SPITE - T is ruled out
- SPIKE - K is ruled out
- SPICE - C is allowed (not ruled out yet)

SPIEC is not a word, but let's check:
- SPIED - D is allowed
- SPIEL - L ruled out
- SPIES - S repeated
- SPICA - A ruled out
- SPICY - C, Y allowed
- SPIKE - K ruled out
- SPILT - L, T ruled out

The most likely valid word is ""SPICY"" with C and Y both being new test letters, or ""SPIED"" with D being new. Between these, ""SPIED"" seems more common.

But let's verify SPICY:
S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) C(_) Y(_)
C and Y haven't been ruled out yet, and we know position 4 is E, so SPICY would actually be S P I C Y - but we need E in position 4. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, our pattern is S P I E _ (positions 1-4 fixed as S, P, I, E).

Valid words ending with E already have position 5 determined by the remaining letter, but we need position 5 to be a new letter.

Looking at the pattern S P I E _, we need to find a word that starts with SPIE and has a 5th letter that's allowed. The only common 5-letter word is ""SPIED"" (past tense of spy), where D is a new letter not yet tested or ruled out.

This fits perfectly:
- S P I E D
- All letters except D are already confirmed in their positions
- D hasn't been ruled out yet
