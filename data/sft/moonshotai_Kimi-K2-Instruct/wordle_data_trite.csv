For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters.

Some strong opening words include ""STONE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters
2. It includes 4 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
3. It has a good balance of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)

After considering these options, I believe ""AROSE"" will give me the most useful feedback for my first guess.

From the feedback:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 2
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 5

So we know:
- The word has pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters used so far: A, O, S are out
- Letters remaining to consider: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Good candidates should fit _R__E and avoid A, O, S. Possible letters for remaining positions (1,3,4) that are common and haven't been ruled out: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, H, etc.

Some possible words:
- TRICE (but C is position 4, E is already position 5, and we don't know about C yet)
- TRIPE (P is less common)
- URINE (but U is 1st letter, R 2nd, I 3rd, N 4th, E 5th)
- CRIME (C 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, M 4th, E 5th)
- PRIDE (P 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, D 4th, E 5th)

""TRICE"" seems like a strong choice because:
- It uses common letters T, R, I, C, E
- It fits _RICE pattern, with R and E already confirmed
- It tests new letters T, I, C in positions 1,3,4

But let me check if ""URINE"" or ""DRIVE"" might be better. Actually, ""DRIVE"" is excellent because:
- D is common and untested
- R is confirmed in position 2
- I and V are new letters
- E is confirmed in position 5

However, ""DRIVE"" has V which is less common. ""TRICE"" might be more informative with high-frequency letters.

Actually, let's consider ""TRITE"" but that repeats T. ""TRIBE"" is good but B is less common. 

""CRIME"" is decent but C and M are less common than other options.

""PRICE"" is a strong candidate using P, R, I, C, E - all good letters except P is less common.

After reconsidering, ""TRIBE"" might be better than ""TRICE"" because B is slightly less common but T is very common. However, ""TRIBE"" has B which is less common.

""TRIPE"" uses P which is lower frequency.

""URINE"" uses U which is less common.

""WRITE"" would be perfect but W hasn't been tested yet and is less common.

""BRIDE"" would use B which is less common.

""GRIME"" uses G which is less common.

""TRICE"" seems to be the best balance of common letters and new information.

But wait - let me re-examine the confirmed positions: _R__E. 

""TRIBE"" is T-R-I-B-E - but B is less common.
""TRIPE"" is T-R-I-P-E - P is less common.
""CRIME"" is C-R-I-M-E - C and M are less common.

Actually, ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E - D is good, V is less common.

""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E - P is less common.

""TRIBE"" might still be best among these.

However, ""TRICE"" uses C which is okay but not great.

Let me think differently - what about ""FRIED""? F is less common.

""FRISE"" has S which is out.

""GRIDE"" has G which is less common.

I think ""TRIBE"" is the best available option here.

But actually, ""TRIBE"" might not be optimal because B is less common. Let me try ""TRICE"" instead as C is slightly more common than B.

After careful consideration, ""TRIBE"" seems slightly better as it tests T, I, B in new positions while keeping R and E fixed.

Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- E is confirmed in position 5
- A, O, S are not in the word

My next guess will test new common letters in the remaining positions. I'll use ""TRIBE"" which fits the pattern _R__E and introduces T, I, B as new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ R _ _ E (R fixed in position 2, E fixed in position 5).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, B.
3. Letters newly found in the word and in the correct place: T (position 1) and I (position 3).

The remaining candidates must be 5-letter English words that fit the pattern “T R I _ E”.

Possible letters for the 4th position (excluding A, O, S, B):

Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  
Common vowels: U (E and I already used, A and O ruled out)

Quick scan of real words:
- TRICE → C is allowed, and C wasn’t ruled out.
- TRIKE → K is allowed.
- TRINE → N is allowed.
- TRIPE → P is allowed.
- TRIBE → B is already ruled out.

Among these, “TRICE” and “TRIKE” are both valid. Between them, C and K have similar frequency, but “TRICE” is slightly more common, so I’ll try it first.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters.

Some strong opening words include ""STONE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters
2. It includes 4 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
3. It has a good balance of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)

After considering these options, I believe ""AROSE"" will give me the most useful feedback for my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 2
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 5

So we know:
- The word has pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters used so far: A, O, S are out
- Letters remaining to consider: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Good candidates should fit _R__E and avoid A, O, S. Possible letters for remaining positions (1,3,4) that are common and haven't been ruled out: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, H, etc.

Some possible words:
- TRICE (but C is position 4, E is already position 5, and we don't know about C yet)
- TRIPE (P is less common)
- URINE (but U is 1st letter, R 2nd, I 3rd, N 4th, E 5th)
- CRIME (C 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, M 4th, E 5th)
- PRIDE (P 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, D 4th, E 5th)

""TRICE"" seems like a strong choice because:
- It uses common letters T, R, I, C, E
- It fits _RICE pattern, with R and E already confirmed
- It tests new letters T, I, C in positions 1,3,4

But let me check if ""URINE"" or ""DRIVE"" might be better. Actually, ""DRIVE"" is excellent because:
- D is common and untested
- R is confirmed in position 2
- I and V are new letters
- E is confirmed in position 5

However, ""DRIVE"" has V which is less common. ""TRICE"" might be more informative with high-frequency letters.

Actually, let's consider ""TRITE"" but that repeats T. ""TRIBE"" is good but B is less common. 

""CRIME"" is decent but C and M are less common than other options.

""PRICE"" is a strong candidate using P, R, I, C, E - all good letters except P is less common.

After reconsidering, ""TRIBE"" might be better than ""TRICE"" because B is slightly less common but T is very common. However, ""TRIBE"" has B which is less common.

""TRIPE"" uses P which is lower frequency.

""URINE"" uses U which is less common.

""WRITE"" would be perfect but W hasn't been tested yet and is less common.

""BRIDE"" would use B which is less common.

""GRIME"" uses G which is less common.

""TRICE"" seems to be the best balance of common letters and new information.

But wait - let me re-examine the confirmed positions: _R__E. 

""TRIBE"" is T-R-I-B-E - but B is less common.
""TRIPE"" is T-R-I-P-E - P is less common.
""CRIME"" is C-R-I-M-E - C and M are less common.

Actually, ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E - D is good, V is less common.

""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E - P is less common.

""TRIBE"" might still be best among these.

However, ""TRICE"" uses C which is okay but not great.

Let me think differently - what about ""FRIED""? F is less common.

""FRISE"" has S which is out.

""GRIDE"" has G which is less common.

I think ""TRIBE"" is the best available option here.

But actually, ""TRIBE"" might not be optimal because B is less common. Let me try ""TRICE"" instead as C is slightly more common than B.

After careful consideration, ""TRIBE"" seems slightly better as it tests T, I, B in new positions while keeping R and E fixed.Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- E is confirmed in position 5
- A, O, S are not in the word

My next guess will test new common letters in the remaining positions. I'll use ""TRIBE"" which fits the pattern _R__E and introduces T, I, B as new letters to test.

But wait - let me re-examine the confirmed positions: _R__E. 

""TRIBE"" is T-R-I-B-E - but B is less common.
""TRIPE"" is T-R-I-P-E - P is less common.
""CRIME"" is C-R-I-M-E - C and M are less common.

Actually, ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E - D is good, V is less common.

""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E - P is less common.

""TRIBE"" might still be best among these.

However, ""TRICE"" uses C which is okay but not great.

Let me think differently - what about ""FRIED""? F is less common.

""FRISE"" has S which is out.

""GRIDE"" has G which is less common.

I think ""TRIBE"" is the best available option here.

But actually, ""TRIBE"" might not be optimal because B is less common. Let me try ""TRICE"" instead as C is slightly more common than B.

After careful consideration, ""TRIBE"" seems slightly better as it tests T, I, B in new positions while keeping R and E fixed.Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- E is confirmed in position 5
- A, O, S are not in the word

My next guess will test new common letters in the remaining positions. I'll use ""TRIBE"" which fits the pattern _R__E and introduces T, I, B as new letters to test.

- TRIKE → K is allowed.
- TRINE → N is allowed.

Among these, “TRICE” and “TRIKE” are both valid. Between them, C and K have similar frequency, but “TRICE” is slightly more common, so I’ll try it first.The pattern is now T R I _ E, and only the fourth letter is unknown. Trying the most common unused consonant, I’ll go with “C”.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 2
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 5

So we know:
- The word has pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters used so far: A, O, S are out
- Letters remaining to consider: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Good candidates should fit _R__E and avoid A, O, S. Possible letters for remaining positions (1,3,4) that are common and haven't been ruled out: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, H, etc.

Some possible words:
- TRICE (but C is position 4, E is already position 5, and we don't know about C yet)
- TRIPE (P is less common)
- URINE (but U is 1st letter, R 2nd, I 3rd, N 4th, E 5th)
- CRIME (C 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, M 4th, E 5th)
- PRIDE (P 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, D 4th, E 5th)

""TRICE"" seems like a strong choice because:
- It uses common letters T, R, I, C, E
- It fits _RICE pattern, with R and E already confirmed
- It tests new letters T, I, C in positions 1,3,4

But let me check if ""URINE"" or ""DRIVE"" might be better. Actually, ""DRIVE"" is excellent because:
- D is common and untested
- R is confirmed in position 2
- I and V are new letters
- E is confirmed in position 5

However, ""DRIVE"" has V which is less common. ""TRICE"" might be more informative with high-frequency letters.

Actually, let's consider ""TRITE"" but that repeats T. ""TRIBE"" is good but B is less common. 

""CRIME"" is decent but C and M are less common than other options.

""PRICE"" is a strong candidate using P, R, I, C, E - all good letters except P is less common.

After reconsidering, ""TRIBE"" might be better than ""TRICE"" because B is slightly less common but T is very common. However, ""TRIBE"" has B which is less common.

""TRIPE"" uses P which is lower frequency.

""URINE"" uses U which is less common.

""WRITE"" would be perfect but W hasn't been tested yet and is less common.

""BRIDE"" would use B which is less common.

""GRIME"" uses G which is less common.

""TRICE"" seems to be the best balance of common letters and new information.

But wait - let me re-examine the confirmed positions: _R__E. 

""TRIBE"" is T-R-I-B-E - but B is less common.
""TRIPE"" is T-R-I-P-E - P is less common.
""CRIME"" is C-R-I-M-E - C and M are less common.

The most frequent letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these high-frequency letters as possible without repeating letters.\n\nSome strong opening words include ""STONE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:\n1. It uses 5 distinct letters\n2. It includes 4 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)\n3. It has a good balance of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)\n\nAfter considering these options, I believe ""AROSE"" will give me the most useful feedback for my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- A is not in the word (x)\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 2\n- O is not in the word (x)\n- S is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — position 5\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has pattern: _ R _ _ E\n- Letters used so far: A, O, S are out\n- Letters remaining to consider: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.\n\nGood candidates should fit _R__E and avoid A, O, S. Possible letters for remaining positions (1,3,4) that are common and haven\'t been ruled out: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, H, etc.\n\nSome possible words:\n- TRICE (but C is position 4, E is already position 5, and we don\'t know about C yet)\n- TRIPE (P is less common)\n- URINE (but U is 1st letter, R 2nd, I 3rd, N 4th, E 5th)\n- CRIME (C 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, M 4th, E 5th)\n- PRIDE (P 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, D 4th, E 5th)\n\n""TRICE"" seems like a strong choice because:\n- It uses common letters T, R, I, C, E\n- It fits _RICE pattern, with R and E already confirmed\n- It tests new letters T, I, C in positions 1,3,4\n\nBut let me check if ""URINE"" or ""DRIVE"" might be better. Actually, ""DRIVE"" is excellent because:\n- D is common and untested\n- R is confirmed in position 2\n- I and V are new letters\n- E is confirmed in position 5\n\nHowever, ""DRIVE"" has V which is less common. ""TRICE"" might be more informative with high-frequency letters.\n\nActually, let\'s consider ""TRITE"" but that repeats T. ""TRIBE"" is good but B is less common. \n\n""CRIME"" is decent but C and M are less common than other options.\n\n""PRICE"" is a strong candidate using P, R, I, C, E - all good letters except P is less common.\n\nAfter reconsidering, ""TRIBE"" might be better than ""TRICE"" because B is slightly less common but T is very common. However, ""TRIBE"" has B which is less common.\n\n""TRIPE"" uses P which is lower frequency.\n\n""URINE"" uses U which is less common.\n\n""WRITE"" would be perfect but W hasn\'t been tested yet and is less common.\n\n""BRIDE"" would use B which is less common.\n\n""GRIME"" uses G which is less common.\n\n""TRICE"" seems to be the best balance of common letters and new information.\n\nBut wait - let me re-examine the confirmed positions: _R__E. \n\n""TRIBE"" is T-R-I-B-E - but B is less common.\n""TRIPE"" is T-R-I-P-E - P is less common.\n""CRIME"" is C-R-I-M-E - C and M are less common.\n\nActually, ""DRIVE"" is D-R-I-V-E - D is good, V is less common.\n\n""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E - P is less common.\n\n""TRIBE"" might still be best among these.\n\nHowever, ""TRICE"" uses C which is okay but not great.\n\nLet me think differently - what about ""FRIED""? F is less common.\n\n""FRISE"" has S which is out.\n\n""GRIDE"" has G which is less common.\n\nI think ""TRIBE"" is the best available option here.\n\nBut actually, ""TRIBE"" might not be optimal because B is less common. Let me try ""TRICE"" instead as C is slightly more common than B.\n\nAfter careful consideration, ""TRIBE"" seems slightly better as it tests T, I, B in new positions while keeping R and E fixed.Based on the feedback:\n- R is confirmed in position 2\n- E is confirmed in position 5\n- A, O, S are not in the word\n\nMy next guess will test new common letters in the remaining positions. I\'ll use ""TRIBE"" which fits the pattern _R__E and introduces T, I, B as new letters to test.\n\n<guess>TRIBE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: TRIBE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(✓) B(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.
