For the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to gather maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It covers 5 distinct letters
- Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many words
- Includes common consonants (R, S) that often appear in various positions
- This should give us a good baseline to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses

From the first guess AROSE, we have:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 2nd letter
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Letters we know:
- R is at position 2
- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively
- O and E are not in the word

We need a new word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Contains A and S but not in positions 1 and 4
3. Does not contain O or E
4. Has 5 letters

Possible positions for A and S:
- A could be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is R), so 3,4,5
- S could be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but position 2 is R), so 1,3,5

Let's think of words with R as the 2nd letter and trial some:
- CRISP: C R I S P – but S is in position 4 which was marked wrong (S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked -)
- DRANK: D R A N K – A is in position 3 which is acceptable, but does it have S? No.
- GRAFT: G R A F T – has A in position 3, but no S
- TRASH: T R A S H – has A in position 3 and S in position 4 (but S was wrong in position 4 in AROSE)
- BRASH: B R A S H – has A in 3 and S in 4 (same issue)
- CRASS: C R A S S – double S, but S is in position 4 (wrong)
- URSAE: has E which is out
- IRATE: has E and O is out
- FRISK: F R I S K – R at 2, S at 4 (but S was wrong at 4)
- GRASP: G R A S P – A at 3, S at 4 (S wrong at 4)
- CRUST: C R U S T – S at 4 (wrong)
- TRUST: T R U S T – same
- PRISM: P R I S M – S at 4 (wrong)
- DRIPS: D R I P S – S at 5 which is acceptable! (S was in position 4 wrong, so 5 is new position)

DRIPS:
- D is new
- R is correctly at 2
- I is new
- P is new
- S is at 5 (was at 4 wrong, so this is new position)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting known constraints.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to gather maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It covers 5 distinct letters
- Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many words
- Includes common consonants (R, S) that often appear in various positions
- This should give us a good baseline to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, we have:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 2nd letter
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Letters we know:
- R is at position 2
- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively
- O and E are not in the word

We need a new word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Contains A and S but not in positions 1 and 4
3. Does not contain O or E
4. Has 5 letters

Possible positions for A and S:
- A could be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is R), so 3,4,5
- S could be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but position 2 is R), so 1,3,5

Let's think of words with R as the 2nd letter and trial some:
- CRISP: C R I S P – but S is in position 4 which was marked wrong (S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked -)
- DRANK: D R A N K – A is in position 3 which is acceptable, but does it have S? No.
- GRAFT: G R A F T – has A in position 3, but no S
- TRASH: T R A S H – has A in position 3 and S in position 4 (but S was wrong in position 4 in AROSE)
- BRASH: B R A S H – has A in 3 and S in 4 (same issue)
- CRASS: C R A S S – double S, but S is in position 4 (wrong)
- URSAE: has E which is out
- IRATE: has E and O is out
- FRISK: F R I S K – R at 2, S at 4 (but S was wrong at 4)
- GRASP: G R A S P – A at 3, S at 4 (S wrong at 4)
- CRUST: C R U S T – S at 4 (wrong)
- TRUST: T R U S T – same
- PRISM: P R I S M – S at 4 (wrong)
- DRIPS: D R I P S – S at 5 which is acceptable! (S was in position 4 wrong, so 5 is new position)

DRIPS:
- D is new
- R is correctly at 2
- I is new
- P is new
- S is at 5 (was at 4 wrong, so this is new position)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting known constraints.Based on the feedback from AROSE, I know:
- R is correct in position 2
- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively
- O and E are not in the word

My next guess is DRIPS, which places:
- R in position 2 (correct)
- S in position 5 (new position since it was wrong at 4)
- Tests new letters D, I, P

Guess 2: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:

1. R is fixed at position 2.
2. S is fixed at position 5.
3. A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
4. The word does NOT contain O, E, D, I, P.

Therefore, the secret word has the form:
_ R _ _ S
and must contain A somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Letters still possible (excluding O, E, D, I, P):
A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need 3 more letters (positions 1, 3, 4), one of which must be A.

Candidate patterns:
- A R _ _ S  → A in position 1 (allowed, since A was “-” in position 1 of AROSE, meaning it’s in word but wrong position in that guess, so position 1 is now possible)
- _ R A _ S
- _ R _ A S

1. A R _ _ S  → AR…S: ARB… ARF… ARG… ARK… ARM… ARN… ART… 5-letter?  ARBYS? No. ARK… ARKYS – not valid. ARUMS – rare. ARBOS – not common.
2. _ R A _ S  → CRABS, FRAPS, GRAYS, PRAMS – but P is out. CRABS: C R A B S – C, A, B not yet tested. Looks good.
3. _ R _ A S  → CRASS – S repeats (S already at 5) and P is out. BRASS – B, R, A, S, S – double S. C R A B S is cleaner.

Word CRABS:
- C: new
- R: correct position 2
- A: correct position 3 (allowed since A was wrong position in AROSE, and position 3 is new)
- B: new

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to gather maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It covers 5 distinct letters
- Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many words
- Includes common consonants (R, S) that often appear in various positions
- This should give us a good baseline to narrow down possibilities in subsequent guesses

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, we have:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so R is the 2nd letter
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Letters we know:
- R is at position 2
- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively
- O and E are not in the word

We need a new word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Contains A and S but not in positions 1 and 4
3. Does not contain O or E
4. Has 5 letters

Possible positions for A and S:
- A could be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is R), so 3,4,5
- S could be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but position 2 is R), so 1,3,5

Let's think of words with R as the 2nd letter and trial some:
- CRISP: C R I S P – but S is in position 4 which was marked wrong (S was in position 4 in AROSE and marked -)
- DRANK: D R A N K – A is in position 3 which is acceptable, but does it have S? No.
- GRAFT: G R A F T – has A in position 3, but no S
- TRASH: T R A S H – has A in position 3 and S in position 4 (but S was wrong in position 4 in AROSE)
- BRASH: B R A S H – has A in 3 and S in 4 (same issue)
- CRASS: C R A S S – double S, but S is in position 4 (wrong)
- URSAE: has E which is out
- IRATE: has E and O is out
- FRISK: F R I S K – R at 2, S at 4 (but S was wrong at 4)
- GRASP: G R A S P – A at 3, S at 4 (S wrong at 4)
- CRUST: C R U S T – S at 4 (wrong)
- TRUST: T R U S T – same
- PRISM: P R I S M – S at 4 (wrong)
- DRIPS: D R I P S – S at 5 which is acceptable! (S was in position 4 wrong, so 5 is new position)

DRIPS:
- D is new
- R is correctly at 2
- I is new
- P is new
- S is at 5 (was at 4 wrong, so this is new position)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting known constraints.Based on the feedback from AROSE, I know:
- R is correct in position 2
- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively
- O and E are not in the word

My next guess is DRIPS, which places:
- R in position 2 (correct)
- S in position 5 (new position since it was wrong at 4)
- Tests new letters D, I, P

Guess 2: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:

1. R is fixed at position 2.
2. S is fixed at position 5.
3. A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
4. The word does NOT contain O, E, D, I, P.

Therefore, the secret word has the form:
_ R _ _ S
and must contain A somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Letters still possible (excluding O, E, D, I, P):
A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need 3 more letters (positions 1, 3, 4), one of which must be A.

Candidate patterns:
- A R _ _ S  → A in position 1 (allowed, since A was “-” in position 1 of AROSE, meaning it’s in word but wrong position in that guess, so position 1 is now possible)
- _ R A _ S
- _ R _ A S

Let me generate words:

1. A R _ _ S  → AR…S: ARB… ARF… ARG… ARK… ARM… ARN… ART… 5-letter?  ARBYS? No. ARK… ARKYS – not valid. ARUMS – rare. ARBOS – not common.
2. _ R A _ S  → CRABS, FRAPS, GRAYS, PRAMS – but P is out. CRABS: C R A B S – C, A, B not yet tested. Looks good.
3. _ R _ A S  → CRASS – S repeats (S already at 5) and P is out. BRASS – B, R, A, S, S – double S. C R A B S is cleaner.

Word CRABS:
- C: new
- R: correct position 2
- A: correct position 3 (allowed since A was wrong position in AROSE, and position 3 is new)
- B: new
- S: correct position 5
No banned letters. Looks valid.

1. R is fixed at position 2.
2. A is fixed at position 3.
3. S is fixed at position 5.
4. C, B, D, I, P, O, E are NOT in the word.

So the pattern is:
_ R A _ S

We still need a letter for positions 1 and 4.  
Letters that remain available (consonants only, no vowels except possibly Y):
F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct consonants (or Y) for positions 1 and 4.  
Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R A _ S and use only allowed letters.

Candidates:
FRAYS  
GRANS  
GRAFS  
GRAYS  
GRAHS – not a word  
KRANS – rare  
PRANS – P is out  
TRAMS – M is new, T is new

TRASS – double S is ok but already used  
FRASS – F, S, S ok but S already known  
TRAYS – T, Y ok  
GRANS – G, N ok  
FRANS – F, N ok  

Among these, common words are: FRAYS, GRAYS, GRANS, TRANS, TRAYS.

Let me pick TRAYS:
- T in position 1  
- R in position 2 (known)  
- A in position 3 (known)

(S was in position 4 wrong, so 5 is new position)\n\nDRIPS:\n- D is new\n- R is correctly at 2\n- I is new\n- P is new\n- S is at 5 (was at 4 wrong, so this is new position)\n\nThis seems like a good next guess to test new letters while respecting known constraints.Based on the feedback from AROSE, I know:\n- R is correct in position 2\n- A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively\n- O and E are not in the word\n\nMy next guess is DRIPS, which places:\n- R in position 2 (correct)\n- S in position 5 (new position since it was wrong at 4)\n- Tests new letters D, I, P\n\n<guess>DRIPS</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) P(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Now we know:\n\n1.
