Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct or at least learning which letters are in the word. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word would combine these letters to get maximum information. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters and includes multiple vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R (x): R is not in the word at all.
- O (x): O is not in the word at all.
- S (x): S is not in the word at all.
- E (✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (5th position).

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The word contains A somewhere, but NOT in the first position.
3. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Letters we still have to work with: the remaining 22 letters, excluding R, O, S.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E fixed at position 5.
- Include A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Use other common consonants that weren’t eliminated (T, L, N, C, D, etc.).

One efficient word meeting these criteria is “TABLE”:
- T: common consonant not yet used.
- A: appears in the second position (allowed, since A just must not be first).
- B: another common consonant.
- L: common consonant.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct or at least learning which letters are in the word. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word would combine these letters to get maximum information. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters and includes multiple vowels.

- O (x): O is not in the word at all.
- S (x): S is not in the word at all.
- E (✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (5th position).

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The word contains A somewhere, but NOT in the first position.
3. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Letters we still have to work with: the remaining 22 letters, excluding R, O, S.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E fixed at position 5.
- Include A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Use other common consonants that weren’t eliminated (T, L, N, C, D, etc.).

One efficient word meeting these criteria is “TABLE”:
- T: common consonant not yet used.
- A: appears in the second position (allowed, since A just must not be first).
- B: another common consonant.
- L: common consonant.
- E: already known correct in position 5.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R (x): R is not in the word at all.
- O (x): O is not in the word at all.
- S (x): S is not in the word at all.
- E (✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (5th position).

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The word contains A somewhere, but NOT in the first position.
3. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Letters we still have to work with: the remaining 22 letters, excluding R, O, S.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E fixed at position 5.
- Include A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Use other common consonants that weren’t eliminated (T, L, N, C, D, etc.).

One efficient word meeting these criteria is “TABLE”:
- T: common consonant not yet used.
- A: appears in the second position (allowed, since A just must not be first).
- B: another common consonant.
- L: common consonant.
- E: already known correct in position 5.

Let’s try TABLE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the accumulated feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in the 5th position.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are NOT in the word.

2. TABLE → T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - A is now fixed in the 2nd position.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and B are NOT in the word.

Current knowns:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ E
- Letters used so far: E(5), A(2)
- Valid letters left: all except R, O, S, T, B
- L is somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 because L(-) in position 4).

Let’s pick a word that fits _ A _ _ E, contains L in position 1 or 3, and uses other common letters we haven’t eliminated.

Candidate: CABLE – but B is out (B from TABLE feedback).
FABLE – B is out.
GLADE – D is allowed, G and D haven’t been excluded.

GLADE fits:
- G (allowed), L in position 3 (allowed), A in 2, D in 4, E in 5.

Guess 2: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: GLADE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) A(-) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

1. Positional certainties
   - 2nd letter: A (from TABLE feedback “A(✓)”)
   - 5th letter: E (from both AROSE and GLADE feedback “E(✓)”)

   Current pattern: _ A _ _ E

2. Letter-status list
   - Green (correct position): A(2), E(5)
   - Yellow (present but wrong positions):
       – A: initially “(-)” in AROSE (now fixed at 2)
       – L: “(-)” in TABLE and again “(-)” in GLADE
         ⇒ L is in word, cannot be in positions 3 or 4
         ⇒ only possible positions left: 1 or 3 (but 3 was just tried in GLADE and failed, so L must be in 1)
   - Eliminated letters: R, O, S, T, B, G, D

3. Deduced pattern so far
   - Position 1: must be L
   - Position 2: A (fixed)
   - Position 3: ?
   - Position 4: ?
   - Position 5: E (fixed)

   Therefore the word is L A _ _ E

4. Remaining usable consonants for positions 3 and 4
   (exclude R, O, S, T, B, G, D and any already confirmed elsewhere)
   Remaining letters: C, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   Common English consonants among these: C, F, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y

5. Candidate words fitting L A _ _ E
   - LANCE – N and C are allowed
   - LACKE – C and K allowed (but “LACKE” is not in most word lists; “LACK” is 4 letters)
   - LAMPE – M and P allowed
   - LAMNE – invalid
   - LACHE – C and H allowed (but “LACHE” is uncommon)
   - LANCE is the clearest valid 5-letter word

Hence the best next guess is LANCE.

Guess 3: GLADE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) A(-) D(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: LANCE -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating everything so far:

Pattern locked in:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 5 = E
So the word is _ A _ _ E

Known letters:
- L is in the word, but it cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (because it was “(-)” in both GLADE and LANCE).
- Therefore L must be in position 4.

That gives us: _ A _ L E

Eliminated letters (never appear): R, O, S, T, B, G, D, N, C

Possible consonants left for positions 1 and 3 (must be common, remaining letters):
Remaining alphabet minus the eliminated set and vowels (except A and E already used):
Usable consonants: F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

We now need a valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern ? A ? L E, using only these consonants.

Candidate words:
- FABLE – B is eliminated.
- MAPLE – M, P, L allowed; fits the pattern _ A _ L E perfectly.

Let’s choose MAPLE.

2.  Position 5 is **E** with ✓ in every relevant guess.
3.  Letter L has appeared as “(-)” three separate times (TABLE, GLADE, MAPLE) and once as “(-)” at position 1 (LANCE).  
   - That means L is in the word but **never** in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
   - The only position left for L is **position 4**.

So the word **must** be of the form  
  _ A _ L E

Letters **eliminated** so far (never appear in the word):

where X and Y are chosen from the remaining consonants.

Scanning the list of common 5-letter words, the only one that fits is

The next possibility is swapping the consonants:  
  H A K L E ⇒ **HAKLE** (invalid).  
Then

Eventually the only remaining valid word that matches the pattern with the allowed letters is

- X = K, Y = H → KAHLE (invalid)  
- X = W, Y = K → WAKLE (invalid)

Realisation: we overlooked the fact that **V** is still allowed.  
The word **H A V L E** is invalid, but **H A I L E** uses I (vowel), which is allowed.  
Checking the word list, **HAILE** is archaic, but **HAYLE** is not valid.  

Finally, the **only correct choice left** is
