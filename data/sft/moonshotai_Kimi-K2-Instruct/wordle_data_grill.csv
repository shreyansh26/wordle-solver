For the first guess, I want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and vowels. Common starting words include those with E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. 

A popular first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This covers 5 different letters including 2 vowels and 3 consonants, giving good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains L (but not in position 2)
- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E

I need a new 5-letter word that includes L (but not in position 2) and avoids S, A, T, E. Since vowels are limited (A and E are out), I'll try a word with O and/or I, plus common consonants.

""BLOND"" comes to mind, but it has O and N, D - let's check:
- B, L, O, N, D
- L is in position 2 (but we know L is in the word but not position 2), so this might not be ideal.

Instead, ""FLING"" would be better:
- F, L, I, N, G
- L is in position 2, which we know is wrong, but we're testing other letters.

Actually, ""CRONY"" has:
- C, R, O, N, Y
- But no L, which we know must be present.

""DRILL"" has:
- D, R, I, L, L
- L appears twice, but position 2 and 5, and we know L is not in position 2.

""GUILD"" has:
- G, U, I, L, D
- L is in position 4, which is acceptable (not position 2)
- Uses new letters G, U, I, D

This seems like a good next guess as it incorporates:
- L (known to be in word)
- Common consonants G, D
- Vowel U and I (since A, E are out)
- Avoids S, T, A, E

Available vowels (excluding the forbidden A, E, U and already-used I): O

Since only O is left among vowels, position 2 or 5 must be a consonant; position 5 could also be Y acting as a vowel/consonant.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words matching G _ I L _.

Possible fills:
- G R I L L  – but D is forbidden, so the LL is fine.
- G R I L S  – S is forbidden.
- G R I L Y  – Y is allowed.
- G H I L L  – H is allowed.
- G N I L Y  – uncommon, but possible.
- G O I L _  – O in position 2: G O I L _ ; need a consonant for 5th spot. G O I L N (GOILN not a word). G O I L Y (GOILY not a word).

“GRILL” leaps out: matches G _ I L _ , has two L’s (both allowed), uses only allowed letters, and is a common word. Let’s check:

- R (unknown, but allowed)
- I (✓) in 3
- L (✓) in 4
- L (allowed, since L can appear more than once)
