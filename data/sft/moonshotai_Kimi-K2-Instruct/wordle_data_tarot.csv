For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess would use a mix of these common letters to help eliminate or confirm letters early on.

One effective strategy is to use a word like ""AROSE"" which contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers a good range of common letters and can quickly help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE we can deduce:

1. A, R, O each appear somewhere in the word but NOT in their 1st, 2nd, 3rd positions respectively.
2. S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has an A, an R, and an O, but not where they were guessed.
- No S, no E.
- Positions 1, 2, 3 are open for these letters (since their previous positions are ruled out), and positions 4 and 5 are also open.

Letters we can still use: A, R, O plus other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Re-use A, R, O in new positions.
- Introduce new common consonants not yet used.
- Avoid S and E.

Possible candidates: CRONY, MORAL, ORBIT, TRAIN, CARGO, etc.

Choose CRONY because:
- C, N, Y are new common letters.
- R is in position 3 (originally position 2, so new).
- O is in position 2 (originally position 3, so new).
- A is not used here, but we still have many other letters to test.

Let's update what we now know:

Known to be in the word:  
- R (✓ at position 3)  
- A (present but not at positions 1 or 4)  
- O (present but not at positions 2 or 3)

Known NOT in the word:  
S, E, C, N, Y, M, L

Available positions for the known letters:  
A can be at 2, 3, 4, 5 → but 3 is taken by R, 4 is excluded → so A must be at 2 or 5.  
O can be at 1, 2, 4, 5 → but 2 is excluded → so O must be at 1, 4, or 5.

We still have two unknown letters. Since we have not yet tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, U, W, etc., we should pick a word that:  
- keeps R fixed at position 3,  
- places A and O in one of their valid positions,  
- introduces two new common letters.

A quick check:  
If we put A at position 2, then positions 1, 4, 5 need O plus two other letters.  
Example pattern: _ A R _ _

If we put A at position 5, then positions 1, 2, 4 need O plus two other letters.  
Example pattern: _ _ R _ A

Let’s try the first pattern (_ A R _ _) with O in position 4 (allowed).  
We need two more letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, U, W}.  
A common, balanced choice is “D” and “I”.  
So the word becomes D A R I O → DARIO.

Check:  
- R is at 3 (fixed).  
- A at 2 (allowed).  
- O at 4 (allowed).  
- D and I are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess would use a mix of these common letters to help eliminate or confirm letters early on.

One effective strategy is to use a word like ""AROSE"" which contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers a good range of common letters and can quickly help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we can deduce:

1. A, R, O each appear somewhere in the word but NOT in their 1st, 2nd, 3rd positions respectively.
2. S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has an A, an R, and an O, but not where they were guessed.
- No S, no E.
- Positions 1, 2, 3 are open for these letters (since their previous positions are ruled out), and positions 4 and 5 are also open.

Letters we can still use: A, R, O plus other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Re-use A, R, O in new positions.
- Introduce new common consonants not yet used.
- Avoid S and E.

Possible candidates: CRONY, MORAL, ORBIT, TRAIN, CARGO, etc.

Choose CRONY because:
- C, N, Y are new common letters.
- R is in position 3 (originally position 2, so new).
- O is in position 2 (originally position 3, so new).
- A is not used here, but we still have many other letters to test.

1. Letters NOT in the word (so far): S, E, C, N, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, R, O.
   - A is not in position 1 (from AROSE).
   - R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 again (from CRONY) – so R ≠ 2.
   - O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from CRONY) – so O ≠ 3.

3. We still need to place A, R, O in the remaining slots (positions 1–5) while satisfying the positional exclusions above.

Possible positions left:
- A can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a third guess that:
- Contains A, R, O (since we know they must be present).
- Introduces new, common letters we haven’t tested yet (to maximize information).
- Excludes S, E, C, N, Y.

Good untested consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.
Good untested vowels: I, U.

A strong candidate is “MORAL”:
- M (new consonant)
- O (must be in word; allowed positions: 1,2,4,5 → here it’s 2, allowed)
- R (must be in word; allowed positions: 1,3,4,5 → here it’s 3, allowed)
- A (must be in word; allowed positions: 2,3,4,5 → here it’s 4, allowed)
- L (new consonant)

This positioning respects all positional exclusions and tests new letters M and L while re-using A, R, O in new spots.

Consolidating the feedback so far:

- R is fixed in position 3 (✓).
- A must be in position 2 (from DARIO feedback: A(✓)).
- O is present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback). So O must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I.

Current known pattern:
1: _ (must be O or a new letter)
2: A (fixed)
3: R (fixed)
4: _ (must be new letter, since I was rejected)
5: _ (must be O or new letter)

But O must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions left are 1 or 5.

Let’s consider both cases:
Case 1: O in position 1 → O A R _ _
Case 2: O in position 5 → _ A R _ O → but position 1 would then need to be a new letter, and position 4 would also need to be a new letter.

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

Let’s try Case 1 first: O A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining set. Possible combinations: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

A common guess would be O A R B K → ""OARBK"" but that feels less likely. Instead, let’s try O A R G H → ""OARGH"" but that’s not a valid English word.

Instead, let’s try O A R B E → but E is already excluded.

Wait, let me think differently: we need a valid English word fitting the constraints.

Looking at the pattern with O in position 1: O A R _ _, possible English words:
- OARBK – invalid
- OAR... – seems no common words

Now try Case 2: _ A R _ O
Possible valid words:
- BARON – but N is excluded
- CARON – C excluded
- FARON – not valid
- GARON – not valid
- HARON – not valid
- KARON – not valid
- MARON – M excluded
- PAROL – L excluded
- TAROK – but K is allowed, and T, K are untested.

""TAROK"" is a valid word (a card game), but let’s see if there’s something more common.

Actually, ""TAROT"" uses T (new), but T is already used in positions 1 and 5. However, O is already required to be in position 5 in this case, so ""TAROT"" would have O in position 5 – which is allowed, and T is new.

But ""TAROT"" has T twice, which might not help since we don’t know if T is in the word.  

A better choice is ""FARRO"" – but double R and O is already in position 5 here.

Instead, let’s try ""PARGO"" – but G and P are new, O in 5, but this is not a common word.

Re-evaluate: the most straightforward valid word fitting _ A R _ O with remaining letters is ""PAROL"" – but L is excluded. 

Next is ""BARON"" – N is excluded.

""GARBO"" – B, G are new, but O is in 5, fits: G A R B O. This seems valid and uses new letters G and B.

So ""GARBO"" seems to fit:
- G (new)
- A (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3 ✓)
- B (new)
- O (position 5, allowed)

Let me verify:
- No excluded letters (S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I are not used)
- O is in a valid position (5)
- A and R are in correct positions
- G and B are new letters

This looks like the best next guess.
</think>

<guess>GARBO</guess>",GARBO,"Consolidating the feedback so far:

- R is fixed in position 3 (✓).
- A must be in position 2 (from DARIO feedback: A(✓)).
- O is present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback). So O must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I.

Current known pattern:
1: _ (must be O or a new letter)
2: A (fixed)
3: R (fixed)
4: _ (must be new letter, since I was rejected)
5: _ (must be O or new letter)

But O must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions left are 1 or 5.

Let’s consider both cases:
Case 1: O in position 1 → O A R _ _
Case 2: O in position 5 → _ A R _ O → but position 1 would then need to be a new letter, and position 4 would also need to be a new letter.

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

Let’s try Case 1 first: O A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining set. Possible combinations: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

A common guess would be O A R B K → ""OARBK"" but that feels less likely. Instead, let’s try O A R G H → ""OARGH"" but that’s not a valid English word.

Instead, let’s try O A R B E → but E is already excluded.

Wait, let me think differently: we need a valid English word fitting the constraints.

Looking at the pattern with O in position 1: O A R _ _, possible English words:
- OARBK – invalid
- OAR... – seems no common words

Now try Case 2: _ A R _ O
Possible valid words:
- BARON – but N is excluded
- CARON – C excluded
- FARON – not valid
- GARON – not valid
- HARON – not valid
- KARON – not valid
- MARON – M excluded
- PAROL – L excluded
- TAROK – but K is allowed, and T, K are untested.

""TAROK"" is a valid word (a card game), but let’s see if there’s something more common.

Actually, ""TAROT"" uses T (new), but T is already used in positions 1 and 5. However, O is already required to be in position 5 in this case, so ""TAROT"" would have O in position 5 – which is allowed, and T is new.

But ""TAROT"" has T twice, which might not help since we don’t know if T is in the word.  

A better choice is ""FARRO"" – but double R and O is already in position 5 here.

Instead, let’s try ""PARGO"" – but G and P are new, O in 5, but this is not a common word.

Re-evaluate: the most straightforward valid word fitting _ A R _ O with remaining letters is ""PAROL"" – but L is excluded. 

Next is ""BARON"" – N is excluded.

""GARBO"" – B, G are new, but O is in 5, fits: G A R B O. This seems valid and uses new letters G and B.

So ""GARBO"" seems to fit:
- G (new)
- A (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3 ✓)
- B (new)
- O (position 5, allowed)

Let me verify:
- No excluded letters (S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I are not used)
- O is in a valid position (5)
- A and R are in correct positions
- G and B are new letters

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess would use a mix of these common letters to help eliminate or confirm letters early on.

One effective strategy is to use a word like ""AROSE"" which contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers a good range of common letters and can quickly help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we can deduce:

1. A, R, O each appear somewhere in the word but NOT in their 1st, 2nd, 3rd positions respectively.
2. S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word has an A, an R, and an O, but not where they were guessed.
- No S, no E.
- Positions 1, 2, 3 are open for these letters (since their previous positions are ruled out), and positions 4 and 5 are also open.

Letters we can still use: A, R, O plus other consonants/vowels not yet ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Re-use A, R, O in new positions.
- Introduce new common consonants not yet used.
- Avoid S and E.

Possible candidates: CRONY, MORAL, ORBIT, TRAIN, CARGO, etc.

Choose CRONY because:
- C, N, Y are new common letters.
- R is in position 3 (originally position 2, so new).
- O is in position 2 (originally position 3, so new).
- A is not used here, but we still have many other letters to test.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word (so far): S, E, C, N, Y.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): A, R, O.
   - A is not in position 1 (from AROSE).
   - R is not in position 2 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 again (from CRONY) – so R ≠ 2.
   - O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from CRONY) – so O ≠ 3.

3. We still need to place A, R, O in the remaining slots (positions 1–5) while satisfying the positional exclusions above.

Possible positions left:
- A can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a third guess that:
- Contains A, R, O (since we know they must be present).
- Introduces new, common letters we haven’t tested yet (to maximize information).
- Excludes S, E, C, N, Y.

Good untested consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.
Good untested vowels: I, U.

A strong candidate is “MORAL”:
- M (new consonant)
- O (must be in word; allowed positions: 1,2,4,5 → here it’s 2, allowed)
- R (must be in word; allowed positions: 1,3,4,5 → here it’s 3, allowed)
- A (must be in word; allowed positions: 2,3,4,5 → here it’s 4, allowed)
- L (new consonant)

This positioning respects all positional exclusions and tests new letters M and L while re-using A, R, O in new spots.

Guess 3: MORAL -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) R(✓) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's update what we now know:

Known to be in the word:  
- R (✓ at position 3)  
- A (present but not at positions 1 or 4)  
- O (present but not at positions 2 or 3)

Known NOT in the word:  
S, E, C, N, Y, M, L

Available positions for the known letters:  
A can be at 2, 3, 4, 5 → but 3 is taken by R, 4 is excluded → so A must be at 2 or 5.  
O can be at 1, 2, 4, 5 → but 2 is excluded → so O must be at 1, 4, or 5.

We still have two unknown letters. Since we have not yet tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, U, W, etc., we should pick a word that:  
- keeps R fixed at position 3,  
- places A and O in one of their valid positions,  
- introduces two new common letters.

A quick check:  
If we put A at position 2, then positions 1, 4, 5 need O plus two other letters.  
Example pattern: _ A R _ _

If we put A at position 5, then positions 1, 2, 4 need O plus two other letters.  
Example pattern: _ _ R _ A

Let’s try the first pattern (_ A R _ _) with O in position 4 (allowed).  
We need two more letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, T, U, W}.  
A common, balanced choice is “D” and “I”.  
So the word becomes D A R I O → DARIO.

Check:  
- R is at 3 (fixed).  
- A at 2 (allowed).  
- O at 4 (allowed).  
- D and I are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

Looks good.

Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: MORAL -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) R(✓) A(-) L(x)
Guess 4: DARIO -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating the feedback so far:

- R is fixed in position 3 (✓).
- A must be in position 2 (from DARIO feedback: A(✓)).
- O is present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback). So O must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I.

Current known pattern:
1: _ (must be O or a new letter)
2: A (fixed)
3: R (fixed)
4: _ (must be new letter, since I was rejected)
5: _ (must be O or new letter)

But O must appear somewhere, and the only possible positions left are 1 or 5.

Let’s consider both cases:
Case 1: O in position 1 → O A R _ _
Case 2: O in position 5 → _ A R _ O → but position 1 would then need to be a new letter, and position 4 would also need to be a new letter.

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining untested common letters: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

Let’s try Case 1 first: O A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining set. Possible combinations: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, U, W.

A common guess would be O A R B K → ""OARBK"" but that feels less likely. Instead, let’s try O A R G H → ""OARGH"" but that’s not a valid English word.

Instead, let’s try O A R B E → but E is already excluded.

Wait, let me think differently: we need a valid English word fitting the constraints.

Looking at the pattern with O in position 1: O A R _ _, possible English words:
- OARBK – invalid
- OAR... – seems no common words

Now try Case 2: _ A R _ O
Possible valid words:
- BARON – but N is excluded
- CARON – C excluded
- FARON – not valid
- GARON – not valid
- HARON – not valid
- KARON – not valid
- MARON – M excluded
- PAROL – L excluded
- TAROK – but K is allowed, and T, K are untested.

""TAROK"" is a valid word (a card game), but let’s see if there’s something more common.

Actually, ""TAROT"" uses T (new), but T is already used in positions 1 and 5. However, O is already required to be in position 5 in this case, so ""TAROT"" would have O in position 5 – which is allowed, and T is new.

But ""TAROT"" has T twice, which might not help since we don’t know if T is in the word.  

A better choice is ""FARRO"" – but double R and O is already in position 5 here.

Instead, let’s try ""PARGO"" – but G and P are new, O in 5, but this is not a common word.

Re-evaluate: the most straightforward valid word fitting _ A R _ O with remaining letters is ""PAROL"" – but L is excluded. 

Next is ""BARON"" – N is excluded.

""GARBO"" – B, G are new, but O is in 5, fits: G A R B O. This seems valid and uses new letters G and B.

So ""GARBO"" seems to fit:
- G (new)
- A (position 2 ✓)
- R (position 3 ✓)
- B (new)
- O (position 5, allowed)

Let me verify:
- No excluded letters (S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I are not used)
- O is in a valid position (5)
- A and R are in correct positions
- G and B are new letters

This looks like the best next guess.

This seems valid and uses new letters G and B.\n\nSo ""GARBO"" seems to fit:\n- G (new)\n- A (position 2 ✓)\n- R (position 3 ✓)\n- B (new)\n- O (position 5, allowed)\n\nLet me verify:\n- No excluded letters (S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I are not used)\n- O is in a valid position (5)\n- A and R are in correct positions\n- G and B are new letters\n\nThis looks like the best next guess.\n\n<guess>GARBO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: MORAL -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) R(✓) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 4: DARIO -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) I(x) O(-)\nGuess 5: GARBO -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) R(✓) B(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
From the cumulative feedback:

- **Position 2**: A (✓) – fixed.  
- **Position 3**: R (✓) – fixed.  

- **Letter O** must appear exactly once, and the only two allowed positions remaining are 1 or 5 (because it cannot be in 2, 3, or 4, and hasn’t appeared yet).

- Letters **excluded** (not in the word at all):  
  S, E, C, N, Y, M, L, D, I, G, B.

- Letters **still allowed** (besides A, R, O):  
  F, H, K, P, T, U, W, etc.

So the hidden pattern is either  
O A R _ _  or _ A R _ O,  
with the two blanks filled by two **distinct** letters from the allowed set.

Valid English words fitting these constraints:

1. O A R F K – invalid (no such word)  
2. O A R F H – invalid  
3. O A R T H – “OARTH” – invalid  
4. F A R T O – valid English word “FARTO” (archaic) but not common  
5. H A R P O – “HARPO” (proper noun, usually capitalized, but acceptable in Wordle-like lists)  
6. T A R P O – invalid  
7. K A R T O – invalid  
8. P A R K O – invalid  
9. W A R P O – invalid  

The only common-enough 5-letter word that fits the strict constraints and uses two **new**, valid letters is **HARPO**.

Check:
- H, P are both untested.  
- O is in position 5, which is still allowed.  
- No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, the logical next guess is **HARPO**.
