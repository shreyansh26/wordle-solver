For my first guess, I want to choose a word that gives me the most information possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Common consonants and vowels like S, T, R, A, E, I, N, O are good choices. 

After considering options like ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc., I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good mix of high-frequency letters that should provide useful feedback regardless of the actual secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses:

1. R A I S E → R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is correctly placed in position 1.
   - A, I, S are not in the word at all.
   - E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. R E B E L → R(✓) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   - R is confirmed in position 1 (already known).
   - E is not in position 2.
   - B is not in the word.
   - E is in position 4.
   - L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word is R _ _ E _
- Letters not in the word: A, I, S, B, L
- Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 1), E (position 4)
- We still need to determine positions 2 and 3.

The remaining allowed letters (excluding A, I, S, B, L) include: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a common 5-letter word that starts with R, has E in the 4th position, and uses only allowed letters. Possible candidates:

- R O D E O
- R U D E R
- R U N E R
- R O M E O
- R O N E Y
- R O K E R

""RUNER"" is not a valid word. ""RUDER"" is valid but uses R twice, which might not be the best for testing new letters. ""ROMEO"" is valid and tests O and M, which haven't been used yet. 

""ROMEO"" fits all criteria: R _ _ E _ with O and M in positions 2 and 3, and no excluded letters.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. R A I S E → R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   – R is fixed in position 1.
   – A, I, S are absent.
   – E is somewhere in the word but NOT position 5.

2. R E B E L → R(✓) E(-) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
   – R fixed in position 1 (repeat).
   – E is NOT in position 2.
   – E is fixed in position 4.
   – B and L are absent.

3. R O M E O → R(✓) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) O(-)
   – R fixed in position 1 (repeat).
   – O is fixed in position 2.
   – M is absent.
   – E is fixed in position 4 (repeat).
   – O is present in the word but NOT in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern so far: R O _ E _
- Letters not in the word: A, I, S, B, L, M
- Position 5 cannot be E or O (from feedback), so possible letters from the remaining alphabet are: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 3 can be any letter except the excluded ones (A, I, S, B, L, M).

Common 5-letter words matching R O _ E _:
- R O D E D (but D appears twice)
- R O D E O (but O is already excluded from position 5)
- R O K E R (valid, tests K and R again)
- R O N E O (but second O is excluded from position 5)
- R O P E D (P and D are new)
- R O V E R (V and R again)
- R O T E N (T and N are new)

""ROVER"" uses R twice (position 1 and 5) and V.  
""ROPED"" uses P and D.  
""ROVEN"" uses V and N.  
""ROGER"" uses G and R again.

""ROGER"" is the most common word that fits perfectly: R O G E R, and it tests G in position 3 and R again in position 5. Importantly, R has not been ruled out from position 5 (only O and E have been ruled out from position 5), so ""ROGER"" is valid.
