This is the first guess, so there's no prior feedback to work from. The goal is to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid uncommon letters (like Q, Z, X) that might waste guesses
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes 3 vowels, which should help us quickly identify which vowels might be in the word. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular first choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it covers the most common letters and gives good vowel coverage.

- O(x): O is NOT in the word

3. We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.

With S and E gone, we still have T, L, N, I, C as high-frequency letters. Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps A and R (but moves them to new positions),  
- uses only the remaining common consonants,  
- tests a new vowel (I) since O and E are out.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:  
- Uses T, R, A, I, N – all allowed letters.  
- Places A in position 3 (new spot), R in position 2 (new spot), giving us fresh positional info.

Alternative quick check: TRAIN contains no O, S, or E, satisfies the known letters, and tests I and N.

We now have three guesses’ worth of results:

Letters confirmed to be in the word (yellow or green in some earlier guess):
- A  ✓
- R  ✓
- N  ✓

Letters confirmed **not** in the word (grey in any guess):
O, S, E, T, I, C, K

Positions we can rule out so far for those confirmed letters:

A: cannot be positions 1, 3  
R: cannot be positions 2, 3  
N: cannot be positions 3, 5  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested yet and that aren’t yet ruled out:
D, L, M, P, U, Y, B, G, H, V, W, F, Z, Q, J, X   (but we’ll pick from the most frequent ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A, R, N exactly once each  
- does **not** contain O, S, E, T, I, C, K  
- places A in spot 2, 4, or 5 (possible positions left)  
- places R in spots 1, 3, 4, or 5 (possible positions left)  
- places N in spots 1, 2, 3, 4 (possible positions left)  

Let’s list some candidate words that satisfy these constraints:

- BANDY  (B, A, N, D, Y)   → contains A, N, but **no R** – reject  
- RANDY  (R, A, N, D, Y)   → positions: R(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)

  – no forbidden letters  

Another candidate that would work is “DRANK” but that has K (already ruled out). “GRAND” has C (ruled out) and G not yet tested, but “GRAND” contains N in spot 5 which is disallowed. “PANDA” has no R. “MANDY” has no R. “RANDY” is therefore the simplest valid option.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,LUNAR,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid uncommon letters (like Q, Z, X) that might waste guesses
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes 3 vowels, which should help us quickly identify which vowels might be in the word. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular first choice.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it covers the most common letters and gives good vowel coverage.

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x): O is NOT in the word  
- S(x): S is NOT in the word  
- E(x): E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R (somewhere), but neither O, S, nor E are in it.
2. A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.
3. We can eliminate any word with O, S, or E.

With S and E gone, we still have T, L, N, I, C as high-frequency letters. Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps A and R (but moves them to new positions),  
- uses only the remaining common consonants,  
- tests a new vowel (I) since O and E are out.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:  
- Uses T, R, A, I, N – all allowed letters.  
- Places A in position 3 (new spot), R in position 2 (new spot), giving us fresh positional info.

Alternative quick check: TRAIN contains no O, S, or E, satisfies the known letters, and tests I and N.

Positions that can be eliminated so far:
- A cannot be in spots 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in spots 2 or 2 (so R ≠ 2).
- N cannot be in spot 5.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, N.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I.
3. Respects the positional exclusions for A, R, N.

Remaining high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, C, M, Y, U, P.

Let’s try to spread A, R, N into fresh positions and fill the remaining two slots with the most common remaining letters.

A good word satisfying all this is “CRANK”:
- Letters: C, R, A, N, K.
- Uses R (not in spot 2), A (not in spot 1 or 3), N (not in spot 5), so every required letter is in a new, allowable position.

Let’s summarize what we know after four guesses.

Confirmed letters in the word:
- A, R, N

Confirmed letters NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y

Positions that are still possible for the confirmed letters:
- A: not 1, 2, 3 → can only be 4 or 5
- R: not 2, 3 → can only be 1, 4, or 5
- N: not 3, 5, and from RANDY we see N is in position 3 (✓).  Wait, that’s impossible because N was already marked “-” in CRANK position 3.  Let me re-read the feedback.

Re-checking Guess 4 RANDY:
Feedback: R(-) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)
This says:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 → so R ≠ 1
- A is in the word but not in position 2 → so A ≠ 2
- N is in the word and in position 3 → N = 3

Therefore:
- N is fixed at position 3.

Updated allowable positions:
- A cannot be 1, 2, 3 → only 4 or 5
- R cannot be 2, 3, 1 → only 4 or 5
- There is no restriction on positions for new letters yet.

Letters still allowed: any letter not yet ruled out (basically any letter except O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y). Among the common ones left: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z, Q (but most of those are rare). The most frequent remaining consonants are L, M, B, G, H, P.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- has N in position 3
- contains A and R exactly once each
- does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y
- and positions for A and R are restricted as above.

Let’s build such a word:

Pattern: _ _ N _ _

We have two spots left (1,2,4,5) for A and R, plus two additional consonants from the allowed set.

Possible placements:

Case 1: A is in 4, then R could be 1,2, or 5
Case 2: A is in 5, then R could be 1,2, or 4

Let’s pick Case 1: A in 4 and R in 1 → word structure: R _ N A _

Now we need a second consonant for position 5 that is allowed and has not been tested. Common remaining consonants: L, M, B, G, H, P, U, V, W, F.

Try L: R _ N A L → “RINAL” – but “RINAL” isn’t a valid English word.

Try G: R _ N A G → “RN A G” – no, “RNAG” not a word.

Try B: R _ N A B – “RNAB” invalid.

Try M: R _ N A M – “RNAM” invalid.

Try V: R _ N A V – “RNAV” invalid.

Try H: R _ N A H – “RNAH” invalid.

Seems like no common words of form R _ N A _ . Let’s try Case 2: A in 5, R in 1 → R _ N _ A

Need a consonant for position 2. Common ones: M, L, B, G, H, P.

Try M: R M N _ A – “RMN_A” – invalid.

Try B: R B N _ A – “RBN_A” – invalid.

Try L: R L N _ A – “RLN_A” – invalid.

Hmm, maybe reverse R and A positions.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 4: _ _ N R A

Need consonants for positions 1 and 2.

Common pair: B and L → “BLNRA” – invalid.

Try F and L → “FLNRA” – invalid.

Try “B” and “L” – “BLNRA” no.

Let’s try A in position 4 and R in position 5: _ _ N A R

Need two consonants for positions 1,2. Common ones: B,L → “BLNAR” – not a word.

Try M,L → “MLNAR” – no.

Try F,L → “FLNAR” – no.

Try B,U → “BUNAR” – no.

Try G,L → “GLNAR” – no.

This suggests we might need to use A in position 4 and R in position 1, but with different consonants.

How about trying R in position 2? But R cannot be in 2 (from guess 1 feedback).

Wait, from guess 1 and 4 we have:
- R cannot be 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be 1 (from RANDY) and cannot be 3 (from CRANK). So R can only be 4 or 5.

Similarly A cannot be 1,2,3 → only 4 or 5.

But N is fixed at 3.

So positions available for A and R are 4 and 5, and they must fit into those two spots.

So the word must end with N in 3, and positions 4 and 5 must be A and R in some order:

Case A: _ _ N A R   (A in 4, R in 5)
Case B: _ _ N R A   (R in 4, A in 5)

Now we need two consonants for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W.

Among common English words, the pattern _ _ N A R yields “BANAR” – invalid.

But “MANAR” – invalid.

“FANAR” – invalid.

“GANAR” – invalid.

“LANAR” – invalid.

“PANAR” – invalid.

“VANAR” – invalid.

“WANAR” – invalid.

“BUNAR” – invalid.

“FUNAR” – invalid.

“GUNAR” – invalid.

“HUNAR” – invalid.

“LUNAR” – valid word! “LUNAR” uses L and U for positions 1 and 2, and has structure L U N A R.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, R, N ✔
- N is in position 3 ✔
- A is in position 4 (allowed) ✔
- R is in position 5 (allowed) ✔
- Letters L and U are not in the forbidden list (O,S,E,T,I,C,K,D,Y) ✔
- “LUNAR” is a valid English word ✔

Therefore, the next guess is LUNAR.
</think>

<guess>LUNAR</guess>",LUNAR,"Let’s summarize what we know after four guesses.

Confirmed letters in the word:
- A, R, N

Confirmed letters NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y

Positions that are still possible for the confirmed letters:
- A: not 1, 2, 3 → can only be 4 or 5
- R: not 2, 3 → can only be 1, 4, or 5
- N: not 3, 5, and from RANDY we see N is in position 3 (✓).  Wait, that’s impossible because N was already marked “-” in CRANK position 3.  Let me re-read the feedback.

Re-checking Guess 4 RANDY:
Feedback: R(-) A(-) N(✓) D(x) Y(x)
This says:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 → so R ≠ 1
- A is in the word but not in position 2 → so A ≠ 2
- N is in the word and in position 3 → N = 3

Therefore:
- N is fixed at position 3.

Updated allowable positions:
- A cannot be 1, 2, 3 → only 4 or 5
- R cannot be 2, 3, 1 → only 4 or 5
- There is no restriction on positions for new letters yet.

Letters still allowed: any letter not yet ruled out (basically any letter except O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y). Among the common ones left: B, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z, Q (but most of those are rare). The most frequent remaining consonants are L, M, B, G, H, P.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- has N in position 3
- contains A and R exactly once each
- does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, C, K, D, Y
- and positions for A and R are restricted as above.

Let’s build such a word:

Pattern: _ _ N _ _

We have two spots left (1,2,4,5) for A and R, plus two additional consonants from the allowed set.

Possible placements:

Case 1: A is in 4, then R could be 1,2, or 5
Case 2: A is in 5, then R could be 1,2, or 4

Let’s pick Case 1: A in 4 and R in 1 → word structure: R _ N A _

Now we need a second consonant for position 5 that is allowed and has not been tested. Common remaining consonants: L, M, B, G, H, P, U, V, W, F.

Try L: R _ N A L → “RINAL” – but “RINAL” isn’t a valid English word.

Try G: R _ N A G → “RN A G” – no, “RNAG” not a word.

Try B: R _ N A B – “RNAB” invalid.

Try M: R _ N A M – “RNAM” invalid.

Try V: R _ N A V – “RNAV” invalid.

Try H: R _ N A H – “RNAH” invalid.

Seems like no common words of form R _ N A _ . Let’s try Case 2: A in 5, R in 1 → R _ N _ A

Need a consonant for position 2. Common ones: M, L, B, G, H, P.

Try M: R M N _ A – “RMN_A” – invalid.

Try B: R B N _ A – “RBN_A” – invalid.

Try L: R L N _ A – “RLN_A” – invalid.

Hmm, maybe reverse R and A positions.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 4: _ _ N R A

Need consonants for positions 1 and 2.

Common pair: B and L → “BLNRA” – invalid.

Try F and L → “FLNRA” – invalid.

Try “B” and “L” – “BLNRA” no.

Let’s try A in position 4 and R in position 5: _ _ N A R

Need two consonants for positions 1,2. Common ones: B,L → “BLNAR” – not a word.

Try M,L → “MLNAR” – no.

Try F,L → “FLNAR” – no.

Try B,U → “BUNAR” – no.

Try G,L → “GLNAR” – no.

This suggests we might need to use A in position 4 and R in position 1, but with different consonants.

How about trying R in position 2? But R cannot be in 2 (from guess 1 feedback).

Wait, from guess 1 and 4 we have:
- R cannot be 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be 1 (from RANDY) and cannot be 3 (from CRANK). So R can only be 4 or 5.

Similarly A cannot be 1,2,3 → only 4 or 5.

But N is fixed at 3.

So positions available for A and R are 4 and 5, and they must fit into those two spots.

So the word must end with N in 3, and positions 4 and 5 must be A and R in some order:

Case A: _ _ N A R   (A in 4, R in 5)
Case B: _ _ N R A   (R in 4, A in 5)

Now we need two consonants for positions 1 and 2 from the allowed set: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W.

Among common English words, the pattern _ _ N A R yields “BANAR” – invalid.

But “MANAR” – invalid.

“FANAR” – invalid.

“GANAR” – invalid.

“LANAR” – invalid.

“PANAR” – invalid.

“VANAR” – invalid.

“WANAR” – invalid.

“BUNAR” – invalid.

“FUNAR” – invalid.

“GUNAR” – invalid.

“HUNAR” – invalid.

“LUNAR” – valid word! “LUNAR” uses L and U for positions 1 and 2, and has structure L U N A R.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, R, N ✔
- N is in position 3 ✔
- A is in position 4 (allowed) ✔
- R is in position 5 (allowed) ✔
- Letters L and U are not in the forbidden list (O,S,E,T,I,C,K,D,Y) ✔
- “LUNAR” is a valid English word ✔

Therefore, the next guess is LUNAR.",Guess 5: LUNAR -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) U(✓) N(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
