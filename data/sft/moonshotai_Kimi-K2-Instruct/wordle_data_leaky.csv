For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This increases the chance of hitting at least some letters that are in the secret word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage. Other strong options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses a good mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used.

- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains E and L ✓
- L is in position 1 (allowed since L can't be in 2, and 3 is A)
- E is in position 5 - but we know E can't be in 5. So this is invalid.

Try ""FLAME"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 2 - but we know L can't be in 2. Invalid.

Try ""BLAME"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 2 - invalid (L can't be in 2)

Try ""GLADE"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 2 - invalid

Try ""CLEAN"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 4
- E in position 2
- No R, O, S, P, T
This seems valid.

Let's verify:
- Positions: 1-C, 2-E, 3-A, 4-L, 5-N
- A is correctly in 3rd position
- E is in 2nd (allowed since it can't be in 5)
- L is in 4th (allowed since it can't be in 2)
- Contains no R, O, S, P, T

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

1. From AROSE  
   A is in the word but not at position 1.  
   E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   R, O, S are out.

2. From PLATE  
   A is at position 3.  
   L is in the word but not at position 2.  
   P and T are out.

3. From CLEAN  
   C is out.  
   N is out.  
   L is still in but not at position 2 or 4 (new “not” positions).  
   E is still in but not at position 2 or 5.  
   A is still in but not at positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (only remaining open spot is 2 or 3, but 3 is already taken by A). Wait, let’s double-check: in CLEAN A is at position 4, so A cannot be at 4. But we already know from PLATE that A is fixed at position 3. So A is definitely at position 3.

So the confirmed facts are:
- Position 3 is A.
- E is in the word, not at 2, 3, 5 → E must be at 1 or 4.  
- L is in the word, not at 2, 4 → L must be at 1 or 5.  
- Eliminated letters so far: R, O, S, P, T, C, N.

Remaining letters to work with: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the two known letters E and L.

We need to place:
- A at 3
- E at 1 or 4
- L at 1 or 5

Case 1: E at 1 and L at 5  
Word form: E _ A _ L  
Remaining letters for positions 2 and 4 must come from the safe pool.  
Possible middle letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Try E B A D L → “EBADL” – not a common word.

Try E G A D L → “EGADL” – no.

Try E G A M L → “EGAML” – no.

Let’s look for real English words. The pattern E _ A _ L gives nothing common.

Case 2: E at 4 and L at 1  
Word form: L _ A E _  
Check common English words:  
L B A E _ – no.  
L D A E D – no.  
L G A E M – no.  
L M A E D – no.  
L F A E R – contains R (out).  
L H A E L – no.  
L M A E N – contains N (out).  
L G A E M – no.

Case 3: E at 1 and L at 1 – impossible (same position).

Case 4: E at 4 and L at 5 – impossible (positions overlap).

Only viable pattern left is L _ A E _ or E _ A _ L. Among these, the only actual 5-letter English word I can see is “LADLE”.  
- L is at 1 (allowed).  
- A is at 3 (fixed).  
- D is new and safe.  
- L is at 4 but wait – 4 is already taken by E. No, word is L-A-D-L-E: positions are 1:L, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:E. But we need A at 3, so that does not fit.

Wait, I misread. Let’s write it out:

Pattern for A at 3:

We need 5 positions:

1 2 3 4 5
_ _ A _ _

With constraints:
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- L must be in 1 or 5.  

Subcases:

Subcase A – E at 1, L at 5:
1:E, 2:?, 3:A, 4:?, 5:L  
Need a valid word E _ A _ L.  
Common word: “EMAIL” – but contains I and M which are allowed and not yet ruled out.  
Check eliminated letters: E, M, A, I, L – none are in the banned list R,O,S,P,T,C,N.  
So EMAIL is a valid candidate.

Subcase B – E at 4, L at 1:
1:L, 2:?, 3:A, 4:E, 5:?  
Word L _ A E _. Common word: L A V E R – contains R (out). L A Z E D – but D is allowed, Z allowed. But LAZED is valid.  
But we don’t have info against D or Z. However, we have more constraints: L at 1, A at 3, E at 4. The only common word I see is LAMED (LAMED is valid, uses M, E, D). But D is safe, M is safe.

Between EMAIL and LAMED, EMAIL looks better because it places E at position 1 (still allowed) and L at 5 (allowed), and uses new letters M and I.

The constraints narrowed the possibilities down to very few patterns. The most promising remaining word that satisfies all known positions and bans is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- S(x): Letter S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-): Letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A and E (positions unknown except not 1st and 5th respectively)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S

I need a new word that:
1. Contains both A and E somewhere (but A not in position 1, E not in position 5)
2. Avoids R, O, and S completely
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good letters to try next would be common ones not yet used, such as T, N, L, C, D, etc.

- L is at 4 but wait – 4 is already taken by E. No, word is L-A-D-L-E: positions are 1:L, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:E. But we need A at 3, so that does not fit.

Wait, I misread. Let’s write it out:

Pattern for A at 3:

We need 5 positions:

1 2 3 4 5
_ _ A _ _

With constraints:
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- L must be in 1 or 5.  

Subcases:

Subcase A – E at 1, L at 5:
1:E, 2:?, 3:A, 4:?, 5:L  
Need a valid word E _ A _ L.  
Common word: “EMAIL” – but contains I and M which are allowed and not yet ruled out.  
Check eliminated letters: E, M, A, I, L – none are in the banned list R,O,S,P,T,C,N.  
So EMAIL is a valid candidate.

Subcase B – E at 4, L at 1:
1:L, 2:?, 3:A, 4:E, 5:?  
Word L _ A E _. Common word: L A V E R – contains R (out). L A Z E D – but D is allowed, Z allowed. But LAZED is valid.  
But we don’t have info against D or Z. However, we have more constraints: L at 1, A at 3, E at 4. The only common word I see is LAMED (LAMED is valid, uses M, E, D). But D is safe, M is safe.

Between EMAIL and LAMED, EMAIL looks better because it places E at position 1 (still allowed) and L at 5 (allowed), and uses new letters M and I.The constraints narrowed the possibilities down to very few patterns. The most promising remaining word that satisfies all known positions and bans is:

Consolidate everything we now know.

1. Position 3 is definitely A.

2. Letters still required somewhere in the word:
   - E (cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 5) ⇒ must be position 4 only.
   - L (cannot be in position 2, 4) ⇒ must be position 1 or 5.

3. Letters we may **not** use at all:
   R, O, S, P, T, C, N, M, I

4. Allowed letters (never ruled out yet):
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  plus the required A, E, L.

Therefore the word must be of the form
   _ _ A E _
or
   _ _ A E L   (because L cannot sit at position 4)

and E must be at position 4.

So the skeleton is
   1 2 3 4 5
   _ _ A E _
with L forced into position 1 or 5.

Case 1 – L at position 1:
   L _ A E _

Case 2 – L at position 5:
   _ _ A E L

Using only the still-allowed letters:

Case 1 – L _ A E _ :
   Need a valid 5-letter word.
   Real English words fitting:
   - L B A E D → “LBAED” – not a word
   - L F A E D → nothing
   - L H A E D → nothing
   - L D A E D → nothing
   Actually, the only common word that shows up is “LADED” (past tense of lade) but let’s check: L-A-D-E-D → D is allowed, A fixed, E fixed, L allowed. However, “laded” is valid and uses no banned letters.

Case 2 – _ _ A E L :
   Need a valid word.
   Possible real words:
   - B A G E L → has G, E, L, B, A – all allowed.
   - F A D E L → not a word
   - G A B E L → “gabel” is rare / obsolete
   - D A G E L → nothing
   - H A G E L → nothing
   - W A G E L → nothing
   Best actual word here is “BAGEL”.

Between “laded” and “bagel”, “bagel” feels the more common choice and tests new letters (B, G).

So we’ll guess BAGEL.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

So we know:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S

I need a new word that:
1. Contains both A and E somewhere (but A not in position 1, E not in position 5)

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good letters to try next would be common ones not yet used, such as T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Remaining common letters to try: N, D, G, H, M, Y, C, etc.

We need a word with:

- Contains E (not in position 5)
- Contains L (not in position 2)
- No R, O, S, P, T

Looking for possibilities:
- First letter: could be B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.
- Second letter: could be E, N, D, etc. (but not L)
- Fourth letter: options like E, L, N, etc. (but A is fixed in 3rd)
- Fifth letter: anything except E, R, O, S, P, T

A good candidate is ""GLAND"":
- A is in position 3 ✓

Try ""CLANE"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains E and L ✓
- L is in position 1 (allowed since L can't be in 2, and 3 is A)
- E is in position 5 - but we know E can't be in 5. So this is invalid.

Try ""FLAME"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 2 - but we know L can't be in 2. Invalid.

Try ""BLAME"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- Contains L and E ✓
- L in position 2 - invalid (L can't be in 2)

Try ""GLADE"":

1. From AROSE  
   A is in the word but not at position 1.  
   E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   R, O, S are out.

2. From PLATE  
   A is at position 3.  
   L is in the word but not at position 2.  
   P and T are out.

3. From CLEAN  
   C is out.  
   N is out.  
   L is still in but not at position 2 or 4 (new “not” positions).  
   E is still in but not at position 2 or 5.  
   A is still in but not at positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (only remaining open spot is 2 or 3, but 3 is already taken by A). Wait, let’s double-check: in CLEAN A is at position 4, so A cannot be at 4. But we already know from PLATE that A is fixed at position 3. So A is definitely at position 3.

So the confirmed facts are:
- Position 3 is A.
- E is in the word, not at 2, 3, 5 → E must be at 1 or 4.  
- L is in the word, not at 2, 4 → L must be at 1 or 5.  
- Eliminated letters so far: R, O, S, P, T, C, N.

Remaining letters to work with: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the two known letters E and L.

We need to place:
- A at 3
- E at 1 or 4
- L at 1 or 5

Case 1: E at 1 and L at 5  
Word form: E _ A _ L  
Remaining letters for positions 2 and 4 must come from the safe pool.  
Possible middle letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Try E B A D L → “EBADL” – not a common word.

Try E G A D L → “EGADL” – no.

Try E G A M L → “EGAML” – no.

Let’s look for real English words. The pattern E _ A _ L gives nothing common.

Word form: L _ A E _  
Check common English words:  
L B A E _ – no.  
L D A E D – no.  
L G A E M – no.  
L M A E D – no.  
L F A E R – contains R (out).  
L H A E L – no.  
L M A E N – contains N (out).  
L G A E M – no.

Case 3: E at 1 and L at 1 – impossible (same position).

Case 4: E at 4 and L at 5 – impossible (positions overlap).

Only viable pattern left is L _ A E _ or E _ A _ L. Among these, the only actual 5-letter English word I can see is “LADLE”.  
- L is at 1 (allowed).  
- A is at 3 (fixed).  
- D is new and safe.  
- L is at 4 but wait – 4 is already taken by E. No, word is L-A-D-L-E: positions are 1:L, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:E. But we need A at 3, so that does not fit.

Wait, I misread. Let’s write it out:

Pattern for A at 3:

We need 5 positions:

1 2 3 4 5
_ _ A _ _

With constraints:
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- L must be in 1 or 5.  

Subcases:

Subcase A – E at 1, L at 5:
1:E, 2:?, 3:A, 4:?, 5:L  
Need a valid word E _ A _ L.  
Common word: “EMAIL” – but contains I and M which are allowed and not yet ruled out.  
Check eliminated letters: E, M, A, I, L – none are in the banned list R,O,S,P,T,C,N.  
So EMAIL is a valid candidate.

Subcase B – E at 4, L at 1:
1:L, 2:?, 3:A, 4:E, 5:?  
Word L _ A E _. Common word: L A V E R – contains R (out). L A Z E D – but D is allowed, Z allowed. But LAZED is valid.  
But we don’t have info against D or Z. However, we have more constraints: L at 1, A at 3, E at 4. The only common word I see is LAMED (LAMED is valid, uses M, E, D). But D is safe, M is safe.

Between EMAIL and LAMED, EMAIL looks better because it places E at position 1 (still allowed) and L at 5 (allowed), and uses new letters M and I.The constraints narrowed the possibilities down to very few patterns. The most promising remaining word that satisfies all known positions and bans is:

<guess>EMAIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 4: EMAIL -> FEEDBACK: E(-) M(x) A(✓) I(x) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidate everything we now know.

1. Position 3 is definitely A.

2. Letters still required somewhere in the word:
   - E (cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 5) ⇒ must be position 4 only.
   - L (cannot be in position 2, 4) ⇒ must be position 1 or 5.

3. Letters we may **not** use at all:
   R, O, S, P, T, C, N, M, I

4. Allowed letters (never ruled out yet):
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  plus the required A, E, L.

Therefore the word must be of the form
   _ _ A E _
or
   _ _ A E L   (because L cannot sit at position 4)

and E must be at position 4.

So the skeleton is
   1 2 3 4 5
   _ _ A E _
with L forced into position 1 or 5.

Case 1 – L at position 1:
   L _ A E _

Case 2 – L at position 5:
   _ _ A E L

Using only the still-allowed letters:

Case 1 – L _ A E _ :
   Need a valid 5-letter word.
   Real English words fitting:
   - L B A E D → “LBAED” – not a word
   - L F A E D → nothing
   - L H A E D → nothing
   - L D A E D → nothing
   Actually, the only common word that shows up is “LADED” (past tense of lade) but let’s check: L-A-D-E-D → D is allowed, A fixed, E fixed, L allowed. However, “laded” is valid and uses no banned letters.

Case 2 – _ _ A E L :
   Need a valid word.
   Possible real words:
   - B A G E L → has G, E, L, B, A – all allowed.
   - F A D E L → not a word
   - G A B E L → “gabel” is rare / obsolete
   - D A G E L → nothing
   - H A G E L → nothing
   - W A G E L → nothing
   Best actual word here is “BAGEL”.

Between “laded” and “bagel”, “bagel” feels the more common choice and tests new letters (B, G).

So we’ll guess BAGEL.

Summary of everything we know after five guesses:

1. Position 3 is definitely A.  
2. The word must contain both E and L somewhere, besides the already-fixed A.  
3. Forbidden letters so far:  
   R, O, S, P, T, C, N, M, I, B, G  
4. Allowed letters (never ruled out):  
   D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  (plus A, E, L)  

5. Positional exclusions for the required letters:
   - A is locked at position 3.  
   - E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 ⇒ E **must** sit in position 4.  
   - L cannot be in positions 2, 4 ⇒ L must be in position 1 or 5.

Hence the only possible templates are:
a) L _ A E _   (L at 1, E at 4)  
b) _ _ A E L   (E at 4, L at 5)

Using only the still-allowed consonants (D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z):

a) L _ A E _ :  
   – The blank (position 2) and the last blank (position 5) must be chosen from the safe set.  
   – We need a real 5-letter English word of the form L ? A E ?.  
   – The only such common word left is L F A E D → “LFAED” – not a word.  
   – “LADED” was considered earlier but uses D twice and still doesn’t fit the required structure (it repeats D at the end).  
   – No other real word matches L?AE? with allowed letters.

b) _ _ A E L :  
   – The blanks at positions 1 and 2 must come from the safe set.  
   – The only real 5-letter English word that fits is F A D E L, but F-A-D-E-L is not recognized.  
   – H A D E L is not a word.  
   – D A D E L – no.  
   – The actual common word here is “HADEL”? No.  
   – The only remaining common word left is “FADEL” (again not valid).  

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed list carefully. We have D allowed.  
Real English word: D A D E L – not valid.  
Another look: the only valid word left is “HAZEL” but Z and H are still allowed. Let me confirm:

H and Z: neither has been ruled out yet.  
H-A-Z-E-L → H, A, Z, E, L – no banned letters.  
That is a perfectly valid word that matches the pattern _ _ A E L with the required letters and positions.

Therefore the best remaining guess is HAZEL.
