For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the target word. Some popular starting words include ""AUDIO"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", but these have 4 vowels which might not be optimal. 

I think a balanced approach is better - using common consonants and a couple of vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (extremely common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know the word has the pattern _ L A _ _ and does not contain S, T, or E.

Good next letters to try would be common consonants and different vowels. Since we have A locked in position 3, we need to test other letters for positions 1, 4, and 5. 

Possible vowels to test: I, O, U
Common consonants to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, R, etc.

Since we have L-A in the middle, testing words like CLAMP, FLANK, or GLAND would be good options. I'll go with ""FLANK"" as it:
- Uses F (new consonant)
- Keeps L and A in correct positions
- Tests N and K (new consonants)

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → _ L A _ _

2. FLANK → _ L A _ K  
   L and A are still correct in positions 2 and 3, and now we know K is correct in position 5.  
   No F or N anywhere.

Pattern so far: _ L A _ K  
Allowed letters (excludes S, T, E, F, N).

Good next consonants to test for positions 1 and 4: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, R, etc.  
Vowels already placed? Only A is locked; positions 1 and 4 could still have vowels or consonants.

I want a word that fits _ L A _ K and tests two new letters, preferably one new vowel and one new consonant.  
A simple choice is “BLACK” (tests B and C) but C would be the 4th letter, giving us L-A-C-K which already has K in the 5th spot – that fits the pattern and tests two new letters.
