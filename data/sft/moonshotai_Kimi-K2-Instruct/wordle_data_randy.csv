For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - covering several high-frequency letters. This will help identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Check positions:

- G, D new.  
- R in spot 2 — again same spot. Invalid.

Next: “MURAL” — missing N.  
“URBAN” — B new, U new.  
Check positions:  
U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5).  
- A is allowed in 4.  
- R in 2 is forbidden. Invalid.

“ULNAR” — but includes I (not allowed).  
“RANID” — but I and D, but I is out.  

We need R not in 2 or 3, A not in 1 or 3, N not in 5.  
Let’s list possible positions:  
A: 2,4,5  
R: 1,4,5 (but 4 and 5 might conflict with A or N)  
N: 1,2,3,4  

A word that fits: “GRAIN” — but I is out.  
“CRANE” — but E is out.  
“FRANK” — K new, F new, but R in 2 invalid.  

Back to basics: need a word with A, R, N, avoiding the forbidden spots, plus two fresh consonants.  
Possible: “BRAWN” — but W new. Check positions:  
B(1), R(2) invalid as before.  

“CARNY” — Y questionable. Let’s avoid obscure letters.  

“DRAIN” — I out.  

“NURAR” — invalid duplicate R.  

“RANCH” — C, H new. Check positions:  
R(1) allowed, A(2) allowed (A not in 1 or 3), N(3) allowed (N not in 5), C(4), H(5). No conflicts.  
Letters: R, A, N, C, H.  
Uses known A, R, N, introduces C, H, both common.  

This looks good.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters and positions:
- R = 1st letter
- A = 2nd letter
- N = 3rd letter

Eliminated letters: O, S, E, T, I, C, H

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RAN and uses two new, still-possible consonants or vowels. Available high-frequency letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, Y.

The pattern is R A N _ _

A good next guess should test two fresh letters. Take “RANDY”: letters Y and D have not been used, and neither was ruled out.

Check positions:
- R A N D Y → R(1)✓ A(2)✓ N(3)✓ D(4) new, Y(5) new.

This maximizes new information while respecting all constraints.
