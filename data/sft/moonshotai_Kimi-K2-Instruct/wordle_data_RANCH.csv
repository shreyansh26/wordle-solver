1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Words with common vowels and consonants like A, E, S, T, R, N, L, etc. are good starting points because they help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

A classic strong starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us information about 5 of the most frequently occurring letters in English words, which should help narrow down possibilities effectively regardless of the feedback.

Another good option would be ""AROSE"", but I'll go with SLATE as it has a slightly better balance of consonants and vowels for initial elimination.

From the feedback:
- S: x → S is not in the word at all.
- L: x → L is not in the word at all.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T: x → T is not in the word at all.
- E: x → E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere, but not in the 3rd position.
- The letters S, L, T, E do not appear anywhere in the word.

Next, I should try a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not 3).
2. Uses other common letters not yet eliminated (like R, N, I, O, U, D, etc.).
3. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

A strong second guess would be ""RADIO"" because:
- It has A in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback)
- Includes R, D, I, O which are all common and not yet tested
- Avoids all eliminated letters (S, L, T, E)

Feedback summary so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. RADIO → R(✓) A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(x)  
   – R is correct in position 1.  
   – A is correct in position 2 (which also satisfies the “A not in position 3” rule).  
   – D, I, O are NOT in the word at all.

Current template: R A _ _ _

Allowed letters must exclude: S, L, T, E, D, I, O.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tested yet: N, C, M, K, B, G, P, etc.  
Remaining usable vowels: since E, I, O are out, only A (already placed) and U and Y are left.

Good candidates for positions 3-4-5:  
– Want to keep A at 2 and R at 1, so focus on slots 3-4-5.  
– Need 3 letters from {N, C, M, K, B, G, P, U, Y}.

A very frequent word pattern RA + NCH or RA + NKY etc.  
RAUNCH and RANKY are 6 letters, but RANCH is 5 letters and fits all constraints (R, A, N, C, H). It uses N and C which haven’t been tested yet, and H which is common.

Let me check:
- R – fixed at 1 ✓  
- A – fixed at 2 ✓  
- N – untested, possible ✓  
- C – untested, possible ✓  
- H – untested, possible ✓  
No forbidden letters appear.

So RANCH seems optimal.
