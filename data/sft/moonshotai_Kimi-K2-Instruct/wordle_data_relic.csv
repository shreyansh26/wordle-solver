1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and I appear frequently in English words. A good starting word should cover multiple vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the first feedback:
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere (but not in the positions tried): R, E
- Positions tested for R (2) and E (5) are ruled out.

We want a new guess that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Does not contain A, O, S.
3. Uses only 5-letter English words.

Good candidate letters to test next include common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, and the remaining vowels I, U.  
A strong next guess that satisfies these constraints is “INERT”:
- It contains R and E.
- It avoids A, O, S.
- Tests new positions for R and E.
- Includes other common letters (I, N, T) to gather more information.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
Meaning:  
- A, O, S are not in the target word at all.  
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

Guess 2: INERT  
Feedback: I(-) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(x)  
Meaning:  
- N and T are NOT in the word.  
- I is in the word, but not in position 1.  
- E is in the word, but not in position 3.  
- R is in the word, but not in position 4.

So far we know for sure the target contains:  
Letters that MUST appear: E, R, I  
Letters that CANNOT appear: A, O, S, N, T  

Positions ruled out:  
- R cannot be in 2 or 4  
- E cannot be in 3 or 5  
- I cannot be in 1  

We want a new 5-letter English word that:  
- Contains each of E, R, I exactly once (because duplicates would have shown extra hints).  
- Excludes A, O, S, N, T.  
- Places R in positions 1, 3 or 5  
- Places E in positions 1, 2 or 4  
- Places I in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5

A quick check of remaining common letters that are still allowed (from the alphabet minus the forbidden ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more distinct letters from that set.

Let’s try to construct a word that hits all constraints.  
Example:  
- Position 1: R (allowed)  
- Position 2: E (allowed)  
- Position 3: I (allowed)  
- Positions 4 & 5: two other allowed letters.

The word “REHAB” fails (A is excluded).  
“RELIC” is no good (N and T already excluded, but L and C are allowed).  
Wait: RELIC uses L and C — both are allowed.  
Check letter set: R, E, L, I, C — all allowed.  
Positions:  
- R (pos 1) – allowed  
- E (pos 2) – allowed (not 3 or 5)
