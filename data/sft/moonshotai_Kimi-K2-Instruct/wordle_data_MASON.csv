Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback from previous guesses, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. According to letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to maximize coverage. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices among experienced players.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no duplicate letters, which should give me good information about which of these letters appear in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters A, O, S (each must appear exactly once, since duplicates weren’t hinted).
- Does NOT contain R or E.
- The positions of A, O, and S are still unknown but cannot be where they were in AROSE.

Next, I need a word that:
1. Includes A, O, and S in different positions from AROSE.
2. Excludes R and E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates might be words like “COAST” (but O and A are in the same positions as before) or “SALON” (S is in position 1, which is new). Let me pick “COAST”:
- C: new letter
- O: new position (2)
- A: new position (3)
- S: new position (4)
- T: new letter

However, in “COAST”, A is still position 3 (same as AROSE), which is invalid since A was marked “-” (wrong position). So A cannot be in position 3. Similarly, O cannot be in position 2 (same as AROSE), and S cannot be in position 4.

Instead, let’s try “SALON”:
- S: new position (1)
- A: new position (2)
- L: new letter
- O: new position (4)
- N: new letter

This satisfies all constraints:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was previously position 4).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, since it was previously position 1).
- O is now in position 4 (allowed, since it was previously position 3).
- Letters R and E are excluded.
- Adds new letters L and N for information gain.

From the new feedback on SALON:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: N
- Contains S somewhere else (positions 3 is possible, but we’ll see).
- Does NOT contain R, E, L.

We still need to determine letters for positions 1 and 3. The remaining letters used in previous guesses that are allowed: A, O, S (but A and O are already placed). New common letters to test: C, D, I, T, U, etc.

Possible patterns: _ A _ O N, with S allowed in position 3.

Let’s think of words that fit _ A _ O N and contain S, without R, E, L. The missing letters are positions 1 and 3. 

Possible words:
- C A S O N (but ""CASON"" isn’t a valid English word).
- M A S O N → valid word ""MASON"".
- T A S O N → ""TASON"" isn’t valid.
- B A S O N → ""BASON"" isn’t valid.
- P A S O N → ""PASON"" isn’t valid.

""MASON"" seems like the only valid candidate that fits _ A _ O N, includes S, and uses new letters M and A (A is already placed), and doesn’t violate any constraints.

Let me verify:
- M: new letter, position 1.
- A: already confirmed position 2.
- S: allowed in position 3 (was in positions 1 and 4 in previous guesses, so position 3 is new).
- O: confirmed position 4.
