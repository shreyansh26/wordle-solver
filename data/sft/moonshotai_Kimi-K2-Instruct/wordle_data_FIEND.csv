As this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should include common letters and vowels to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. The word should avoid rare letters or uncommon combinations.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- ABOUT (covers A, B, O, U, T)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It uses C and R (common consonants)
2. Uses A and E (common vowels)
3. Uses N which is a common ending letter
4. Doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information

- Ends with “END” (positions 3-5: E N D)
- Does not contain C, R, A, S, P
- Uses only remaining common letters (e.g., B, L, M, T, etc.)

Possible candidates:
- **BLEND**: B, L, E, N, D → B and L are still possible.  
- **FLEND** → Not a valid English word.  
- **GLEND** → Not valid.  
- **MEND** → Too short.  
- **TREND** → Contains R (excluded).  
- **BREND** → Contains R.  
- **LEND** → Too short.  

The only valid word fitting _ _ E N D and avoiding all excluded letters is **BLEND**.

However, **BLEND** contains B and L, neither of which has been excluded yet. It fits all constraints perfectly.

From the new feedback for BLEND:

B (1st) → x → B is not in the word.  
L (2nd) → x → L is not in the word.  
E (3rd) → ✓ → E is in the word and in the 3rd position.  
N (4th) → ✓ → N is in the word and in the 4th position.  
D (5th) → ✓ → D is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the pattern is: _ _ E N D.

Letters confirmed NOT in the word so far: C, R, A, S, P, B, L.

Letters confirmed IN the word, in exact positions: E (3), N (4), D (5).

We now need to fill the first two blanks with letters that are not yet excluded (i.e., not in {C,R,A,S,P,B,L}). Remaining common letters include: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since D, E, N are already used in their correct positions, we can ignore them for the first two positions. Valid letters for the first two positions: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that starts with two letters from the above set and ends with ""END"".

Possible candidates:
- FIEND → F, I, E, N, D. Letters F and I are not excluded. This seems valid.
- FIEND is a valid English word.

Let's check other possibilities:
- GIEND → Not a valid word.
- HIEND → Not valid.
- JIEND → Not valid.
- MIEND → Not valid.
- TIEND → Not valid.
- Other combinations are either invalid or use excluded letters.

Thus, FIEND is the only valid candidate.
