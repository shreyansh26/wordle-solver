For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can help me eliminate many common letters and potentially reveal some correct ones. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices among Wordle players. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This combination should give me good initial information about letter presence and positions.

- avoids all eliminated letters R, I, S, M, N, G

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left (besides A and E): none, since I is out.

- CABLE (C, A, B, L, E) – fits all rules
- TABLE (T, A, B, L, E) – T is a common consonant
- VALUE (V, A, L, U, E) – U is untested

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,HEAVE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can help me eliminate many common letters and potentially reveal some correct ones. A good starting word should have common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices among Wordle players. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This combination should give me good initial information about letter presence and positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word AND in the last position (✓)

So far we know:
Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S
Letters in the word somewhere: A
Letters in the correct position: E in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A somewhere other than position 2
- Ends with E
- Does not use R, I, or S

Common words that fit these constraints could be:
- PLATE (but T might not be helpful)
- FABLE (but B and L might be too restrictive)
- MANGE (M, A, N, G, E)
- WAGUE (but G and U might not be ideal)
- CABLE (C, A, B, L, E)

I'll go with MANGE as it uses common letters and provides good coverage for the next steps.

Letters known NOT in the word: R, I, S, M, N, G  
Letter in the word but wrong positions so far: A (it cannot be in 2nd place)  
Letter locked in the correct position: E (5th spot)

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- ends with E
- contains A (but not in 2nd position)
- avoids all eliminated letters R, I, S, M, N, G

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left (besides A and E): none, since I is out.

Let’s pick a word that places A in 3rd or 4th position and tries fresh consonants. A few possibilities:
- CABLE (C, A, B, L, E) – fits all rules
- TABLE (T, A, B, L, E) – T is a common consonant
- VALUE (V, A, L, U, E) – U is untested
- FABLE (F, A, B, L, E)

TABLE uses the new letters T, B, L and keeps A in the 3rd position.

- HARRY – R is eliminated
- HAPPY – P, Y are new, P is in 3rd (but A is in 4th)

Valid candidates:
- HEADY – ends with Y, not E
- HEAVE – H E A V E (H in 1st, A in 4th, E in 5th, V is new)
- HEDGE – G eliminated
- HEFTE – not a word

HEAVE fits all rules:
- H in 1st position (valid)
- A in 4th (correct)
- E in 5th (correct)
- V is new and untested

<guess>HEAVE</guess>",HEAVE,"From the feedback on CHAFE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- H is in the word but in the WRONG position (-)
- A is in the word AND in the correct (4th) position (✓)
- F is NOT in the word (x)
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (✓)

So now we know:
- Correct letters and positions: A _ _ A E
- Letters still in play: H (somewhere, but not 2nd)
- Letters eliminated so far: R, I, S, M, N, G, T, B, L, C, F
- Still untested (and useful) consonants: D, J, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in AE (_ _ _ A E)
- has H somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is A, so 1 or 3)
- avoids all eliminated letters

Possible placements for H:
- H _ _ A E (position 1)
- _ _ H A E (position 3)

Let’s list candidates:
- HEADS – but S is eliminated
- HEAVE – H E A V E (V is new)
- HEDGE – D is new, but G is eliminated
- HEFTE – not a word
- HENCE – N is eliminated
- HEVEL – not a word
- HAVEL – L is eliminated
- HAZEL – Z is new, L is eliminated
- HARRY – R is eliminated
- HAPPY – P, Y are new, P is in 3rd (but A is in 4th)

Valid candidates:
- HEADY – ends with Y, not E
- HEAVE – H E A V E (H in 1st, A in 4th, E in 5th, V is new)
- HEDGE – G eliminated
- HEFTE – not a word

HEAVE fits all rules:
- H in 1st position (valid)
- A in 4th (correct)
- E in 5th (correct)
- V is new and untested",Guess 5: HEAVE -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
