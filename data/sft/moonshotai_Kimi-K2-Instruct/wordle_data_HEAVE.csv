Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. I'll choose a word with frequently used consonants and vowels.

A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters to maximize coverage

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- Three vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S
- All unique letters
This is a well-known strong opening word in Wordle-like games.

1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are excluded.

- Avoid R, O, S.
- Introduce new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ALIEN”:

Let's summarize what we now know from the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALIEN → A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)

Key deductions:
1. E is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1–4 (since E was ✓ in position 5 of AROSE, but only “-” in position 4 of ALIEN). So E must be in position 5.  
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5. Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.  
3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are **all excluded** from the word.  
4. So far allowed letters: A and E. We need to test other common consonants: T, C, D, G, P, B, K, M, etc.

A word that satisfies:
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Contains A in position 3 or 4.  
- Uses only remaining common letters (T, C, D, G, etc.).

Let’s try:
- C in 1, A in 3, T in 4 → C _ A T E → but CATTE is not valid.  
- M in 1, A in 4 → M _ _ A E → MUGAE not valid.  
- B in 1, A in 3 → B _ A _ E → BARGE? But R is excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CABLE? L excluded.  
- P in 1, A in 3 → P _ A _ E → PADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CREAK? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAKE E in 5 → CAKEE invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAGE? Needs 5 letters.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CARE? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAMEL? L excluded.  

Another approach: A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A E  
- Valid common letters left: D, T, C, G, B, K, M, H, etc.  
- Try 1: C, 2: H → CH A E → CHA_E → CHAFE? F is a new letter.  
- CHAFE: C, H, A, F, E.  
   - Uses A in 3 (but we deduced A must be in 3 or 4).  
   - Uses new letters C, H, F.  
   - No banned letters (R, O, S, L, I, N).  

Let me double-check: CHAFE has:
- C, H, A, F, E.  
- A is in position 3.

From the three pieces of feedback we have:

2. ALIEN → A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)

3. CHAFE → C(x) H(-) A(✓) F(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ C, F absent; H exists somewhere; A is now pinned in slot 3; E in slot 5.

Current constraints:
- Word must be: _ _ A _ E
- Valid letters so far: A (fixed in 3), E (fixed in 5), H (somewhere), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, C, F, plus any already used and ruled out (none left in the above list).

Slots 1, 2, 4 remain.  
Slot 4 must be a consonant that hasn’t been tried.  
Common unused consonants: B, D, G, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s build candidates:
- _ _ A _ E with H in 1, 2, or 4:
   - H _ A _ E   → H B A T E (B & T new) → HBATE invalid.  
   - _ H A _ E   → T H A T E → T H A T E = THATE (not a word), D H A M E = DHAME (invalid).  
   - _ _ A H E   → B G A H E (invalid).  

Alternatively, H in 2:
- D H A M E – invalid.  
- M H A T E – invalid.  
- P H A S E – S already banned.  
- T H A M E – THAME (not common).  
- B H A D E – BHADE (invalid).  

Another angle: put H in 4:
- _ _ A H E  
- Need valid consonants for slots 1 & 2.  
- Common: B, D, G, K, M, P, T.  
- B A T H E → B A T H E = BATHE – uses B, T, H.  
   – B, T, H not yet excluded.  
   – A in 3, E in 5, no banned letters.  

BATHE seems to satisfy every constraint.

Check:
- B: new, allowed.  
- A: correct in 3.  
- T: new, allowed.  
- H: allowed, in 4.  
- E: correct in 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

I'll choose a word with frequently used consonants and vowels.

A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters to maximize coverage

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- Three vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S
- All unique letters
This is a well-known strong opening word in Wordle-like games.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first).
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are excluded.
3. A appears somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it’s not first and not last).

Next guess should:
- Keep the known E in position 5.
- Use A somewhere in positions 2-4.
- Avoid R, O, S.
- Introduce new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ALIEN”:
- A in position 2 (possible since A is somewhere not first).
- L, I, N are common consonants not yet tested.
- E in position 5 is fixed.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALIEN → A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)

Key deductions:
1. E is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1–4 (since E was ✓ in position 5 of AROSE, but only “-” in position 4 of ALIEN). So E must be in position 5.  
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5. Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.  
3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are **all excluded** from the word.  
4. So far allowed letters: A and E. We need to test other common consonants: T, C, D, G, P, B, K, M, etc.

A word that satisfies:
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Contains A in position 3 or 4.  
- Uses only remaining common letters (T, C, D, G, etc.).

Let’s try:
- C in 1, A in 3, T in 4 → C _ A T E → but CATTE is not valid.  
- M in 1, A in 4 → M _ _ A E → MUGAE not valid.  
- B in 1, A in 3 → B _ A _ E → BARGE? But R is excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CABLE? L excluded.  
- P in 1, A in 3 → P _ A _ E → PADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CREAK? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAKE E in 5 → CAKEE invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAGE? Needs 5 letters.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CARE? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAMEL? L excluded.  

Another approach: A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A E  
- Valid common letters left: D, T, C, G, B, K, M, H, etc.  
- Try 1: C, 2: H → CH A E → CHA_E → CHAFE? F is a new letter.  
- CHAFE: C, H, A, F, E.  
   - Uses A in 3 (but we deduced A must be in 3 or 4).  
   - Uses new letters C, H, F.  
   - No banned letters (R, O, S, L, I, N).

Let’s collect everything we know.

Letters ruled out:  
R, O, S, L, I, N, C, F, B, T

Letters confirmed:  
E is in position 5.  
A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (since it was “-” in both ALIEN and BATHE).  
From earlier we knew A is also not in 1 or 5, so A must be in position 4.  
That fixes the pattern: _ _ _ A E

Letters that have not been ruled out and could still appear in the first three slots:  
D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A & E already placed).  
Of these, the most common English consonants are D, G, H, K, M, P.

We have three empty slots (1, 2, 3) to fill with new consonants from that set, no repeats.

We need a real English word of the form ???AE.

Quick candidates:
- P A D A E – invalid (repeats A).  
- G A M E ? – no, pattern is ???AE.  
List of valid words ending in AE is tiny; most candidates ending in AE are archaic or plurals.  
However, in Wordle the secret word can be any common 5-letter word, and “GLADE” is common (but ends in E, not AE).  
Wait: the pattern is _ _ _ A E, so we’re looking for words like:  
- G R A D E – but R and D are ruled out? R is ruled out, D is allowed (not yet tested).  
- D A M E – too short.  
Real words of the form ???AE are:  
- GLADE – no, ends in DE.  
- GRAPE – ends in PE.  
We are actually looking for words whose last two letters are AE.  
List of common 5-letter words ending in AE:  
- PAEON – not common.  
- ULNAE – plural of ulna.  
- VOCAE – not common.  
- AERAE – not common.  
Most are rare. The only fairly common one that might appear in a Wordle list is “ULNAE”, but that starts with U. U hasn’t been tested yet, L has been ruled out. So ULNAE has L, which is banned.  

Scanning again, “PAYAE” is non-existent.  
“PUPAE” – plural of pupa. Letters: P, U, P, A, E. P is allowed, U is allowed. However P is repeated, which costs info. Still, it’s a valid English word.  

Other possibilities:  
- PUPAE – P U P A E  
- VENAE – V E N A E – but N is ruled out.  
- VITAE – V I T A E – I and T are ruled out.  
- CULAE – C is out.  
- AREAE – A repeated, R out.  

PUPAE seems the only common enough word left fitting _ _ _ A E with only untested letters (P, U). Let’s use it.

But we can do better: instead of repeating P, test new letters.  
Another pattern: _ _ _ A E. We already have A fixed at 4, E at 5. Let’s choose three distinct new consonants from the allowed set.

Allowed consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Try:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,HEAVE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. I'll choose a word with frequently used consonants and vowels.

A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters to maximize coverage

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- Three vowels: A, O, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S
- All unique letters
This is a well-known strong opening word in Wordle-like games.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first).
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are excluded.
3. A appears somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it’s not first and not last).

Next guess should:
- Keep the known E in position 5.
- Use A somewhere in positions 2-4.
- Avoid R, O, S.
- Introduce new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ALIEN”:
- A in position 2 (possible since A is somewhere not first).
- L, I, N are common consonants not yet tested.
- E in position 5 is fixed.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ALIEN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we now know from the two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALIEN → A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)

Key deductions:
1. E is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1–4 (since E was ✓ in position 5 of AROSE, but only “-” in position 4 of ALIEN). So E must be in position 5.  
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5. Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.  
3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are **all excluded** from the word.  
4. So far allowed letters: A and E. We need to test other common consonants: T, C, D, G, P, B, K, M, etc.

A word that satisfies:
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Contains A in position 3 or 4.  
- Uses only remaining common letters (T, C, D, G, etc.).

Let’s try:
- C in 1, A in 3, T in 4 → C _ A T E → but CATTE is not valid.  
- M in 1, A in 4 → M _ _ A E → MUGAE not valid.  
- B in 1, A in 3 → B _ A _ E → BARGE? But R is excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CABLE? L excluded.  
- P in 1, A in 3 → P _ A _ E → PADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CADDE? Invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 4 → C _ _ A E → CREAK? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAKE E in 5 → CAKEE invalid.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAGE? Needs 5 letters.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CARE? R excluded.  
- C in 1, A in 3 → C _ A _ E → CAMEL? L excluded.  

Another approach: A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A E  
- Valid common letters left: D, T, C, G, B, K, M, H, etc.  
- Try 1: C, 2: H → CH A E → CHA_E → CHAFE? F is a new letter.  
- CHAFE: C, H, A, F, E.  
   - Uses A in 3 (but we deduced A must be in 3 or 4).  
   - Uses new letters C, H, F.  
   - No banned letters (R, O, S, L, I, N).  

Let me double-check: CHAFE has:
- C, H, A, F, E.  
- A is in position 3.  
- E in position 5.  
- No R, O, S, L, I, N.  

Seems valid.

Guess 3: CHAFE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) A(✓) F(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ A exists, wrong spot; R, O, S absent; E correct in slot 5.

2. ALIEN → A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)  
   ⇒ L, I, N absent; E exists but not in slot 4; A exists but not in slot 1 or 2.

3. CHAFE → C(x) H(-) A(✓) F(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ C, F absent; H exists somewhere; A is now pinned in slot 3; E in slot 5.

Current constraints:
- Word must be: _ _ A _ E
- Valid letters so far: A (fixed in 3), E (fixed in 5), H (somewhere), plus any other letters not yet ruled out.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, C, F, plus any already used and ruled out (none left in the above list).

Slots 1, 2, 4 remain.  
Slot 4 must be a consonant that hasn’t been tried.  
Common unused consonants: B, D, G, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s build candidates:
- _ _ A _ E with H in 1, 2, or 4:
   - H _ A _ E   → H B A T E (B & T new) → HBATE invalid.  
   - _ H A _ E   → T H A T E → T H A T E = THATE (not a word), D H A M E = DHAME (invalid).  
   - _ _ A H E   → B G A H E (invalid).  

Alternatively, H in 2:
- D H A M E – invalid.  
- M H A T E – invalid.  
- P H A S E – S already banned.  
- T H A M E – THAME (not common).  
- B H A D E – BHADE (invalid).  

Another angle: put H in 4:
- _ _ A H E  
- Need valid consonants for slots 1 & 2.  
- Common: B, D, G, K, M, P, T.  
- B A T H E → B A T H E = BATHE – uses B, T, H.  
   – B, T, H not yet excluded.  
   – A in 3, E in 5, no banned letters.  

BATHE seems to satisfy every constraint.

Check:
- B: new, allowed.  
- A: correct in 3.  
- T: new, allowed.  
- H: allowed, in 4.  
- E: correct in 5.  
- No forbidden letters (R, O, S, L, I, N, C, F).  

So BATHE is a valid next guess.

<guess>PUPAE</guess>From the feedback we have:

- E is fixed in position 5.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (because it was “-” when tried in slots 1, 2, 3 and we already knew it’s not last).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4, giving the exact pattern: _ _ _ A E.

Letters still allowed for slots 1–3: D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a common English word of the form ???AE.

Among the limited options, the only common-enough word that fits is:

<guess>PUPAE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Let’s update our constraints after the five guesses.

1. E is fixed in position 5.  
   Pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E  

2. A is confirmed in the word but **not** in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it has always been “-”).  
   The only spot left for A is **position 4**, but that conflicts with E already in 5.  
   Therefore A must indeed be in position 4, giving the fixed pattern:  
   _ _ _ A E  

3. Letters already ruled out:  
   R, O, S, L, I, N, C, F, B, T, P, U  

4. Letters still allowed for the first three slots (must be consonants, no repeats):  
   D, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y  

5. We need a common English 5-letter word matching the pattern ???AE.

Valid words left:
- IMAGE → I is ruled out.  
- GAMAE → archaic, and A repeats.  
- VENAE → N is ruled out.  
- VITAE → I, T ruled out.  
- ULNAE → L, N ruled out.  
- DAGAE → not a word.  
- MAKEE → not a word.  
- DRAKE → R, K valid but R is ruled out.  
- HAVAE → not a word.  
- MAVAE → not a word.  

Rechecking a Scrabble list, the only real English 5-letter word ending in AE that uses no banned letters is:

DAGAE – but that’s not common.  
The next possibility is to realize the puzzle list may include the uncommon but Scrabble-legal **DAGAE**.

However, let’s double-check the pattern again: we have _ _ _ A E.  
With remaining letters: D, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.

Possible consonant triplets:
- D G A E – invalid (needs 5 letters).  
- D H A E – invalid.  
- G H A E – invalid.  
- M A D A E – M A D A E = MADAE – not a word.  
- M A K A E – not a word.  
- V A G A E – not a word.  

The only word that appears in the Scrabble/NWL list and uses only allowed letters is **DAGAE** (plural of daga, an old word). Even though obscure, it satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next (and highly constrained) guess is:
