Since this is the first guess (with no prior feedback), the optimal strategy is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means using a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: covers very common letters S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because:
1. It contains two very common vowels (A, E)
2. It contains three common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This will give us good coverage to narrow down the possibilities quickly.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, meaning none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore we must pick a 5-letter word that:

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, or E  
- Still uses common remaining letters so we can quickly narrow the search space

Common consonants we still have to test: R, N, I, O, U, D, M, C, H, etc.  
Common vowels we still have to test: I, O, U, Y (since A and E are out).

A word like “ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all fresh letters and fairly common.  
Another good candidate is “CHURN” or “MOURN”, but “ROUND” feels slightly more balanced.

Let’s go with ROUND.

Current status:
- Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, M, Y
- Letters known to be in the word: O (and O is fixed in 2nd position)
- Letters that are in the word but not in the positions tried yet: C and H (from MOCHY feedback)

Therefore the word pattern is: ? O ? ? ?

And it must include C and H somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus C and H which we know are in the word.

We need to place C and H in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and fill the remaining spots with letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- C in position 1: C O H ? ? or C O ? H ?
- H in position 1: H O C ? ? or H O ? C ?
- C in position 3: ? O C H ? or ? O C ? H
- H in position 3: ? O H C ? or ? O H ? C
- etc.

Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit ? O ? ? ? with C and H somewhere.

Looking at possible words:
- BOCH? - but B is allowed, but no common word
- COB?H - but we don't know if B is correct
- HOC?K - possible, but K is allowed
- POOCH - but P, O, O, C, H - O is already in position 2, so POOCH would have O in position 2 and 3, which might be okay
- POUCH - but U is eliminated
- COUGH - but U is eliminated
- BOTCH - B, O, T, C, H - T is eliminated
- HOTCH - H, O, T, C, H - T is eliminated
- PITCH - but I is allowed, T is eliminated
- PORCH - R is eliminated
- VOUCH - V, O, U, C, H - U is eliminated
- WOOCH - W, O, O, C, H - O is already in position 2, so W O O C H is possible but double O
- CONCH - N is eliminated
- POUCH - U is eliminated
- BOOCH - B, O, O, C, H - possible but double O

Looking at the above, ""BOOCH"" seems to fit:
- B is allowed
- O in position 2
- O in position 3 (repetition allowed)
- C in position 4 (after being in position 3 in MOCHY, now trying position 4)
- H in position 5 (after being in position 4 in MOCHY, now trying position 5)

But ""BOOCH"" isn't a common word. 

Another option is ""COBHH"" - but that's not a word.

Wait, let's think of real words:
- POOCH - P, O, O, C, H - this is a real word
- Mooch - but M is eliminated
- Cooey - but Y is eliminated
- Wooch - not a word

""POOCH"" seems the best:
- P is allowed
- O in position 2
- O in position 3
- C in position 4
- H in position 5

This tests:
- P as a new letter
- Double O (positions 2 and 3)
- C in position 4 (was in position 3 before)
- H in position 5 (was in position 4 before)

This gives maximum new information.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2
- C and H are in the word but not in their previous positions (positions 3 and 4 respectively)
- Many letters have been eliminated

The pattern is: _ O _ _ _ with C and H somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""POOCH"":
- P (new letter)
- O (confirmed in position 2)
- O (second O allowed)
- C (moved from position 3 to 4)
- H (moved from position 4 to 5)
