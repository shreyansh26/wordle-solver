For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. The best opening words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

One of the most statistically optimal opening words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of frequent letters to start eliminating possibilities.

From the first feedback on SLATE:

- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So:
- We can eliminate all words containing S, L, A, T entirely.
- We must include E somewhere other than position 5.
- The remaining letters from our pool should be consonants and vowels we have not ruled out (common ones left: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, G, etc.).

Aiming for a new word that:
1. Contains E (not in position 5).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A strong next guess is ""REIGN"":
- R: common consonant, not ruled out.
- E: must be included, placed in position 2 (safe for now).
- I: common vowel, not ruled out.
- G: common consonant, not ruled out.
- N: common consonant, not ruled out.

This should give us more information about the remaining consonants and vowels.

Interpreting the second feedback:

- R is in the word but in the WRONG position (-) ⇒ R ≠ 1st letter.
- E is in the word but in the WRONG position (-) ⇒ E ≠ 2nd letter.
- I is NOT in the word (x) ⇒ eliminate all words containing I.
- G is in the word but in the WRONG position (-) ⇒ G ≠ 4th letter.
- N is in the word but in the WRONG position (-) ⇒ N ≠ 5th letter.

So far we know:
- Must contain: E, R, G, N (each at least once)
- Must NOT contain: S, L, A, T, I
- E ≠ 5th, R ≠ 1st, G ≠ 4th, N ≠ 5th

Let’s list positions 1-5 and fill what we can:

1: Cannot be S, L, A, T, I, R. Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
2: Cannot be E (already known), nor S, L, A, T, I, R. Possible: same set minus E.
3: No restrictions yet except S, L, A, T, I are out.
4: Cannot be G, nor S, L, A, T, I.
5: Cannot be E or N, nor S, L, A, T, I.

Looking for common 5-letter words meeting these constraints and containing E, R, G, N.

A quick scan gives “GONER”.  
- Contains E, R, G, N (and O, which hasn’t been ruled out).
- Letter positions:
  1: G — allowed (not ruled out for 1st).
  2: O — allowed.
  3: N — allowed.
  4: E — allowed (E may be anywhere except originally 5th; here in 4th: new info).
  5: R — allowed.
