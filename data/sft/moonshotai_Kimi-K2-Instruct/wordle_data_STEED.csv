For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word) and to eliminate many possibilities based on the feedback. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO - another vowel-heavy word

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: fairly common consonant
- R: very common
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage and help narrow down the word quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- E is somewhere other than the last position.

We still have 25 letters to work with (minus CRAN), and we know only that E is present. To maximize information gain, we should pick a new word that:
1. Includes E but not in position 5.
2. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels to gather more feedback.

Good candidates:
- STOLI (but I is less common)
- BLOKE (but K is less common)
- DOUSE (but S and O are good, and E is in position 4)
- MUSED (E in position 4)
- STONE (E in position 5 again → bad, since we know E isn’t there)

Let's go with ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E
- E is in position 4 – ok, not 5.
- Uses S, T, O, N – none of which appeared in CRANE feedback.
- N was already eliminated (N(x)), so STONE is invalid.

Next: ""HIDES"":

However, ""SIDED"" may not be optimal for info gain.

Better: ""SPIKE"" doesn't include D. Need word with D, S, E in pos 4.

However, ""SIDED"" may not be optimal for info gain.

Better: ""SPIKE"" doesn't include D. Need word with D, S, E in pos 4.

Let's try ""DESKS"":
- D in pos 1 (invalid – D not in pos 1)
""SEEDS"" – S in pos 5 invalid, E twice unknown.

""DISKS"" – S in pos 5 invalid.

""BUSED"" is the cleanest so far:
- B new
- U new
- S in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5 (allowed)

This covers new letters B and U while placing S and D appropriately.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,STEED,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word) and to eliminate many possibilities based on the feedback. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO - another vowel-heavy word

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: fairly common consonant
- R: very common
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage and help narrow down the word quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- E is somewhere other than the last position.

We still have 25 letters to work with (minus CRAN), and we know only that E is present. To maximize information gain, we should pick a new word that:
1. Includes E but not in position 5.
2. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels to gather more feedback.

Good candidates:
- STOLI (but I is less common)
- BLOKE (but K is less common)
- DOUSE (but S and O are good, and E is in position 4)
- MUSED (E in position 4)
- STONE (E in position 5 again → bad, since we know E isn’t there)

Let's go with ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E
- E is in position 4 – ok, not 5.
- Uses S, T, O, N – none of which appeared in CRANE feedback.
- N was already eliminated (N(x)), so STONE is invalid.

Adjusted candidate: ""MUSED""
- M, U, S, E, D
- E in position 4 – ok.
- Letters not used yet: M, U, S, D – all new.
- This seems optimal.

Alternatively ""DOLES"":
- D, O, L, E, S
- E in position 4 – ok.
- D, O, L, S – new letters.

I'll choose ""DOLES"" because D, O, L, S are very common and give good coverage.

<guess>DOLES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: DOLES -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N
   - E exists but is not in position 5

2. DOLES → D(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
   - Eliminated letters: O, L
   - D is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 5
   - E is now confirmed in position 4

Current constraints:
- Word contains: E in position 4
- Word also contains: D (not pos 1), S (not pos 5)
- Word excludes: C, R, A, N, O, L

Remaining valid letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E fixed in position 4
- D and S somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5 for D; positions 1-4 for S)
- No C,R,A,N,O,L

Good next guess should reuse D and S and introduce new common letters. Try:
- B, I, T, M, P, U, etc.

Let's test ""SPIKE"":
- S in pos 1 (allowed)
- P new
- I new
- K new
- E in pos 4 (correct)
But need to include D. So invalid.

Try ""DISKS"" – has S twice (S in pos 1 and 5) but 5th S is invalid (feedback says S not in pos 5). Also has K and S twice.

Better candidate: ""DITES"":
- D in pos 1 but feedback says D not in pos 1 (-). Invalid.

Next: ""HIDES"":
- H new
- I new
- D in pos 2 (allowed)
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 but feedback says S not in pos 5 (-). Invalid.

Try ""WIDES"":
- W new
- I new
- D in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 → invalid.

Try ""SIDED"":
- S in pos 1 (ok)
- I new
- D in pos 2 (ok)
- E in pos 4 (ok)
- D in pos 5 (ok)

But ""SIDED"" has D twice, and we only know one D exists. No evidence against it yet, though.

Another option: ""MUSED"":
- M new
- U new
- S in pos 3
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5 (but D must not be in pos 1 – ok here)

But ""MUSED"" was considered in previous step and has D in pos 5, which is allowed (only restriction is D not in pos 1).

However, we need to cover S and D positions better. Let's pick ""BUSED"":
- B new
- U new
- S in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5

Seems valid and covers new letters.

But let's check if any simpler word exists. ""WIDES"" already failed. ""HIDES"" failed.

Another candidate: ""TIDES"":
- T new
- I new
- D in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 (invalid per feedback)

Hmm, S cannot be in pos 5. So we need S in pos 1, 2, or 3.

Best next guess: ""SIDLE"" – but L is eliminated. ""SIDED"" has D twice, no issue yet.

But ""SIDED"" uses S, I, D, E, D – and we know E is in pos 4, D must not be in pos 1 (ok here), S not in pos 5 (ok here), D can be in pos 5.

However, ""SIDED"" may not be optimal for info gain.

Better: ""SPIKE"" doesn't include D. Need word with D, S, E in pos 4.

Let's try ""DESKS"":
- D in pos 1 (invalid – D not in pos 1)
""SEEDS"" – S in pos 5 invalid, E twice unknown.

""DISKS"" – S in pos 5 invalid.

""BUSED"" is the cleanest so far:
- B new
- U new
- S in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5 (allowed)

This covers new letters B and U while placing S and D appropriately.

  – S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5  
- Still available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ S E D or _ S _ E D or S _ _ E D

Also, the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be from the unused set and must not repeat.

Let’s list candidates fitting _ _ S E D, _ S _ E D, S _ _ E D:

- _ _ S E D: need two unused letters in positions 1–2.  
  – F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
  – e.g., FUSED? U is eliminated.  
  – MUSED: U eliminated.  
  – WISED: I is allowed, S in 3, but I is ok.  
  – W, I unused → WISED fits (but D is already in 5)  
  – Actually W I S E D is valid: W, I unused; S not in 3? S is allowed in 3?  
    Wait: feedback says S(-) in BUSED, meaning S is in word but NOT in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.  
    Therefore _ _ S E D is invalid (S would be in 3) – scratch that.

- _ S _ E D: positions 1 and 3 must be unused letters, S in 2.  
  – Possible letters for 1 and 3: any unused except those eliminated.  
  – H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y + S in 2.

Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word) and to eliminate many possibilities based on the feedback. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO - another vowel-heavy word

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: fairly common consonant
- R: very common
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage and help narrow down the word quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E.
- Does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- E is somewhere other than the last position.

We still have 25 letters to work with (minus CRAN), and we know only that E is present. To maximize information gain, we should pick a new word that:
1. Includes E but not in position 5.
2. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels to gather more feedback.

Good candidates:
- STOLI (but I is less common)
- BLOKE (but K is less common)
- DOUSE (but S and O are good, and E is in position 4)
- MUSED (E in position 4)
- STONE (E in position 5 again → bad, since we know E isn’t there)

Let's go with ""STONE"":
- S, T, O, N, E
- E is in position 4 – ok, not 5.
- Uses S, T, O, N – none of which appeared in CRANE feedback.
- N was already eliminated (N(x)), so STONE is invalid.

Adjusted candidate: ""MUSED""
- M, U, S, E, D
- E in position 4 – ok.
- Letters not used yet: M, U, S, D – all new.
- This seems optimal.

Alternatively ""DOLES"":
- D, O, L, E, S
- E in position 4 – ok.
- D, O, L, S – new letters.

I'll choose ""DOLES"" because D, O, L, S are very common and give good coverage.

<guess>DOLES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DOLES -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N
   - E exists but is not in position 5

2. DOLES → D(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
   - Eliminated letters: O, L
   - D is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 5
   - E is now confirmed in position 4

Current constraints:
- Word contains: E in position 4
- Word also contains: D (not pos 1), S (not pos 5)
- Word excludes: C, R, A, N, O, L

Remaining valid letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E fixed in position 4
- D and S somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5 for D; positions 1-4 for S)
- No C,R,A,N,O,L

Good next guess should reuse D and S and introduce new common letters. Try:
- B, I, T, M, P, U, etc.

Let's test ""SPIKE"":
- S in pos 1 (allowed)
- P new
- I new
- K new
- E in pos 4 (correct)
But need to include D. So invalid.

Try ""DISKS"" – has S twice (S in pos 1 and 5) but 5th S is invalid (feedback says S not in pos 5). Also has K and S twice.

Better candidate: ""DITES"":
- D in pos 1 but feedback says D not in pos 1 (-). Invalid.

Next: ""HIDES"":
- H new
- I new
- D in pos 2 (allowed)
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 but feedback says S not in pos 5 (-). Invalid.

Try ""WIDES"":
- W new
- I new
- D in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 → invalid.

Try ""SIDED"":
- S in pos 1 (ok)
- I new
- D in pos 2 (ok)
- E in pos 4 (ok)
- D in pos 5 (ok)

But ""SIDED"" has D twice, and we only know one D exists. No evidence against it yet, though.

Another option: ""MUSED"":
- M new
- U new
- S in pos 3
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5 (but D must not be in pos 1 – ok here)

But ""MUSED"" was considered in previous step and has D in pos 5, which is allowed (only restriction is D not in pos 1).

However, we need to cover S and D positions better. Let's pick ""BUSED"":
- B new
- U new
- S in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5

Seems valid and covers new letters.

But let's check if any simpler word exists. ""WIDES"" already failed. ""HIDES"" failed.

Another candidate: ""TIDES"":
- T new
- I new
- D in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- S in pos 5 (invalid per feedback)

Hmm, S cannot be in pos 5. So we need S in pos 1, 2, or 3.

Best next guess: ""SIDLE"" – but L is eliminated. ""SIDED"" has D twice, no issue yet.

But ""SIDED"" uses S, I, D, E, D – and we know E is in pos 4, D must not be in pos 1 (ok here), S not in pos 5 (ok here), D can be in pos 5.

However, ""SIDED"" may not be optimal for info gain.

Better: ""SPIKE"" doesn't include D. Need word with D, S, E in pos 4.

Let's try ""DESKS"":
- D in pos 1 (invalid – D not in pos 1)
""SEEDS"" – S in pos 5 invalid, E twice unknown.

""DISKS"" – S in pos 5 invalid.

""BUSED"" is the cleanest so far:
- B new
- U new
- S in pos 2
- E in pos 4
- D in pos 5 (allowed)

This covers new letters B and U while placing S and D appropriately.

Guess 3: BUSED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's process the new feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-):  
   – Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N  
   – E exists, not in position 5

2. DOLES → D(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓) S(-):  
   – Eliminated letters: O, L  
   – E confirmed in position 4  
   – D exists, not in position 1  
   – S exists, not in position 5

3. BUSED → B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(✓):  
   – Eliminated letters: B, U  
   – S exists, not in position 3  
   – E still in position 4  
   – D now confirmed in position 5

Summary of constraints:
- Letter set so far eliminated: C, R, A, N, O, L, B, U  
- Positions:  
  – E is fixed in position 4  
  – D is fixed in position 5  
  – S is in the word, but cannot be in positions 3 or 5  
- Still available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ _ S E D or _ S _ E D or S _ _ E D  
(since S must occupy position 1, 2, or 3)

Also, the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be from the unused set and must not repeat.

Let’s list candidates fitting _ _ S E D, _ S _ E D, S _ _ E D:

- _ _ S E D: need two unused letters in positions 1–2.  
  – F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
  – e.g., FUSED? U is eliminated.  
  – MUSED: U eliminated.  
  – WISED: I is allowed, S in 3, but I is ok.  
  – W, I unused → WISED fits (but D is already in 5)  
  – Actually W I S E D is valid: W, I unused; S not in 3? S is allowed in 3?  
    Wait: feedback says S(-) in BUSED, meaning S is in word but NOT in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.  
    Therefore _ _ S E D is invalid (S would be in 3) – scratch that.

- _ S _ E D: positions 1 and 3 must be unused letters, S in 2.  
  – Possible letters for 1 and 3: any unused except those eliminated.  
  – H, I, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y + S in 2.  
  – Examples:  
    – H S I E D → HSIED, not a word.  
    – T S I E D → T S I E D not valid.  
    – M S I E D → MSI… no.  
    – P S I E D → no.  
    – V S I E D → no.  
    – W S I E D → no.  
    – H S K E D → HSKED, not valid.  
  – Need valid dictionary word.  
  – F is unused → F S I E D → not valid.  
  – G is unused → G S I E D → no.  

- S _ _ E D: positions 2 and 3 must be unused letters, S in 1.  
  – Letters for 2 and 3: from remaining.  
  – Valid English words:  
    – SPIED: P, I unused. S in 1 (ok), P in 2 (ok), I in 3 (ok), E in 4, D in 5.  
      – Check letters: S, P, I, E, D.  
      – No eliminated letters.  
      – S not in 3 or 5 (ok, it's in 1).  
      – D in 5 (ok).  
    – SKIED: K, I unused. Same pattern.  
    – SMILED: too long.  
    – SHIED: H, I unused.  

SPIED and SKIED and SHIED are all valid 5-letter words.  
SPIED uses P and I – both fresh. SKIED uses K and I. SHIED uses H and I.

Among these, ""SPIED"" seems the most common.

Let’s go with SPIED.
