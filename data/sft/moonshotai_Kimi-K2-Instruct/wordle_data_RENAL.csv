For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)
This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S and T are NOT in the word (x)
- L, A, E appear in the word but are in the wrong positions (-)

So we now know:
- The word has L, A, E somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- Letters S and T do not appear at all.

We still need to use the letters L, A, E in different positions. To get more information, I should pick a word that contains these letters plus some new common consonants (since we haven’t tested many consonants yet).

A good next guess would include common consonants like R, N, C, etc. One word that fits is ALERT because:
- A, L, E are letters we know exist (from SLATE feedback)
- R and T are common consonants (but we know T is excluded, so I can’t use T)
Wait, T is excluded, so ALERT is bad (has T).

Instead, I’ll pick a word that has L, A, E and introduces new consonants. A good option is LEARN:
- L is moved to first position (was position 2, now 1)
- E is moved to second position (was position 5, now 2)
- A is moved to third position (was position 3, now 3) – but feedback said A was in wrong position, so shouldn’t be here
Oops, that repeats A in position 3 which we know is wrong.

Next try: PLANE
- P (new letter)
- L (moved from 2 to 2 – no, should move)
Actually, let me think differently. Since A was in position 3 and is wrong, and L was in 2 and wrong, and E was in 5 and wrong, I should place them elsewhere.

A better word is CLEAR:
- C (new)
- L (moved to 2→4)
- E (moved 5→2)
- A (moved 3→3 – no, 3 is where A was, so bad)

Next: EARLY
- E (moved 5→1)
- A (moved 3→2)
- R (new)
- L (moved 2→4)
- Y (new)
This moves all known letters to new positions and introduces R and Y.

EARLY seems optimal.

From the first two guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown (-): L, A, E, R

Positions we know for each of those four letters:
- L: cannot be in position 2 (from slate) or 4 (from early).
- A: cannot be in position 3 (from slate) or 2 (from early).
- E: cannot be in position 5 (from slate) or 1 (from early).
- R: cannot be in position 3 (from early).

This leaves possible positions:
- L: 1, 3, 5
- A: 1, 4, 5
- E: 2, 3, 4
- R: 1, 2, 4, 5

I also want to introduce a new consonant to get more information. Common unused consonants so far: N, D, C, etc.  
A 5-letter word that uses L, A, E, R plus one new consonant and respects the position restrictions is “REALM”:
- R: possible at 1
- E: possible at 2
- A: possible at 3? No – A cannot be at 3 (slate), so this is invalid.

Next idea: “LARGE”
- L: 1 (allowed)
- A: 2 (allowed)
- R: 3 – but R cannot be at 3 (early feedback), so no.

“PEARL”
- P (new letter)
- E: 2 (allowed)
- A: 3 – but A cannot be at 3. No.

“ALTER”
- A: 1 (allowed)
- L: 2 – but L cannot be at 2. No.

“CRANE” uses C and N but only has R and A/E from known letters.

Instead, let’s compose a word that places the four known letters in remaining valid spots and adds one fresh consonant.  
Valid positions remaining:
L: 1,3,5  
A: 1,4,5  
E: 2,3,4  
R: 1,2,4,5  

One combination that fits is:

1: L  
2: E  
3: R  
4: A  
5: (new letter, e.g., D)

That forms “LERAD” – but “LERAD” isn’t a valid English word.

Try:

1: A  
2: L  
3: E  
4: R  
5: (new letter) → “ALER_” – no common word.

Try:

1: R  
2: E  
3: L  
4: A  
5: D  → “RELAD” – invalid.

Try:

1: R  
2: E  
3: A  
4: L  
5: (new letter) → “REAL_” – “REALM” already failed (A at 3).

Next: “LARDE” – invalid.

“LEARN” we already ruled out.

“RAILE” – uses I (new), but E is at 5 which we know is wrong.

“REALM” was invalid, “PEARL” invalid, etc.

Let’s list all possible positions respecting constraints:

We must include L, A, E, R and one fresh letter (N, C, D, etc.).

A valid arrangement:
- 1: R  
- 2: E  
- 3: L  
- 4: A  
- 5: N  → “RELNA” – not a word.

Another:
- 1: L  
- 2: E  
- 3: R  
- 4: A  
- 5: N  → “LERAN” – invalid.

Another:
- 1: C  
- 2: L  
- 3: A  
- 4: R  
- 5: E  → “CLARE” – invalid.

“CRANE” – only contains A, R, E.

“CLEAR” – already considered; A at 3 fails.

“RENAL”
- R: 1  
- E: 2  
- N (new)  
- A: 4  
- L: 5  

Check constraints:
- L was at 2 and 4, so 5 is new ✔  
- A was at 2 and 3, so 4 is new ✔  
- E was at 5 and 1, so 2 is new ✔  
- R was at 3, so 1 is new ✔  
- N is fresh  

“RENAL” is a valid English word (relating to kidneys) and satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, “RENAL” is the best next guess.
