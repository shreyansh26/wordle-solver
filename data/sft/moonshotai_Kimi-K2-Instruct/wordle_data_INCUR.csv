For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm the presence of key vowels and consonants. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to check their presence.
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This maximizes the chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or at least confirming its presence in the word.

From the feedback A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x) on AROSE:

- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We now know:
1. No A, O, S, E.
2. R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Next guess should:
- Include R in a new position (to test where it actually sits).
- Avoid A, O, S, E.
- Prefer common letters we haven’t tested yet (like I, U, D, N, T, L, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRIUM”:
- T and U are new letters.
- R is moved to position 1.
- I is a new vowel.
- M is new.

But “TRIUM” isn’t a common 5-letter English word. Better: “DRIFT”:
- D, I, F, T are new.
- R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong → bad.

Better: “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T are all new except R.
- R in position 2 again → still bad.

“CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P.
- R in position 2 again → no good.

“DRINK”:
- D, R, I, N, K.
- R in position 2 → still bad.

“URINE” uses E → invalid.

“BRICK”:
- B, R, I, C, K.
- R in position 2 → bad.

“RIGHT”:
- R in position 1.
- I, G, H, T are new.
- Uses no forbidden letters.

That looks solid: R in position 1, tests I, G, H, T.

Another option is “FRITH” (archaic) – but “RIGHT” is more common.

So I’ll go with “RIGHT”.

“DRINK”:
- D, R, I, N, K.
- R in position 2 → still bad.

“URINE” uses E → invalid.

“BRICK”:
- B, R, I, C, K.
- R in position 2 → bad.

“RIGHT”:
- R in position 1.
- I, G, H, T are new.
- Uses no forbidden letters.

That looks solid: R in position 1, tests I, G, H, T.

Another option is “FRITH” (archaic) – but “RIGHT” is more common.

So I’ll go with “RIGHT”.

<guess>RIGHT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RIGHT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.  
   – R exists somewhere, but not in position 1 (because it was in position 1 in AROSE and got “-”, so not position 2 in AROSE, i.e., not position 2 overall).

2. RIGHT → R(-) I(-) G(x) H(x) T(x)  
   – R exists, but not in position 1 (because it’s “-” here).  
   – I exists, but not in position 2.  
   – G, H, T are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, E, G, H, T.  
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and I (positions yet unknown).  
- R is not in position 1 or 2.  
- I is not in position 2.

Remaining positions to try for R: 3, 4, or 5.  
Remaining positions to try for I: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Aim for a word that:
- Contains R and I.  
- Places R somewhere new (3, 4, or 5).  
- Places I somewhere new (1, 3, 4, or 5).  
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, O, S, E, G, H, T).  
- Uses only the remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Candidate words:
- PRIM_: PRIM_ would use P, R, I, M…  
  PRIM_ isn’t 5 letters.  
- BRICK → C, K are new, but B and C are fine. R in position 2, which we know is wrong.  
- DRUID → Uses D, U, I, D. R in 2, wrong.  
- FRUIT → F, R, U, I, T. T is excluded.  
- NURID → U, R, I, D. R in 2, wrong.  
- CRIED → C, R, I, E, D. E is excluded.  
- FURID → F, U, R, I, D.  
  – Letters: F, U, R, I, D. All allowed.  
  – R is in position 3 (new).  
  – I is in position 4 (new).  
  – F, U, D are new test letters.

Thus FURID is a valid next guess.

Positions already ruled out for these letters:
- R: not 1, 2, 3

- U: not 2, 3  

Thus possible positions:

We need a new 5-letter word that uses at least R, I, U and only the still-allowed consonants.  
Remaining consonants: B, C, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  

A simple pattern that places each known letter in an untested slot is:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm the presence of key vowels and consonants. A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to check their presence.
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This maximizes the chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or at least confirming its presence in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x) on AROSE:

- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

We now know:
1. No A, O, S, E.
2. R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Next guess should:
- Include R in a new position (to test where it actually sits).
- Avoid A, O, S, E.
- Prefer common letters we haven’t tested yet (like I, U, D, N, T, L, etc.).

A strong candidate is “TRIUM”:
- T and U are new letters.
- R is moved to position 1.
- I is a new vowel.
- M is new.

But “TRIUM” isn’t a common 5-letter English word. Better: “DRIFT”:
- D, I, F, T are new.
- R is in position 2 again, which we know is wrong → bad.

Better: “FRUIT”:
- F, R, U, I, T are all new except R.
- R in position 2 again → still bad.

“CRIMP”:
- C, R, I, M, P.
- R in position 2 again → no good.

“DRINK”:
- D, R, I, N, K.
- R in position 2 → still bad.

“URINE” uses E → invalid.

“BRICK”:
- B, R, I, C, K.
- R in position 2 → bad.

“RIGHT”:
- R in position 1.
- I, G, H, T are new.
- Uses no forbidden letters.

That looks solid: R in position 1, tests I, G, H, T.

Another option is “FRITH” (archaic) – but “RIGHT” is more common.

So I’ll go with “RIGHT”.

From the latest feedback:
U(-) N(✓) R(-) I(-) P(x)

- N is in slot 2 (✓).
- U, R, I are each in the word but NOT in the positions they just occupied:
  – U not in 1  
  – R not in 3  
  – I not in 4  
- P is absent.

Already-absent letters: A, O, S, E, G, H, T, F, D, P  
Still-allowed letters: B, C, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus U, R, I, N (with N fixed at 2).

Positions left to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5, with N locked in 2.

Known letters to place: U, R, I  
Positions ruled out:
  – U: 1, 2, 3  
  – R: 1, 2, 3  
  – I: 2, 4  

Thus:
- U must go in 4 or 5  
- R must go in 4 or 5  
- I must go in 1, 3, or 5  

We need a consonant for whichever slot remains.  
A working arrangement:
I 1, N 2, (new consonant) 3, U 4, R 5

Choose consonant 3 that hasn’t been used yet: C, L, M, V, W, Y … “C” is common.

So: I N C U R  → “INCUR” (valid English).
