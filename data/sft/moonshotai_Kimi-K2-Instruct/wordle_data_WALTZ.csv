The first guess should be a strategic word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are good choices because they include frequently used vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L). 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word because:
- Contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Covers a good range of letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly

From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is A
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E
3. We need to test new consonants and vowels in the other positions.

A good second guess will:
- Keep A in position 2
- Introduce new common consonants (like T, N, L, M, C, D) and vowels (O, U, Y)
- Avoid the forbidden letters

Let’s digest the new feedback step-by-step.

1. **Known A position**: A is confirmed in slot 2 (second letter).

2. **Forbidden / confirmed letters**:
   - From Guess 1: R, I, S, E are all absent.
   - From Guess 2: P, N are absent (slots 1 and 4 respectively).
   - L is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2).
   - A is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2, but we already know A is fixed in slot 2—this feedback line is effectively confirming again that it is in slot 2).
   - T is in the word but **not** in slot 5.

3. **Current pattern**: _ A _ _ _
   - Slots 1, 3, 4, 5 still need filling.
   - Allowed letters (not yet excluded): L, T, plus any unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
   - L cannot be in slot 2 (already impossible there) and must appear somewhere else (likely slot 3, 4, or 5).
   - T cannot be in slot 5, so it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

4. **Choosing a word**:
   - We want to test new consonants and possible vowels while fitting L and/or T where allowed.
   - Candidate structure: _ A L _ _  or  _ A _ T _  or  _ A L T _  etc.
   - “GLADY” is invalid (Y isn’t common enough).
   - “CABAL” has two A’s, but we only have one A.
   - “HATCH” has two T’s, but we don’t know if T is allowed twice.
   - A solid choice is “MALT” but that’s 4 letters.
   - “MALTH” is not a word.
   - Let’s pick “FAULT”:
     – F is new; U is new; L and T are the letters we know exist.
     – Pattern: _ A _ _ _, so FAULT fits: F A U L T → second letter is A.
     – L will be in slot 4 (allowed), T in slot 5 (but T is forbidden in slot 5). So FAULT is invalid for T in slot 5.

   - Try “GLOAM” — no, A is already slot 2.
   - Try “CAULK” — C A U L K: all letters new except L.
     – L is in slot 4 (allowed). T is missing, but we don’t yet know T must be used. We can test both L and T together later if needed.

   - Instead test “TALON” but N and O are not yet ruled out; however N was already ruled out in PLANT feedback.

   - Try “CALYX” — X and Y uncommon; not ideal.

   - Best simple word with new letters and placing L and T: we need to place L somewhere in 3-5, and T somewhere in 1-4.

   - “TABLE” uses E which is out.
   - “FATAL” uses F, T, L correctly: F A T A L → two A’s, but we have only one A. Invalid.

   - Try “CLAMP” — P already out.
   - Try “CLAD” — 4 letters.

   - “DUCAL” — D, U, C, L, A: A in slot 4? No, A must be slot 2.

   - “MACAW” — M, C, W new; A slot 2 ok; but W is okay, but pattern: M A C A W → two A’s.

   - “VAULT” — V, U new; L in slot 4 ok; but T in slot 5 is blocked.

   - “CAMEL” — M, C, E; E out.

   - “DATUM” — D, U, M; T in slot 4 ok (not 5); M in slot 5: pattern D A T U M → T is in slot 3 (ok), L missing.

   - Let’s choose “DATUM” to test D, U, M and T in slot 3.

   - However we must include L somewhere because L is confirmed in the word.

So we must use L. Let’s retry:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Need to place L in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2) and T somewhere not 5.

- “TALKS” — S out.
- “TALON” — N out.
- “TALAR” — R out.
- “TALUK” — K possible.

Actually, the only common word I see that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T and new letters is “TALUK” (a real word: an administrative division in India).

But let me check again:

Letters left to use: L, T must be in the word somewhere, and we have to introduce new letters (D, K, C, G, etc.).

A good word: “CLAPT” — no P is out.
“CLACK” — C A C K: A slot 2 ok, C twice ok, but C is new, L in slot 1 ok, K new. But we don’t know about double letters.

Simpler: “CALYX” again not ideal.

Another good candidate: “FABLE” — E out.

The simplest word that fits the constraints: “GAULT” — G, U, L, T; but T in slot 5 is forbidden.

Another: “BALMY” — B, M, Y; L in slot 3, M in slot 4, Y in slot 5. T is missing.

I realize I need to use L and T in one of the remaining spots.

- _ A _ _ _
- T cannot be in 5.
- L can be in 1,3,4,5.

Try “TALON” again but N is out (from PLANT feedback).

“TALON” invalid because N is out.

Next reasonable word: “CALYX” not helpful.

Let’s pick “CALM” but 4 letters.

Actually, let’s choose “CLADY” — but Y is not great.

Best compromise: “CLAMP” — P is out.

“BLAST” — S, B, T in slot 5 forbidden.

After careful consideration, the optimal next test word that abides by all rules is:

“FLOAT” — but O, A in slot 2 ok, L must appear, T must appear and cannot be in slot 5.

“FLOAT” pattern: F L O A T → but A must be slot 2, so this becomes F L O A T — A is slot 4, invalid.

Let’s switch to “FAULT” again, but T in slot 5 is blocked.

Another word: “VALET” — A in slot 2, T in slot 5 blocked.

We need to place T in slot 1, 3, or 4.

- _ A T _ _
- _ A _ T _
- T A _ _ _

Try “TACET” — E out.

“TACIT” — I, T out.

“TAMAL” — M, L ok, A slot 2 ok, but pattern T A M A L → two A’s.

“TABLA” — B, L ok, but two A’s.

“TAIGA” — I, G out.

A valid word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T in allowed spots: “DATUM” missed L.

“DATLY” — not a word.

Wait, simple real word: “TALKS” — but S is out.

“TALUK” — real word: T A L U K.  
- T in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (correct)  
- L in slot 3 (allowed)  
- U, K new.

That seems legitimate.

Therefore, I will guess TALUK.

Actually, let’s choose “CLADY” — but Y is not great.

Best compromise: “CLAMP” — P is out.

“BLAST” — S, B, T in slot 5 forbidden.

After careful consideration, the optimal next test word that abides by all rules is:

“FLOAT” — but O, A in slot 2 ok, L must appear, T must appear and cannot be in slot 5.

“FLOAT” pattern: F L O A T → but A must be slot 2, so this becomes F L O A T — A is slot 4, invalid.

Let’s switch to “FAULT” again, but T in slot 5 is blocked.

Another word: “VALET” — A in slot 2, T in slot 5 blocked.

We need to place T in slot 1, 3, or 4.

- _ A T _ _
- _ A _ T _
- T A _ _ _

Try “TACET” — E out.

“TACIT” — I, T out.

“TAMAL” — M, L ok, A slot 2 ok, but pattern T A M A L → two A’s.

“TABLA” — B, L ok, but two A’s.

“TAIGA” — I, G out.

A valid word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T in allowed spots: “DATUM” missed L.

“DATLY” — not a word.

Wait, simple real word: “TALKS” — but S is out.

“TALUK” — real word: T A L U K.  
- T in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (correct)  
- L in slot 3 (allowed)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,WALTZ,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess should be a strategic word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are good choices because they include frequently used vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L). 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word because:
- Contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Covers a good range of letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is A
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E
3. We need to test new consonants and vowels in the other positions.

A good second guess will:
- Keep A in position 2
- Introduce new common consonants (like T, N, L, M, C, D) and vowels (O, U, Y)
- Avoid the forbidden letters

Possible candidates: PLANT, CANDY, MANGO, TALON, DAUNT. 

""PLANT"" looks good because:
- Uses P, L, N, T (all common consonants we haven't tested)
- Keeps A in position 2
- No forbidden letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback step-by-step.

1. **Known A position**: A is confirmed in slot 2 (second letter).

2. **Forbidden / confirmed letters**:
   - From Guess 1: R, I, S, E are all absent.
   - From Guess 2: P, N are absent (slots 1 and 4 respectively).
   - L is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2).
   - A is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2, but we already know A is fixed in slot 2—this feedback line is effectively confirming again that it is in slot 2).
   - T is in the word but **not** in slot 5.

3. **Current pattern**: _ A _ _ _
   - Slots 1, 3, 4, 5 still need filling.
   - Allowed letters (not yet excluded): L, T, plus any unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
   - L cannot be in slot 2 (already impossible there) and must appear somewhere else (likely slot 3, 4, or 5).
   - T cannot be in slot 5, so it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

4. **Choosing a word**:
   - We want to test new consonants and possible vowels while fitting L and/or T where allowed.
   - Candidate structure: _ A L _ _  or  _ A _ T _  or  _ A L T _  etc.
   - “GLADY” is invalid (Y isn’t common enough).
   - “CABAL” has two A’s, but we only have one A.
   - “HATCH” has two T’s, but we don’t know if T is allowed twice.
   - A solid choice is “MALT” but that’s 4 letters.
   - “MALTH” is not a word.
   - Let’s pick “FAULT”:
     – F is new; U is new; L and T are the letters we know exist.
     – Pattern: _ A _ _ _, so FAULT fits: F A U L T → second letter is A.
     – L will be in slot 4 (allowed), T in slot 5 (but T is forbidden in slot 5). So FAULT is invalid for T in slot 5.

   - Try “GLOAM” — no, A is already slot 2.
   - Try “CAULK” — C A U L K: all letters new except L.
     – L is in slot 4 (allowed). T is missing, but we don’t yet know T must be used. We can test both L and T together later if needed.

   - Instead test “TALON” but N and O are not yet ruled out; however N was already ruled out in PLANT feedback.

   - Try “CALYX” — X and Y uncommon; not ideal.

   - Best simple word with new letters and placing L and T: we need to place L somewhere in 3-5, and T somewhere in 1-4.

   - “TABLE” uses E which is out.
   - “FATAL” uses F, T, L correctly: F A T A L → two A’s, but we have only one A. Invalid.

   - Try “CLAMP” — P already out.
   - Try “CLAD” — 4 letters.

   - “DUCAL” — D, U, C, L, A: A in slot 4? No, A must be slot 2.

   - “MACAW” — M, C, W new; A slot 2 ok; but W is okay, but pattern: M A C A W → two A’s.

   - “VAULT” — V, U new; L in slot 4 ok; but T in slot 5 is blocked.

   - “CAMEL” — M, C, E; E out.

   - “DATUM” — D, U, M; T in slot 4 ok (not 5); M in slot 5: pattern D A T U M → T is in slot 3 (ok), L missing.

   - Let’s choose “DATUM” to test D, U, M and T in slot 3.

   - However we must include L somewhere because L is confirmed in the word.

So we must use L. Let’s retry:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Need to place L in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2) and T somewhere not 5.

- “TALKS” — S out.
- “TALON” — N out.
- “TALAR” — R out.
- “TALUK” — K possible.

Actually, the only common word I see that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T and new letters is “TALUK” (a real word: an administrative division in India).

But let me check again:

Letters left to use: L, T must be in the word somewhere, and we have to introduce new letters (D, K, C, G, etc.).

A good word: “CLAPT” — no P is out.
“CLACK” — C A C K: A slot 2 ok, C twice ok, but C is new, L in slot 1 ok, K new. But we don’t know about double letters.

Simpler: “CALYX” again not ideal.

Another good candidate: “FABLE” — E out.

The simplest word that fits the constraints: “GAULT” — G, U, L, T; but T in slot 5 is forbidden.

Another: “BALMY” — B, M, Y; L in slot 3, M in slot 4, Y in slot 5. T is missing.

I realize I need to use L and T in one of the remaining spots.

- _ A _ _ _
- T cannot be in 5.
- L can be in 1,3,4,5.

Try “TALON” again but N is out (from PLANT feedback).

“TALON” invalid because N is out.

Next reasonable word: “CALYX” not helpful.

Let’s pick “CALM” but 4 letters.

Actually, let’s choose “CLADY” — but Y is not great.

Best compromise: “CLAMP” — P is out.

“BLAST” — S, B, T in slot 5 forbidden.

After careful consideration, the optimal next test word that abides by all rules is:

“FLOAT” — but O, A in slot 2 ok, L must appear, T must appear and cannot be in slot 5.

“FLOAT” pattern: F L O A T → but A must be slot 2, so this becomes F L O A T — A is slot 4, invalid.

Let’s switch to “FAULT” again, but T in slot 5 is blocked.

Another word: “VALET” — A in slot 2, T in slot 5 blocked.

We need to place T in slot 1, 3, or 4.

- _ A T _ _
- _ A _ T _
- T A _ _ _

Try “TACET” — E out.

“TACIT” — I, T out.

“TAMAL” — M, L ok, A slot 2 ok, but pattern T A M A L → two A’s.

“TABLA” — B, L ok, but two A’s.

“TAIGA” — I, G out.

A valid word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T in allowed spots: “DATUM” missed L.

“DATLY” — not a word.

Wait, simple real word: “TALKS” — but S is out.

“TALUK” — real word: T A L U K.  
- T in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (correct)  
- L in slot 3 (allowed)  
- U, K new.

That seems legitimate.

Therefore, I will guess TALUK.Based on the feedback, A must be in position 2, L and T are in the word but not in their previous positions, and R, I, S, E, P, N are excluded.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess should be a strategic word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are good choices because they include frequently used vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L). 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word because:
- Contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Covers a good range of letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is A
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E
3. We need to test new consonants and vowels in the other positions.

A good second guess will:
- Keep A in position 2
- Introduce new common consonants (like T, N, L, M, C, D) and vowels (O, U, Y)
- Avoid the forbidden letters

Possible candidates: PLANT, CANDY, MANGO, TALON, DAUNT. 

""PLANT"" looks good because:
- Uses P, L, N, T (all common consonants we haven't tested)
- Keeps A in position 2
- No forbidden letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback step-by-step.

1. **Known A position**: A is confirmed in slot 2 (second letter).

2. **Forbidden / confirmed letters**:
   - From Guess 1: R, I, S, E are all absent.
   - From Guess 2: P, N are absent (slots 1 and 4 respectively).
   - L is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2).
   - A is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2, but we already know A is fixed in slot 2—this feedback line is effectively confirming again that it is in slot 2).
   - T is in the word but **not** in slot 5.

3. **Current pattern**: _ A _ _ _
   - Slots 1, 3, 4, 5 still need filling.
   - Allowed letters (not yet excluded): L, T, plus any unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
   - L cannot be in slot 2 (already impossible there) and must appear somewhere else (likely slot 3, 4, or 5).
   - T cannot be in slot 5, so it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

4. **Choosing a word**:
   - We want to test new consonants and possible vowels while fitting L and/or T where allowed.
   - Candidate structure: _ A L _ _  or  _ A _ T _  or  _ A L T _  etc.
   - “GLADY” is invalid (Y isn’t common enough).
   - “CABAL” has two A’s, but we only have one A.
   - “HATCH” has two T’s, but we don’t know if T is allowed twice.
   - A solid choice is “MALT” but that’s 4 letters.
   - “MALTH” is not a word.
   - Let’s pick “FAULT”:
     – F is new; U is new; L and T are the letters we know exist.
     – Pattern: _ A _ _ _, so FAULT fits: F A U L T → second letter is A.
     – L will be in slot 4 (allowed), T in slot 5 (but T is forbidden in slot 5). So FAULT is invalid for T in slot 5.

   - Try “GLOAM” — no, A is already slot 2.
   - Try “CAULK” — C A U L K: all letters new except L.
     – L is in slot 4 (allowed). T is missing, but we don’t yet know T must be used. We can test both L and T together later if needed.

   - Instead test “TALON” but N and O are not yet ruled out; however N was already ruled out in PLANT feedback.

   - Try “CALYX” — X and Y uncommon; not ideal.

   - Best simple word with new letters and placing L and T: we need to place L somewhere in 3-5, and T somewhere in 1-4.

   - “TABLE” uses E which is out.
   - “FATAL” uses F, T, L correctly: F A T A L → two A’s, but we have only one A. Invalid.

   - Try “CLAMP” — P already out.
   - Try “CLAD” — 4 letters.

   - “DUCAL” — D, U, C, L, A: A in slot 4? No, A must be slot 2.

   - “MACAW” — M, C, W new; A slot 2 ok; but W is okay, but pattern: M A C A W → two A’s.

   - “VAULT” — V, U new; L in slot 4 ok; but T in slot 5 is blocked.

   - “CAMEL” — M, C, E; E out.

   - “DATUM” — D, U, M; T in slot 4 ok (not 5); M in slot 5: pattern D A T U M → T is in slot 3 (ok), L missing.

   - Let’s choose “DATUM” to test D, U, M and T in slot 3.

   - However we must include L somewhere because L is confirmed in the word.

So we must use L. Let’s retry:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Need to place L in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2) and T somewhere not 5.

- “TALKS” — S out.
- “TALON” — N out.
- “TALAR” — R out.
- “TALUK” — K possible.

Actually, the only common word I see that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T and new letters is “TALUK” (a real word: an administrative division in India).

But let me check again:

Letters left to use: L, T must be in the word somewhere, and we have to introduce new letters (D, K, C, G, etc.).

A good word: “CLAPT” — no P is out.
“CLACK” — C A C K: A slot 2 ok, C twice ok, but C is new, L in slot 1 ok, K new. But we don’t know about double letters.

Simpler: “CALYX” again not ideal.

Another good candidate: “FABLE” — E out.

The simplest word that fits the constraints: “GAULT” — G, U, L, T; but T in slot 5 is forbidden.

Another: “BALMY” — B, M, Y; L in slot 3, M in slot 4, Y in slot 5. T is missing.

I realize I need to use L and T in one of the remaining spots.

- _ A _ _ _
- T cannot be in 5.
- L can be in 1,3,4,5.

Try “TALON” again but N is out (from PLANT feedback).

“TALON” invalid because N is out.

Next reasonable word: “CALYX” not helpful.

Let’s pick “CALM” but 4 letters.

Actually, let’s choose “CLADY” — but Y is not great.

Best compromise: “CLAMP” — P is out.

“BLAST” — S, B, T in slot 5 forbidden.

After careful consideration, the optimal next test word that abides by all rules is:

“FLOAT” — but O, A in slot 2 ok, L must appear, T must appear and cannot be in slot 5.

“FLOAT” pattern: F L O A T → but A must be slot 2, so this becomes F L O A T — A is slot 4, invalid.

Let’s switch to “FAULT” again, but T in slot 5 is blocked.

Another word: “VALET” — A in slot 2, T in slot 5 blocked.

We need to place T in slot 1, 3, or 4.

- _ A T _ _
- _ A _ T _
- T A _ _ _

Try “TACET” — E out.

“TACIT” — I, T out.

“TAMAL” — M, L ok, A slot 2 ok, but pattern T A M A L → two A’s.

“TABLA” — B, L ok, but two A’s.

“TAIGA” — I, G out.

A valid word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T in allowed spots: “DATUM” missed L.

“DATLY” — not a word.

Wait, simple real word: “TALKS” — but S is out.

“TALUK” — real word: T A L U K.  
- T in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (correct)  
- L in slot 3 (allowed)  
- U, K new.

That seems legitimate.

Therefore, I will guess TALUK.Based on the feedback, A must be in position 2, L and T are in the word but not in their previous positions, and R, I, S, E, P, N are excluded.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: TALUK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) L(✓) U(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  From Guess 1:  
    A(✓) → second letter is A.  
    R, I, S, E are entirely absent.

2.  From Guess 2:  
    L(-) → L is present but not in slot 2 (already impossible).  
    T(-) → T is present but not in slot 5.

3.  From Guess 3:  
    T(-) (slot 1) → T is present but not in slot 1.  
    A(✓) (slot 2) → re-confirmed.  
    L(✓) (slot 3) → L is present **and in slot 3**.  
    U(x), K(x) → U and K are absent.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ A L _ _  (L is fixed in slot 3).
- Forbidden letters: R I S E P N U K.
- T must appear exactly once, and can only be in slot 4 (since 1, 5 are excluded, and L is in 3).
- Remaining open slots: 1 and 5; allowed letters still unused are B C D F G H J M O V W Y plus the fixed T in 4.

We need a word of the form: [consonant] A L T [consonant].

Scanning common 5-letter words fitting _ A L T _:
- F A L T O  (FALTO – not valid)  
- M A L T Y  (MALT Y – no)  
- D A L T O  (DALTO – no)  
- M A L T S  (S is out)  
- M A L T Y  (Y is allowed)  
- W A L T Z  (Z rarely used, also 5-letter word “waltz” has Z, but we have no info on Z)  
- B A L T O  (BALTO – proper noun, not in word list)  
- C A L T H  (CALTH – not real)  
- G A L T H  (GALTH – no)  
- H A L T S  (S out)  
- V A L T O  (no)  
- J A L T O  (no)  
- M A L T Y  (M A L T Y) → “MALTY” is a valid English word.

No other common dictionary words fit the pattern as neatly.

Therefore, the logical next guess is MALTY.

From every guess so far we have:

1. A is locked in position 2.
2. L is locked in position 3.
3. T is locked in position 4.
4. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all):  
   R, I, S, E, P, N, U, K, M, Y.

So the pattern is: _ A L T _ and we only need one more letter for the first position.  
Allowed first-position letters (still unused and not forbidden):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, V, W, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words of the form ? A L T ?:

But “FAULT” is impossible (U is out), “DAULT” invalid, etc.

There is a valid English word “BALTI” (a style of curry), but I is already excluded.  
Next, “BALTA” – not a word.  
Actually, the legitimate word that fits is “BALTA” (as in Balta, a place name), but that’s a proper noun.  

However, there is one common dictionary word: “BALMY” – but Y is excluded.  

Wait – the only remaining possibility is “BALTA” – not standard.  

Rechecking: “BALSA” – S excluded.  
“BALDY” – Y excluded.  

Ah! “BALSA” – S is excluded.  

Re-examining the list, the correct word that fits _ A L T _ with allowed letters is “BALTI” but I is out.  

The only valid, common English word left that fits is:

B A L T + the letter O (but O has not been tested yet).  

There is a real word “BALTO” (proper noun, Balto the dog), but again proper noun.  

Actually, the correct standard word is “BALTI” (I excluded).  

Going through the alphabet, the only possible letter left that makes a real word is “BALSA” -> S excluded.  

Wait – the word “GALTY” is out (Y excluded).  

Upon rechecking, the only real valid common word left is “BALTO” (Balto), but since we’re restricted to common dictionary words and cannot use I, S, etc., the only remaining candidate is:

B A L T + O → “BALTO” (sometimes accepted in word lists).

However, since the puzzle appears to have only one valid word left with the constraints, and we have tried all other possibilities, the most logical choice is:

B A L T O → “BALTO”.

But let’s double-check the allowed letters:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, V, W, Z are allowed.

So possible words are:  
B A L T B (invalid)  
B A L T C (invalid)  
...  
B A L T D (invalid)  
G A L T H (invalid)  

Ah! There is actually a real English word that fits: “BALTA” is not standard, but “BALTI” is disallowed (I).  

Therefore, there is only one remaining valid common word left: “BALTO”.

Hence, the next guess must be “BALTO”.

But to be absolutely sure, let’s list every consonant not yet excluded and see which forms a real word:

Allowed consonants for slot 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, V, W, Z.

Real words formed:

- BALTO – accepted in some dictionaries
- CALTO – not a word

- FALTO – not a word
- GALTO – not a word
- HALTO – not a word
- JALTO – not a word
- VALTO – not a word
- WALTO – not a word
- ZALTO – not a word

Thus, the only valid word left is “BALTO”.

Therefore, the next guess is:

B A L T O → BALTO.

<guess>BALTO</guess>",BALTO,"From every guess so far we have:

1. A is locked in position 2.
2. L is locked in position 3.
3. T is locked in position 4.
4. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all):  
   R, I, S, E, P, N, U, K, M, Y.

So the pattern is: _ A L T _ and we only need one more letter for the first position.  
Allowed first-position letters (still unused and not forbidden):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, V, W, Z.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WALTZ,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess should be a strategic word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are good choices because they include frequently used vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N, L). 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word because:
- Contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- Has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No letter repeats
- Covers a good range of letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is A
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E
3. We need to test new consonants and vowels in the other positions.

A good second guess will:
- Keep A in position 2
- Introduce new common consonants (like T, N, L, M, C, D) and vowels (O, U, Y)
- Avoid the forbidden letters

Possible candidates: PLANT, CANDY, MANGO, TALON, DAUNT. 

""PLANT"" looks good because:
- Uses P, L, N, T (all common consonants we haven't tested)
- Keeps A in position 2
- No forbidden letters

<guess>PLANT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback step-by-step.

1. **Known A position**: A is confirmed in slot 2 (second letter).

2. **Forbidden / confirmed letters**:
   - From Guess 1: R, I, S, E are all absent.
   - From Guess 2: P, N are absent (slots 1 and 4 respectively).
   - L is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2).
   - A is in the word but **not** in slot 2 (because it got “-” in slot 2, but we already know A is fixed in slot 2—this feedback line is effectively confirming again that it is in slot 2).
   - T is in the word but **not** in slot 5.

3. **Current pattern**: _ A _ _ _
   - Slots 1, 3, 4, 5 still need filling.
   - Allowed letters (not yet excluded): L, T, plus any unused common letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
   - L cannot be in slot 2 (already impossible there) and must appear somewhere else (likely slot 3, 4, or 5).
   - T cannot be in slot 5, so it could be in 1, 3, or 4.

4. **Choosing a word**:
   - We want to test new consonants and possible vowels while fitting L and/or T where allowed.
   - Candidate structure: _ A L _ _  or  _ A _ T _  or  _ A L T _  etc.
   - “GLADY” is invalid (Y isn’t common enough).
   - “CABAL” has two A’s, but we only have one A.
   - “HATCH” has two T’s, but we don’t know if T is allowed twice.
   - A solid choice is “MALT” but that’s 4 letters.
   - “MALTH” is not a word.
   - Let’s pick “FAULT”:
     – F is new; U is new; L and T are the letters we know exist.
     – Pattern: _ A _ _ _, so FAULT fits: F A U L T → second letter is A.
     – L will be in slot 4 (allowed), T in slot 5 (but T is forbidden in slot 5). So FAULT is invalid for T in slot 5.

   - Try “GLOAM” — no, A is already slot 2.
   - Try “CAULK” — C A U L K: all letters new except L.
     – L is in slot 4 (allowed). T is missing, but we don’t yet know T must be used. We can test both L and T together later if needed.

   - Instead test “TALON” but N and O are not yet ruled out; however N was already ruled out in PLANT feedback.

   - Try “CALYX” — X and Y uncommon; not ideal.

   - Best simple word with new letters and placing L and T: we need to place L somewhere in 3-5, and T somewhere in 1-4.

   - “TABLE” uses E which is out.
   - “FATAL” uses F, T, L correctly: F A T A L → two A’s, but we have only one A. Invalid.

   - Try “CLAMP” — P already out.
   - Try “CLAD” — 4 letters.

   - “DUCAL” — D, U, C, L, A: A in slot 4? No, A must be slot 2.

   - “MACAW” — M, C, W new; A slot 2 ok; but W is okay, but pattern: M A C A W → two A’s.

   - “VAULT” — V, U new; L in slot 4 ok; but T in slot 5 is blocked.

   - “CAMEL” — M, C, E; E out.

   - “DATUM” — D, U, M; T in slot 4 ok (not 5); M in slot 5: pattern D A T U M → T is in slot 3 (ok), L missing.

   - Let’s choose “DATUM” to test D, U, M and T in slot 3.

   - However we must include L somewhere because L is confirmed in the word.

So we must use L. Let’s retry:

- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Need to place L in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2) and T somewhere not 5.

- “TALKS” — S out.
- “TALON” — N out.
- “TALAR” — R out.
- “TALUK” — K possible.

Actually, the only common word I see that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T and new letters is “TALUK” (a real word: an administrative division in India).

But let me check again:

Letters left to use: L, T must be in the word somewhere, and we have to introduce new letters (D, K, C, G, etc.).

A good word: “CLAPT” — no P is out.
“CLACK” — C A C K: A slot 2 ok, C twice ok, but C is new, L in slot 1 ok, K new. But we don’t know about double letters.

Simpler: “CALYX” again not ideal.

Another good candidate: “FABLE” — E out.

The simplest word that fits the constraints: “GAULT” — G, U, L, T; but T in slot 5 is forbidden.

Another: “BALMY” — B, M, Y; L in slot 3, M in slot 4, Y in slot 5. T is missing.

I realize I need to use L and T in one of the remaining spots.

- _ A _ _ _
- T cannot be in 5.
- L can be in 1,3,4,5.

Try “TALON” again but N is out (from PLANT feedback).

“TALON” invalid because N is out.

Next reasonable word: “CALYX” not helpful.

Let’s pick “CALM” but 4 letters.

Actually, let’s choose “CLADY” — but Y is not great.

Best compromise: “CLAMP” — P is out.

“BLAST” — S, B, T in slot 5 forbidden.

After careful consideration, the optimal next test word that abides by all rules is:

“FLOAT” — but O, A in slot 2 ok, L must appear, T must appear and cannot be in slot 5.

“FLOAT” pattern: F L O A T → but A must be slot 2, so this becomes F L O A T — A is slot 4, invalid.

Let’s switch to “FAULT” again, but T in slot 5 is blocked.

Another word: “VALET” — A in slot 2, T in slot 5 blocked.

We need to place T in slot 1, 3, or 4.

- _ A T _ _
- _ A _ T _
- T A _ _ _

Try “TACET” — E out.

“TACIT” — I, T out.

“TAMAL” — M, L ok, A slot 2 ok, but pattern T A M A L → two A’s.

“TABLA” — B, L ok, but two A’s.

“TAIGA” — I, G out.

A valid word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses L and T in allowed spots: “DATUM” missed L.

“DATLY” — not a word.

Wait, simple real word: “TALKS” — but S is out.

“TALUK” — real word: T A L U K.  
- T in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (correct)  
- L in slot 3 (allowed)  
- U, K new.

That seems legitimate.

Therefore, I will guess TALUK.Based on the feedback, A must be in position 2, L and T are in the word but not in their previous positions, and R, I, S, E, P, N are excluded.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: TALUK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) L(✓) U(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  From Guess 1:  
    A(✓) → second letter is A.  
    R, I, S, E are entirely absent.

2.  From Guess 2:  
    L(-) → L is present but not in slot 2 (already impossible).  
    T(-) → T is present but not in slot 5.

3.  From Guess 3:  
    T(-) (slot 1) → T is present but not in slot 1.  
    A(✓) (slot 2) → re-confirmed.  
    L(✓) (slot 3) → L is present **and in slot 3**.  
    U(x), K(x) → U and K are absent.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ A L _ _  (L is fixed in slot 3).
- Forbidden letters: R I S E P N U K.
- T must appear exactly once, and can only be in slot 4 (since 1, 5 are excluded, and L is in 3).
- Remaining open slots: 1 and 5; allowed letters still unused are B C D F G H J M O V W Y plus the fixed T in 4.

We need a word of the form: [consonant] A L T [consonant].

Scanning common 5-letter words fitting _ A L T _:
- F A L T O  (FALTO – not valid)  
- M A L T Y  (MALT Y – no)  
- D A L T O  (DALTO – no)  
- M A L T S  (S is out)  
- M A L T Y  (Y is allowed)  
- W A L T Z  (Z rarely used, also 5-letter word “waltz” has Z, but we have no info on Z)
