- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work from. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which helps identify or eliminate many letters early in the game.

From the feedback:
- A(✓) → first letter is A

Step 1: Re-state all constraints from prior feedback.

1. Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
2. Letters ruled out completely (x feedback): R, O, D, T, N
3. Letters we know must be in the word:
   - S (from “S(-)” twice) – but S has been excluded from positions 2, 3, 4.
   - I (from “I(-)”) – but I has been excluded from position 3.

Step 2: Determine where S and I can still sit.

- S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4.  
  The only remaining spot inside A _ _ _ E is position 1, but position 1 is already A.  
  Therefore S cannot be in the word at all under the current pattern, which contradicts the earlier “S(-)” feedback.  
  Conclusion: Our interpretation must be that S is not allowed in the positions already guessed (2, 3, 4) and must appear in the single remaining “middle” position that has not yet been tried.

Wait: the word is A _ _ _ E, so the middle three slots are positions 2, 3, 4.

We have tried:
- Guess 1: A R O S E → S in 4 (feedback “-”)
- Guess 2: A S I D E → S in 2 (feedback “-”)
- Guess 3: A T O N E → no S at all (but we only got x on T, O, N, so S wasn’t placed)

The feedback “S(-)” means “S is in the word, but not in that particular spot.”  
Thus S has to be in the only remaining untested slot among 2, 3, 4: position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3 = S  
- Position 2 and 4 must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, D, T, N)  
- We also know I is in the word (from ASIDE), so I must be in position 2 or 4.

Step 3: Compile valid letters for positions 2 and 4.

Allowed letters (English alphabet minus R, O, D, T, N) plus avoiding previously placed letters:
Vowels left to use: I, U, (maybe Y)  
Consonants left: S is already fixed at 3, so remaining common consonants: C, L, M, P, H, G, K, etc.

We need to place I in 2 or 4 and some other legal consonant in the remaining slot.

Option 1: I in 2, consonant in 4 → A I S _ E  
   Candidate consonants: C, L, M, P, H, K, etc.

Option 2: consonant in 2, I in 4 → A _ S I E

Step 4: Choose the most common word under Option 1.

A I S _ E → AIS_E  
Possible: AISLE (common word).  
Check letters:  
- A, I, S, L, E — none are in the banned list.  
- S is in position 3 (never before tested there).  
- I is in position 2 (never before tested there).  
- L is new, which is good (will give info).

So let’s try AISLE.

<guess>AISLE</guess>",AISLE,"Step 1: Re-state all constraints from prior feedback.

1. Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
2. Letters ruled out completely (x feedback): R, O, D, T, N
3. Letters we know must be in the word:
   - S (from “S(-)” twice) – but S has been excluded from positions 2, 3, 4.
   - I (from “I(-)”) – but I has been excluded from position 3.

Step 2: Determine where S and I can still sit.

- S cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4.  
  The only remaining spot inside A _ _ _ E is position 1, but position 1 is already A.  
  Therefore S cannot be in the word at all under the current pattern, which contradicts the earlier “S(-)” feedback.  
  Conclusion: Our interpretation must be that S is not allowed in the positions already guessed (2, 3, 4) and must appear in the single remaining “middle” position that has not yet been tried.

Wait: the word is A _ _ _ E, so the middle three slots are positions 2, 3, 4.

We have tried:
- Guess 1: A R O S E → S in 4 (feedback “-”)
- Guess 2: A S I D E → S in 2 (feedback “-”)
- Guess 3: A T O N E → no S at all (but we only got x on T, O, N, so S wasn’t placed)

The feedback “S(-)” means “S is in the word, but not in that particular spot.”  
Thus S has to be in the only remaining untested slot among 2, 3, 4: position 3.

Therefore:
- Position 3 = S  
- Position 2 and 4 must be chosen from letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, D, T, N)  
- We also know I is in the word (from ASIDE), so I must be in position 2 or 4.

Step 3: Compile valid letters for positions 2 and 4.

Option 1: I in 2, consonant in 4 → A I S _ E  
   Candidate consonants: C, L, M, P, H, K, etc.

Option 2: consonant in 2, I in 4 → A _ S I E

Step 4: Choose the most common word under Option 1.

A I S _ E → AIS_E
