For the first guess, I want to maximize information gain with a word that contains common letters in English words. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C are among the most common
- A good first guess should cover several of these

Some excellent first guesses include: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, CRANE, etc. 

I'll go with ""STARE"" because it contains:
- S, T (common consonants)
- A, R, E (very common vowels)
This gives me good coverage across common letters in different positions.

From the feedback:
- S: x → not in the word
- T: – → in the word but not in position 2
- A, R, E: all x → none of these letters are in the word at all

So the word:
- Does NOT contain: S, A, R, E
- Contains a T somewhere other than position 2
- Still needs 4 other letters that we haven’t tested yet

Letters still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

To continue eliminating common letters, I’ll pick a word with new common consonants and a different vowel. A good combination would be:

- Include T (already known to be in the word)
- Try O, I, U (other common vowels)
- Add new common consonants: N, L, C, H, M, B, etc.

One strong candidate is ""POINT"" because:
- Uses new vowels O and I
- Uses common consonants P, N, T (and T must be somewhere else)
- T will appear in position 4 here, which satisfies ""not in position 2""
- Uses all new letters except T, which we already know is in the word

From the three guesses so far:

1. STARE → S(x) T(-) A(x) R(x) E(x)  
   – T is present but NOT in positions 2 or 5.

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(-)  
   – I is present but NOT in position 3, and T is still **not** in position 5.

3. BUILT → B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) T(-)  
   – Confirms I is present but NOT in position 3, and T is **not** in position 5.

So far:
- Known letters in the word: T, I  
- Positions ruled out for T: 2, 5  
- Positions ruled out for I: 3  
- Letters **definitely absent**: S, A, R, E, P, O, N, B, U, L  
- Remaining unused letters include: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need three additional distinct letters from the remaining set.  
We also need:
- T to appear in 1, 3, or 4  
- I to appear in 1, 2, or 5  

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses common remaining letters is “KITHT” but “KITHT” is invalid (double T).  
Let’s try “MIGHT”:
- M (new), I (allowed in position 2), G (new), H (new), T (allowed in position 5? No – position 5 is already ruled out for T).  
“MIGHT” puts T in position 5 – **invalid**.

Next candidate: “TIGHT”
- T in position 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), G, H new.  
“TIGHT” uses:
- T in 1 (ok), I in 2 (ok), G, H new, plus a fifth letter.  
But “TIGHT” reuses G and H – but only five letters total.  

Let’s verify: T I G H T – that’s 5 letters.  
But T appears twice – the word can’t have two Ts unless the secret word does.  
We don’t know that yet.  

Better to use 5 distinct letters.  
Candidate: “TWIXT” – but repeats T.  
Try “WIDTH”:
- W, I, D, T, H  
- T is in position 4 – allowed.  
- I is in position 2 – allowed.  
- Letters W, D, H are new.  
All constraints satisfied.

Let’s go with “WIDTH”.
