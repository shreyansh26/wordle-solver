For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like E, A, or O)
2. Common consonants (like T, N, S, R, or L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word is of the form _ _ O _ _.
- Letters to exclude: A, R, S, E.
- Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, W, Y, V, X, Z, J, Q (but we want to stick with very common ones).
- Remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, O, E are used or confirmed).

Good next words should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels. We want to test letters like T, N, L, I, U, etc.

Possible candidates: POINT, COUNT, UNLIT, NIGHT, etc. I'll go with POINT because it tests P, I, N, T while keeping O in the third position and avoiding all excluded letters.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → O is correctly placed in position 3; A, R, S, E are absent.
2. POINT → confirms O at position 3; P, I, N, T are absent.
3. COULD → confirms O at position 3; C, U, L, D are absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters eliminated: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, D
- Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: Y is the only vowel not yet ruled out.

We need a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters (no repeats of any eliminated ones).
- Contains consonants we haven’t tried yet, and ideally the vowel Y.

Possible consonant clusters for the positions: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.

Let’s try:
- B and G → B O _ G Y → no 5-letter word like “BO_GY”.
- M and B → M O _ B Y → “MOBBY” (invalid, double B).
- F and G → F O _ G Y → “FOGGY” (valid, but G is repeated; still, it’s allowed if G is allowed).

2. POINT → confirms O at position 3; P, I, N, T are absent.
3. COULD → confirms O at position 3; C, U, L, D are absent.

- Remaining high-frequency consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: Y is the only vowel not yet ruled out.

We need a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters (no repeats of any eliminated ones).
- Contains consonants we haven’t tried yet, and ideally the vowel Y.

Possible consonant clusters for the positions: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y.

Let’s try:
- B and G → B O _ G Y → no 5-letter word like “BO_GY”.
- M and B → M O _ B Y → “MOBBY” (invalid, double B).
- F and G → F O _ G Y → “FOGGY” (valid, but G is repeated; still, it’s allowed if G is allowed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Common vowels (like E, A, or O)
2. Common consonants (like T, N, S, R, or L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

Popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

- Remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, O, E are used or confirmed).

Good next words should test new common consonants and the remaining vowels. We want to test letters like T, N, L, I, U, etc.

Now we’ve ruled out almost the whole alphabet except a handful of consonants:

- Positions 1, 2, 4 must be from the still-unused set:  
  B, H, K, M, V, W, X, Z, J, Q  
  (but we can ignore the very-rare ones).

We want common consonants first: B, H, K, M, V, W.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2 and one for position 4.

- H _ O _ Y: HOOKY – usable (but K already ruled out)  
- K _ O _ Y: KHORY – invalid  
- M _ O _ Y: MOONY – Y already used twice? No, just position 5 is Y.

BROOD – R ruled out.

BLOWY – L ruled out.

HOGGY – G ruled out.

“WOOLY” – L ruled out.

Known:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Position 5 must be Y (✓)
- Positions 1, 2, 4 must be from the still-unused set:  
  B, H, K, M, V, W, X, Z, J, Q  
  (but we can ignore the very-rare ones).

We want common consonants first: B, H, K, M, V, W.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2 and one for position 4.  
A quick scan of common English words gives:

- B _ O _ Y: BHOY – invalid  
- H _ O _ Y: HOOKY – usable (but K already ruled out)  
- K _ O _ Y: KHORY – invalid  
- M _ O _ Y: MOONY – Y already used twice? No, just position 5 is Y.  
- V _ O _ Y: VOOEY – invalid  
- W _ O _ Y: WOOZY – also invalid.

Let’s try MOONY:
- M, O, O, N, Y – but N is already ruled out.

BROOD – R ruled out.

BLOWY – L ruled out.

HOGGY – G ruled out.

Back to the still-allowed consonants: B, H, K, M, V, W.

Only legal 5-letter word left that ends in O _ Y and uses two of these consonants for slots 1 and 2 is “BHOY” (but not a standard word).

Wait – what about “MOODY”?
- M, O, O, D, Y – but D already ruled out.

“WOOLY” – L ruled out.

“HOBBY” – B twice, H and B allowed, pattern _ _ O _ Y:
H O B B Y → positions 1,2,4,5: H (1), O (3), B (4), Y (5) – perfect.

Letters: H, O, B, B, Y – none ruled out except those already excluded.  
This is the only high-frequency word that fits.

So, let’s guess HOBBY.

From the latest feedback:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ Y
- Letters still allowed: B, K, M, V, W (plus any others not yet ruled out).
- B appears in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5; hence B must be in position 1 or 2.
- All other letters not yet tried: K, M, V, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting the pattern [B or K/M/V/W] [B or K/M/V/W] O [B is excluded here] Y.

Possible candidates:
- BOMBY – invalid (B, O, M, B, Y) but B repeats and must appear only once.
- BOBBY – invalid (B repeats twice, already tried).
- BOYLY – invalid.
- BOKKY – invalid.
- MOBGY – invalid.

The only valid, common word left that fits _ _ O _ Y with B in position 1 or 2 and uses only still-allowed letters is BOMBY, but M is not yet eliminated and O and Y are confirmed. However, checking again, BOMBY is not a standard English word.

Re-examining still-allowed consonants: B, K, M, V, W.

We must have B once, and positions 1 and 2 must contain one B and one of K, M, V, W.

The only standard word that fits is:
B O W Y ? – but we need 5 letters.

Wait – we need 5 letters with pattern _ _ O _ Y.

Looking again, the only word left is:
B O O M Y → but O repeats (and we only know O is in position 3).

Actually, let's list all valid words fitting _ _ O _ Y with B in 1 or 2 and no other disallowed letters:
- BOOMY – O repeats, but O is fixed in third position, so second O is allowed.
- BOBBY – already ruled out.
- BOGGY – G ruled out.
- BOOSY – S ruled out.
- BOOKY – K is allowed, K not ruled out.

BOOKY: B, O, O, K, Y.
- B is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (allowed).
- K is new and not yet ruled out.
- Y is in position 5 (confirmed).
- Letters used: B, O, K, Y – all allowed.

This seems to be the last standard word left.

Therefore, the final guess is BOOKY.
