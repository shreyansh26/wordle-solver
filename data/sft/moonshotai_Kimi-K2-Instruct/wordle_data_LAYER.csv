For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes vowels and common consonants. 

Common letters in English include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, etc. A word like ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it includes:
- Three vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel presence
- Two very common consonants (R, S) to test consonant presence
- No repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This seems like a strong opening move to gather initial feedback.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong spot (R(-))  
- A is in the word and in the right spot (A(✓)) so the word is _ A _ _ _
- I is not in the word (I(x))
- S is not in the word (S(x))
- E is in the word but in the wrong spot (E(-))

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _
Letters we now know are present: A (fixed in position 2), R (somewhere else), E (somewhere else)
Letters we can eliminate: I, S

Since R is in the word but not at the start, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
E is in the word but not at the end (position 5), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible letters to try: consonants not eliminated yet (T, N, L, C, etc.) while keeping in mind we still need to place R and E.

A good next guess would test new common consonants while respecting the constraints. ""CRANE"" could work:
- C and N are new common consonants
- R is moved to position 3
- A stays fixed in position 2
- E is moved to position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this would be invalid)

Alternative: ""TREAD"" - but this conflicts with A being fixed in position 2.

Better option: ""EARLY"" - puts E first, A fixed, R in position 3, tests new letters L and Y.

Another option: ""LATER"" - but this would put E in position 4 and R in position 5, which is acceptable.

I'll go with ""LATER"" as it uses common letters and tests:
- L as new letter
- A fixed in position 2
- T as new letter
- E in position 4
- R in position 5 (note: feedback only showed E is not in position 5, not that R can't be)

A good starting word typically includes vowels and common consonants. \n\nCommon letters in English include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, etc. A word like ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it includes:\n- Three vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel presence\n- Two very common consonants (R, S) to test consonant presence\n- No repeating letters, maximizing information gain\n\nThis seems like a strong opening move to gather initial feedback.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is in the word but in the wrong spot (R(-))  \n- A is in the word and in the right spot (A(✓)) so the word is _ A _ _ _\n- I is not in the word (I(x))\n- S is not in the word (S(x))\n- E is in the word but in the wrong spot (E(-))\n\nSo the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _\nLetters we now know are present: A (fixed in position 2), R (somewhere else), E (somewhere else)\nLetters we can eliminate: I, S\n\nSince R is in the word but not at the start, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\nE is in the word but not at the end (position 5), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nPossible letters to try: consonants not eliminated yet (T, N, L, C, etc.) while keeping in mind we still need to place R and E.\n\nA good next guess would test new common consonants while respecting the constraints.
