For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It covers the vowels A and E
2. It includes common consonants C, R, N
3. It doesn’t repeat any letters, giving maximum coverage

This will help narrow down possible letters efficiently.

R is now in position 2 (acceptable since feedback only said R is not in position 2; actually CRANE had R in position 2 and it was marked “-”, so R can be in other positions). E is in position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5. So DROVE is invalid.

RIVER:
- R: position 1 (valid, since R is allowed in 1,3,4,5)
- I: new letter
- V: new letter
- E: position 4 (valid)
- R: position 5 (valid, since R can be here)

This introduces I and V as new letters while testing R in position 1 and 5, and E in position 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It covers the vowels A and E
2. It includes common consonants C, R, N
3. It doesn’t repeat any letters, giving maximum coverage

This will help narrow down possible letters efficiently.

- C: not in the word (x)  
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- A: not in the word (x)  
- N: not in the word (x)  
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)  

So we know:
1. The word contains R and E.
2. R is NOT in position 2.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word definitely does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses R and E in different positions.
- Avoids C, A, N.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “SIREN” but N is ruled out.  
“PERCH” has C which is ruled out.  
“DROVE” is possible—contains D, R, O, V, E.  
R is now in position 2 (acceptable since feedback only said R is not in position 2; actually CRANE had R in position 2 and it was marked “-”, so R can be in other positions). E is in position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5. So DROVE is invalid.  

Try “TREND”:  
- Contains R and E.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It covers the vowels A and E
2. It includes common consonants C, R, N
3. It doesn’t repeat any letters, giving maximum coverage

This will help narrow down possible letters efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:

- C: not in the word (x)  
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- A: not in the word (x)  
- N: not in the word (x)  
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)  

So we know:
1. The word contains R and E.
2. R is NOT in position 2.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word definitely does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses R and E in different positions.
- Avoids C, A, N.
- Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “SIREN” but N is ruled out.  
“PERCH” has C which is ruled out.  
“DROVE” is possible—contains D, R, O, V, E.  
R is now in position 2 (acceptable since feedback only said R is not in position 2; actually CRANE had R in position 2 and it was marked “-”, so R can be in other positions). E is in position 5, but feedback said E is not in position 5. So DROVE is invalid.  

Try “TREND”:  
- Contains R and E.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5).  
- Uses T, D as new letters.  

Looks good.

<guess>TREND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the information we now have:

1. From both CRANE and TREND: N is not in the word (x both times).
2. From CRANE: C, A are not in the word (x both times).
3. From TREND: T and D are not in the word (x both times).
4. From both CRANE and TREND: R and E are in the word but not yet in their correct positions.
   - CRANE: R was in position 2 (feedback “-”), E was in position 5 (feedback “-”).
   - TREND: R was in position 2 (feedback “-”), E was in position 3 (feedback “-”).
   - Therefore, R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5 or 3.

So the word contains R and E, and their possible positions are:
- R: positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 2)
- E: positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5)

We need a word that uses R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters. The word must avoid C, A, N, T, D.

Good next words to test could be:
- FERRY: repeats R, but we might want to avoid repeats for more info.
- PERKY: P, R, K, Y — R in position 2 (invalid, we know R is not in position 2).
- HORSE: H, O, S — R in position 3 (valid), E in position 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).
- GRIPE: G, R, I, P — R in position 2 (invalid).
- REIGN: R in position 1 (valid), E in position 2 (valid), new letters G, I, N (N is invalid, so skip).
- FRESH: R in position 2 (invalid).
- BROKE: B, R, O, K — R in position 2 (invalid).
- SPREE: repeats E twice, and R in position 3 (valid), E in positions 4 and 5 (invalid for 5).
- PRESS: repeats S, R in position 2 (invalid).
- RIVER: R in position 1 (valid), E in position 4 (valid), V is new, I is new. This looks good.

RIVER:
- R: position 1 (valid, since R is allowed in 1,3,4,5)
- I: new letter
- V: new letter
- E: position 4 (valid)
- R: position 5 (valid, since R can be here)

This introduces I and V as new letters while testing R in position 1 and 5, and E in position 4.

   - Letters **C, A, N, T, D, I, V** are **not** in the word at all.
   - **R** is not in position 1 (from RIVER feedback: first R is “-”) and not in position 2 (from CRANE & TREND).
   - Therefore **R** must appear **only once**, in position 5.

2. Word pattern so far:
   _ _ _ E R  

3. Allowed letters: any except C, A, N, T, D, I, V. Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, W, Y, etc.  
   Vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

4. We now need three more distinct letters to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
   A good next test word should:
   - Fit the pattern _ _ _ E R.
   - Use new letters we have not tried yet to maximize information gain.

5. Candidate words that satisfy the pattern and use fresh letters:
   - LOWER → L, O, W are new.
   - HOMER → H, O, M are new.
   - FOYER → F, O, Y are new.
   - GONER → G, O, N (N is excluded, discard).
   - SUPER → S, U, P are new.

“SUPER” covers three new letters (S, U, P) and fits the required pattern.
