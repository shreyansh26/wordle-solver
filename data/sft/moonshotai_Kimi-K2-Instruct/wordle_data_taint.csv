For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives as much information as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word typically uses a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O) - but lacks common consonants
- ADIEU (similar to AUDIO but less consonants)

I think ""CRANE"" is a good balance because it has:
1. C (common consonant)
2. R (very common)
3. A (most common vowel)
4. N (common)
5. E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good coverage of frequent letters to help narrow down the secret word.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good starting word typically uses a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O) - but lacks common consonants
- ADIEU (similar to AUDIO but less consonants)

I think ""CRANE"" is a good balance because it has:
1. C (common consonant)
2. R (very common)
3. A (most common vowel)
4. N (common)
5. E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good coverage of frequent letters to help narrow down the secret word.

- C is NOT in the word (x)

- A is in the word, but not in position 3 (-) → so A must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5
- N is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is _ _ _ N _ with an A somewhere among positions 1, 2, or 5 (can't be 3 or 4).

Good next letters to test would be common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated: S, T, L, M, P, I, O, U, D, etc.

A word that fits: _ _ A N _ or _ A _ N _ or A _ _ N _. Let's try a word with A in position 2 and some new consonants.

""PLANT"" comes to mind:
- P: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- A: fits position 2
- N: already confirmed in position 4
- T: new consonant

This tests P, L, T while keeping A and N in new positions.

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, E, P, L

Remaining common consonants/vowels to test: S, D, G, B, M, K, I, O, U, etc.

We need a word that:
- has A in position 1 or 2
- ends in N T
- uses only the allowed letters (no C, R, E, P, L)

Ideas:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ N T → words like ""ADUNT"" (invalid), ""AGENT"" (E excluded), ""AMENT"" (E excluded), ""ANGST"" (S not yet tested)

""SAINT"" is valid and tests S, I, A in position 2.

""DAUNT"" is also valid and tests D, U, A in position 2.

Both are good, but ""SAINT"" uses S which is very common and the new vowel I.

- T (already placed)

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, E, P, L

Remaining common consonants/vowels to test: S, D, G, B, M, K, I, O, U, etc.

We need a word that:
- has A in position 1 or 2
- ends in N T
- uses only the allowed letters (no C, R, E, P, L)

Ideas:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ N T → words like ""ADUNT"" (invalid), ""AGENT"" (E excluded), ""AMENT"" (E excluded), ""ANGST"" (S not yet tested)
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ N T → words like ""BAINT"" (invalid), ""DAUNT"" (D, U not yet tested), ""GAUNT"" (G, U not yet tested), ""HAUNT"", ""JAUNT"", ""SAINT"", ""VAUNT"", ""WANT_"" (not 5 letters)

""SAINT"" is valid and tests S, I, A in position 2.

""DAUNT"" is also valid and tests D, U, A in position 2.

Both are good, but ""SAINT"" uses S which is very common and the new vowel I.

Let's go with ""SAINT"".

Position map:
1  2  3  4  5
?  A  I  N  T   (with ✓ on all of A, I, N, T)

So the word has the fixed ending **AINT** and we only need to determine the first letter.

Letters already ruled out: C, R, E, P, L, S

Still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z … plus vowels we haven’t ruled out (O, U) but we already have A and I so the first letter must be a consonant.

Common 5-letter words ending in AINT:
- FAINT
- PAINT (P ruled out)
- SAINT (S ruled out)
- TAINT (T already used in position 5, can’t repeat)
- GAINT (not a valid word)
- HAINT (chiefly dialectal but sometimes accepted)
- MAINT (not a valid word)
- VAIN’T (invalid)

The most straightforward remaining choice is **FAINT**.

Positions 2-5 are exactly **A I N T**, so we only need to determine the first letter.

Letters already ruled out (because they have received an “x” in the first position or anywhere):  
C, R, E, P, L, S, F

Remaining common consonants that can start a valid English word ending in AINT:  
B, D, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, …

Valid dictionary words that fit:

- BAINT  – not standard  
- DAINT – archaic form of “dainty,” rarely accepted  
- GAINT – invalid  
- HAINT – regional/dialectal (sometimes accepted)  
- JAINT – invalid  
- KAINT – invalid  
- MAINT – invalid  
- VAINT – invalid  
- WAINT – invalid  
- YAINT – invalid  

The only standard, widely accepted word left is:

**DAINT** (even if archaic, it’s the closest valid choice).

So we’ll test D as the first letter.

All feedback confirms the last four letters are fixed as A I N T.  
Letters already ruled out in the first position are: C, R, E, P, L, S, F, D.

Remaining standard English word: **GAINT** is not valid, **Haint** is dialectal, **MAINT** isn’t a word, **Paint** uses P (ruled out), **Taint** re-uses T, **Vaint**, **Waint**, etc. are invalid.

The only standard, unruled 5-letter word ending in AINT left is **PAINT**, but P is already ruled out. There is no other valid candidate, which means I must have missed an earlier constraint.

Rechecking: all consonants tried so far that are ruled out in position 1 are C,R,E,P,L,S,F,D.  
The only valid word left is **Haint**, even if colloquial.

However, **PAINT** uses P (already excluded). This implies the secret word must be **Haint**.

But let’s be certain: the only consonant remaining that forms a recognized word with AINT is **G** (GAINT doesn’t exist), **M** (MAINT doesn’t exist), etc. The only valid word is **Haint**.

Therefore, the correct guess is **haint**.
