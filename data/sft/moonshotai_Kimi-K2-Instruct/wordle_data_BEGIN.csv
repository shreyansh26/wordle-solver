For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use a word with frequently appearing letters in English - particularly vowels and common consonants. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple positions. 

Traditional opening guesses for Wordle-type games include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Let's consolidate what we know:

Letters known to be in the word  
- E (not at positions 3, 4, 5) ⇒ must be at 1 or 2  
- N (not at positions 2, 3) ⇒ must be at 1, 4, or 5  

Letters confirmed NOT present  
A, D, L, O, R, S, T  

Consequences:  
1. If E is at position 1, N can be at 4 or 5.  
2. If E is at position 2, N can be at 1, 4, 5 (but can’t be 1 because N can’t be 1 if E is 2 – that would put two known letters in the first two slots and still leave positions 3,4,5 with constraints).  

We also know the word contains no duplicates among the ruled-out letters.

Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining allowed vowels: I, U (I is known to be in the word but not at position 1), plus E (already placed).

The simplest next step is to test a pattern that satisfies:  
- E in position 1 or 2  
- N in position 4 or 5  
- Uses fresh allowed letters elsewhere.

Let’s try E at position 2 and N at position 4:  
 _ E _ N _  

We need a consonant at 1,3,5 that have not been used.  
I’ll pick “C” at 1, “U” at 3, and “M” at 5 → “CENUM” – not a word.  
Pick “B” at 1, “I” at 3, “G” at 5 → “BEING” – valid word, uses I (already known to exist), B, G fresh.

Let’s try “BEING”.

- E at 2  
- N at 4  
- B, I, G new  
- Contains I not at 1 (ok per feedback on “inlet”)

Looks safe.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BEGIN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use a word with frequently appearing letters in English - particularly vowels and common consonants. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants to test multiple positions. 

Traditional opening guesses for Wordle-type games include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT at position 5
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S
- Is 5 letters long

Now I need to pick a new word that:
1. Uses E in positions 1-4 (not 5)
2. Does not use A, R, O, or S
3. Uses other common letters that haven't been eliminated

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A, O are out)

I'll try a word with E in position 2, using common remaining letters. ""T"" is a very common starting letter, and ""N"" and ""D"" are common consonants.

I'll go with ""trend"":
- Uses E in position 2
- Does not use A, R, O, or S
- Uses common letters T, N, D

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds:

Round 1 (arose)  
A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Round 2 (trend)  
T(x) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)  
⇒ The word does NOT contain T, R, D; the E is present but not at position 3; the N is present (exact position unknown).

Letters already ruled out: A, D, O, R, S, T  
Letters now known to be in the word: E, N

Remaining useful consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: E, I, U  (A and O already out)

We need to place:
- E in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)
- N somewhere (position still unknown)
- No duplicates of any letter already used.

To maximize information, I’ll try a word that uses both E and N in new positions, plus three fresh consonants.  
Candidate: “inlet” – but this has an I (allowed) and uses E at position 4 and N at position 3. Let me check: contains no banned letters, uses E not at 3 or 5, uses N, and introduces I, L.
