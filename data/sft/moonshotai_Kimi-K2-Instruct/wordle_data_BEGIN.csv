This is the first guess, so there's no prior feedback to consider. The goal here is to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:

1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover both categories.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers the vowels A, I, E and common consonants R, S. This gives us a broad set of letters to get initial feedback on, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

So, I'll go with ARISE as my first guess.

From the feedback:

Summary of what we now know:

Letters not in the word at all:
A, R, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but each is in the wrong position so far:
I (but not in position 3, and not in position 1)
E (but not in position 5, and not in position 4)

Remaining open positions for I and E: 2, 3, 4 for I and 1, 2, 3 for E (with the overlaps resolved by the known positions).

So the word contains I and E somewhere in:
I ∈ {2, 4}
E ∈ {1, 2, 3}

We also need three more distinct consonants that have not been ruled out. Available consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels left to use: the word already has I and E, and no others have been ruled out (but we know A is out).

Aiming for a word that places both I and E in new legal positions and introduces common unused consonants.

Possible patterns:
- E I _ _ _ (I in 2, E in 1)
- _ E I _ _ (I in 3, but I has never been in 3 so this is allowed)
- _ _ E I _ (I in 4, E in 3)
- etc.

Using high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, H, K, M, P, etc.):

Candidate: “DEMIC” – but C is last, and I would be 4, E 2. Checks out.

Another: “CHIDE” – I in 4, E in 5 (invalid, E can’t be in 5).

Another: “MEDIC” – I in 4, E in 2, uses M, D, C.

Still another: “PIKED” – I in 3, E in 4 (invalid), D last.

Best balance seems “MEDIC” – uses I in 4, E in 2, new consonants M, D, C.

Next: ""TIDLE"" - but L and D are low frequency.
Better: ""NIECE"" - I in 2, E in 3 and 5 (but E can't be in 5).
Refining: ""LIETH"" - uses I in 3 (invalid), so no.
""ELITE"" - E in 1 and 5 (invalid), I in 3 (invalid).
""TWICE"" - I in 3 (invalid).
""EDICT"" - I in 3 (invalid).
""EVICT"" - I in 3 (invalid).

Better approach: Put I in 1 or 2 or 4, E in 1-4.
""INLET"" - I in 1, E in 4. Contains N, L, T (all new letters).
""ENIGM"" - but GM is uncommon.
""EIGHT"" - I in 2, E in 1, GH unlikely.

""INLET"" seems best - uses I (pos 1), E (pos 4), and tests new letters N, L, T.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

Letters not in the word at all:
A, R, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but each is in the wrong position so far:
I (but not in position 3, and not in position 1)
E (but not in position 5, and not in position 4)

Remaining open positions for I and E: 2, 3, 4 for I and 1, 2, 3 for E (with the overlaps resolved by the known positions).

So the word contains I and E somewhere in:
I ∈ {2, 4}
E ∈ {1, 2, 3}

We also need three more distinct consonants that have not been ruled out. Available consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels left to use: the word already has I and E, and no others have been ruled out (but we know A is out).

Aiming for a word that places both I and E in new legal positions and introduces common unused consonants.

Possible patterns:
- E I _ _ _ (I in 2, E in 1)
- _ E I _ _ (I in 3, but I has never been in 3 so this is allowed)
- _ _ E I _ (I in 4, E in 3)
- etc.

Using high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, H, K, M, P, etc.):

Candidate: “DEMIC” – but C is last, and I would be 4, E 2. Checks out.

Another: “CHIDE” – I in 4, E in 5 (invalid, E can’t be in 5).

Another: “MEDIC” – I in 4, E in 2, uses M, D, C.

Still another: “PIKED” – I in 3, E in 4 (invalid), D last.

Best balance seems “MEDIC” – uses I in 4, E in 2, new consonants M, D, C.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Pattern: _ E _ I _
- Letters known not in the word at all: A, R, S, N, L, T, M, D, C, W, H
- Letters that ARE in the word and still need correct placement:
    – I: must be in position 4 (already ✓)
    – E: must be in position 2 (already ✓)
    – G: must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (already ruled out by I)
- We need three new letters for positions 1, 3, 5 from the unused set:
    Remaining unused letters (consonants & vowels): B, F, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z
    Vowels already exhausted (A out, I/E placed), so positions 1, 3, 5 must be consonants.

We need a common English word of the form C E C I C (C = consonant from the remaining set).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,BEGIN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so there's no prior feedback to consider. The goal here is to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:

1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Have a mix of vowels and consonants to cover both categories.

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it covers the vowels A, I, E and common consonants R, S. This gives us a broad set of letters to get initial feedback on, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

So, I'll go with ARISE as my first guess.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x)
- I and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains I and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- Does not contain A, R, or S.

The known letters are I and E. They can appear in any positions except 3 (for I) and 5 (for E).

To maximize information gain while using known letters, I should:
1. Include I and E in new positions (I not in 3, E not in 5)
2. Avoid A, R, S
3. Choose common consonants not yet tested (like T, N, L, D, etc.)

Possible structure: E _ _ I _ or _ E I _ _ or similar, avoiding positions 3 for I and 5 for E.

A good candidate: ""UNTIE"" - uses I in position 4 and E in position 5 (but E can't be in 5), so adjust.
Next: ""TIDLE"" - but L and D are low frequency.
Better: ""NIECE"" - I in 2, E in 3 and 5 (but E can't be in 5).
Refining: ""LIETH"" - uses I in 3 (invalid), so no.
""ELITE"" - E in 1 and 5 (invalid), I in 3 (invalid).
""TWICE"" - I in 3 (invalid).
""EDICT"" - I in 3 (invalid).
""EVICT"" - I in 3 (invalid).

Better approach: Put I in 1 or 2 or 4, E in 1-4.
""INLET"" - I in 1, E in 4. Contains N, L, T (all new letters).
""ENIGM"" - but GM is uncommon.
""EIGHT"" - I in 2, E in 1, GH unlikely.

""INLET"" seems best - uses I (pos 1), E (pos 4), and tests new letters N, L, T.

<guess>INLET</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) L(x) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

Letters not in the word at all:
A, R, S, L, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word, but each is in the wrong position so far:
I (but not in position 3, and not in position 1)
E (but not in position 5, and not in position 4)

Remaining open positions for I and E: 2, 3, 4 for I and 1, 2, 3 for E (with the overlaps resolved by the known positions).

So the word contains I and E somewhere in:
I ∈ {2, 4}
E ∈ {1, 2, 3}

We also need three more distinct consonants that have not been ruled out. Available consonants not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Vowels left to use: the word already has I and E, and no others have been ruled out (but we know A is out).

Aiming for a word that places both I and E in new legal positions and introduces common unused consonants.

Possible patterns:
- E I _ _ _ (I in 2, E in 1)
- _ E I _ _ (I in 3, but I has never been in 3 so this is allowed)
- _ _ E I _ (I in 4, E in 3)
- etc.

Using high-frequency remaining letters (C, D, H, K, M, P, etc.):

Candidate: “DEMIC” – but C is last, and I would be 4, E 2. Checks out.

Another: “CHIDE” – I in 4, E in 5 (invalid, E can’t be in 5).

Another: “MEDIC” – I in 4, E in 2, uses M, D, C.

Still another: “PIKED” – I in 3, E in 4 (invalid), D last.

Best balance seems “MEDIC” – uses I in 4, E in 2, new consonants M, D, C.

Let’s lock that in.

<guess>MEDIC</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: MEDIC -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(✓) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have exact positions for two letters:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)

So the template is: _ E _ I _

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all x marks):
A, R, S, N, L, T, M, D, C

Available letters:
Vowels left: O, U, (A already out)
Consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need three more distinct letters for positions 1, 3, 5. Good candidates should be common consonants not yet used.

High-frequency remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try combinations:
- Position 1: B, F, G, H, K, P, V, W
- Position 3: same pool
- Position 5: same pool

Common words fitting _ E _ I _:
- BEGIN (B, G, N – but N is out)
- BEGET (but T is out)
- BEVIL (not a word)
- FELIX (X at end, but X is low frequency)
- HEIDI (D is out)
- KEBAB (B repeats, A is out)
- PEGGY (G repeats, Y at end – but G is fine, Y is okay)

The best simple option is: ""HEIGH"" – but G and H are okay, but it's not a common word.

Better: ""BEVIL"" – not valid.
Actually: ""VEGIE"" – but E repeats.
""PEKIN"" – N is out.
""PEWIT"" – T is out.
""PERIL"" – R, L are out.

Wait - we have limited options. Let me check a real dictionary list for _E_I_ words.

Real words left:
- BASIC - but C is out
- BIKIE
- CIVIL - C, L are out
- FETID - D, T are out

- PEWIT - T is out
- REJIG - R is out
- SEPIK - S is out
- TEPID - T, D are out

""WEIGH"" looks perfect:

- Uses only new unused letters: W, G, H
