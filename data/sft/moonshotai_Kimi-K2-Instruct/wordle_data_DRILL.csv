Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, I should choose a word that contains common letters found in many English words. A good starting word uses vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers common consonants and vowels. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has a good mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E).

From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word.
- R is in the word AND in the correct second position.
- A, N, E are NOT in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the second spot (fixed).
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, E.
3. Uses only remaining letters (common consonants and vowels left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y).

A good second guess should introduce new common letters. The word ""BROTH"" fits:
- R in position 2 (matches ✓).
- Uses B, O, T, H (none of which are excluded).
- Covers common letters B, O, T, H.
