For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. 

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from feedback

This should help me quickly narrow down possible letters and their positions for subsequent guesses.

Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

1) From AROSE:
   A is correct in position 1.
   R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
   E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2) From AHEAD:
   A(✓) again confirms A in position 1.
   H(x) and D(x) → H and D are NOT in the word.
   E(-) confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because the AHEAD guess placed E at 3 but the feedback is “-”, so E is somewhere else in positions 2, 3, 5).  
   A(-) in position 4 means no second A in position 4 (so it’s not A A _ _ _).

So far:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Contains an E (positions 2, 3 or 5; definitely not 4 and not already placed).
- Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, H, D.
- No second A in position 4.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and possible positions for E.  
The remaining common consonants include B, C, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y.  
Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel).  
Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with A.
- Has E in position 2 to test if E is in position 2.
- Adds new common consonants: let’s pick “ALONE”.

“ALONE”:
- A in position 1 (already confirmed).
- L, N, E are new letters we haven’t tested.
- O is already excluded (from AROSE feedback), but I just noticed O is excluded (O(x) from AROSE). So ALONE has O, which is banned. That won't work.

Let me re-pick. I need to avoid O, R, S, H, D.  
Try “ANGLE”:
- A _ _ _ _ (first letter A).
- Has E in position 5. We know E is not in position 5 (from AROSE: “E(-)” means not in 5). So ANGLE won’t work.

Try “AMPLE”:
- A, M, P, L, E.
- Starts with A.
- E in position 5 → again, E cannot be in 5 (from AROSE feedback), so reject.

Try “AGENT”:
- A, G, E, N, T.
- Starts with A.
- E in position 3. This is acceptable (positions allowed for E: 2, 3, 5; 5 is excluded, so 2 or 3 is fine).
- Uses new consonants G, N, T.

Let’s consolidate what the three rounds have told us.

Known facts:
1. Word must be A _ _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, H, D, T
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still need to confirm:
   - E (must be placed somewhere after position 1, and we know it isn’t in positions 3,4,5 from the feedback in AGENT: the E placed at position 3 received (-) → so E not at 3, and we already knew from AROSE it is not at 5. Therefore E must be at position 2.)
   - G received (-) in position 2 → so G is in the word but not in position 2
   - N received (-) in position 4 → so N is in the word but not in position 4

Therefore:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E (only remaining spot)
- Positions 3, 5: must be filled by G and N in some order (since both letters are in the word and haven’t yet found their home)
- Position 4: must be a letter we haven’t eliminated yet and which hasn’t appeared. Possibilities include B, C, F, I, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can now test which order G and N go in, and what letter lands at 4.

A quick exhaustive scan of valid English words of form A E _ _ _ with only remaining letters allowed gives us only a few candidates. The most common is “AEGIS”. Let’s verify:

A E G I S
- A ✓ correct position
- E ✓ position 2 (which we deduced must hold E)
- G (needs to be somewhere, here at 3)
- I (new letter to test at 4)
- S (but S is already excluded by AROSE feedback: S(x) in first guess)

So “AEGIS” is invalid because S is banned.

Next candidate: “AEONS” – again contains banned S and O.

Next: “AEQUI” – uncommon and contains U and I; probably not the target.

Next: “AERIE” – has R (banned).

Next: “AERIF” – R banned.

Wait, let’s step back systematically.

We need A E _ _ _ with remaining letters not yet ruled out and no repeats of banned letters.

Letters allowed now (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used; O ruled out)

We know G and N are both in the word. So the three remaining slots must include G and N and one additional consonant or vowel.

Permutations:
- AE _ _ _, with positions 3,4,5 taking {G, N, X} where X is the new letter.

Quickly scanning for common words:
- AEN _ _ – nothing common comes to mind
- AE _ N _ – “AEINO” no, etc.
- AE _ _ N – “AEIGN” no
- AE G _ N – “AEGN_” – no common word
- AE _ G N – “AEIGN” – none
- AE N G _ – “AENGI” – none

Actually, a valid dictionary word is “AEGIS” but as we saw it contains banned S.

Another candidate: “AEGIR” – has R (banned).

Next possible candidate: “AEGIP” – uses P, which is allowed. Let’s list the possibilities systematically.

We need a 5-letter word starting AE, containing both G and N somewhere, and one more letter not banned.

Possible patterns:
1. A E G _ N
2. A E N _ G
3. A E _ G N
4. A E _ N G
5. A E G N _
6. A E N G _

We need to fill the blank with a letter not yet banned.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look up common words for these patterns.

A E G _ N:
- AEGAN – not valid
- AEGEN – not valid
- … none

A E N _ G:
- AENIG – not a word
- AENAG – none
- AENUG – none

A E _ G N:

- AECGN – none
- AEFGN – none
- AELGN – none
- AEMGN – none

- AEGNY – none

A E N G _:
- AENGI – none
- AENGB – none
- AENGC – none
- AENGF – none
- AENGL – AENGL doesn’t exist
- etc.

This exhaustive scan shows that the only common English word that fits all constraints is “AEGIS”, but it contains the banned letter S.

Let me double-check: perhaps I mis-assumed the positions.

We know:
- A is fixed at 1.
- E must be at 2 (deduced from feedback).
- We must use G and N somewhere in positions 3,4,5.
- Position 4 cannot be N (from AGENT feedback: N(-) means N not at 4).
- G cannot be at 2 (from AGENT feedback: G(-) at 2 means G is in word but not at 2).

Therefore, the three remaining slots (3,4,5) must contain G, N, and one additional letter X (not banned), with N not at 4 and G not at 2 (which is already satisfied).

Thus possible arrangements:
- AE G N X
- AE G X N
- AE N G X
- AE N X G
- AE X G N
- AE X N G

Let’s list valid English words with these patterns:

AE G N X:
- AEGNB – none
- AEGNI – none
- AEGNU – none
- AEGNY – none

AE G X N:
- AEGAN – not a word
- AEGCN – none
- AEGFN – none
- AEGGN – impossible (G twice)
- AEGIN – AEGIN not a word
- AEGKN – none
- AEGLN – none
- AEGMN – none

- AECNG – none
- AEFNG – none
- AELNG – none
- AEMNG – none
- AEPNG – none
- AIENG – none
- AUENG – none

None of these yield common English words. This strongly suggests my earlier deduction that E must be at position 2 is correct, but there’s simply no common word starting AE containing both G and N. Therefore, I must revisit the deduction.

Wait, let’s re-examine the AGENT feedback carefully:

Guess 3: AGENT → A(✓) G(-) E(-) N(-) T(x)

- G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 2.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 3 (it was placed at 3 in AGENT).
- N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4.

We already knew from AROSE:
- E is in word but not at 5.

Therefore, E can be at position 2, 3, or 4, but NOT at 3 (from AGENT), NOT at 5 (from AROSE). So E must be at position 2 or 4.

Let’s not jump to position 2 only yet.

Similarly, G must be in the word but not at 2, so possible positions 3,4,5.

N must be in the word but not at 4, so possible positions 2,3,5.

Let’s map possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed: A _ _ _ _
Letters to place: E, G, N plus two more letters from allowed set (B,C,F,I,K,L,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, none of which have been ruled out yet).

We need a 5-letter word A _ _ _ _ containing E, G, N, with constraints:
- E not at 3,5
- G not at 2
- N not at 4

Thus possible positions:

Case 1: E at position 2
Then word is A E _ _ _
We need to place G and N in positions 3,4,5 with
   G not at 2 (already okay, G at 3,4,5 allowed),
   N not at 4.

Thus possible arrangements:
- AE G N X (but N at 4 banned)
- AE G X N
- AE N G X
- AE N X G
- AE X G N
- AE X N G

We saw these produce no common words.

Case 2: E at position 4
Then word is A _ _ E _
We need to place G and N in positions 2,3,5 with
   G not at 2 → so G at 3 or 5,
   N not at 4 (already okay, N at 2,3,5).

Thus possible arrangements:
- A N G E _
- A G N E _
- A N _ E G
- A G _ E N
- A _ N E G
- A _ G E N

Let’s look up common English words matching these patterns.

A N G E _:
- ANGER – yes, ANGER is a common word.

Check constraints:
- Starts with A ✓
- Contains E at 4 ✓
- Contains G at 3 ✓ (G not at 2, so okay)
- Contains N at 2 ✓ (N not at 4, so okay)
- All letters not yet excluded: R is allowed (hasn’t been tested yet).

Therefore, “ANGER” is a valid candidate fitting all feedback.

Let’s try it.

Based on the combined feedback, the word must start with A, contain E (not at 3 or 5), contain G (not at 2), and contain N (not at 4). The only common English word fitting all these constraints is “ANGER”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ANGEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. 

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for this because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from feedback

This should help me quickly narrow down possible letters and their positions for subsequent guesses.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(✓) means A is in the word and it is the first letter.
- R(x), O(x), S(x) mean none of R, O, or S are in the word at all.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in the last position.

So the word starts with A and has an E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. Also, we can exclude R, O, and S.

Good candidate letters to try next are common consonants and vowels we haven’t used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that starts with A, contains E not at the end, and uses new common consonants. “AHEAD” fits:
- Starts with A.
- Has E in position 3 (not last).
- Uses new consonants H and D, and another A (which could help confirm positions).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: AHEAD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) H(x) E(-) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

1) From AROSE:
   A is correct in position 1.
   R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
   E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2) From AHEAD:
   A(✓) again confirms A in position 1.
   H(x) and D(x) → H and D are NOT in the word.
   E(-) confirms E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because the AHEAD guess placed E at 3 but the feedback is “-”, so E is somewhere else in positions 2, 3, 5).  
   A(-) in position 4 means no second A in position 4 (so it’s not A A _ _ _).

So far:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Contains an E (positions 2, 3 or 5; definitely not 4 and not already placed).
- Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, H, D.
- No second A in position 4.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and possible positions for E.  
The remaining common consonants include B, C, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y.  
Vowels left: I, U, Y (Y can act as vowel).  
Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with A.
- Has E in position 2 to test if E is in position 2.
- Adds new common consonants: let’s pick “ALONE”.

“ALONE”:
- A in position 1 (already confirmed).
- L, N, E are new letters we haven’t tested.
- O is already excluded (from AROSE feedback), but I just noticed O is excluded (O(x) from AROSE). So ALONE has O, which is banned. That won't work.

Let me re-pick. I need to avoid O, R, S, H, D.  
Try “ANGLE”:
- A _ _ _ _ (first letter A).
- Has E in position 5. We know E is not in position 5 (from AROSE: “E(-)” means not in 5). So ANGLE won’t work.

Try “AMPLE”:
- A, M, P, L, E.
- Starts with A.
- E in position 5 → again, E cannot be in 5 (from AROSE feedback), so reject.

Try “AGENT”:
- A, G, E, N, T.
- Starts with A.
- E in position 3. This is acceptable (positions allowed for E: 2, 3, 5; 5 is excluded, so 2 or 3 is fine).
- Uses new consonants G, N, T.

That looks good: AGENT.

Guess 3: AGENT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(-) E(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what the three rounds have told us.

Known facts:
1. Word must be A _ _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, H, D, T
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still need to confirm:
   - E (must be placed somewhere after position 1, and we know it isn’t in positions 3,4,5 from the feedback in AGENT: the E placed at position 3 received (-) → so E not at 3, and we already knew from AROSE it is not at 5. Therefore E must be at position 2.)
   - G received (-) in position 2 → so G is in the word but not in position 2
   - N received (-) in position 4 → so N is in the word but not in position 4

Therefore:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E (only remaining spot)
- Positions 3, 5: must be filled by G and N in some order (since both letters are in the word and haven’t yet found their home)
- Position 4: must be a letter we haven’t eliminated yet and which hasn’t appeared. Possibilities include B, C, F, I, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can now test which order G and N go in, and what letter lands at 4.

A quick exhaustive scan of valid English words of form A E _ _ _ with only remaining letters allowed gives us only a few candidates. The most common is “AEGIS”. Let’s verify:

A E G I S
- A ✓ correct position
- E ✓ position 2 (which we deduced must hold E)
- G (needs to be somewhere, here at 3)
- I (new letter to test at 4)
- S (but S is already excluded by AROSE feedback: S(x) in first guess)

So “AEGIS” is invalid because S is banned.

Next candidate: “AEONS” – again contains banned S and O.

Next: “AEQUI” – uncommon and contains U and I; probably not the target.

Next: “AERIE” – has R (banned).

Next: “AERIF” – R banned.

Wait, let’s step back systematically.

We need A E _ _ _ with remaining letters not yet ruled out and no repeats of banned letters.

Letters allowed now (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used; O ruled out)

We know G and N are both in the word. So the three remaining slots must include G and N and one additional consonant or vowel.

Permutations:
- AE _ _ _, with positions 3,4,5 taking {G, N, X} where X is the new letter.

Quickly scanning for common words:
- AEN _ _ – nothing common comes to mind
- AE _ N _ – “AEINO” no, etc.
- AE _ _ N – “AEIGN” no
- AE G _ N – “AEGN_” – no common word
- AE _ G N – “AEIGN” – none
- AE N G _ – “AENGI” – none

Actually, a valid dictionary word is “AEGIS” but as we saw it contains banned S.

Another candidate: “AEGIR” – has R (banned).

Next possible candidate: “AEGIP” – uses P, which is allowed. Let’s list the possibilities systematically.

We need a 5-letter word starting AE, containing both G and N somewhere, and one more letter not banned.

Possible patterns:
1. A E G _ N
2. A E N _ G
3. A E _ G N
4. A E _ N G
5. A E G N _
6. A E N G _

We need to fill the blank with a letter not yet banned.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s look up common words for these patterns.

A E G _ N:
- AEGAN – not valid
- AEGEN – not valid
- … none

A E N _ G:
- AENIG – not a word
- AENAG – none
- AENUG – none

A E _ G N:
- AEBGN – none
- AECGN – none
- AEFGN – none
- AELGN – none
- AEMGN – none
- AEPGN – none
- AIEGN – none
- AUEGN – none

A E _ N G:
- AEBNG – none
- AECNG – none
- AEFNG – none
- AELNG – none
- AEMNG – none
- AEPNG – none
- AIENG – none
- AUENG – none

A E G N _:
- AEGNI – not a word
- AEGNB – none
- AEGNF – none
- AEGNL – none
- AEGNM – none
- AEGNP – none
- AEGNU – none
- AEGNY – none

A E N G _:
- AENGI – none
- AENGB – none
- AENGC – none
- AENGF – none
- AENGL – AENGL doesn’t exist
- etc.

This exhaustive scan shows that the only common English word that fits all constraints is “AEGIS”, but it contains the banned letter S.

Let me double-check: perhaps I mis-assumed the positions.

We know:
- A is fixed at 1.
- E must be at 2 (deduced from feedback).
- We must use G and N somewhere in positions 3,4,5.
- Position 4 cannot be N (from AGENT feedback: N(-) means N not at 4).
- G cannot be at 2 (from AGENT feedback: G(-) at 2 means G is in word but not at 2).

Therefore, the three remaining slots (3,4,5) must contain G, N, and one additional letter X (not banned), with N not at 4 and G not at 2 (which is already satisfied).

Thus possible arrangements:
- AE G N X
- AE G X N
- AE N G X
- AE N X G
- AE X G N
- AE X N G

Let’s list valid English words with these patterns:

AE G N X:
- AEGNB – none
- AEGNI – none
- AEGNU – none
- AEGNY – none

AE G X N:
- AEGAN – not a word
- AEGCN – none
- AEGFN – none
- AEGGN – impossible (G twice)
- AEGIN – AEGIN not a word
- AEGKN – none
- AEGLN – none
- AEGMN – none
- AEGPN – none
- AEGUN – none
- AEGVN – none
- AEGYN – none

AE N G X:
- AENGB – none
- AENGC – none
- AENGF – none
- AENGI – AENGI not a word
- AENGK – none
- AENGL – AEGLN not a word
- AENGM – none
- AENGP – none
- AENGU – none
- AENGV – none
- AENGY – none

AE N X G:
- AENAG – none
- AENBG – none
- AENCG – none
- AENFG – none
- AENIG – none
- AENKG – none
- AENLG – none
- AENMG – none
- AENPG – none
- AENUG – none
- AENVG – none
- AENYG – none

AE X G N:
- AEBGN – none
- AECGN – none
- AEFGN – none
- AELGN – none
- AEMGN – none
- AEPGN – none
- AIEGN – none
- AUEGN – none

AE X N G:
- AEBNG – none
- AECNG – none
- AEFNG – none
- AELNG – none
- AEMNG – none
- AEPNG – none
- AIENG – none
- AUENG – none

None of these yield common English words. This strongly suggests my earlier deduction that E must be at position 2 is correct, but there’s simply no common word starting AE containing both G and N. Therefore, I must revisit the deduction.

Wait, let’s re-examine the AGENT feedback carefully:

Guess 3: AGENT → A(✓) G(-) E(-) N(-) T(x)

- G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 2.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 3 (it was placed at 3 in AGENT).
- N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4.

We already knew from AROSE:
- E is in word but not at 5.

Therefore, E can be at position 2, 3, or 4, but NOT at 3 (from AGENT), NOT at 5 (from AROSE). So E must be at position 2 or 4.

Let’s not jump to position 2 only yet.

Similarly, G must be in the word but not at 2, so possible positions 3,4,5.

N must be in the word but not at 4, so possible positions 2,3,5.

Let’s map possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed: A _ _ _ _
Letters to place: E, G, N plus two more letters from allowed set (B,C,F,I,K,L,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, none of which have been ruled out yet).

We need a 5-letter word A _ _ _ _ containing E, G, N, with constraints:
- E not at 3,5
- G not at 2
- N not at 4

Thus possible positions:

Case 1: E at position 2
Then word is A E _ _ _
We need to place G and N in positions 3,4,5 with
   G not at 2 (already okay, G at 3,4,5 allowed),
   N not at 4.

Thus possible arrangements:
- AE G N X (but N at 4 banned)
- AE G X N
- AE N G X
- AE N X G
- AE X G N
- AE X N G

We saw these produce no common words.

Case 2: E at position 4
Then word is A _ _ E _
We need to place G and N in positions 2,3,5 with
   G not at 2 → so G at 3 or 5,
   N not at 4 (already okay, N at 2,3,5).

Thus possible arrangements:
- A N G E _
- A G N E _
- A N _ E G
- A G _ E N
- A _ N E G
- A _ G E N

Let’s look up common English words matching these patterns.

A N G E _:
- ANGER – yes, ANGER is a common word.

Check constraints:
- Starts with A ✓
- Contains E at 4 ✓
- Contains G at 3 ✓ (G not at 2, so okay)
- Contains N at 2 ✓ (N not at 4, so okay)
- All letters not yet excluded: R is allowed (hasn’t been tested yet).

Therefore, “ANGER” is a valid candidate fitting all feedback.

Let’s try it.Based on the combined feedback, the word must start with A, contain E (not at 3 or 5), contain G (not at 2), and contain N (not at 4). The only common English word fitting all these constraints is “ANGER”.

Therefore, I must revisit the deduction.\n\nWait, let’s re-examine the AGENT feedback carefully:\n\nGuess 3: AGENT → A(✓) G(-) E(-) N(-) T(x)\n\n- G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 3 (it was placed at 3 in AGENT).\n- N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nWe already knew from AROSE:\n- E is in word but not at 5.\n\nTherefore, E can be at position 2, 3, or 4, but NOT at 3 (from AGENT), NOT at 5 (from AROSE). So E must be at position 2 or 4.\n\nLet’s not jump to position 2 only yet.\n\nSimilarly, G must be in the word but not at 2, so possible positions 3,4,5.\n\nN must be in the word but not at 4, so possible positions 2,3,5.\n\nLet’s map possible positions:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5\nFixed: A _ _ _ _\nLetters to place: E, G, N plus two more letters from allowed set (B,C,F,I,K,L,M,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, none of which have been ruled out yet).\n\nWe need a 5-letter word A _ _ _ _ containing E, G, N, with constraints:\n- E not at 3,5\n- G not at 2\n- N not at 4\n\nThus possible positions:\n\nCase 1: E at position 2\nThen word is A E _ _ _\nWe need to place G and N in positions 3,4,5 with\n   G not at 2 (already okay, G at 3,4,5 allowed),\n   N not at 4.\n\nThus possible arrangements:\n- AE G N X (but N at 4 banned)\n- AE G X N\n- AE N G X\n- AE N X G\n- AE X G N\n- AE X N G\n\nWe saw these produce no common words.\n\nCase 2: E at position 4\nThen word is A _ _ E _\nWe need to place G and N in positions 2,3,5 with\n   G not at 2 → so G at 3 or 5,\n   N not at 4 (already okay, N at 2,3,5).\n\nThus possible arrangements:\n- A N G E _\n- A G N E _\n- A N _ E G\n- A G _ E N\n- A _ N E G\n- A _ G E N\n\nLet’s look up common English words matching these patterns.\n\nA N G E _:\n- ANGER – yes, ANGER is a common word.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Starts with A ✓\n- Contains E at 4 ✓\n- Contains G at 3 ✓ (G not at 2, so okay)\n- Contains N at 2 ✓ (N not at 4, so okay)\n- All letters not yet excluded: R is allowed (hasn’t been tested yet).\n\nTherefore, “ANGER” is a valid candidate fitting all feedback.\n\nLet’s try it.Based on the combined feedback, the word must start with A, contain E (not at 3 or 5), contain G (not at 2), and contain N (not at 4).

We now have four letters locked:

A _ _ _ _
A N G E _

with the only remaining unknown at position 5.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, H, D, T  
Letters we have already placed: A, N, G, E  
Therefore the final letter must be one of the still-allowed consonants that has not appeared: B, C, F, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that start with ANGE:

- ANGE**L** – valid, common
- ANGE**R** – R already ruled out
- ANGE**D** – D ruled out
- ANGE**K** – not a word
- etc.

The only everyday word left is “ANGEL.”
