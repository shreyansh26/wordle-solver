For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good mix of letters that appear frequently in English words and should help identify which letters are in the secret word and where they might be positioned.

From the feedback:

- S – not in the word (x)
- L – in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A – in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T – in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E – not in the word (x)

So the secret word contains the letters L, A, and T, but none is in the same place as in SLATE.  
Current positions:  
L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, T is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses L, A, and T at least once (they’re in the word).
2. Places them in positions different from their positions in SLATE.
3. Uses no S or E.
4. Fills the remaining slots with fresh letters to gather more information.

A word that fits is “ALTAR”:
- A is in position 1 (was 3, so okay)
- L is in position 2 (was 2, so this repeats the same position—BAD, discard)
Another candidate: “TABLE” uses E (forbidden).

Better: “PLANT”
- P, N are new letters
- L in position 2 (still same position—BAD)

Next candidate: “FLOAT”
- F and O are new
- L is in position 1 (was 2, okay)

“CRATE” uses E (forbidden).

“TRAIL”
- T in position 1 (was 4, okay)
- R and I are new

This meets all constraints:

Candidate word: “PLANT”
- P, N new letters
- L in position 2 (forbidden) → reject.

Candidate word: “ATOLL”
- uses L twice → reject (L should appear once only).

Candidate word: “LATTE”
- uses E (forbidden) and double T → reject.

Candidate word: “ALTAR”
- L in position 2 (forbidden), uses R (forbidden) → reject.

Candidate word: “TULIP”
- uses I (forbidden) → reject.

Candidate word: “TULPA”
- uses U, P new
- T in 1 (forbidden) → reject.

Candidate word: “LOVAT”
- uses O, V new
- L in 1 (allowed)
- O, V new
- A in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Letters L, A, T each appear once in allowed positions.
- Uses new letters O, V.
- No forbidden letters.

Let me double-check:
L: position 1 (allowed)
O: new
V: new
A: position 4 (allowed)
T: position 5 (allowed)

Perfect.

From the three previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word  
S, E, R, I, O, V  

Letters that **are** in the word  
L, A, T  

Positions fixed so far  
- L is in position 1 (✓)  
- A is NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” in LOVAT)  
- T is NOT in position 5 (it was marked “-” in LOVAT)  

Summary of usable information  
- The word looks like L _ _ _ _  
- A and T must appear exactly once each among positions 2, 3, 4, 5  
- A is **not** in 4  
- T is **not** in 5  

We need two new letters (not S, E, R, I, O, V) to fill the remaining two slots.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowel(s): U (only vowel not yet used or ruled out)  

Possible placements of A and T  

1. A in 2, T in 3  
2. A in 2, T in 4  
3. A in 3, T in 2  
4. A in 3, T in 4  
5. A in 5, T in 2,3,4  

Let’s pick one that makes a valid 5-letter word:

- L A T _ _  → LA?  
- L _ A T _  or  L _ _ A T (invalid because T can’t be 5)  

Quick scan of the dictionary:

Choose L A T _ _ with the two new letters.  
Need two consonants from the “good” set.  
A safe choice is C and H → LATCH (a valid word).  
Letters used: L, A, T, C, H – all allowed and no repeats.

Therefore, the next guess is LATCH.
