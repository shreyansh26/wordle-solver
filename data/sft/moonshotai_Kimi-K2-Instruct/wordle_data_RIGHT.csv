For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular starting words are ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R: common consonants
- A, E: common vowels
- N: a frequently used letter
This provides good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal information about several letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R but NOT in 2nd position.
2. It does NOT contain C, A, N, E.

We need a 5-letter word with R, no C/A/N/E, and R not in 2nd spot. Let's try to include other common letters like S, T, L, I, O, U...

Possible candidates: ""TRUST"" (but has T in 2nd position which might conflict with R needing to move), ""STORy"" (but has E), ""BROIL"" (but has O and I), ""FROST"" (has F,O,S,T)

Looking at ""FROST"":
- F: common
- R: known to be in word
- O: common vowel
- S: common
- T: common
And importantly, R is in 3rd position (not 2nd), satisfying the feedback.

Also, none of C/A/N/E are present. This seems like a good exploratory guess.

From the combined feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

2. FROST → F(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) T(✓)  
   – T is correct in position 5.  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – F, O, S are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in word: R and T (positions fixed for T at 5).  
- Letters excluded: C, A, N, E, F, O, S.  
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

- Ends with T (position 5).  
- Contains R in one of positions 1, 2, or 4.

Possible consonants still allowed: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: I, U, Y (A,E,O excluded).

Let’s summarize the feedback so far.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is present but not in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are absent.

2. FROST → F(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) T(✓)
   - T is correct in position 5.
   - R is still present but not in position 3.
   - F, O, S are absent.

3. DIRTY → D(x) I(✓) R(-) T(-) Y(x)
   - I is correct in position 2.
   - R is still present but not in position 4.
   - D, Y are absent.
   - T appears in the word but is not in position 4 (already known to be in position 5).

So we now know:
- Word is _ I _ _ T with:
  - R somewhere in the remaining open positions 1 or 3 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 4 from feedback).
  - Letters already excluded: C, A, N, E, F, O, S, D, Y.

Open letters allowed: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus R and I already used.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits the pattern:
- Position 1 or 3 must be R (since R must be present and positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed or excluded for R).
- Positions: 1 (must be R or another allowed consonant), 2 (I, fixed), 3 (must be R or another allowed consonant), 4 (allowed consonant), 5 (T, fixed).

Possible patterns:
- R I _ _ T → R I ? ? T
- _ I R _ T → ? I R ? T

Looking at valid English words:

1. R I _ _ T:
   - R I V E T → but E is excluded.
   - R I P E T → invalid.
   - R I G I T → invalid.
   - R I G O T → O excluded.
   - R I G H T → Right: R I G H T. Check letters: R, I, G, H, T. None of the excluded letters appear. G and H are allowed. This seems valid.

2. _ I R _ T:
   - B I R C H → C excluded.
   - P I R A T → A excluded.
   - V I R U T → invalid.
   - L I R T S → invalid.
   - M I R T H → M I R T H: M, I, R, T, H. T is already fixed at 5, so this would be M I R T H, but T is at 5 and word would be M I R T H which is 5 letters with T at 5, but R is at 3. However, ""MIRTH"" is a valid word. But let's see if it's better than RIGHT.

Between ""RIGHT"" and ""MIRTH"":
- RIGHT: R I G H T. R at 1, I at 2, G, H at 3,4, T at 5. All letters allowed.
- MIRTH: M I R T H. R at 3, I at 2, M at 1, T at 4 (but T must be at 5), so this doesn’t fit the pattern (_ I R _ T implies T at 5, so MIRTH would be M I R T H, T at 4 which is invalid). So MIRTH is invalid.

So the only valid candidate from common words is RIGHT.

Check RIGHT against all constraints:
- Positions: R(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5).
- R is in the word (position 1), not in positions 2,3,4 → satisfies R(-) feedback.
- I is correct in position 2 → matches DIRTY feedback.
- T is correct in position 5 → matches FROST feedback.
- No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, RIGHT is the logical next guess.
