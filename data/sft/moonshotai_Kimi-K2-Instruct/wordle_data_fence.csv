Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use a word that contains frequently used letters in English, ideally with no letter repetitions. 

A good starting word might be something like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" or ""AUDIO"". These words contain very common letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has S, L, A, T, E - all of which are among the most common letters in English.

From the first guess we know:

- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the target word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.

Popular remaining consonants are R, N, C, H, D, P, B, M, K, F, G, Y, V, W, X, Z, Q, J (avoiding S, L, T).

Popular vowels still in play: I, O, U (E is already used and A is out).

I want a word that uses as many distinct, common remaining letters as possible, ends with E, and does not repeat E elsewhere. Possible choices: ""PRONE"", ""BRIDE"", ""CRIME"", ""DRIVE"", ""GRIPE"", ""HOUSE"", ""JUICE"", ""MOUSE"", ""PRIDE"", ""QUITE"", ""WRITE"", ""VIRGE"", etc.

I'll pick ""HOUSE"" because H, O, U, S, E are all very common letters and only E was confirmed; S is already ruled out, so this is actually bad since it contains S. Let me choose something without S.

Let me try ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E. None of S, L, A, T appear and it ends with E. This seems good.

So far we know:

- The word ends with E (position 5 has ✓).

That leaves these remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
And remaining vowels: O, U (E is already used in position 5, A and I are ruled out).

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Uses none of the ruled-out letters.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

Good common 5-letter endings with E we can try:
- _ O N E → CONE, GONE, HONE, NONE, ZONE
- _ U M E → CUME, FUME, HUME, MUME (most are uncommon)
- _ O U E → (none valid)
- _ O V E → COVE, HOVE, LOVE (L is out), MOVE, NOVE (none valid), WOVE
- _ O N E → CONE, GONE

- H O N E _ – but needs to end in E, so H O N E ? No, 5 letters, last must be E.
- C O M E _ – no, last must be E.
- M O N E Y – ends in Y, not E.
- C H O K E – uses C, H, O, K, E.
- B O N E _ – no, must be 5 letters ending E.

Between CHOKE, CHONE, COMBE, GOUGE, etc., COMBE seems less common, CHOKE and CHONE are both good. CHOKE uses more diverse consonants (C, H, K), so I'll go with CHOKE.

From the latest feedback:

- Position 5 is E (✓).
- C is present somewhere, but NOT in position 1 (-).
- H, O, K are NOT in the word at all (x).
- Letters already ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, P, R, I, D, H, O, K.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z (plus E already used in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with C somewhere in positions 2-4 (since position 1 is ruled out for C), and using only the allowed letters.

Let me list possible patterns:

_ _ _ _ E
with C in slot 2, 3, or 4.

Candidate letters left: B, C, F, G, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for valid words:

- C in position 2: e.g., N C ? ? E, F C ? ? E, etc. – but few common words fit.
- C in position 3: e.g., ? ? C ? E.
- C in position 4: e.g., ? ? ? C E – but that would place C in 4th, but we need a 5-letter word ending in E, so 4th letter C, 5th E. Example: B U N C E – ""BUNCE"" isn't valid.
- C in position 3: e.g., B U C K E – but K is out.
- C in position 3: M U C H E – no, H is out.
- C in position 3: F U N C E – ""FUNCE"" isn't valid.
- C in position 3: G U N C E – no.
- C in position 2: N I C E – but I is out.
- C in position 2: F A C E – A is out.
- C in position 2: B O N C E – but O is out.
- C in position 2: M I N C E – I is out.
- C in position 2: W I N C E – I is out.
- C in position 2: B U C C E – no.
- C in position 3: M U C H E – H is out.
- C in position 3: G U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: B U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: V I N C E – I is out.
- C in position 3: F U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: M U N C E – ""MUNCE"" isn't valid.
- C in position 3: N U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: B U C K E – K is out.
- C in position 3: F U C H E – H is out.
- C in position 3: G U C H E – H is out.
- C in position 3: Y U C C E – no.

Hmm, struggling to find valid words with C in 2-4 and the remaining letters. Maybe I'm missing some.

Let me think differently: what common 5-letter words end in E, contain C not in first position, and use none of S,L,A,T,P,R,I,D,H,O,K?

Possible words:
- C in position 2: N I C E – I is out.
- C in position 3: M U C H E – H is out.
- C in position 3: F U N C E – not valid.
- C in position 3: B U N C E – not valid.
- C in position 3: G U N C E – not valid.
- C in position 2: N E C K E – K is out.
- C in position 3: G U I D E – I, D out.
- C in position 3: V I N C E – I is out.
- C in position 3: B U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: F U N C E – no.
- C in position 3: Y U C C E – no.

Wait, ""JUICE"" – but I is out.
""OUNCE"" – O is out.
""FORCE"" – O is out.
""VOICE"" – I, O out.
""WINCE"" – I is out.
""MINCE"" – I is out.
""BUNCE"" – not a word.
""YINCE"" – no.
""FENCE"" – F, E, N, C, E – valid word.
But C must be in 2-4, and in FENCE, C is in 4th position. Also, F, E, N are allowed.

Let's check FENCE:
- F: allowed
- E: position 5, already ✓
- N: allowed
- C: position 4, allowed (not in position 1)
- E: already in 5

No ruled-out letters are used.

Another option: ""MINCE"" – but I is out.
""NIECE"" – I is out.
""JUICE"" – I, U, but I is out, J is allowed but I is out.
""BUNCE"" – not a word.
""LANCE"" – L is out.
""GONCE"" – no.
""YONCE"" – no.

""FENCE"" seems to be the only valid candidate here that fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is FENCE.
