For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels (especially A, E) and common consonants (like R, T, N, S, L). 

Some top-tier starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- RAISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel overall)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English while being a valid 5-letter word.

We know:
- C is correct in position 1.
- N is correct in position 4.
- E is correct in position 5.
- R and A are NOT in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
C _ _ N E

Letters already eliminated: R, A

Possible 2nd and 3rd letters must avoid R and A and ideally use common remaining consonants (S, T, L, D, M, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).

Common patterns that fit C _ _ N E:
- C O I N E  (but COINE isn’t a valid word)
- C H I N E  (CHINE – British variant spelling of “chine”; exists)
- C H O N E  (CHONE – not standard)
- C L O N E  (CLONE – valid word, uses L, O)
- C L I N E  (CLINE – valid biological term)
- C H I N E  (CHINE – less common)
- C L O N E  (CLONE – common word)

“CLONE” covers two new common letters (L and O) and is a standard English word.
