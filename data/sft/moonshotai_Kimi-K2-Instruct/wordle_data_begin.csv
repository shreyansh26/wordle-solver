Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Popular choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

Among these, SLATE covers S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage of consonants and vowels. This seems like a strong first guess to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let’s consolidate the information we have so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, O, U, C  
Letters that are in the word:  
- E (position unknown, but not 5th)  
- N (position unknown, but not 4th)  

So the mystery word contains both E and N, and does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, O, U, C.  
The vowels left to test are only I and (possibly) Y.  
Consonants left to test: R, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc. (excluding the banned letters).

We still have 5 positions. We know:
- E must appear in one of positions 1-4 (not 5).  
- N must appear in some position other than 4.  

A good third guess should:
1. Place E and N in new positions.
2. Introduce several fresh, still-possible consonants.
3. Avoid every banned letter.

Candidate letters: E, N, I, R, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W…  
Let’s try an R-heavy word that also uses I and a couple other consonants: RINER (but R and E are already in E’s mystery spot), FINED (but D is fine), GRIPE (but P is fine), etc.

A balanced choice is “GRIPE”:
- G, R, I, P, E  
- Includes E in position 5 (which we know is wrong, but we’ll still get info on G, R, I, P).  
But we want E in positions 1-4.  
So let’s rearrange: “PRIDE” has E in position 5 again (bad).  
“INFER” has E in position 4 (good) and N in position 2.  
Letters: I, N, F, E, R – none of the banned letters are used.

So a good guess is “INFER”.

Let's list what we know after three guesses.

Letters **not** in the word:  
S, L, A, T, O, U, C, F, R  

Letters that **are** in the word and their current positional constraints (from the “-” feedback):

- E: not in position 5 (from guess 1) and not in position 4 (from guess 3).  
- N: not in position 2 (from guess 2) and not in position 3 (from guess 3).  
- I: appears in the word (from guess 3), but not in position 1.

So the three letters we know must appear are E, N, I.

Positions ruled out:

E: positions 4 and 5  
N: positions 2 and 3  
I: position 1  

Remaining possible positions:

E: 1, 2, 3  
N: 1, 4, 5  
I: 2, 3, 4, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I exactly once each.  
- Uses none of the banned letters (S, L, A, T, O, U, C, F, R).  
- Respects the positional bans above.

Remaining candidate consonants/letters: D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that puts the known letters in still-allowed positions and fills the remaining slots with fresh, allowable letters.

One candidate:  
- Position 1: D, G, H, M, K, P, V, W, Y, B…  
- Position 2: E is possible here (since E not banned from 2).  
- Position 3: I is allowed here (I not banned from 3).  
- Position 4: N is allowed here (N not banned from 4).  
- Position 5: any remaining allowable letter.

Example word: D E I N ?  
We need a fifth letter, not already used, not banned.  
Let’s pick G: DEING – but “DEING” is not an English word.  
Try H: DEINH – not a word.  
Try K: DEINK – not a word.  
Try M: DEINM – not a word.  
Try switching positions: maybe N in 5, E in 3, I in 2:  
I E _ _ N – need two consonants not banned.  
I E D _ N – “IEDNN” – no.  
Real words are needed.

Another arrangement:  
E in 1, N in 4, I in 3:  
E _ I N _  
Need a consonant for positions 2 and 5, not banned.  
E B I N D – “EBIND” – not a word.  
E G I N D – “EGIND” – not a word.  
E M I N G – “EMING” – not a word.  
E H I N G – “EHING” – not a word.  

Let’s reverse engineer by listing real 5-letter words that contain E, N, I and none of the banned letters.

Candidate real words:  
BEGIN – but G, E, I, N – contains B, E, G, I, N.  
Check letters: B, E, G, I, N – none of the banned letters (S,L,A,T,O,U,C,F,R).  
Position check:  
B(1) – allowed.  
E(2) – allowed (E not banned from 2).  
G(3) – allowed.  
I(4) – allowed (I not banned from 4).  
N(5) – allowed (N not banned from 5).  

“BEGIN” meets all constraints and uses only the allowed letters.

So let’s guess BEGIN.

E G I N D – “EGIND” – not a word.  
E M I N G – “EMING” – not a word.  
E H I N G – “EHING” – not a word.

B(1) – allowed.  
E(2) – allowed (E not banned from 2).  
G(3) – allowed.  
I(4) – allowed (I not banned from 4).  
N(5) – allowed (N not banned from 5).  

“BEGIN” meets all constraints and uses only the allowed letters.
