As this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A, O: common vowels
- R, S: common consonants
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination allows me to test five distinct letters efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- A, O, and S are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R _ _ E

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S.

Next, we want to pick a word that:
1. Keeps R in the 2nd position and E in the 5th position.
2. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
3. Uses new common consonants and vowels (like T, L, N, I, U) to test more letters.

A good candidate that meets these criteria is ""TRIBE"":
- T is a common consonant we haven’t tested yet.
- R stays in the 2nd position.
- I is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.
- B is a consonant we haven’t tested yet.
- E stays in the 5th position.
- No A, O, or S are used.

We now know:

- Positional certainties:
  2nd letter = R  
  3rd letter = I  
  4th letter = B  
  5th letter = E  

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, T.

- Still unknown: only the 1st letter.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the form _ R I B E.
2. Uses a first letter that has not been ruled out (i.e., not A, O, S, T).
3. Uses no other letters already ruled out.

Looking at the pattern _ R I B E, the only 5-letter word that fits is “CRIBE” (but that’s not a valid English word) or “TRIBE” (already tried). The correct English word is actually “TRIBE,” but we’ve already used it and know T is disallowed.

Wait—let’s list valid English words matching _ R I B E:

- BRIBE – fits and starts with B (B has not been ruled out yet).
- CRIBE – not a standard word.
- FRIBE – not a word.
- GRIBE – obsolete/archaic, unlikely.

So the only standard English word left is “BRIBE.”

Check constraints:
- B is allowed (only in 4th position certainty, not disallowed elsewhere).
- R, I, B, E are already confirmed in their positions.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, “BRIBE” satisfies all conditions.
