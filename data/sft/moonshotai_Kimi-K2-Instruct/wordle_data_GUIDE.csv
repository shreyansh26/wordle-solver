For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to choose a word with frequently used letters that can cover many possibilities. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Have a mix of vowels and consonants

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (uses C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good coverage.

From the feedback so far:
- Position 5 is definitely E (✓ from all guesses)
- Position 3 is definitely I (✓ from guesses 2 and 3)
- Letters ruled out by now: 
  From SLATE: S, L, A, T
  From CRIME: C, R, M
  From WHINE: W, H, N
- So the pattern is: _ _ I _ E
- Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O and U (since A is out)

We need two more letters for positions 1, 2 and 4 (but position 4 is already determined by position 3, so actually positions 1,2,4 with 4 being whatever fits).

Looking for 5-letter words ending in E with I in position 3. Some possibilities:
- _ _ I _ E
Let's think systematically:

Possible combinations:
- B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z for positions 1,2,4
But position 4 can't be any of the ruled out letters either.

Looking at common letters, let's try:
- P, B, D, F, G, K are good remaining common consonants
- O and U are remaining vowels

Possible words:
- BOGIE (B, O, G - but G is ok)
- DOGIE (D, O, G)
- FOGIE (F, O, G)
- BOGIE is a word (means a railway car or golf term)

Check if any letters in BOGIE are ruled out:
B - not ruled out
O - not ruled out
G - not ruled out
I - confirmed
E - confirmed

BOGIE fits the pattern _ _ I _ E perfectly with fresh letters.

Alternative could be:
- DIXIE (but X is less common)
- PIXIE (P, I, X - but X is less common)
- BIKIE (but K is ok, but this is slang)

BOGIE seems the best choice here.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Secret Word: BRISK

A common strategy is to choose a word with frequently used letters that can cover many possibilities. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Have a mix of vowels and consonants

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (uses C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and provides good coverage.

So we now know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. Letters S, L, A, T are excluded.
3. We still have 19 other letters that could appear.

Looking for a word that:
- Ends in E
- Does not contain S, L, A, T
- Uses new common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, P, F, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A is out and E is already placed)

Some good candidate words:
- CRONE (but C and R are good, O and N also)
- PRIME (but P, R, I, M are good)
- CHIME (C, H, I, M)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V)

I'll choose ""CRIME"" because:
- Ends with E (✓)
- Uses C, R, I, M - none of which have been tested yet
- Uses common letters
- Vowel/consonant mix

We need two new consonants and one vowel (or consonant) for positions 1, 2 and 4.  
Remaining common letters to test: N, D, G, B, K, P, F, V, W, Y, H, Q, U, O, etc.

Current deductions:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E  (I is in position 3, E is in position 5)
- Letters definitely out: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, W, H, N, B, O
  (because BOGIE gave “B(x) O(x) G(-) I(-) E(✓)”)
- The G and the I in BOGIE both got “-”, meaning:
  – G is in the word but NOT in position 4.
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 … but we already know it **is** in position 3 (from CRIME & WHINE).  
    Therefore the feedback must have been mis-read: the “I(-)” simply repeats what we already knew (I somewhere), while the “G(-)” tells us G is in the word but not in position 4.

So:
- G is present but NOT at position 4.
- Still need two letters for positions 1 and 2.
- Additional letters now ruled out: B, O

Remaining common unused letters: D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z plus vowel U.

We need a word of the form _ _ I _ E, with G somewhere but NOT in position 4.

Let’s place G in position 1 or 2 and pick the other letter from the still-allowed set.

Candidate set:
G _ I _ E  or  _ G I _ E

Possible words:
- GUIDE – G, U, I, D, E
- GRIPE – R is out
- GLIDE – L is out
- GIGUE – repeats G (but G is allowed once)
- DINGE – N is out
- PIGGE – repeats G
- VIGUE – V, U

GUIDE fits: G _ I _ E, uses G, U, D, all still allowed, and places G in position 1 (so position 4 remains free of G, satisfying the “-” feedback on G).

Summary checks:
- GUIDE: G(1), U(2), I(3), D(4), E(5)
- G not in position 4 (ok)
- Letters G, U, D not yet ruled out

<guess>GUIDE</guess>",GUIDE,"Current deductions:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E  (I is in position 3, E is in position 5)
- Letters definitely out: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, W, H, N, B, O
  (because BOGIE gave “B(x) O(x) G(-) I(-) E(✓)”)
- The G and the I in BOGIE both got “-”, meaning:
  – G is in the word but NOT in position 4.
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 … but we already know it **is** in position 3 (from CRIME & WHINE).  
    Therefore the feedback must have been mis-read: the “I(-)” simply repeats what we already knew (I somewhere), while the “G(-)” tells us G is in the word but not in position 4.

So:
- G is present but NOT at position 4.
- Still need two letters for positions 1 and 2.
- Additional letters now ruled out: B, O

Remaining common unused letters: D, F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z plus vowel U.
