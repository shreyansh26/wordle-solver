For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters that appear frequently in English words. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Popular opening words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- LATER (L, A, T, E, R)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It contains the very common letters C, R, A, N, E
2. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (C, R, N) - good balance
3. C and R are high-frequency consonants
4. A and E are the two most common vowels
5. N is also very common in English

This gives us the best chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) that will narrow down future possibilities significantly.

From CRANE we learned:
- A is in position 3 (✓).  
- N is somewhere in the word (✓) but not in position 4.  
- C, R, E are completely absent.

So the pattern is: _ _ A N _ or _ _ A _ N or _ A N _ _ or _ _ _ A N, etc., as long as N isn’t in position 4.

I want to keep the known letters A (fixed at 3) and N, and introduce new common consonants and vowels while respecting the exclusions (no C, R, E).  

A good second-guess strategy is to use as many fresh letters as possible. Let’s pick:
- S, T, I, D, or L for consonants.  
- O, U for vowels.

A word that fits this nicely is “STAND”:
- S: new letter.  
- T: new letter.  
- A: locked in position 3.  
- N: somewhere in the word (positions 1,2,5 allowed).  
- D: new letter.

It also obeys the constraints: no C, R, E and N is not in position 4.
