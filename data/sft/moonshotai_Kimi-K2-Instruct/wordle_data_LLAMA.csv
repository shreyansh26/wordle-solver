For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains all five vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels and common consonants are in the word.

- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.

We also know the word does **not** contain R, O, S, or E.

To maximize information, we should test new common consonants and perhaps check the vowel A in a new position. A strong follow-up guess is “TAINT” because:
- It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess).
- It introduces T, I, and N, which are all very common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids every letter already ruled out (R, O, S, E).

From both guesses we now know:

Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, T, I, N  
Known letter: A (present but not in positions 1 or 2)  
Still-untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Since A must be in position 3, 4, or 5, a good strategy is to put it in position 3 (middle) and surround it with high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried yet.

Picking from the top untested consonants (C, L, B, M, P, D, H, K, G …), I’ll form a word that keeps A in the middle and tries two fresh consonants on each side, e.g., C_L_A_M_P → “CLAMP” uses C, L, M, P, none of which have been ruled out.

Check:  
- Letters used: C, L, A, M, P (all new or confirmed ok)  
- A is in position 3, satisfying the “present but not in 1 or 2” requirement  
- No forbidden letters appear

Therefore “CLAMP” is a safe, informative next guess.

Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains all five vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels and common consonants are in the word.

- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).

- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

Letters remaining to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A again, but now we know it’s somewhere other than position 1).

We also know the word does **not** contain R, O, S, or E.

To maximize information, we should test new common consonants and perhaps check the vowel A in a new position. A strong follow-up guess is “TAINT” because:
- It places A in position 2 (different from the first guess).
- It introduces T, I, and N, which are all very common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids every letter already ruled out (R, O, S, E).

So “TAINT” should give us useful clues about these new letters and the location of A.

Still-untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Since A must be in position 3, 4, or 5, a good strategy is to put it in position 3 (middle) and surround it with high-frequency consonants we haven’t tried yet.

Picking from the top untested consonants (C, L, B, M, P, D, H, K, G …), I’ll form a word that keeps A in the middle and tries two fresh consonants on each side, e.g., C_L_A_M_P → “CLAMP” uses C, L, M, P, none of which have been ruled out.

Check:  
- Letters used: C, L, A, M, P (all new or confirmed ok)  
- A is in position 3, satisfying the “present but not in 1 or 2” requirement

So far we know the word must be:

Letters ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, F, Y  
Letters still allowed and untested for position 1: B, D, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z  
Letters still allowed and untested for position 5: same list

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form X L A M X with X from the allowed letters.  
The only common English words that fit this pattern:

- BLAME → uses E (already ruled out)  
- GLAM? → needs a 5th letter; “GLAM” is only 4 letters  
- SLAM? → S is ruled out  
- ULAMA → 5 letters, but first letter is U, last is A (A already used in 3rd position, but “ULAMA” is a valid English word)  
- BLAMS → plural of “blam,” an informal word; valid in Scrabble etc.  

Among these, “ULAMA” is the only valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints. Let’s confirm:

- U and A: A is already in the word (position 3), but A can still appear elsewhere (no restriction on duplicates).  
- However, in traditional Wordle rules, letters do not repeat unless explicitly confirmed. Since we haven’t seen any duplicate hints, we should avoid repeats unless forced.  

Next option: “BLAMS” – valid 5-letter word, uses B (allowed) and S (but S is ruled out).  

Re-examining the ruled-out list: S was ruled out by AROSE feedback (S was marked x).  

Thus, “BLAMS” is invalid (S is out).  

Next: “GLAM” is 4 letters.  

“ULAMA” is the only valid 5-letter word left: U, L, A, M, A. But A repeats.  

Wait – another common word: “CLAM” variants all ruled out.  

Actually, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in LAM?  

None common in English except “ULAMA” (variant of ULEMA).  

But “ULAMA” uses A twice – acceptable in Wordle unless duplicate feedback contradicts.  

Thus, the only reasonable guess left is “ULAMA,” but we should verify:

- U: untested  
- L, A, M: confirmed correct positions  
- A: already in word; no rule against reuse  

However, “ULAMA” is quite obscure.  

Re-evaluate: maybe I missed a word.  

Alternative: “GLAM” is 4 letters.  

Realization: English has no common 5-letter word _LAM_ except “ULAMA.”  

Thus, “ULAMA” is the only possible guess left fitting the constraints.  

But let’s double-check the ruled-out letters to ensure no oversight:

Ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, F, Y  

Letters left for positions 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z  

Valid words:  
- BLAME (E out)  
- BLAMS (S out)  
- ULAMA (valid)  

Thus, “ULAMA” is the only candidate.  

But in standard Wordle solution lists, “ULAMA” is indeed accepted.  

Therefore, the next guess is ULAMA.

- GLAM? → needs a 5th letter; “GLAM” is only 4 letters  
- SLAM? → S is ruled out  
- ULAMA → 5 letters, but first letter is U, last is A (A already used in 3rd position, but “ULAMA” is a valid English word)  
- BLAMS → plural of “blam,” an informal word; valid in Scrabble etc.  

Among these, “ULAMA” is the only valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints. Let’s confirm:

- U and A: A is already in the word (position 3), but A can still appear elsewhere (no restriction on duplicates).  
- However, in traditional Wordle rules, letters do not repeat unless explicitly confirmed. Since we haven’t seen any duplicate hints, we should avoid repeats unless forced.  

Next option: “BLAMS” – valid 5-letter word, uses B (allowed) and S (but S is ruled out).  

Re-examining the ruled-out list: S was ruled out by AROSE feedback (S was marked x).  

Thus, “BLAMS” is invalid (S is out).  

Next: “GLAM” is 4 letters.  

“ULAMA” is the only valid 5-letter word left: U, L, A, M, A. But A repeats.  

Wait – another common word: “CLAM” variants all ruled out.  

Actually, let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in LAM?  

None common in English except “ULAMA” (variant of ULEMA).  

But “ULAMA” uses A twice – acceptable in Wordle unless duplicate feedback contradicts.  

Thus, the only reasonable guess left is “ULAMA,” but we should verify:

- U: untested  
- L, A, M: confirmed correct positions  
- A: already in word; no rule against reuse  

However, “ULAMA” is quite obscure.  

Re-evaluate: maybe I missed a word.  

Alternative: “GLAM” is 4 letters.  

Realization: English has no common 5-letter word _LAM_ except “ULAMA.”  

Thus, “ULAMA” is the only possible guess left fitting the constraints.  

But let’s double-check the ruled-out letters to ensure no oversight:

Ruled out: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, C, P, F, Y  

Letters left for positions 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z  

Valid words:  
- BLAME (E out)  
- BLAMS (S out)  
- ULAMA (valid)  

Thus, “ULAMA” is the only candidate.  

But in standard Wordle solution lists, “ULAMA” is indeed accepted.  

Therefore, the next guess is ULAMA.
