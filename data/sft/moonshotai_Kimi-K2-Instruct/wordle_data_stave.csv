My first guess in Wordle is strategic. I want a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to cover more ground
3. Includes vowels and consonants
4. Is statistically good at narrowing down possibilities

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"", I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- S is very common as first letter
- L and T are high-frequency consonants
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- All letters are distinct
- It has good entropy for elimination

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (✓) – correct and in the right spot (1st letter is S)
- A (✓) – correct and in the right spot (3rd letter is A)
- E (✓) – correct and in the right spot (5th letter is E)
- T (-) – exists but in the wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 4)
- L (x) – does not appear anywhere in the word

So the pattern so far:
S A _ _ E  
with T somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd spot, but 3rd is already A, so T must be 2nd or 4th.

Possible patterns:
- S T A _ E

Valid 5-letter words that fit:
- STARE (pattern S T A R E) – all letters allowed (no L)
- STATE – but repeats T, unlikely; also second T would be at 4th, but first T at 2nd is already placed
- SATED – but second letter A, third letter T; fits S A T E D but E already 5th, so S A T E D has E twice, invalid
- SPACE – S P A C E (T not used, so invalid for T being in word)
- SAUCE – same issue, T not used

STARE fits perfectly:
- S (1st) ✓
- T (2nd) – T needs to be somewhere, this could be it

- All letters are distinct

- T (-) – exists but in the wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 4)

So the pattern so far:
S A _ _ E  
with T somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd spot, but 3rd is already A, so T must be 2nd or 4th.

Possible patterns:
- S T A _ E
- S A T _ E
- S A _ T E

Valid 5-letter words that fit:
- STARE (pattern S T A R E) – all letters allowed (no L)
- STATE – but repeats T, unlikely; also second T would be at 4th, but first T at 2nd is already placed
- SATED – but second letter A, third letter T; fits S A T E D but E already 5th, so S A T E D has E twice, invalid

- STAYE – invalid  

“STAGE” is a perfectly common English word and fits every constraint:
- S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G _ E(✓)  
- G has never been used or ruled out.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We have the fixed pattern `S T A _ E` and we have eliminated the letters L, R, K, G from the fourth position.
Valid consonants still allowed for the 4th spot: B, C, D, F, H, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.
Common English words that fit:

- STADE (obscure)
- STAVE
- STANE
- STYPE (invalid)
- STIME (invalid)
- STONE
- STOPE (invalid)
- STOVE (invalid)

Among these, “STAVE”, “STANE”, and “STONE” are the clearest real words.
“STAVE” is plausible, but “STONE” is a very frequent word and uses N, which we have not tested yet.  
So trying STONE next.
