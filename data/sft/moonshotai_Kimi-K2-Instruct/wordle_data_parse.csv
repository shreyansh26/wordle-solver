For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Popular starting words often include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common letter frequencies, the word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) that appear frequently in English words.
- It has the common consonants R and S.
- It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z etc.
- It covers every vowel except U, and includes S which is very common.

This will help us quickly identify which vowels are present and their positions, plus give us information about R and S.

From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – the letter R is in the word but not in the first position.  
A(✓) – the letter A is correctly in position 2.  
I(x) – the letter I is not in the word at all.  
S(✓) – the letter S is correctly in position 4.  
E(✓) – the letter E is correctly in position 5.

So the pattern we now have is:
_ A _ S E

Known letters: A, S, E are locked in their positions.  
Known present letters: R is somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3).  
Known absent letters: I is definitely not in the word.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- matches the pattern _ A _ S E
- contains the letter R somewhere among the blanks (positions 1 or 3)
- does not contain the letter I

Let’s list possibilities:

1. Position 1 is R: R A _ S E  
   The missing letter (position 3) has to be a consonant that isn’t I.  
   Common consonants to try: C, D, L, M, N, P, T, etc.  
   Candidate words:  
   - R A C S E – RACSE? Not a valid English word.  
   - R A D S E – RADSE? Not valid.  
   - R A L S E – RALSE? Not valid.  
   - R A N S E – RANSE? Not valid.  
   - R A P S E – RAPSE? Not valid.  
   - R A T S E – RATSE? Not valid.

2. Position 3 is R: _ A R S E  
   Candidate words:  
   - P A R S E – PARSE (valid word).  
   - C A R S E – CARSE (valid but less common; ""carse"" is a Scottish term for low fertile land).  
   - M A R S E – MARSE is archaic for ""marsh"" but still a word.  
   - F A R S E – FARSE is not a standard word.  
   - D A R S E – DARSE is not standard.

Among these, PARSE is the clearest valid word. It fits all the constraints:
- Matches _ A _ S E when R is inserted at position 3 (P A R S E).
- Contains R, which must be present.
- Does not contain I.
- Is a common English word.

Therefore, PARSE is the best second guess.
