For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in English. This helps me gather information about which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that are among the most frequent. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are good starting points because they contain high-frequency letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes A, R, O, S, E - covering several of the top common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know the word is in the form: _ R _ _ _ and it contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 1.  It does NOT contain O, S, E.

Next, I want to introduce new common letters.  The remaining high-frequency letters I haven’t used yet include T, I, N, L, C, U, M, etc.  

A good candidate would use those plus keep the R in position 2 and test new letter positions for A.

I’ll try “TRAIN”.  
- T is new.
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A is in position 3 (a new spot for it).
- I is new.
- N is new.

This gives us five new letters to test while keeping R fixed.

Current certainties:
- Word form: _ R A M _
- R is locked in position 2
- A is locked in position 3
- M is locked in position 4
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, D

So far we have: ? R A M ?

Letters left to test (common ones): B, C, F, G, K, L, P, U, Y, H, W

No repeats are allowed for the remaining position unless the letter is already known to appear twice (but only A has shown twice and position 5 can’t take A because the second A in DRAMA was marked “-”, i.e., letter exists but is not in position 5).

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits “_ R A M _” and uses new letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Some candidates:
- CRAMP (C, P) – C and P are both fresh
- GRAMP (G, P) – G and P are fresh
- BRAVO – invalid, contains B and V but V hasn’t been tested and O is excluded
- FRAME – F, E – E is excluded
- CRANE – C, N – N excluded
- CRUMB – B, U – fresh

“CRAMP” uses two completely untested letters (C, P) and has the right pattern.

Let’s try CRAMP.
