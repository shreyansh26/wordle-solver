For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me useful information about common letters in English 5-letter words. 

A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination covers several high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, giving us good coverage and likely feedback to narrow down subsequent guesses.

From both guesses we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, D, F, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and A (each in the wrong place so far)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2 (from guess 1) and R ≠ 2 (from guess 2) – so R cannot be in position 2.
- A ≠ 3 (from guess 1) and A ≠ 3 (from guess 2) – so A cannot be in position 3.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both R and A.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: i.e., no C, N, E, D, F, T.
5. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include B, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, Y.

A good candidate that satisfies everything is “MARRY”:
- Contains R (positions 3 and 4) and A (position 2).
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters: M, A, R, Y.

However, double letters in the same word can sometimes obscure information, so let’s try a variant without double letters: “HARPY”
- H is new, A (pos 2), R (pos 3), P new, Y new.
- R not in pos 2, A not in pos 3 – satisfies constraints.
- Letters all allowed so far.

Another solid option is “GAMMA” but again has double letters. Let’s go for “HARPY”.

Wait, HARPY has A in position 2 and R in position 3 – let’s check constraints:
- R not in position 2 – ok, it’s in 3.
- A not in position 3 – ok, it’s in 2.

HARPY seems fine.

Alternatively, “LABOR”:
- L, A, B, O, R.
- A in position 2, R in position 5.
- R not in 2, A not in 3 – ok.
- Letters new and allowed.

Between HARPY and LABOR, LABOR has O which is a common vowel we haven’t tried yet and might give more info. Let’s go with LABOR.

3. A is in the word but not in position 2.

5. B is not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word so far: C, N, E, D, F, T, B.

Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position 5), L, A, O.

So the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ R with the letters L, A, O somewhere in the first four positions, and A not in position 2, O not in position 4, L not in position 1.

Let’s list possible arrangements of L, A, O in the first four positions, excluding the ruled-out positions:

- L cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 4.

We also need to include one more letter (since the word has 5 letters and we have 4 accounted for: L, A, O, R). This extra letter must be from the remaining unused letters: G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A straightforward next guess should test these constraints. A good candidate is “SOLAR”:
- S is new (high-frequency letter).
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in position 4).
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L cannot be in position 1).
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so this is invalid. Hence “SOLAR” is impossible.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,solar,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me useful information about common letters in English 5-letter words. 

A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination covers several high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, giving us good coverage and likely feedback to narrow down subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “crane”:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters already ruled-out: C, N, E.
- Letters known to be in the word: R and A, and they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

A good second guess should:
1. Place R somewhere other than position 2.
2. Place A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Avoid using C, N, E.
4. Introduce new high-frequency letters.

A strong candidate is “DRAFT”:
- D, F, T are new letters.
- R is placed in position 1 instead of position 2.
- A is placed in position 2 instead of position 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, D, F, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and A (each in the wrong place so far)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2 (from guess 1) and R ≠ 2 (from guess 2) – so R cannot be in position 2.
- A ≠ 3 (from guess 1) and A ≠ 3 (from guess 2) – so A cannot be in position 3.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both R and A.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: i.e., no C, N, E, D, F, T.
5. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include B, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, Y.

A good candidate that satisfies everything is “MARRY”:
- Contains R (positions 3 and 4) and A (position 2).
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters: M, A, R, Y.

However, double letters in the same word can sometimes obscure information, so let’s try a variant without double letters: “HARPY”
- H is new, A (pos 2), R (pos 3), P new, Y new.
- R not in pos 2, A not in pos 3 – satisfies constraints.
- Letters all allowed so far.

Another solid option is “GAMMA” but again has double letters. Let’s go for “HARPY”.

Wait, HARPY has A in position 2 and R in position 3 – let’s check constraints:
- R not in position 2 – ok, it’s in 3.
- A not in position 3 – ok, it’s in 2.

HARPY seems fine.

Alternatively, “LABOR”:
- L, A, B, O, R.
- A in position 2, R in position 5.
- R not in 2, A not in 3 – ok.
- Letters new and allowed.

Between HARPY and LABOR, LABOR has O which is a common vowel we haven’t tried yet and might give more info. Let’s go with LABOR.

5. B is not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word so far: C, N, E, D, F, T, B.

- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in position 4).
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L cannot be in position 1).
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so this is invalid. Hence “SOLAR” is impossible.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me useful information about common letters in English 5-letter words. 

A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: very common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This combination covers several high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, giving us good coverage and likely feedback to narrow down subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “crane”:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Letters already ruled-out: C, N, E.
- Letters known to be in the word: R and A, and they are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

A good second guess should:
1. Place R somewhere other than position 2.
2. Place A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Avoid using C, N, E.
4. Introduce new high-frequency letters.

A strong candidate is “DRAFT”:
- D, F, T are new letters.
- R is placed in position 1 instead of position 2.
- A is placed in position 2 instead of position 3.

<guess>draft</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: draft -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) A(-) F(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, D, F, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: R and A (each in the wrong place so far)

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2 (from guess 1) and R ≠ 2 (from guess 2) – so R cannot be in position 2.
- A ≠ 3 (from guess 1) and A ≠ 3 (from guess 2) – so A cannot be in position 3.

We need a word that:
1. Contains both R and A.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
4. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: i.e., no C, N, E, D, F, T.
5. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

The remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet include B, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, Y.

A good candidate that satisfies everything is “MARRY”:
- Contains R (positions 3 and 4) and A (position 2).
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters: M, A, R, Y.

However, double letters in the same word can sometimes obscure information, so let’s try a variant without double letters: “HARPY”
- H is new, A (pos 2), R (pos 3), P new, Y new.
- R not in pos 2, A not in pos 3 – satisfies constraints.
- Letters all allowed so far.

Another solid option is “GAMMA” but again has double letters. Let’s go for “HARPY”.

Wait, HARPY has A in position 2 and R in position 3 – let’s check constraints:
- R not in position 2 – ok, it’s in 3.
- A not in position 3 – ok, it’s in 2.

HARPY seems fine.

Alternatively, “LABOR”:
- L, A, B, O, R.
- A in position 2, R in position 5.
- R not in 2, A not in 3 – ok.
- Letters new and allowed.

Between HARPY and LABOR, LABOR has O which is a common vowel we haven’t tried yet and might give more info. Let’s go with LABOR.

<guess>labor</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: draft -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) A(-) F(x) T(x)
Guess 3: labor -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) B(x) O(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. R is now confirmed in position 5.
2. L is in the word but not in position 1.
3. A is in the word but not in position 2.
4. O is in the word but not in position 4.
5. B is not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word so far: C, N, E, D, F, T, B.

Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position 5), L, A, O.

So the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ R with the letters L, A, O somewhere in the first four positions, and A not in position 2, O not in position 4, L not in position 1.

Let’s list possible arrangements of L, A, O in the first four positions, excluding the ruled-out positions:

- L cannot be in position 1.
- A cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 4.

We also need to include one more letter (since the word has 5 letters and we have 4 accounted for: L, A, O, R). This extra letter must be from the remaining unused letters: G, H, I, K, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A straightforward next guess should test these constraints. A good candidate is “SOLAR”:
- S is new (high-frequency letter).
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in position 4).
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L cannot be in position 1).
- A is in position 2 – but A cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so this is invalid. Hence “SOLAR” is impossible.

Next candidate: “LOVAR”:
- L in position 1 – but L cannot be in position 1. Invalid.

Next candidate: “HOLAR”:
- H is new.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (allowed, since A is only banned from position 2).
- R in position 5 (confirmed).
- All letters used are allowed so far (C, N, E, D, F, T, B are out).

“HOLAR” seems valid, but is “HOLAR” a real word? It doesn’t appear in standard dictionaries. Let’s pick a more common word.

“VOCAL”:
- V is new.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- C is out – invalid.

“POLAR”:
- P is new.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (allowed).
- R in position 5 (confirmed).
- Letters: P, O, L, A, R – all allowed so far.

Check positions:
- P in 1: new letter, fine.
- O in 2: allowed (only banned from 4).
- L in 3: allowed (only banned from 1).
- A in 4: allowed (only banned from 2).
- R in 5: fixed.

“POLAR” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.
