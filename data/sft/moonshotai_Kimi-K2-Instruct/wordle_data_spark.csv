For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the correct or incorrect positions early on.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.
- I and E are not in the word at all.

We therefore avoid I and E, and we need to place R, A, S in different slots.  
A good next word should:
- Keep the three known letters but shift their positions (R, A, S).
- Add two new letters not yet used that are common (T, N, O, L, etc.).

A candidate that satisfies these rules and is a valid word is “SPORT”:
- S is now in position 1 (originally in 4).
- P and T are new letters.
- R is now in position 3 (originally in 1).
- O is a new vowel (since A must go elsewhere and I/E excluded).

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters in the word so far: S, P, R (they’re all ✓ in correct positions 1, 2, 4).
2. Letters NOT in the word: I, E, O, T.

Positions now look like:
1 2 3 4 5
S P _ R _

We still need the third and fifth letters.  
Letters we haven’t tested yet include: A, N, L, D, Y, U, M, C, B, G, etc.  
A and S are already known to be in the word but not in their original spots; A is not in position 2, and S is already correctly in position 1, so A could still fit in position 3 or 5.

A simple valid word fitting S P _ R _ is “SPARE”.  
- A fits position 3 (we know A is in the word but not in position 2).  
- E was previously ruled out in position 5 (from RAISE), so we must avoid E.  
Hence “SPARE” uses E again, which we must reject.

Next attempt: keep S P _ R _ and avoid E, O, I, T.  
Try “SPARK”:
- A in position 3 (allowed).  
- K is new but valid.  
We haven’t seen K yet, and it’s common in 5-letter words.

So “SPARK” fits all constraints.
