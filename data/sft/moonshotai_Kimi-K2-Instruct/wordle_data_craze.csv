Since this is my first guess and I have no feedback to work with, I should choose a word that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word
2. Contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting some hits
3. Uses different letters to gather maximum information

Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. Some good options would be words like:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E) - covers many common letters
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - similar concept
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - another good mix
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels

I'll go with STARE as it has a good mix of common consonants (S, T, R) and vowels (A, E) which should give us valuable feedback.

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th, must move elsewhere).

- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5 because A and E are already correct).

1. Must keep A in 3rd and E in 5th.
2. Must include R somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).

Current positive information:
- Positions: C _ A R E  (because C, A, R, E are all correct and in those exact spots)
- Letters that are definitely in the word: C, A, R, E
- Letters ruled out so far: S, T, N

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern C _ A R E and uses no S, T, or N.

Looking at the pattern C A R E, it’s clear the word is C A R E with one more letter in position 2.  
The only 5-letter English words that begin with C, end with ARE and have one letter between C and A are:

C A R E plus an inserted second letter:
- C H A R E  (CHARE) – archaic but valid
- C L A R E  (CLARE) – proper noun, but we need common words
- C R A R E  – invalid
- C O A R E  – invalid
- C B A R E  – invalid

- C M A R E  – invalid

- C U A R E  – invalid
- C V A R E  – invalid
- C Y A R E  – invalid

Actually, C _ A R E as a 5-letter pattern with the letters we have fixed suggests the word is CARE plus one letter inserted in position 2, but that would be six letters.  
Wait, let’s re-express the pattern:

From CRANE feedback: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), E(✓) are all correct in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 respectively.  
So the word is:

C _ A R E

So the second letter is missing. We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits C _ A R E.

The only common English word that fits is “CHARE”.

However, CHARE is a bit obscure. Double-checking the pattern: C(1) _ A(3) R(4) E(5). The letter in position 2 must be a valid letter that forms a word with C, A, R, E.

Other possibilities:
- C L A R E – CLARE (proper noun)
- C H A R E – CHARE (valid, though rare)
- C F A R E – no
- C O A R E – no

CHARE is the only valid 5-letter word here.

But let’s be sure:
- CARE is 4 letters; inserting one letter in position 2 gives CHARE, CLARE, etc.
- CHARE is in dictionaries as a verb (to cart or carry) and a noun (an odd job).

Therefore, the correct guess is CHARE.

- C M A R E  – invalid
- C P A R E  – invalid
- C U A R E  – invalid
- C V A R E  – invalid
- C Y A R E  – invalid

Actually, C _ A R E as a 5-letter pattern with the letters we have fixed suggests the word is CARE plus one letter inserted in position 2, but that would be six letters.  
Wait, let’s re-express the pattern:

From CRANE feedback: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), E(✓) are all correct in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 respectively.  
So the word is:

C _ A R E

So the second letter is missing. We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits C _ A R E.

The only common English word that fits is “CHARE”.

However, CHARE is a bit obscure. Double-checking the pattern: C(1) _ A(3) R(4) E(5). The letter in position 2 must be a valid letter that forms a word with C, A, R, E.

Other possibilities:
- C L A R E – CLARE (proper noun)
- C H A R E – CHARE (valid, though rare)
- C F A R E – no
- C O A R E – no

CHARE is the only valid 5-letter word here.

But let’s be sure:
- CARE is 4 letters; inserting one letter in position 2 gives CHARE, CLARE, etc.
- CHARE is in dictionaries as a verb (to cart or carry) and a noun (an odd job).

Therefore, the correct guess is CHARE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. Some good options would be words like:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - similar concept
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - another good mix

Looking at the pattern C A R E, it’s clear the word is C A R E with one more letter in position 2.

C A R E plus an inserted second letter:

So far we have:

Confirmed positions  
1: C (✓)  
3: A (✓)  
5: E (✓)  

Confirmed letters that must appear somewhere but not yet locked in place  
R (was in positions 2 and 4 but always marked “wrong position”)

Forbidden letters we have ruled out  
S, T, N, H, V

Hence the pattern is C _ A _ E and the list of still-allowed letters is:

ABCDEFGILMOPQRUWXYZ  
- remove S T N H V  
→ remaining consonants especially useful for positions 2 and 4:  
B, C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Q, R, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels A E I O U.

Given R must appear once and only in position 2 or 4, the only two legal skeletons are

C R A _ E  or  C _ A R E.

We’ve already tried CRA_E with CRAVE (V was rejected).  
Next reasonable candidate with a new letter for the blank:

C R A M E  (CRAME – though rarely used)  
C R A P E (CAPE with R inserted – invalid)  
C R A Z E (CRAZE – not yet tried)  
C L A R E (CLARE – proper noun)  
C F A R E (invalid)  
C G A R E (invalid)  
C M A R E (invalid)  
C P A R E (invalid)  
C D A R E (invalid)

The only remaining common dictionary word for C R A _ E is CRAZE.  
Yet CRAZE uses Z and we haven’t tested Z.  
So CRAZE is the logical next try.
