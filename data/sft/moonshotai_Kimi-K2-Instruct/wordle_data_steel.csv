For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters that appear frequently in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the word structure is S _ _ _ _.  
L, T, and E must appear somewhere in positions 2-5, each once.  
A is forbidden.

To test a good set of remaining letters, I’ll try a word that keeps S fixed and permutes L, T, E plus adds a new common consonant. A promising candidate is ""SLEET"", which places L, E, and T in new positions and introduces the double E (which is acceptable because E could repeat, though feedback said E was only misplaced, not necessarily single).

Let me verify:
- S is in position 1 (matches ✓).
- L moves from 2 to 2... oops, that’s the same spot. I need to move L somewhere else.  
Better: ""SETLS"" is invalid, so maybe ""STEEL"" – but that repeats E which might not be helpful.  
Another option: ""STOLE"" – uses S, T, O (new), L, E.  
This tests O as a new vowel and positions T, L, E differently.

""STOLE"" seems good:
- S ✓ (position 1).
- T now in position 2 (was 4).
- O is new.
- L now in position 4 (was 2).
- E now in position 5 (was 5 – but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position, so 5 cannot be correct for E... thus E must be in 2, 3, or 4 here. In STOLE, E is 5 – same as original, which would contradict feedback. So STOLE is invalid.)

Next candidate: ""STEAL"" – but A was marked x, so no.  
""SMELT"" – M is new, all others fit: S(✓), M(new), E(was misplaced, now 3), L(was 2, now 4), T(was 4, now 5). This positions E, L, T all differently.  

""SMELT"" looks valid and informative.

- STEAL – A is invalid (from SLATE).
- STEEL – but E is already in 3 and we don’t have info on double E, but SMELT didn’t say E appears twice.
- STEIL – not a valid word.
- STELL – valid; means to stop or let time pass.

""STELL"" fits all constraints:
- S(✓), T(position 2), E(position 3), L(position 5), and L in 5 is allowed (from feedback L is not in 2 or 4).

From the feedback history:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)  
2. SMELT → S(✓) M(x) E(✓) L(-) T(-)  
3. STELL → S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) L(-) L(✓)

Key deductions:

- S is locked in position 1.  
- T is locked in position 2 (from STELL’s T(✓)).  
- E is locked in position 3 (from SMELT’s E(✓)).  
- L cannot be in position 4 (from STELL’s L(-)), but it must be in the word somewhere.  
  – In STELL, position 4 is L(-) and position 5 is L(✓), so the word has only one L and it is in position 5.  
- So far the pattern is: S T E _ L, with exactly one L at position 5.

We need one more letter for position 4. Letters tried so far: S, T, E, L, A (x), M (x).  
Common unused consonants: R, N, K, D, C, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words fitting S T E _ L:
- STEAL – A is invalid.  
- STEEL – Would have two E’s; but E is already fixed at 3 and no feedback suggests a second E.  
- STERL – Not a valid English word.  
- STEDL – Not valid.  
- STEYL – Not valid.

- STEKL – Not valid.

- STEIL – Not valid.  
- STEGL – Not valid.  
- STEBL – Not valid.  
- STEWL – Not valid.

Wait, none of these are valid English words. Let me reconsider.

Valid 5-letter words of the form ST _ EL or S T E _ L:
- STREL – Not valid.  
- STELD – Not valid.  
- STEDL – Not valid.  
- STEIL – Not valid.  
- STEAL – A invalid.  
- STEEL – Double E, but E is already confirmed at 3.  
- STEEL is actually valid, and the feedback on E in SMELT confirmed E at 3, so second E is possible if the word is STEEL.

But STELL feedback showed L(✓) at 5, implying only one L at 5. STEEL has no second L, but we need L somewhere. Wait, STEEL is S T E E L, which has E at 3 and 4, but we have no info against double E, and L at 5 is confirmed. So STEEL is possible.

Another candidate: STENL – invalid.  
STEPL – invalid.  
STEIL – invalid.  
STEAL – invalid.  

Valid English word: STEEL (S T E E L). Let me check constraints:
- S at 1 ✓  
- T at 2 ✓ (from STELL feedback)  
- E at 3 ✓ (from SMELT feedback)  
- Second E at 4 – no feedback against it.  
- L at 5 ✓ (from STELL feedback).  

No conflicts. STEEL is the only valid word fitting all constraints.
