For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to contain common letters in the English language and help me narrow down possibilities quickly. A good first word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
2. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gained

A classic and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two highly frequent consonants (R, S)

This should give good coverage of common letters to help deduce the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) ⇒ A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) ⇒ R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) ⇒ O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) ⇒ S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
1. The word contains A and S.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.
3. A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

A good second guess should:
- Retain A and S.
- Try A in new positions and S in new positions.
- Use other common letters not yet ruled out (e.g., T, L, N, I, U).

A strong candidate is “SAINT”:
- S is moved to position 1 (previously at 4).
- A is moved to position 2 (previously at 1).
- Contains N, I, T – all still possible letters.
- Uses no ruled-out letters (R, O, E).

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we already knew:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Letters R, O, E are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SAINT) we now know:
- S is in position 1 – it’s fixed there.
- A is in position 2 – it’s fixed there.
- The letters I, N, T do NOT appear anywhere else in the word.

So the pattern so far is:

S A _ _ _

and the remaining letters must be chosen from:
Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Allowed vowels: U (the only common vowel still unused)

We need two more letters for positions 3-5 that are not I, N, T, R, O, E.

A very common cluster after “SA” is “L”, then a vowel, then a consonant, forming words like SALAD, SALTY, SALVE, SALON, SALUT, etc.

Let’s try “SALAD”:
- S and A are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- L and D have not been ruled out.
- The second A is possible (repeating vowels are allowed).

This guess will tell us:
- Whether L is in position 3.
- Whether D is in position 5.
- Whether another A appears in position 4.
