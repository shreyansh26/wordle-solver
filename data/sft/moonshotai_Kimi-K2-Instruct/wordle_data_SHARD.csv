- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a 5-letter word that contains common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are good starting points because they use frequently occurring letters in English.

Looking at these options:
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- All vowels except O and U (A, I, E)
- Common consonants R and S
- No repeated letters
- High frequency letters that appear in many words

This should give me good coverage to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)

1. I and E are not in the word at all (x).  
2. R, A, S are in the word but in wrong positions (-).  
   - R is not in position 1  
   - A is not in position 2  
   - S is not in position 4  
3. That leaves positions 1-5 to fill, avoiding I, E and placing R, A, S somewhere else.

Good next word:
- Must use R, A, S but in new positions.
- Must avoid I, E.
- Should introduce new letters to maximize information.

Candidate: STARS – but S repeats and S already appears in RAISE feedback.

Candidate: TRASH – has T, R, A, S, H.  
   – R in position 2 (good, not position 1)  
   – A in position 3 (good, not position 2)  
   – S in position 4 (bad, same as before) – reject.

Candidate: CRASH – C, R, A, S, H  
   – R in position 2 (good)  
   – A in position 3 (good)  
   – S in position 4 (bad) – reject.

Candidate: SHARD – S, H, A, R, D  
   – S in position 1 (good, new)  
   – A in position 3 (good)  
   – R in position 4 (good)  
   – Uses new letters H and D.

This looks optimal.
