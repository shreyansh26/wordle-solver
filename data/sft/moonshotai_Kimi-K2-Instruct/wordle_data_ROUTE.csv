For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm positions.

A popular and effective starting word is ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, and E - all very common letters. This gives us good coverage across vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(✓) — R is correct and in the first position.
- E(✓) — E is correct and in the fifth position.
- A(x), I(x), S(x) — A, I, and S do not appear in the word at all.

So the word looks like: R _ _ _ E, and none of A, I, or S are present.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.
- Ends with E.
- Does NOT contain A, I, or S.

Common consonants still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Common vowels still allowed: O, U.

Let me think of candidates:
- R O U N E — but “roune” isn’t a valid English word.
- R O C K E — “rocke” isn’t valid.
- R O U G E — “rouge” is valid.
- R O D E O — ends with O, not E.
- R U M P E — “rumpe” isn’t valid.
- R O B L E — “roble” isn’t common.

“ROUGE” fits perfectly:
- Starts with R, ends with E.
- Uses common letters R, O, U, G, E.
- Does not contain A, I, or S.

I choose “ROUGE”.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern so far: R O U _ E
- All letters in ROUGE except G are confirmed correct and in place.
- G is NOT in the word at all.

So the mystery word is R O U _ E and the fourth letter is not G.

Common consonants still allowed (not A, I, S, G):
B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y.

Vowels still allowed (but position 4 must be a consonant because positions 2 and 3 are vowels and we already have E in position 5).

Let’s list possible 5-letter English words that fit the pattern R O U _ E:
- ROUTE — valid word, uses T.
- ROUSE — valid word, uses S (but S was already ruled out).
- ROUGE — already guessed, ruled out G.
- ROULE — not a valid English word.
- ROUME — not a valid English word.
- ROUBE — not a valid English word.
- ROUDE — not a valid English word.
- ROUME — not valid.

So the only strong candidate left is ROUTE. Let’s check:
- R O U T E
- R(✓) O(✓) U(✓) T _ E(✓)
- No A, I, S, G — all satisfied.

Therefore, ROUTE seems to be the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints.
