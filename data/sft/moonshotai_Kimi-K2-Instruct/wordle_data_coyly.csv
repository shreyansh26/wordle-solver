Since this is the first guess with no feedback yet, I need to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word
2. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
3. Avoid duplicate letters to test more unique positions

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word that combines these would be ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to work with.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- Only O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are absent.
3. We still haven't tested B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps O in a different spot (not 3rd) to confirm its position.
- Uses new, common consonants not yet ruled out (like B, C, D, T, L, N).
- Uses a new vowel since we only know O is present; I, U are good candidates.

A strong candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all untested letters.
- O is moved to the 2nd position.
- This tests 4 new letters while repositioning O.

We are looking for a 5-letter word whose second letter is O and whose other four letters are from the still-untested set.

Quick scan of the remaining common letters:

Possible consonant clusters or vowel placements:
- B, C, F, K, L, M, W could fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- None of the remaining vowels (none left except Y acting sometimes as vowel) are probable in first position, so position 1 is likely a consonant.

Some candidate words that fit:
- COBRA – but R is already ruled out.
- BOUGH – U and H are ruled out.
- FOCAL – A and L are ruled out.
- BOBBY – B is untested, word is valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no feedback yet, I need to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word
2. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
3. Avoid duplicate letters to test more unique positions

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word that combines these would be ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to work with.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- Only O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are absent.
3. We still haven't tested B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps O in a different spot (not 3rd) to confirm its position.
- Uses new, common consonants not yet ruled out (like B, C, D, T, L, N).
- Uses a new vowel since we only know O is present; I, U are good candidates.

A strong candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all untested letters.
- O is moved to the 2nd position.
- This tests 4 new letters while repositioning O.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,coyly,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no feedback yet, I need to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first word should:
1. Use common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word
2. Include vowels since most 5-letter words contain them
3. Avoid duplicate letters to test more unique positions

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word that combines these would be ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to work with.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- Only O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are absent.
3. We still haven't tested B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps O in a different spot (not 3rd) to confirm its position.
- Uses new, common consonants not yet ruled out (like B, C, D, T, L, N).
- Uses a new vowel since we only know O is present; I, U are good candidates.

A strong candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all untested letters.
- O is moved to the 2nd position.
- This tests 4 new letters while repositioning O.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions  
1. The secret word contains the letter O in position 2 (from the ✓ in Guess 2).  
2. Letters ruled out so far:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T  
3. Letters still unknown: the remaining 18 letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
4. We need a 5-letter word that keeps O in position 2 and uses only untested letters elsewhere.

Candidate words that fit O in position 2:  
- BLOWN – but L, W, N are tested/ruled out.  
- COBRA – C, B are untested, but R is ruled out.  
- DOUGH – D, U, G, H are all untested and common.  
- FOCAL – F, C, L are untested, but L is ruled out.  
- HOCUS – H, C, U, S; S is ruled out.  
- JOKER – J, K, R; R is ruled out.  
- MOCHA – M, C, H, A; A is ruled out.  
- ROUGH – R is ruled out.  
- WORLD – R is ruled out.  
- YOLKS – Y, L, K, S; L, S are ruled out.  

Best choice among remaining: DOUGH – uses D, U, G, H, none of which have been tested yet, and keeps O in position 2.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What do we know so far?

1. The word has O in position 2 (from POINT and DOUGH both showing ✓ for the 2nd letter).
2. Letters ruled out completely:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, D, U, G, H  
3. Still-untested letters (and their approximate frequency rank):  
   B, C, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Among these, B, C, F, L, M, K, W are relatively common.

We are looking for a 5-letter word whose second letter is O and whose other four letters are from the still-untested set.

Quick scan of the remaining common letters:

Pattern: _ O _ _ _

Possible consonant clusters or vowel placements:
- B, C, F, K, L, M, W could fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
- None of the remaining vowels (none left except Y acting sometimes as vowel) are probable in first position, so position 1 is likely a consonant.

Some candidate words that fit:
- COBRA – but R is already ruled out.
- BOUGH – U and H are ruled out.
- FOCAL – A and L are ruled out.
- BOBBY – B is untested, word is valid.
- MOMMY – M is untested, word is valid.
- COLIC – C is untested, but I and C are ruled out (I from POINT, C here is fine, but I is not).
- COMMA – C, M are untested, but A is ruled out.
- BOOMY – O is already fixed in 2nd, duplicate O would be unusual but allowed if word exists.
- BONEY – E, N are ruled out.
- JOCKY – J, C, K, Y are untested, word is valid.
- WOMBY – W, M, B, Y are untested, word is valid (womby is archaic but valid).

Among these, the most common-looking with all letters still in play is:

B O M B Y – B, M, B, Y are all untested, and it keeps O in position 2.
However, ""bomby"" is obscure; a more common word is ""BOBBY"", which uses only B and Y still untested.

But ""BOBBY"" reuses B, which is acceptable since we haven't tested B yet.

But let's pick a word that uses four distinct untested letters to maximize information.

Let’s try:  
C O B L Y – but is that a word? No.

C O B B Y – not standard.

C O M B S – S is ruled out.

F O L K Y – F, O, L, K, Y – all untested except O. Word ""FOLKY"" is valid.

This seems good: F O L K Y.

All letters F, L, K, Y are untested and O is in the correct position.

Therefore, FOLKY is the optimal next guess.

Guess 4: FOLKY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) L(-) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed facts:
1. The secret word has O in position 2.
2. Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, D, U, G, H, F, K.
3. From Guess 4 (FOLKY):
   - F is NOT in the word (x).
   - O is still in position 2 (✓) – already known.
   - L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L exists somewhere else than pos 3.
   - K is NOT in the word (x).
   - Y is in the word and in the CORRECT position (✓) → Y is the 5th letter.

So we now have template: _ O _ _ Y and the word contains the letter L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): B, C, J, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Among these, the common ones are B, C, L, M, W.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Matches pattern: ? O ? ? Y
- Contains L somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Candidate words:
- BOLLY – B, O, L, L, Y → L must be in pos 1 or 4, here it’s in 3 → allowed. (Also valid English word)
- COLLY – same as above with C.
- MOLLY – same with M.
- BOBBY – B, O, B, B, Y → no L → invalid
- COBBY – no L → invalid

BOLLY, COLLY, MOLLY all fit the pattern and constraints. Among these, BOLLY seems most common.

From all feedback so far:

  – L (from L(-) and L(✓) in guesses 4 & 5)
- Letters ruled out completely: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, D, U, G, H, F, K, B
- Therefore positions 1, 3, 4 may only use the still-allowed letters: C, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, L
- L must be used once more (it appeared once at 4th position in BOLLY, but we had L(-) earlier, so it must actually appear twice in the word—once not in 3rd/4th and once in 4th).  
  That means L is in 4th (confirmed ✓) and also in 1st or 3rd.

So the pattern is one of:
