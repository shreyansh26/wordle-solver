For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the best chance of identifying key letters in the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these high-frequency letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:

I’ll now pick a word that keeps A in position 2, places S in a new spot, and introduces other common consonants/vowels. A strong candidate is “CASTS”:
- C (new consonant)
- A (known in position 2)
- S (must appear, now in position 3)
- T (new consonant)
- S (must appear, now in position 5)

However, CASTS uses S twice; to maximize information, I’d prefer to introduce a new consonant for the last letter. Another option is “SATIN”, but A is locked in position 2, so we can’t start with S. 

Better: “BASIC” fails (I was already ruled out). 

Let’s go with “SALTY”:

Current constraints gathered from both guesses:

1. RAISE → R(x), A(✓), I(x), S(-), E(x)
   - Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
   - S is present, but NOT in position 4 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 1 (from SALTY).  
     So S must appear in position 2, 3, or 5.  
     However, position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 3 or 5.

2. SALTY → S(-), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), Y(✓)
   - A, T, Y are now confirmed and in their exact positions:
     Word pattern: _ A T Y _
   - S is present but NOT in position 1 (from SALTY) and NOT in position 4 (from RAISE).  
     Combined with position 2 (A), S must appear in position 3 or 5.
   - New letters ruled out: L.

Known letters to include: A (fixed), T (fixed), Y (fixed), S (must appear once).
Known letters to exclude: R, I, E, L.

So the word must be of the form: _ A T Y _ and must contain an S in position 3 or 5.

If S is in position 3: _ A S T Y → but then the word would be _ A S T Y, which doesn’t fit because position 4 is already T and position 5 is Y. So S must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ A T Y S

Only the first letter remains to be determined. We need a 5-letter word ending in A T Y S. The only common English word fitting this is “PATYS”? No. “HATYS”? No. “BATYS”? No.

Wait, let’s list valid English words ending in A T Y S:
- None exist. This implies our assumption may be wrong.

Re-evaluate: SALTY feedback shows T and Y in correct positions (✓), so the word is _ A T Y _.  
But S is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (A), 4 (from RAISE), so S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- If S is in 3: _ A S T Y → “B A S T Y” is not a word.  
- If S is in 5: _ A T Y S → “P A T Y S” is not a word.  

This suggests an inconsistency, meaning our previous interpretation might be missing something. However, based strictly on the feedback, the only possible letter for position 1 that forms a valid word is “P” to make “PATYS”, but this isn’t valid.  

Rechecking: The only valid English word matching _ A T Y _ is “PATYS” (invalid). Thus, likely S must be in position 3, forming _ A S T Y. The only valid word here is “HASTY” (but H, A, S, T, Y). Let’s test this: H A S T Y.

Check feedback consistency:
- Must contain S: yes (position 3).  
- Must have A in 2: yes.  
- Must have T in 4: yes.  
- Must have Y in 5: yes.  
- Must not have L, R, I, E: yes.  

Thus, “HASTY” fits all constraints.

   - A, T, Y are now confirmed and in their exact positions:
     Word pattern: _ A T Y _
   - S is present but NOT in position 1 (from SALTY) and NOT in position 4 (from RAISE).  
     Combined with position 2 (A), S must appear in position 3 or 5.
   - New letters ruled out: L.

Known letters to include: A (fixed), T (fixed), Y (fixed), S (must appear once).
Known letters to exclude: R, I, E, L.

So the word must be of the form: _ A T Y _ and must contain an S in position 3 or 5.

If S is in position 3: _ A S T Y → but then the word would be _ A S T Y, which doesn’t fit because position 4 is already T and position 5 is Y. So S must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: _ A T Y S

Only the first letter remains to be determined. We need a 5-letter word ending in A T Y S. The only common English word fitting this is “PATYS”? No. “HATYS”? No. “BATYS”? No.

Wait, let’s list valid English words ending in A T Y S:
- None exist. This implies our assumption may be wrong.

Re-evaluate: SALTY feedback shows T and Y in correct positions (✓), so the word is _ A T Y _.  
But S is in the word but not in positions 1, 2 (A), 4 (from RAISE), so S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- If S is in 3: _ A S T Y → “B A S T Y” is not a word.  
- If S is in 5: _ A T Y S → “P A T Y S” is not a word.  

This suggests an inconsistency, meaning our previous interpretation might be missing something. However, based strictly on the feedback, the only possible letter for position 1 that forms a valid word is “P” to make “PATYS”, but this isn’t valid.  

Rechecking: The only valid English word matching _ A T Y _ is “PATYS” (invalid). Thus, likely S must be in position 3, forming _ A S T Y. The only valid word here is “HASTY” (but H, A, S, T, Y). Let’s test this: H A S T Y.

Check feedback consistency:
- Must contain S: yes (position 3).  
- Must have A in 2: yes.  
- Must have T in 4: yes.  
- Must have Y in 5: yes.  
- Must not have L, R, I, E: yes.  

Thus, “HASTY” fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Good next letters to test (still common) among those not yet ruled out: T, O, L, N, C, D, U, Y, S (already known to appear), etc.

I’ll now pick a word that keeps A in position 2, places S in a new spot, and introduces other common consonants/vowels. A strong candidate is “CASTS”:
- C (new consonant)
- A (known in position 2)
- S (must appear, now in position 3)

However, CASTS uses S twice; to maximize information, I’d prefer to introduce a new consonant for the last letter. Another option is “SATIN”, but A is locked in position 2, so we can’t start with S. 

Better: “BASIC” fails (I was already ruled out). 

Let’s go with “SALTY”:

- L, T, Y are new letters.

The feedback on TASTY shows:
- T(-) : T is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- A(✓) : A is correctly in position 2.
- S(✓) : S is correctly in position 3.
- T(✓) : T is correctly in position 4.
- Y(✓) : Y is correctly in position 5.

This gives us the exact pattern: _ A S T Y

The only remaining letter is the first one, which must be a consonant not yet eliminated. From previous rounds, eliminated letters are R, I, E, L, H, and T (since T cannot be in position 1). The remaining common consonants are B, C, D, F, etc.

Looking at the pattern _ A S T Y, the only common English word that fits is PASTY (P is a valid starting letter and has not been eliminated yet).
