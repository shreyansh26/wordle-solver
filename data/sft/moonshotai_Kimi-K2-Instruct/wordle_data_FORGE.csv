1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some good starting words include: ADIEU, AROSE, IRATE, CRANE, SLATE, STARE.

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowels quickly
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word at all (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- O: in word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in word at all (x)
- E: in word AND in correct position (✓) → E is the last letter

So we know:
- Word ends in E
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or S

Positions so far: _ _ _ _ E

R cannot be in position 2, and O cannot be in position 3.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, F, H
Good vowels left: I, U

I want a word that:
- Ends in E
- Uses R and O in new positions
- Avoids A and S
- Uses common remaining letters

Looking at candidates:
- ROUTE - uses R and O, ends in E, but R would be in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed)
- DROVE - uses R and O, ends in E
- BROKE - uses R and O, ends in E
- PROBE - uses R and O, ends in E

I'll choose ROUTE as it uses R and O in different positions and includes T (a very common letter).

Letters still available among common ones: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, V, W, Y.
