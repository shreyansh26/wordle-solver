For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is strategically beneficial. The ideal first word in Wordle typically has:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. A good mix of vowels and consonants
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and vowels
- ""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E - also excellent with common letters
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another solid choice

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes the most common letters in English (especially E, A, R) and gives good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R – not in the word at all (x).
- A – in the word, but NOT in position 2 (-).
- I – not in the word (x).
- S – not in the word (x).
- E – in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓).

So we now know:
1. The word ends in E.
2. The letter A appears somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, or 4).
3. The letters R, I, S are not in the word at all.
4. We haven’t tested B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z yet.

A good next guess should:
- Keep the E in place.
- Try to place the A in a new spot (e.g., position 1 or 3).
- Introduce several fresh, common consonants.

I’ll test the word “PLATE” because:
- It keeps E in position 5.
- Moves A to position 2 (but we already know A is not in position 2; actually that’s bad).  
Oops—correction: the feedback told us A is in the word but NOT in position 2, so we must keep A out of position 2.

Therefore, a better choice is “CHASE”:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Puts A in position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces C, H, S—but wait, S was already ruled out (x in RAISE).  
So “CHASE” is invalid because of S.

Next option: “MEANT”  
But T is untested and E is fixed at 5, so “MEANT” would move E out of position 5—invalid.

Better: “TABLE”
- Keeps E at 5.
- Moves A into position 3.
- Introduces T, B, L, all new letters.

2. The letter A appears somewhere else in the word (positions 1, 3, or 4).
3. The letters R, I, S are not in the word at all.
4. We haven’t tested B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z yet.

A good next guess should:
- Keep the E in place.
- Try to place the A in a new spot (e.g., position 1 or 3).
- Introduce several fresh, common consonants.

I’ll test the word “PLATE” because:
- It keeps E in position 5.
- Moves A to position 2 (but we already know A is not in position 2; actually that’s bad).  
Oops—correction: the feedback told us A is in the word but NOT in position 2, so we must keep A out of position 2.

Therefore, a better choice is “CHASE”:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Puts A in position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces C, H, S—but wait, S was already ruled out (x in RAISE).  
So “CHASE” is invalid because of S.

Next option: “MEANT”  
But T is untested and E is fixed at 5, so “MEANT” would move E out of position 5—invalid.

Better: “TABLE”
- Keeps E at 5.
- Moves A into position 3.
- Introduces T, B, L, all new letters.

Looks good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds so far:

Knowns  
- Position 5 is definitely E.  
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- Letters already ruled out: R, I, S, T, B.  
- Letters still possible: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus letters not yet used.

Positions for A must now be 1 or 4.  
We also know L appears somewhere (from TABLE: L(-)) but is not in position 4.

Next guess should:  
1. Keep E fixed in position 5.  
2. Place A in a new allowed spot (position 1 or 4).  
3. Try some fresh consonants.  
4. Possibly reuse L in a new spot.

Option 1: CLAVE – but V is uncommon and C/L/A placement may not be ideal.  
Option 2: GABLE – but B is ruled out.  
Option 3: HALVE – same V issue.  
Option 4: MAPLE – P good, M good, A in 2 is bad.  
Option 5: LANCE – A in 3 is bad.  
Option 6: FLAKE – A in 3 is bad.  
Option 7: PLANE – A in 3 is bad.  
Option 8: GLADE – A in 3 is bad.  
Option 9: LADEN – A in 2 is bad.  
Option 10: CABLE – B is ruled out.  
Option 11: VALUE – A in 2 is bad.  
Option 12: ANOLE – A in 1, N, O, L, E – all letters fresh or allowed.  
   A is in position 1 (allowed).  
   L is in position 4 (allowed, since we know L is not in 4, but feedback from TABLE shows L is in the word but not in position 4, so position 4 is actually the only place L can’t be; therefore put L in position 3? Wait, no: TABLE feedback says L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. So L could be in 1, 2, or 3. In ANOLE, L is in 3 – that’s fine. Thus ANOLE is valid.)  

Another check:  
ANOLE:  
- A allowed in 1.  
- N, O, L new or allowed positions.  
- E fixed in 5.  
- No ruled-out letters.  

Looks good.

From the latest feedback:

Position 1: A(✓) – A is correct in position 1.  
Position 2: N(-) – N is somewhere in the word but not in position 2.  
Position 3: O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.  
Position 4: L(-) – L is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.  
Position 5: E(✓) – E is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is:
A _ O _ E
with the additional info:
- N and L must appear in the remaining blank positions (2 or 4).
- From earlier rounds we have already ruled out: R, I, S, T, B.

Positions left to fill: 2 and 4 (must be N and L in some order).

Only possible combinations:
1. A N O L E
2. A L O N E

Both are valid English 5-letter words.  
We check both:
- ANOLE: but we already played it and got feedback, so it’s not the secret word.  
- ALONE: we have not tried it yet.

Therefore the only remaining candidate is ALONE.
