This is my first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good first guess should use common letters to maximize information gain. Some of the most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A word that uses several of these common letters would be ideal. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another option is ""AROSE"" with A, R, O, S, E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters and covers good vowel/consonant balance.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word with E in position 5 and none of A, R, O, S in it. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, H, etc. and remaining vowels could include I, U.

Try to pick other common letters not ruled out. A useful pattern might be T, I, N, L, etc.

Letters: T, I, N, E, D - none is A, R, O, S. E is in 5th position. This seems valid.

Another option: INLET (but contains N, L, E, T, I - all valid).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter word with E in position 5 and none of A, R, O, S in it. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, H, etc. and remaining vowels could include I, U.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Try to pick other common letters not ruled out. A useful pattern might be T, I, N, L, etc.

Example word: TINED (but contains N, I, D, E - no A, R, O, S)

Let's confirm TINED:
Letters: T, I, N, E, D - none is A, R, O, S. E is in 5th position. This seems valid.

Another option: INLET (but contains N, L, E, T, I - all valid).

I think ""INLET"" is a good choice because:
- It has E in the 5th position (correct so far)
- It doesn't contain A, R, O, S
- It uses common letters I, N, L, T

- The word ends in E (position 5).

- Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Remaining common letters we can still try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y (plus T which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T somewhere other than position 4, and using none of the forbidden letters.

Candidate patterns:
- T _ _ _ E
- _ T _ _ E
- _ _ T _ E

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:

- T _ _ _ E: “THEME” uses H, M – both still allowed.  
- _ T _ _ E: “UTILE” uses U, I (I is forbidden – skip).  
- _ _ T _ E: “CUTIE” uses C, U, I (I forbidden – skip).  

“THEME” satisfies:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: INLET → I(x) N(x) L(x) E(✓) T(-)

Summary of constraints so far:
- The word ends in E (position 5).
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, I, N, L.
- Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Remaining common letters we can still try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y (plus T which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T somewhere other than position 4, and using none of the forbidden letters.

Candidate patterns:
- T _ _ _ E
- _ T _ _ E
- _ _ T _ E

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:

- T _ _ _ E: “THEME” uses H, M – both still allowed.  
- _ T _ _ E: “UTILE” uses U, I (I is forbidden – skip).  
- _ _ T _ E: “CUTIE” uses C, U, I (I forbidden – skip).  

“THEME” satisfies:
- Position 5 is E.  
- Contains T (position 1).  
- Contains H, M (both allowed).  
- Doesn’t use any forbidden letters.

Let’s lock in “THEME”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the constraints from all feedback:

1. Word ends with E (position 5).  
2. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, S, I, N, L, H, M.  
3. Letters whose status we know:
   - T is in the word and is in position 1 (from Guess 3: T(✓) …).  
   - First E is correct in position 5.  
   - The second E in Guess 3 (position 4) shows “-”, meaning there is an E but NOT in position 4; since we already have E in position 5, this just confirms the single E at the end.  
   - Therefore the word looks like: T _ _ _ E.

Allowed letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Y, plus any others not yet excluded.

We need a common 5-letter word matching T _ _ _ E.

Candidates:
- TWICE – uses W, C (both allowed), fits pattern.  
- TUBEE – invalid (not a word).  
- TULLE – L is forbidden.  
- TRACE – R and A are forbidden.  
- TWINE – N is forbidden.  
- THYME – already tried (H, M forbidden).

“TWICE” is the only clean common candidate left.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints after four guesses:

1. Word must start with T and end with E: T _ _ _ E  
   (from Guess 3: T(✓) and Guess 1/2/3/4: E(✓) in position 5)

2. Forbidden letters (from feedback):  
   A, R, O, S, I, N, L, H, M, W, C

3. So the three middle letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must come from the remaining alphabet:  
   B, D, F, G, K, P, U, Y, plus any other letters not yet used or ruled out.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T, ends with E.  
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2, 3, 4.  
- Is a valid English word.

Looking at common words fitting T _ _ _ E, possible candidates:
- TUBEE – invalid (not a word)  
- TULLE – L is forbidden  
- TUNGE – N is forbidden  
- TYGGE – not common  
- TUGGE – not a word  
- TUPPE – not a word  
- TYGGE – not a word  

The only remaining common word seems to be: TUGGE (but this is not a valid word), or TYKEE (not a word).  

Let me think again:  
From remaining letters (B, D, F, G, K, P, U, Y), the only realistic combinations that make valid English words:
- TUBED – but D is allowed, U is allowed, B is allowed.  
- TUBED is a valid word meaning ""having tubes"", and fits T _ _ _ E with no forbidden letters.

Let me confirm TUBED:
- T, U, B, E, D  
- T is position 1 (confirmed ✓)  
- E is position 5 (confirmed ✓)  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, I, N, L, H, M, W, C are all avoided)  
- U, B, D are all still allowed.

Thus, TUBED is a valid next guess.

Letters still allowed (and not yet used in any of the five guesses): F, G, K, P, Y, plus any others not explicitly marked x.

We need a common 5-letter word of the form T _ _ _ E using only the remaining letters. Let’s list candidates:

- TF?E – nothing common
- TG?E – nothing common
- TK?E – nothing common
- TP?E – nothing common
- TY?E – the only word that comes to mind is TYPE, but P is allowed and Y is allowed.

TYPE is a valid English word:

- Fits the pattern T _ _ _ E.
- Contains Y, P in positions 2 and 3.
