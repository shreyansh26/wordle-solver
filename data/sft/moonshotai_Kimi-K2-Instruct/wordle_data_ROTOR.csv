For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. Common strategies include:

1. Using words with frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Including common vowels (like E, A, O, I)
3. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular first guesses in Wordle include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it covers the five most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T) plus S, which is very common in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Positional exclusions from the “–” marks:

1. Exactly the letters T and R plus any of the allowed others  
2. Respects the positional bans above  
3. Contains at least one vowel, and the only vowel left to try is O  

We also want to test as many new consonants as possible in one shot.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly narrow down possibilities. Common strategies include:

1. Using words with frequently occurring consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
2. Including common vowels (like E, A, O, I)
3. Avoiding words with repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular first guesses in Wordle include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it covers the five most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T) plus S, which is very common in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(x) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S(x) – S is not in the secret word at all.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- Letters to eliminate: A, E, S.
- Letters we know are present: T, R.
- T is not in position 2, R is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains T and R.
2. Does not contain A, E, S.
3. Places T somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 4.

To maximize information, we should choose a word with other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tested yet (like O, I, U, N, L, C). A good candidate is ""TRUIO"" but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s pick ""TRUNK"":
- Contains T and R.
- Uses U, N, K (new letters).
- T is in position 1 (not 2), R is in position 2 (not 4).
- No A, E, S.

Guess 2: TRUNK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) U(x) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (STARE):
- S, A, E are out entirely.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2 (TRUNK):
- U, N, K are out entirely.
- T appears again in position 1 and still gets (-): so T is in the word but NOT in position 1 either.
- R appears in position 2 and still gets (-): so R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Collecting what we know:
- Letters confirmed present: T and R.
- Letters confirmed absent: S, A, E, U, N, K.
- Positions ruled out:
  – T cannot be in 1 or 2.
  – R cannot be in 2 or 4.

So T must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains both T and R (with the positional restrictions above).
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated: among common remaining consonants the candidates are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y; for vowels the only ones we haven’t disproved are I and O.

A quick scan of common patterns suggests words like “BIRTH” or “DARTY”, but we need to check constraints.

Let’s pick a word that places T in position 3 (middle) and R in position 5 (end):
- CRIOT is invalid.
- DIRTY fits: D I R T Y
  – Letters: D, I, R, T, Y
  – R is in position 3 (allowed), T is in position 4 (allowed)
  – No forbidden letters.

DIRTY therefore satisfies all known constraints.

Now we have much clearer information:

Letters and positions:
- R is correct in position 1 (✓).
- O is correct in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Letters completely ruled out (from all guesses and feedback):
S, A, E, U, N, K, D, I, Y, B

Letters confirmed in the word:
R (position 1), O (position 2), T (somewhere else)

Remaining open positions for T: 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are taken or forbidden)

Allowed letters left (not yet tried and not eliminated):
C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
R O _ _ _ or R O _ _ T (but T must go in 3 or 4)...

So possible patterns:
- R O T _ _ (T in 3)
- R O _ T _ (T in 4)

Let's find real 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- R O T C H (ROTHC invalid), but ROTCH isn’t a word.
- R O C K T – K is eliminated.
- R O M P T – no such word.
- R O P T S – P and S, but S is eliminated.
- R O T E D – D is eliminated.
- R O T H O – H, O is already used twice but allowed, but not standard.

Real words:
- ROTCH (nope)
- ROTOR (T in 3, uses O again, R already used in 1) – but R already in 1.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be R O _ _ _ with T in 3 or 4, and use remaining letters.

ROTC? is invalid.

Wait, let's list possible words systematically:

1. R O T _ _ : needs letters from C,F,G,H,L,M,P,V,W for positions 4,5. But T is in 3.
   - ROTCH – invalid
   - ROTFL – slang, but valid
   - ROTOR – but R is already in 1, and T is in 3, but O is in 2 and 4, which is allowed.
     - ROTOR: R(1)=✓, O(2)=✓, T(3)=?, O(4)=?, R(5)=?
     - Check constraints:
       - R is in word and position 1 is correct (so position 5 can be R, but that’s fine).
       - T is in word and must be in 3 or 4 → here it’s in 3, which is allowed.
       - No banned letters.
       - ROTOR is a valid word.

Another candidate could be R O M P T, but P is allowed, M is allowed, T in 5 is banned, so no.

Thus, the best guess is ROTOR.
