For the first guess, we want a word that can help us quickly identify common letters and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E)
- ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E)
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E)
- ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E)

These words contain a mix of common vowels (A, E, O, I) and consonants (S, T, R, N, L) that can provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S) which should give us good initial information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – the letter A is in the target word but NOT in position 1.
- R(x) – the letter R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – the letter O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the target word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) – the letter E is not in the word at all.

So, the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
- DOES contain A and S, but A is not in position 1 and S is not in position 4.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters A and S.
2. Avoid the eliminated letters R, O, E.
3. Try new positions for A and S, and introduce other common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

A good candidate is a word that uses A and S in different positions, adds common consonants like T, N, L, and common remaining vowels like I or U. Good possibilities: STAIN, SLANT, SNAIL, SAINT, PLANS, etc.

Among these, “STAIN” seems ideal:
- Uses S in position 1 (since S can’t be in 4, trying 1 is safe).
- Uses A in position 3 (since A can’t be in 1).
- Introduces T, I, N – all common and so far untested letters.

Hence, “STAIN” is a logical next guess.

Summary of what we now know from both guesses:

1. Letters present in the word (but not yet pinned to positions):
   - S is in the word and is in position 1 (from STAIN: S✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (from AROSE: A-) and not in position 3 (from STAIN: A-).
   - N is in the word but not in position 5 (from STAIN: N-).

2. Letters definitely absent:
   - R, O, E, T, I.

3. Untested common letters we should consider:
   - Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Vowels: U (A is already known to be present)

4. Word structure so far:
   - Position 1: S (fixed by ✓)
   - Positions 2, 3, 4, 5: unknown; A and N must appear somewhere in these four slots, but not in their previously excluded positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 4  (but 1 is already S, so 2, 3, 4)

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that contains both A and N in acceptable positions and uses only the remaining allowed letters. Trying combinations:

- S A _ _ N — but N in position 5 was eliminated by STAIN (N-), so invalid.
- S _ A _ N — same issue with N in 5.
- S _ _ A N — N in 5 still invalid.
- S _ A N _ — A in 3 is invalid (from STAIN).
- S A N _ _ — N in 3 is allowed.
- S _ N A _ — N in 3, A in 4.
- S _ _ N A — N in 4, A in 5.

Let’s pick one of these patterns. For example: S _ A N _. Need to fill positions 2 and 5 with remaining allowed letters. Allowed letters (excluding R, O, E, T, I) and including A, N, S already placed.

Possible choices for positions 2 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A common word that fits is ""SHANK"":
- S H A N K
- Check positions:
  - S in 1: ✓ (fixed)
  - H: untested, allowed
  - A in 3: invalid (from STAIN: A-), so SHANK is no good.

- S N A C K
- Positions:
  - S in 1: ✓
  - N in 2: allowed (N- meant not in 5)
  - A in 3: invalid (A- from STAIN), so no.

Next pattern: S _ _ N A. Try ""SUNNA"" – but ""SUNNA"" has two N's, might be less likely, and U is allowed.

Wait, let's try simpler words. How about ""SLANG"":

  - S in 1: ✓
  - L: allowed
  - A in 3: invalid (A- from STAIN), so no.

- S A N D Y
