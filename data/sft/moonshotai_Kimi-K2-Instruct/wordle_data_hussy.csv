For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common and uses a variety of frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E), making it likely to hit at least some correct letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So my next goal is:
1. Keep using S, but move it away from position 1.
2. Avoid any of the letters L, A, T, E.
3. Pick a new set of high-frequency consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good letters to try now would include (among others) R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A strong second-guess candidate is “SHORN” because:
- It moves S to position 2.
- It uses R, O, N (all frequent) and none of the excluded letters (L, A, T, E).
- It introduces two new vowels (O) and common consonants (R, N).

Another solid choice is “CRISP” or “SPOON”, but “SHORN” feels slightly better for coverage.

From the combined feedback:

1. S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
2. All other letters used so far (L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N) are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- S must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- We need a word that contains S (not in positions 1-2) and uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.

The remaining common letters that have not been tried (and are not ruled out) include: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels while placing S in one of the allowed positions. 

One such word is “CUBISM” – but that’s 6 letters. We need 5.

How about “DISKS”? (S in position 3) – but the second S would be redundant for information gain.

A better choice: “PUMPS” – places S in position 5, uses new letters P, U, M.

Another: “PUSHS” – but that’s plural and uncommon.

A clean choice: “MUSKY” – uses M, U, K, Y, and places S in position 2 (but we know S can’t be in position 2 from Guess 2 feedback). So S must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

Let's try “MUSKY” but shift S to position 3: “MUSKY” positions: M(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – S is in position 3, which is allowed.

Alternatively, “BUSKY”, “PUSKY”, etc.

But let’s pick a more common word: “MUSKS” – but repeats S.

Best single-use, common word: “MUSKY”.

Wait, is “MUSKY” a common word? Yes, it’s the adjective form of musk.

Another option: “DUSKY” – but we haven’t tried D yet.

But to maximize info, let’s use a word with 5 distinct new letters and S in a new position.

Let me pick “MUSKY”.

But to avoid Y which is less common, how about “DUSKS” – but repeats S.

Hmm.

Actually, “MUSIC” is common, but I is already in “MUSIC” (but I hasn’t been ruled out), and S would be in position 3.

But C is not ruled out either.

But let's check if these letters are allowed:
Letters used in feedback:
Excluded: L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N
S cannot be in 1 or 2
Allowed: S can be in 3,4,5
Other allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A very good word: “MUSIC”
- M, U, S, I, C
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- All letters are new and not excluded
- Common word

This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So my next goal is:
1. Keep using S, but move it away from position 1.
2. Avoid any of the letters L, A, T, E.
3. Pick a new set of high-frequency consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good letters to try now would include (among others) R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A strong second-guess candidate is “SHORN” because:
- It moves S to position 2.
- It uses R, O, N (all frequent) and none of the excluded letters (L, A, T, E).
- It introduces two new vowels (O) and common consonants (R, N).

Another solid choice is “CRISP” or “SPOON”, but “SHORN” feels slightly better for coverage.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
2. All other letters used so far (L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N) are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- S must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- We need a word that contains S (not in positions 1-2) and uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.

The remaining common letters that have not been tried (and are not ruled out) include: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels while placing S in one of the allowed positions. 

One such word is “CUBISM” – but that’s 6 letters. We need 5.

How about “DISKS”? (S in position 3) – but the second S would be redundant for information gain.

A better choice: “PUMPS” – places S in position 5, uses new letters P, U, M.

Another: “PUSHS” – but that’s plural and uncommon.

A clean choice: “MUSKY” – uses M, U, K, Y, and places S in position 2 (but we know S can’t be in position 2 from Guess 2 feedback). So S must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

Let's try “MUSKY” but shift S to position 3: “MUSKY” positions: M(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – S is in position 3, which is allowed.

Alternatively, “BUSKY”, “PUSKY”, etc.

But let’s pick a more common word: “MUSKS” – but repeats S.

Best single-use, common word: “MUSKY”.

Wait, is “MUSKY” a common word? Yes, it’s the adjective form of musk.

Another option: “DUSKY” – but we haven’t tried D yet.

But to maximize info, let’s use a word with 5 distinct new letters and S in a new position.

Let me pick “MUSKY”.

But to avoid Y which is less common, how about “DUSKS” – but repeats S.

Hmm.

Actually, “MUSIC” is common, but I is already in “MUSIC” (but I hasn’t been ruled out), and S would be in position 3.

But C is not ruled out either.

But let's check if these letters are allowed:
Letters used in feedback:
Excluded: L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N
S cannot be in 1 or 2
Allowed: S can be in 3,4,5
Other allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A very good word: “MUSIC”
- M, U, S, I, C
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- All letters are new and not excluded
- Common word

This seems optimal.

Letters not allowed anywhere: L,A,T,E,H,O,R,N,M,I,C  
Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (plus remaining vowels: none except U is already placed)

We need 2 more letters for positions 1 and 5, plus a letter for position 4, all from the allowed set.

Looking for common 5-letter words with pattern: ? U S ? ?

Possible candidates (checking dictionary):
- DUSKY: uses D, K, Y — all allowed.

6. Remaining available letters (middle-frequency and still unused) for positions 1 and 4: B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out, but these are the most likely).
7. We need two distinct letters from the allowed set to fill positions 1 and 4.
8. Looking for common 5-letter English words ending in -USY: possible candidates include BUSY, FUSE, etc., but must match _ U S _ Y and use only allowed letters.
9. BUSY is only 4 letters and doesn’t fit.
10. The only common word I can think of that fits _ U S _ Y is “FUSKY” but that’s not a word.
11. Actually, the pattern is _ U S _ Y and we need a valid word. Let me think of common ones: BUSKY (no), DUSKY (D eliminated), PUSKY (no), GUSKY (no), FUSKY (no), JUSKY (no), etc.
12. Wait, maybe “PUSSY”? But that has a double S (S is already in position 3), and P and Y are allowed. However, the word must use each letter only once unless the secret word has repeats, but we don’t have evidence of that. Also, P is allowed.
13. “PUSSY” has S in position 3 and 4, but we don’t know if S repeats. However, since we haven’t seen any evidence of letter repeats, better to avoid it.
14. Another possibility: “BUSSY” – again double S.
15. The only remaining common word I can think of is “FUSSY” but again double S.
16. Alternatively, “GUSHY” – but H is eliminated.
17. “PUSHY” – H is eliminated.
18. “JUSKY” – K is eliminated.
19. “PUSSY” seems to be the only viable word left that fits _ U S _ Y with allowed letters (P, U, S, S, Y). Despite the double S, it’s a valid word.
20. Since all other combinations seem invalid or extremely uncommon, I’ll guess “PUSSY”.",Guess 5: PUSSY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) S(✓) S(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,hussy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is common and uses a variety of frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E), making it likely to hit at least some correct letters in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So my next goal is:
1. Keep using S, but move it away from position 1.
2. Avoid any of the letters L, A, T, E.
3. Pick a new set of high-frequency consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good letters to try now would include (among others) R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, etc.

A strong second-guess candidate is “SHORN” because:
- It moves S to position 2.
- It uses R, O, N (all frequent) and none of the excluded letters (L, A, T, E).
- It introduces two new vowels (O) and common consonants (R, N).

Another solid choice is “CRISP” or “SPOON”, but “SHORN” feels slightly better for coverage.

<guess>SHORN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(-) O(x) R(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:

1. S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
2. All other letters used so far (L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N) are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- S must be in positions 3, 4 or 5.
- We need a word that contains S (not in positions 1-2) and uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.

The remaining common letters that have not been tried (and are not ruled out) include: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next step is to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels while placing S in one of the allowed positions. 

One such word is “CUBISM” – but that’s 6 letters. We need 5.

How about “DISKS”? (S in position 3) – but the second S would be redundant for information gain.

A better choice: “PUMPS” – places S in position 5, uses new letters P, U, M.

Another: “PUSHS” – but that’s plural and uncommon.

A clean choice: “MUSKY” – uses M, U, K, Y, and places S in position 2 (but we know S can’t be in position 2 from Guess 2 feedback). So S must be in position 3, 4 or 5.

Let's try “MUSKY” but shift S to position 3: “MUSKY” positions: M(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5) – S is in position 3, which is allowed.

Alternatively, “BUSKY”, “PUSKY”, etc.

But let’s pick a more common word: “MUSKS” – but repeats S.

Best single-use, common word: “MUSKY”.

Wait, is “MUSKY” a common word? Yes, it’s the adjective form of musk.

Another option: “DUSKY” – but we haven’t tried D yet.

But to maximize info, let’s use a word with 5 distinct new letters and S in a new position.

Let me pick “MUSKY”.

But to avoid Y which is less common, how about “DUSKS” – but repeats S.

Hmm.

Actually, “MUSIC” is common, but I is already in “MUSIC” (but I hasn’t been ruled out), and S would be in position 3.

But C is not ruled out either.

But let's check if these letters are allowed:
Letters used in feedback:
Excluded: L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N
S cannot be in 1 or 2
Allowed: S can be in 3,4,5
Other allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A very good word: “MUSIC”
- M, U, S, I, C
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- All letters are new and not excluded
- Common word

This seems optimal.

<guess>MUSIC</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(-) O(x) R(x) N(x)
Guess 3: MUSIC -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) S(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we have:

- U is in the word and is in position 2.
- S is in the word and is in position 3 (confirmed).
- All other letters tried so far (M, I, C from MUSIC; plus earlier L,A,T,E,H,O,R,N) are NOT in the word.

So we know:
Pattern so far: _ U S _ _  
Letters not allowed anywhere: L,A,T,E,H,O,R,N,M,I,C  
Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (plus remaining vowels: none except U is already placed)

We need 2 more letters for positions 1 and 5, plus a letter for position 4, all from the allowed set.

Looking for common 5-letter words with pattern: ? U S ? ?

Possible candidates (checking dictionary):
- DUSKY: uses D, K, Y — all allowed.
- FUSKS: uses F, K — but S repeats, and not a common word.
- GUSKY: G, K, Y — but GUSKY isn’t common.
- BUSKY: B, K, Y — BUSKY isn’t a word.
- PUSKY: P, K, Y — no.
- DUSKS: S repeats.
- DUSKY seems the only viable common word fitting _ U S _ _.

So DUSKY is a strong candidate.

5. Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N, M, I, C, D, K
