- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
3. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
4. Avoid rare letters like X, Z, Q for the first guess

A popular strategy is to use words with a good mix of vowels and common consonants. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" are often recommended. 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - great letter coverage
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also excellent
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - good too

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) = x → A is not in the word.
- R (2nd letter) = - → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O (3rd letter) = x → O is not in the word.
- S (4th letter) = x → S is not in the word.
- E (5th letter) = - → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- R is NOT in position 2, and E is NOT in position 5.

I now want a new word that:
1. Includes R and E (confirmed letters).
2. Does not include A, O, or S (eliminated letters).
3. Avoids placing R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

A strong candidate is “INERT” because:
- It contains both confirmed letters (R and E).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (A, O, S).
- R is in position 4 (not position 2), and E is in position 3 (not position 5).
- It introduces new common letters (I, N, T) to gather more information.

Summary of all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Contains R and E  
   – Does NOT contain A, O, S  
   – R ≠ position 2, E ≠ position 5  

2. INERT → I(x) N(x) E(-) R(-) T(-)  
   – Contains E, R, T (T newly confirmed)  
   – Does NOT contain I or N  
   – E ≠ position 3, R ≠ position 4, T ≠ position 5  

Putting it together:  
Letters known to be in the word: E, R, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, I, N  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- E cannot be in 3 or 5  
- R cannot be in 2 or 4  
- T cannot be in 5  

That leaves the following possible slots for each known letter:
E: 1, 2, 4  
R: 1, 3, 5  
T: 1, 2, 3, 4  

We still need two more consonants.  From the remaining common letters (B, C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, H, etc.), I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses E, R, T exactly once each  
- Avoids all banned letters  
- Places them in still-allowed positions  
- Uses two fresh consonants to maximize new info  

Candidate: “TUBER”
- Contains T, U, B, E, R – hits all known letters (T, E, R) and introduces U, B  
- U and B haven’t been tested yet, so we learn about their presence/absence  
- Positioning respects the positional constraints:
  – T in 1 (allowed)  
  – E in 4 (allowed)  
  – R in 5 (allowed)  

Hence I’ll guess TUBER.
