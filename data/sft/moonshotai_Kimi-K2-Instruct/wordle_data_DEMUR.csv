For the first guess, we want to maximize the amount of information gained. This means choosing a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Commonly used starting words include:
- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E
- STARE: Contains S, T, A, R, E
- ROATE: Contains R, O, A, T, E

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it has several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

This means choosing a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. \n\nCommonly used starting words include:\n- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (common letters)\n- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E\n- STARE: Contains S, T, A, R, E\n- ROATE: Contains R, O, A, T, E\n\nI\'ll choose ""SLATE"" as it has several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on DECOR:
- D(✓): D is correct in position 1.
- E(✓): E is correct in position 2.
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- R(✓): R is correct in position 5.

Thus, the word structure is now:
D E _ _ R

Letters already confirmed or placed:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 5: R

Letters eliminated so far: S, L, A, T, I, N, C, O

Remaining common letters for positions 3 and 4: F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting D E _ _ R.

Possible candidates:
- DEGUR (not a valid word)
- DETER (but T was eliminated)
- DEFER (F not eliminated yet)
- DEGER (not valid)
- DEXER (X uncommon)
- DEMUR (valid)
- DEPER (not valid)
- DEWER (not common)
- DEVER (not valid)

Among valid common words, ""DEFER"" and ""DEMUR"" stand out. ""DEFER"" uses F and another E, but we already have E confirmed in position 2 and no evidence of another E. ""DEMUR"" uses M and U, both common and not yet eliminated. 

Let me pick ""DEMUR"" to test M and U in positions 3 and 4.
