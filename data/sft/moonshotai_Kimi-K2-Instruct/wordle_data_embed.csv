For a first guess, I want to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. I'll choose a word with:
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L)
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Good starting words often include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage across possible word structures.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word has:
- The letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, S at all.

1. Uses E somewhere other than the last position.
2. Avoids R, A, I, S entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants/vowels to maximize new information.

Possible next steps: focus on common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P and remaining vowels like O, U. I’ll choose a word with:
- E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- High-frequency consonants and at least one other vowel.

Good candidates: ""TOWER"", ""MUTED"", ""CLOVE"", ""BLEND"". ""TOWER"" uses T, O, W, E, R — but R is already excluded. ""MUTED"" uses M, U, T, E, D — all allowed. Let’s pick ""MUTED"" because it tests M, U, T, E, D, giving broad coverage.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage across possible word structures.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word has:
- The letter E somewhere, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, S at all.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere other than the last position.
2. Avoids R, A, I, S entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants/vowels to maximize new information.

Possible next steps: focus on common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, M, P and remaining vowels like O, U. I’ll choose a word with:
- E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- High-frequency consonants and at least one other vowel.

Good candidates: ""TOWER"", ""MUTED"", ""CLOVE"", ""BLEND"". ""TOWER"" uses T, O, W, E, R — but R is already excluded. ""MUTED"" uses M, U, T, E, D — all allowed. Let’s pick ""MUTED"" because it tests M, U, T, E, D, giving broad coverage.

<guess>MUTED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: MUTED -> FEEDBACK: M(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:

1. Forbidden letters so far: R, A, I, S, U, T  
2. Required letters (present somewhere): E, D  
   – E is in the correct spot (position 4)  
   – D is somewhere but NOT in position 5  
3. Letters whose position we still haven’t tested: M (we know it’s in the word but not at position 1)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E D is impossible because D can’t be last.  
Word pattern must have:
- E at position 4  
- D somewhere except position 5  
- No R, A, I, S, U, T  
- Must include M (since M(-) says M is in the word, just not at position 1)

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, 3

Let’s try a word that places M and D in new positions while satisfying all constraints.
Candidate structure: _ M _ E _

We need consonants and vowels not yet excluded.  
Good available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, W, Y, plus M and D already required.

A promising test word: MODEL  
- M in position 1 (still allowed)  
- O (allowed vowel)  
- D in position 3 (allowed)  
- E (correct spot)  
- L (new consonant)

Check constraints:
- No R, A, I, S, U, T – OK  
- E at 4 – OK  
- D not at 5 – OK  
- M present – OK  

This tests L as a new letter and re-tests M in position 1 to confirm placement.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: MUTED -> FEEDBACK: M(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓) D(✓)
Guess 3: MODEL -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(x) D(-) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback:

- Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, U, T, O, L
- Required letters: E (fixed at position 4), D (somewhere), M (somewhere)
- Known wrong positions:  
  – M cannot be 1st or 2nd (from MODEL and MUTED)  
  – D cannot be 3rd or 5th (from MODEL and MUTED)  
  – E is correctly at 4th

So D must be in position 1 or 2.  
Slots:  
1: can be D or another allowed consonant  
2: can be D or another allowed consonant  
3: any allowed letter  
4: E (fixed)  
5: any allowed letter except D

Allowed letters left (excluding the forbidden ones and duplicates):  
Vowels: E already used, so only possible new vowel is Y  
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, W, Y, M (must appear), D (must appear)

We need to place both M and D in the word while satisfying the positional constraints.

Let’s try D in position 1 and M in position 3:
D _ M E _

We need a middle letter for position 2 and a final letter for position 5 from the remaining allowed letters.  
Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, W, Y

A good next test would introduce more consonants to narrow the set.  
Let’s pick N for position 2 and K for position 5: D N M E K

This word uses:
- D in position 1 (allowed)  
- N (new letter)  
- M in position 3 (allowed)  
- E at position 4 (correct)  
- K (new letter)  

All letters are allowed and positions fit constraints.

Guess 4: DNMEK -> FEEDBACK: D(-) N(x) M(-) E(✓) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

1. Forbidden letters (never appear): R, A, I, S, U, T, O, L, N, K  
2. Required letters (must appear):
   - E is already locked in position 4.
   - D must appear somewhere, but NOT at positions 1, 3, 5.
   - M must appear somewhere, but NOT at positions 1, 2, 3.

3. Positions left to test:
   - D can only be in position 2.
   - M can only be in position 5.
   - Positions 1 and 3 are still open, but must be filled with letters from the remaining allowed set (excluding the forbidden ones).

4. Remaining allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, P, W, Y  
5. Remaining allowed vowels: Y (only vowel left besides the fixed E).

Given the above, the only possible positions for D and M are:
- D in position 2
- M in position 5

Thus, the word structure is: _ D _ E M

Now, we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 3 from the remaining allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, J, P, W, Y). To maximize information, we should pick letters that are relatively common. Let's pick C for position 1 and H for position 3 to form ""CDHEM"". This uses two new consonants (C and H) to further narrow down possibilities.
