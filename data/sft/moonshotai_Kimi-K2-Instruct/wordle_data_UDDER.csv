For my first guess, I want to choose a word that can help me maximize information gain. A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters that appear in many 5-letter words
2. Include multiple vowels to test vowel positions
3. Have common consonants like R, S, T, L, N

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has the consonants R and S which are among the most frequent in English
- These letters appear in a large percentage of 5-letter words
- It can quickly eliminate many possibilities based on the feedback

From the latest feedback:

UNDER → U(✓) N(x) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

So every letter except N is now:
- in the word  
- in the exact position shown.

That gives us the confirmed pattern:

Position 1: U  
Position 2: ? (must be a letter we haven’t ruled out)  
Position 3: D  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: R  

We also know letters NOT in the word:  
A, O, S, T, I, N.

So the only unknown is position 2.  
Allowed letters (common, not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Let’s plug in the most common consonants remaining:

- C → “UDCER” – invalid (not a word).  
- B → “UDBER” – invalid.  
- G → “UDGER” – invalid.  
- H → “UDHER” – invalid.  
- L → “UDLER” – invalid.  
- M → “UDMER” – invalid.  
- V → “UDVER” – invalid.  
- W → “UDWER” – invalid.  
- B → try “CUBER” but C and U positions are locked.  
- H → try “HUDER” – invalid.  
- B → try “BUDER” – invalid.  
- H → “HUDER” – invalid.  
- V → “VUDER” – invalid.  
- L → “LUDER” – invalid.  
- F → “FUDER” – invalid.  
- G → “GUDER” – invalid.  
- M → “MUDER” – invalid.  
- P → “PUDER” – invalid.  
- W → “WUDER” – invalid.  
- Y → “YUDER” – invalid.  

Wait—simplest valid word that fits is **UDDER** (a real English word).  
Let’s confirm:

- U D D E R  
- D is allowed at 3 ✓  
- R at 5 ✓  
- E at 4 ✓  
- U at 1 ✓  
- No banned letters used.

So the only possible 5-letter word fitting the constraints is UDDER.
