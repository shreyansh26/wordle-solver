For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should contain several of these.

Some popular first guesses include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes C (common), R (very common), A (most common vowel), N (common), and E (most common letter overall). This gives good coverage of common letters while avoiding repeats.

From the feedback:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains: A, E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain: C, N

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position
2. Contains both A and E (but A not in position 3, E not in position 5)
3. Does not contain C or N

Looking at common patterns with R in position 2: words like BRAND, GRADE, FRAME, CRANE (already used), PRANK, etc. Since we know C and N are out, let's think of others.

Good candidates:
- BREAD (B, R, E, A, D) - R in position 2, contains A and E, no C or N
- FREAK (F, R, E, A, K) - same pattern
- GREAT (G, R, E, A, T)

I'll choose GREAT as it uses very common letters and tests T which is also common.
