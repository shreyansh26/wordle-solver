- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A common strategy is to choose a word that contains frequently used letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English.

A good first guess would be a word that uses several of these letters. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, which will provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Feedback from AROSE tells us:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

Since O is somewhere in the word, and none of A, R, S, E are present, I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter O (and not in position 3).
2. Contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good next-guess candidates: words like “POINT,” “CLOUD,” “GLOOM,” “JOINT,” etc., but they must avoid the forbidden letters. After scanning, “POINT” violates it (contains I, which wasn’t ruled out, but let’s check if it uses any forbidden letters). Actually, POINT has P, O, I, N, T — none of A, R, S, E are present, and O is in position 2 (not 3), so this fits. Another option is “COUNT,” but U is acceptable. “DOING” might also work but has I and N.

Let me pick “COUNT.”

- C, O, U, N, T: none are A, R, S, E.
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it just cannot be position 3).

This should give good coverage with new letters.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

Candidate positions:
