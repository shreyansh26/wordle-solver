For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me identify which letters might be in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any, so I can maximize the information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - also great letters
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - strong choice
- ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of possible letters.

From GREEN we just got:
G(x) – G is not in the word.
R(✓) – R is in position 2.
E(✓) – E is in position 3.
E(✓) – second E is in position 4 (already known from TOWER).
N(✓) – N is in position 5.

So the known pattern is:
1: ?
2: R
3: E
4: E
5: N
_ R E E N

We still need to determine the first letter.  
It must be a letter that:
- is not any of the previously ruled-out letters: A, I, S, T, O, W, G.  
- can form a valid 5-letter word with the fixed tail “REEN”.

Common first letters that satisfy this: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, Y.  
Actual English words ending in “REEN”:
- BREEN (rare)
- CREEN (rare)
- DREEN (Scots, rare)
- FREEN (slang)
- PREEN (valid)
- SREEN (invalid, ruled out S)
- etc.

The only common, valid word is “PREEN”.  
It respects every constraint: starts with P (not ruled out), pattern P R E E N, and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore the next logical guess is PREEN.
