For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid letters that are too rare

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It tests 5 unique letters to give maximum information

Other good candidates would be ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AUDIO"", but I'll go with AROSE as it's particularly balanced.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first letter).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not as the first letter.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Letters to include: A (but not in position 1)
Letters to exclude: R, O, S, E

Good next guesses should use new common consonants and vowels. Since A is known to be in the word (but not first), let's try to place A in different positions and use remaining common letters (I, U, N, T, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.).

A strong second guess would be ""TAINT"" - but T is common and we haven't ruled it out yet. However, we might want to avoid T for now since we have limited info. Instead, ""ULNAD"" is too obscure. 

Let's try ""PLAIN"":
- P, L, I, N are all still possible
- A is in position 4 (testing new position for A)
- Uses all new letters except A (which we know is in word)

Another option is ""BLAND"" but B is less common. ""CLAMP"" is similar. 

Actually, ""CABIN"" might be better:
- C, B, I, N are new
- A is in position 2
- Common letters

But let me think simpler - ""PAINT"" uses P, A (position 2), I, N, T. Since we know none of these are excluded except A (which we know is in word), this gives good coverage.

After reconsidering, ""PAINT"" seems optimal as it tests:
- P, I, N, T (all new)
- A in position 2 (new position for known letter)
- All letters are common
