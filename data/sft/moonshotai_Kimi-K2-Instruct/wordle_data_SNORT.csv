### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has O in the 3rd position.
2. The word contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
3. The word does not contain A or E.

Next, we want to test new common letters while respecting the known constraints. A good candidate would include the confirmed O in position 3, and place R and S in new positions, while introducing other common letters (like T, N, L, I, etc.).

Let's try ""FRONT"":
- F: new letter
- R: in position 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so now it's in a new position)
- O: correct position 3
- N: new letter
- T: new letter

This respects all constraints: O is fixed in position 3, R and S haven't been placed in their forbidden positions yet (though we aren't using S here), and we're testing new letters.

From the new feedback on FRONT:
- F is not in the word (x)
- R is still in the word but still in the wrong position (-) — could now be 1, 3, 4, or 5 (3 is taken by O, so 1, 4, 5)
- O is confirmed in the 3rd slot (✓)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — could be 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3)
- T is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓)

So we now know the pattern: _ _ O _ T and the letters R, S, N must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are fixed).

Also, we have ruled out A, E, F.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3 and T in position 5
- Contains R, S, N in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4) in some order
- Contains no A, E, F

Possible permutations for positions 1, 2, 4 are the three letters R, S, N.

Let’s quickly check permutations:
- S N R → SNORT – but has A/E? No, but it has O and T already placed. Wait: SNORT – in positions: S(1) N(2) O(3) R(4) T(5) – R is in 4, which is allowed (not its prior forbidden positions 2). This looks valid.
- S R N → SRONT – not a word?
- R S N → RSONT – not a word
- R N S → RNOST – not a word
- N S R → NSORT – not a word
- N R S → NROST – not a word

The only valid permutation is SNORT.

Let’s confirm: SNORT:
- S: not in position 4 (was position 4 in AROSE) – here it’s 1, so OK
- N: not in position 4 (was position 4 in FRONT) – here it’s 2, so OK
- R: not in position 2 (from AROSE) – here it’s 4, so OK
- O: position 3 ✓
- T: position 5 ✓

This fits all constraints.
