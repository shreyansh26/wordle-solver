For the first guess, we want to choose a word that can give us the maximum amount of information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" because they contain common vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a common starting word that covers popular letters (C, R, A, N, E) without repeating any letters. This should help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second position).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (fourth position).
- C, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ N _
- Letters to exclude: C, A, E.

Now we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as the second letter.
2. Has N as the fourth letter.
3. Does not contain C, A, or E.

Looking at common letters not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let's brainstorm possible words fitting _ R _ N _:
- BRING (B, R, I, N, G) – fits the pattern and excludes C, A, E.
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) – fits the pattern and excludes C, A, E.
- FRONT (F, R, O, N, T) – fits the pattern and excludes C, A, E.

Among these, ""BRING"" uses very common letters and seems like a good guess.

We now have three full rounds of feedback:

- Pattern confirmed: _ R I N _
- Letters that have been eliminated: C, A, E, B, G, D, K
- Remaining letters (from the alphabet minus the eliminated ones):
  F, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts and ends with letters from the remaining set and fits the pattern _ R I N _.

Possible words fitting the pattern:
- FRIND (not a common word)
- FRINK (eliminated K)
- GRIND (eliminated G)
- PRINK (eliminated K)
- PRINT (P, R, I, N, T) — P and T are still available
- TRINE (eliminated E)
- TRINS (eliminated S is ok, but TRINS is plural of TRIN, not common)

The most common valid 5-letter word left is PRINT (P-R-I-N-T).

All letters in PRINT have not been eliminated yet:
- P: not ruled out
- R: confirmed ✓
- I: confirmed ✓
- N: confirmed ✓
- T: not ruled out
