For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters in 5-letter words. A classic strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AUDIO"" is popular because it has four vowels, but I prefer ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - giving good coverage of common letters in various positions.

Let me go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S - very common starting letter
- L - common consonant
- A - most common vowel
- T - very common consonant
- E - most common ending letter

This should give me good information across multiple common letters and positions.

So far we know:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

We still have no information about the letters:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also learned that the vowels A and E are NOT in the word, so the vowels still possible are I, O, U, and maybe Y.

Good strategy now is to test some new consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A nice “second-guess” word that covers several unused common letters and the remaining vowels is “ROUND”:
- R – common consonant
- O – one of the remaining vowels
- U – another remaining vowel
- N – common consonant
- D – common consonant

This will give information on S (because of position), R, O, U, N, D.

What we know so far:
- Letters already ruled out completely: L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D (9 letters gone)
- Letter we know exists but not in position 1: S
- Vowels still possible: I (since A, E, O, U are gone)
- Other consonants still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
1. Uses S but NOT in position 1
2. Uses only remaining possible letters
3. Tests some new consonants and the remaining vowel I

Good candidates would be words like:
- CHIPS
- WHISK
- SWISH
- CRISP

Among these, ""CRISP"" seems good because:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R was already ruled out though (from ROUND), so actually ""CRISP"" is invalid
- ""WHISK"" uses W, H, I, S, K - all still possible letters
- ""SWISH"" uses S twice which is allowed but might not be optimal
- ""CHIPS"" uses C, H, I, P, S - all still possible letters

Between ""WHISK"" and ""CHIPS"", ""CHIPS"" tests C, H, I, P, S which gives good coverage.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters we have eliminated entirely:  
   L, A, T, E, R, O, U, N, D, C, H

2. Letters we know are in the word and their positional clues:  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - P is in the word and IS in position 4.  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1) and NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3). Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
     – However, we also know I is not in position 3, so position 3 could still be S.

3. Vowels still possible: only I is confirmed; Y could also act as a vowel if needed.  
   Other vowels (A, E, O, U) are already ruled out.

4. Consonants not yet tested: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, I, P (with P locked in position 4).  
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters.  
- Places S in position 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).  
- Places I somewhere except position 3.

A promising pattern:  
_ S I P _  or _ I S P _  or _ _ S P _ with I elsewhere.

Let’s look for real words that fit:

- If S is in position 2: _ S _ P _  
  Possible letters for positions 1,3,5: must come from remaining pool (B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) plus I (which can’t be in position 3).  
  Candidates:  
  – BISPY? (not a word)  
  – MISPY? (not a word)  
  – WISPY? (valid word) → W I S P Y  
    – This places I in position 2 and S in position 3.  
    – All letters still allowed.  
    – Provides new letter W and Y.

- If S is in position 3: _ _ S P _  
  Then I must be in position 2 or 5.  
  Example: F I S P Y? (valid) but we already considered WISPY which is stronger.

Therefore, WISPY seems the best next guess.

Check:
- Letters used: W, I, S, P, Y – all allowed.  
- Positions:  
  – I in position 2 (not forbidden).  
  – S in position 3 (not forbidden).  
  – P in position 4 (matches requirement).  
- Eliminates two new letters (W, Y) and tests S and I positions.

Thus we will guess WISPY.
