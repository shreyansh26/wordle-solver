For the first guess, a good strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify multiple vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain high-frequency letters and cover both vowels and consonants. 

I'm going with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
This should give us good initial coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in first position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

So:
- Letters remaining to consider: everything except R, O, S, E
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- We still need to test other vowels (I, U, Y) and consonants

A good next step is a word that:
1. Includes A in a different position
2. Introduces new high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t tried
3. Avoids R, O, S, E

Word like “UNTIL” or “PAINT” would be decent, but since we need A and want to test more consonants, let’s try:

“PAINT”:
- P and N are common consonants not yet tried
- I and A are vowels; A is placed in position 2
- T is a frequent consonant

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
- R, O, S, E, P, T

Letters definitely in the word:
- A (but not in positions 1 or 2)
- I (and it is in position 3)
- N (somewhere; not sure of position)

Positions fixed so far:
- 3rd letter = I

Positions ruled out for A:
- cannot be 1st or 2nd

Letters still available (not yet ruled out):
- B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- plus A and N (which we know are in the word somewhere)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has I in position 3
- uses both A and N somewhere else (A not in 1st or 2nd, N allowed anywhere except the slot it occupies)
- only uses the still-allowed letters

Let’s try a word that places A in the 4th position and N in the 5th:
- _ _ I A N

The first two consonants should be high-frequency ones we haven’t tried yet.  
Good remaining consonants: C, D, G, B, L, M, etc.

The combination “C” + “L” gives us “CLIAN”. That’s not a valid English word.
How about “M” + “A” – but A can’t be 2nd.
How about “C” + “A” – again A can’t be 2nd.
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2.

Try “B” + “L” → “BLIAN” – not a word.
Let’s flip the A to position 5 and N to position 4: _ _ I N A
Then choose two consonants for 1 & 2: C and L → “CLINA” – not valid.
Another consonant pair: M and A – but A can’t be 2nd.
D and A – again A can’t be 2nd.

Let’s instead put A in the 5th position and N in the 1st: N _ I _ A
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4.
Try N + C + I + D + A → “NCIDA” – no.

Another pattern: N not in 1st, A in 3rd? – but I is already in 3rd.
A must be in 4th or 5th.

Let’s try putting N in 1st and A in 4th: N _ I A _
Fill with consonants: N + B + I + A + L → “NBIAL” – no.
N + G + I + A + M – “NGIAM” – no.
How about N + C + I + A + L – “NCIAL” – no.

Let’s try placing A in the 5th slot and N in the 2nd: _ N I _ A
Positions: 1st and 4th still open.
Choose consonants: C and D → “CNIDA” – no.
B and D → “BNIDA” – no.
L and D → “LNIDA” – no.

How about _ A N I _ ? – but I must be 3rd.

Another idea: place A in 4th, N in 2nd: _ N I A _
Consonant choices: C and M → “CNIAM” – no.
B and M → “BNIAM” – no.

Let’s try a valid English word that satisfies:
- 3rd letter = I
- includes A and N
- avoids all disallowed letters

A real word meeting these: “MANIA” – uses M, A, N, I, A
- I is 3rd – matches
- A appears twice (second and fifth), but we only know A must appear at least once
- M is new (allowed)
- N is used in position 4 (allowed)

Let’s check if MANIA is valid English – yes.

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2.

Try “B” + “L” → “BLIAN” – not a word.
Let’s flip the A to position 5 and N to position 4: _ _ I N A
Then choose two consonants for 1 & 2: C and L → “CLINA” – not valid.
Another consonant pair: M and A – but A can’t be 2nd.
D and A – again A can’t be 2nd.

Let’s instead put A in the 5th position and N in the 1st: N _ I _ A
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4.
Try N + C + I + D + A → “NCIDA” – no.

Another pattern: N not in 1st, A in 3rd? – but I is already in 3rd.
A must be in 4th or 5th.

Let’s try putting N in 1st and A in 4th: N _ I A _
Fill with consonants: N + B + I + A + L → “NBIAL” – no.
N + G + I + A + M – “NGIAM” – no.
How about N + C + I + A + L – “NCIAL” – no.

Let’s try placing A in the 5th slot and N in the 2nd: _ N I _ A
Positions: 1st and 4th still open.
Choose consonants: C and D → “CNIDA” – no.
B and D → “BNIDA” – no.
L and D → “LNIDA” – no.

How about _ A N I _ ? – but I must be 3rd.

Another idea: place A in 4th, N in 2nd: _ N I A _
Consonant choices: C and M → “CNIAM” – no.
B and M → “BNIAM” – no.

Let’s try a valid English word that satisfies:
- 3rd letter = I
- includes A and N
- avoids all disallowed letters

A real word meeting these: “MANIA” – uses M, A, N, I, A
- I is 3rd – matches
- A appears twice (second and fifth), but we only know A must appear at least once
- M is new (allowed)
- N is used in position 4 (allowed)

Let’s check if MANIA is valid English – yes.

So the next guess is: MANIA

Let’s synthesize what we’ve learned from all three guesses:

Letters known to be in the word:
- I (position 3, fixed)
- A (must appear once, but we now know it is specifically in position 5)
- N (somewhere, but not yet locked)

Letters known NOT in the word:
R, O, S, E, P, T, M

Positions fixed:
- 3rd letter = I
- 5th letter = A

Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 4

We need three more letters:
- One of them must be N (since N is in the word, feedback was “N(-)” meaning it is in the word but not in position 3; since 3 is I and 5 is A, N must go in 1, 2, or 4)
- The other two letters must be from the still-allowed set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a valid 5-letter English word of the form:
[1][2][I][4][A]

with N appearing somewhere among positions 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s brainstorm:

Option 1: N in position 1
N _ I _ A → N, (consonant), I, (consonant), A
Candidate consonants for 2 and 4: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, etc.
Try N + C + I + D + A → “NCIDA” – invalid.
N + D + I + C + A → “NDICA” – invalid.
N + F + I + L + A → “NFILA” – invalid.
N + L + I + C + A → “NLICA” – invalid.
N + C + I + L + A → “NCILA” – invalid.

Option 2: N in position 2
_ N I _ A
Need consonants for 1 and 4.
Try C + N + I + D + A → “CNIDA” – invalid.
D + N + I + C + A → “DNICA” – invalid.
B + N + I + L + A → “BNILA” – invalid.
L + N + I + C + A → “LNICA” – invalid.

Option 3: N in position 4
_ _ I N A
Need consonants for 1 and 2.
Try C + L + I + N + A → “CLINA” – invalid.
B + L + I + N + A → “BLINA” – invalid.
D + L + I + N + A → “DLINA” – invalid.
C + H + I + N + A → “CHINA” – valid word!

“CHINA”:
- C, H allowed (not yet ruled out)
- I in 3rd ✓
- A in 5th ✓
- N in 4th (allowed, since previous feedback on N was “-” meaning “somewhere else”, not necessarily excluding 4th)
- No forbidden letters

Therefore, the next strategic guess is CHINA.
