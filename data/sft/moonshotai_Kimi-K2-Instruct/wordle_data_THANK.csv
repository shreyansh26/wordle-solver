2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes the very common letters C, R, A, N, E, which should give a good distribution of hits and misses to guide my next guesses. The letters C and N are also fairly common in English words, providing additional coverage.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- C(x) → C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct 3rd position.
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in the correct 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
? ? A N ?

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, E

Now I need a five-letter word with:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- No C, R, or E elsewhere

I’ll pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels to maximize information. A good next probe is “PLANK” because:
- P, L, K are new letters we haven’t tested.
- It fits the _ _ A N _ pattern.

Let’s submit PLANK.

So far we know:

Letters in the word and their correct positions:
- A is 3rd
- N is 4th
- K is 5th

Letters definitely **not** in the word: C, R, E, P, L

So the pattern is: _ _ A N K

We still need to determine the 1st and 2nd letters, using letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates: B, S, T, M, H, D, G, F, I, O, U

We want a word that fits the pattern _ _ A N K and uses only allowed letters.

Possible words: blank, flank, flank, plank (ruled out), spank (uses P), thank (uses T), drank (uses D), frank (uses R), etc.

Let’s pick **BLANK** because it uses B and L, but L was ruled out in PLANK. Oops! So we cannot use L.

Other possible words: flank (uses F), thank (uses T), drank (uses D), spank (uses P), etc.

Let’s try **FLANK** (F and L). L was ruled out in PLANK, so **FLANK** is invalid.

Next candidate: **THANK** (T, H, A, N, K). T and H are new letters.

Let’s check: T, H are not among the ruled-out letters (C, R, E, P, L). This fits the pattern _ _ A N K.
