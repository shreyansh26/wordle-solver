For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A good strategy is to pick a word with:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. A mix of vowels and consonants

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It covers very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere in positions 2–5)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is somewhere in positions 2–5)
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

I now know:
- The letters O, S, E are ruled out.
- The letters A and R are definitely in the secret word, but not in position 1.
- I still have to test other common letters like T, I, N, L, C, etc.

I should pick a word that:
1. Keeps the known letters A and R (but moves them to new positions)
2. Uses fresh, common letters that have not been tested yet
3. Avoids O, S, E

One such word is “TRAIN”:
- T and I and N are common untested letters.
- A and R are placed in new positions (3 and 4 instead of 2 and 3 in “AROSE”).

Let me confirm:
- A is now in position 3 (was 1) – allowed.
- R is now in position 4 (was 2) – allowed.
- T, I, N are new letters.
- No O, S, or E.

So “TRAIN” seems like a strong second guess.

- T, I, N, O, S, E have all been ruled out.

We still need to determine:
- The exact positions of A (already fixed at 3) and R (must be 1, 4, or 5)
- The remaining letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but position 3 is already A)

Remaining common letters not yet tested include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

- Has R in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5)
- Uses untested common consonants

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are out.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is correct in position 3 (so the word is _ _ A _ _).
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - T, I, N are out.

3. DURAL → D(x) U(x) R(-) A(-) L(x)
   - D, U, L are out.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew not 2).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know it's in position 3).

So we now know:
- The word is _ _ A _ _ (A in position 3).
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N, D, U, L.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, K, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Has R in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let's try some options:

Option 1: R in position 1
- R _ A _ _
- Second letter: must be unused (not T, I, N, etc.) - maybe B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Fourth and fifth: similarly, unused letters
- Example: R B A C K → does ""RBACK"" exist? No.
- R B A K E → E is out.
- R C A K E → E is out.
- R M A R K → R is repeated, but allowed? The rules don't forbid repeats, and we know R is in the word (but we don't know if it appears twice). However, ""RMARK"" isn't a word.
- R A M B O → A is already in position 3, can't be in 2. Also O is out.
- R A C K → too short.
- R H A B D → D is out.
- R H A B K → ""RHABK"" not a word.

- R P A C Y → ""RPACY"" not a word.
- R B A C K → ""RBACK"" not a word.
- R B A K K → K repeated, and ""RBAKK"" not a word.
- R G A M Y → ""RGAMY"" not a word.

- R H A G Y → ""RHAGY"" not a word.
- R H A P Y → ""RHAPY"" not a word.

This path is not yielding many valid words. Maybe R is not in position 1.

Option 2: R in position 4
- _ _ A R _
- First, second, fifth letters must be unused.
- Common unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Example: C H A R M → ""CHARM"" – this is a valid word.
- Check letters: C, H, A, R, M – all allowed (A confirmed at 3, R allowed at 4, others not ruled out).
- Other options: B A R K → but A is fixed at 3.
- P A R K → too short.
- P H A R M → ""PHARM"" not common.
- C H A R K → ""CHARK"" is a word (to char).
- C H A R Y → ""CHARY"" is a word.
- C H A R M → ""CHARM"" is the most common.

Option 3: R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R
- First, second, fourth letters must be unused.
- Example: C H A I R → I is out.
- C H A P R → ""CHAPR"" not a word.
- C H A M R → ""CHAMR"" not a word.
- C H A B R → ""CHABR"" not a word.

- C H A K R → ""CHAKR"" not a word.
- C H A Y R → ""CHAYR"" not a word.
- C H A W R → ""CHAWR"" not a word.
- C H A M P → but R must be in 5.

This path is also not yielding obvious valid words. ""CHARM"" with R in 4 seems the best.

Therefore, the next guess is ""CHARM"".
