For the first guess in a Wordle game, it's strategic to choose a word that has common letters and can help gather maximum information. The best first guesses typically include vowels and common consonants. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E) across different positions. This allows us to quickly identify which of these common letters are in the target word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, T, E are all in the correct positions (positions 1,4,5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ T E

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (A is out). Common consonants still possible: R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that fits S _ _ T E, uses only letters not yet ruled out, and helps test new letters is “SPITE”:
- S (✓) stays.
- P is a new consonant.
- I is a new vowel.
- T (✓) and E (✓) stay.

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E) across different positions. This allows us to quickly identify which of these common letters are in the target word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, T, E are all in the correct positions (positions 1,4,5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S _ _ T E

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (A is out). Common consonants still possible: R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that fits S _ _ T E, uses only letters not yet ruled out, and helps test new letters is “SPITE”:
- S (✓) stays.
- P is a new consonant.
- I is a new vowel.
- T (✓) and E (✓) stay.
- Letters in SPITE: S, P, I, T, E — none of L/A which are ruled out.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed pattern:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: T (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 2: any letter that is not L or P (those are eliminated)

The word looks like: S _ I T E

Letters still available for position 2 (consonants or vowels neither L nor P): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, A (A was only ruled out in other positions, so it could still sit in position 2), O, U.

A good choice is a common consonant we haven’t tried yet—R fits well:
- S R I T E → “SRITE” is not a valid English word.
- S M I T E → “SMITE” is a valid word and hasn’t been tried. It uses M in position 2, which is still allowed.

Let’s pick SMITE.

Guess 2: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
Guess 3: SMITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:
- The word pattern is S _ I T E.
- Letters already confirmed NOT in position 2: L, P, M.
- We need a valid English word with this exact pattern.

Common 5-letter words that fit S _ I T E and haven’t been ruled out:
- SKITE  (valid but uncommon)
- SWITE  (not valid)
- SAITE  (rare, variant spelling)
- SCITE  (not a word)
- SHITE  (slang, vulgar)

The clearest valid choice is “SKITE” (a Scots word meaning splash or boast).

So far the pattern is locked to S _ I T E and we have eliminated:
- Position 2 cannot be L, P, M, K.
Still allowed consonants in position 2 include B, C, D, F, G, H, N, R, V, W, Y, plus vowels A, O, U.

Looking for real 5-letter English words that fit the form S ? I T E and haven’t been used:

- SCITE – not recognized as a valid word.
- SWITE – not a word.
- SHITE – vulgar slang; often rejected in dictionaries.
- SLITE – obsolete spelling (rare).
- SAITE – only a rare spelling variant.
- SNITE – archaic verb meaning to blow the nose (very uncommon).
- SUITE – fits perfectly: S U I T E, and none of its letters have been eliminated from the second slot.

“SUITE” is a common, valid word, and “U” has never been ruled out for position 2.
