Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to make a guess that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A popular starting word in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 of the most common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a good chance to get hits on multiple letters and their positions. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers most of the common vowels and the consonant S, which is very common in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A, R, O – all marked “x” → these letters are NOT in the secret word.
- S – marked “-” → S is in the word but in the wrong place (cannot be the 4th position).
- E – marked “✓” → E is in the word AND is in the 5th position.

So the word ends with E, contains S somewhere among positions 1-3, and does NOT contain A, R or O.

Next, I want to test fresh consonants plus the known S. Good consonants to try include T, L, N, C, H, D, M. I’ll also pick a vowel that isn’t A or O; I and U are still available.

A simple template is _ _ _ S E, but S must actually be one of positions 1-3, so I’ll try S _ _ _ E first. A common 5-letter word following that pattern is “STELE” (but it’s a bit obscure) or “STANE” (rare). To maximize letter coverage I’ll instead try a pattern that puts S in position 2 and tests additional new consonants and vowels: “TENSE”.

- T, N, S, and the second E are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It keeps the confirmed E in position 5.
- It places S in position 2 (different from position 4 where it was before).

If T or N get hits, we’ll know their positions; if not, we’ve eliminated more letters.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (but not positions 2, 3, or 4), E (and it must be the 5th letter).  
T appeared in Guess 2 at position 1 with “-”, so T is in the word but not in position 1.  
Therefore the word contains: S, T, E (fixed at position 5), and two more letters yet unknown, neither of which are A, R, O, N.

Possible positions left for S and T:
- S can be 1, 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- T can be 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1,5)

I need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- contains both S and T
- uses no A, R, O, N

Let me look for common 5-letter words satisfying those constraints. One good candidate is “STELE” (but it’s obscure) or “SETTE” (doesn’t fit). Another possibility is “UPSET” – but ends in T, whereas we need E in 5th. A better candidate is “PESTO” but we know O is out. Going letter by letter…

Actual candidate list: SWEET, SWEPT, SLEET, SMELT, SPELT, SPITE, SUITE … let’s check each against the constraints.

- SWEET – uses W (allowed), S, T, E. S in position 1, T in position 4 (allowed), ends in T? No, ends in T – wait, we need the 5th letter to be E. So SWEET ends in T – no good.  

- SLEET – S at 1, L, E at 5, T at 4. Letters used: S, L, E, T. No banned letters. This satisfies everything.

- SPELT – same pattern, but P and L are new. Also valid.

Between SLEET and SPELT, SLEET uses a new vowel E (already known) and a new consonant L, so it’s a good choice to explore the remaining letters.

Therefore I will guess SLEET.

Let's interpret the new feedback from SLEET:

1. S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 1.
2. L(x) – L is not in the word.
3. E(-) – The second E is in the word but in the wrong place (it can't be 3 or 4 either, since we already know E must be position 5 from AROSE).
4. E(-) – same as above.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong place (it can't be 5, but now we know it can't be 4 either).

So we now know:
- The word starts with S and ends with E.
- It contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 is S, 4 is invalid for T, and 5 is E).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, O, N.

Letters used so far that are confirmed:
- S at position 1
- E at position 5
- T must be in positions 2 or 3

The remaining three letters (positions 2,3,4) must be filled with letters we haven't ruled out yet. The available letters are all consonants except the banned ones (A,R,O,N,L) and include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T must be in position 2 or 3, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: T in position 2
Word form: S T _ _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 3 and 4.

Case 2: T in position 3
Word form: S _ T _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 2 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

For ST _ _ E:
- STONE – but O is banned
- STILE – but L is banned
- STEVE – but V and E are allowed, but we have E at 5
- STAKE – but A is banned
- STUPE – P and U allowed

For S _ T _ E:
- SUITE – O is banned
- SMITE – M,I allowed

Among these, common words are:

- SMITE (S _ T _ E)
- SPITE (S _ T _ E)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A, R, O – all marked “x” → these letters are NOT in the secret word.
- S – marked “-” → S is in the word but in the wrong place (cannot be the 4th position).
- E – marked “✓” → E is in the word AND is in the 5th position.

So the word ends with E, contains S somewhere among positions 1-3, and does NOT contain A, R or O.

Next, I want to test fresh consonants plus the known S. Good consonants to try include T, L, N, C, H, D, M. I’ll also pick a vowel that isn’t A or O; I and U are still available.

A simple template is _ _ _ S E, but S must actually be one of positions 1-3, so I’ll try S _ _ _ E first. A common 5-letter word following that pattern is “STELE” (but it’s a bit obscure) or “STANE” (rare). To maximize letter coverage I’ll instead try a pattern that puts S in position 2 and tests additional new consonants and vowels: “TENSE”.

- T, N, S, and the second E are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It keeps the confirmed E in position 5.
- It places S in position 2 (different from position 4 where it was before).

If T or N get hits, we’ll know their positions; if not, we’ve eliminated more letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (but not positions 2, 3, or 4), E (and it must be the 5th letter).  
T appeared in Guess 2 at position 1 with “-”, so T is in the word but not in position 1.  
Therefore the word contains: S, T, E (fixed at position 5), and two more letters yet unknown, neither of which are A, R, O, N.

Possible positions left for S and T:
- S can be 1, 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- T can be 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1,5)

I need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- contains both S and T
- uses no A, R, O, N

Let me look for common 5-letter words satisfying those constraints. One good candidate is “STELE” (but it’s obscure) or “SETTE” (doesn’t fit). Another possibility is “UPSET” – but ends in T, whereas we need E in 5th. A better candidate is “PESTO” but we know O is out. Going letter by letter…

Actual candidate list: SWEET, SWEPT, SLEET, SMELT, SPELT, SPITE, SUITE … let’s check each against the constraints.

- SWEET – uses W (allowed), S, T, E. S in position 1, T in position 4 (allowed), ends in T? No, ends in T – wait, we need the 5th letter to be E. So SWEET ends in T – no good.  

- SLEET – S at 1, L, E at 5, T at 4. Letters used: S, L, E, T. No banned letters. This satisfies everything.

- SPELT – same pattern, but P and L are new. Also valid.

Between SLEET and SPELT, SLEET uses a new vowel E (already known) and a new consonant L, so it’s a good choice to explore the remaining letters.

Therefore I will guess SLEET.

Case 1: T in position 2
Word form: S T _ _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 3 and 4.

Case 2: T in position 3
Word form: S _ T _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 2 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SUITE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, the best strategy is to make a guess that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A popular starting word in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it uses 5 of the most common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a good chance to get hits on multiple letters and their positions. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers most of the common vowels and the consonant S, which is very common in 5-letter words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A, R, O – all marked “x” → these letters are NOT in the secret word.
- S – marked “-” → S is in the word but in the wrong place (cannot be the 4th position).
- E – marked “✓” → E is in the word AND is in the 5th position.

So the word ends with E, contains S somewhere among positions 1-3, and does NOT contain A, R or O.

Next, I want to test fresh consonants plus the known S. Good consonants to try include T, L, N, C, H, D, M. I’ll also pick a vowel that isn’t A or O; I and U are still available.

A simple template is _ _ _ S E, but S must actually be one of positions 1-3, so I’ll try S _ _ _ E first. A common 5-letter word following that pattern is “STELE” (but it’s a bit obscure) or “STANE” (rare). To maximize letter coverage I’ll instead try a pattern that puts S in position 2 and tests additional new consonants and vowels: “TENSE”.

- T, N, S, and the second E are all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- It keeps the confirmed E in position 5.
- It places S in position 2 (different from position 4 where it was before).

If T or N get hits, we’ll know their positions; if not, we’ve eliminated more letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S (but not positions 2, 3, or 4), E (and it must be the 5th letter).  
T appeared in Guess 2 at position 1 with “-”, so T is in the word but not in position 1.  
Therefore the word contains: S, T, E (fixed at position 5), and two more letters yet unknown, neither of which are A, R, O, N.

Possible positions left for S and T:
- S can be 1, 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)
- T can be 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1,5)

I need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- contains both S and T
- uses no A, R, O, N

Let me look for common 5-letter words satisfying those constraints. One good candidate is “STELE” (but it’s obscure) or “SETTE” (doesn’t fit). Another possibility is “UPSET” – but ends in T, whereas we need E in 5th. A better candidate is “PESTO” but we know O is out. Going letter by letter…

Actual candidate list: SWEET, SWEPT, SLEET, SMELT, SPELT, SPITE, SUITE … let’s check each against the constraints.

- SWEET – uses W (allowed), S, T, E. S in position 1, T in position 4 (allowed), ends in T? No, ends in T – wait, we need the 5th letter to be E. So SWEET ends in T – no good.  

- SLEET – S at 1, L, E at 5, T at 4. Letters used: S, L, E, T. No banned letters. This satisfies everything.

- SPELT – same pattern, but P and L are new. Also valid.

Between SLEET and SPELT, SLEET uses a new vowel E (already known) and a new consonant L, so it’s a good choice to explore the remaining letters.

Therefore I will guess SLEET.

<guess>SLEET</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) E(-) E(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's interpret the new feedback from SLEET:

1. S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 1.
2. L(x) – L is not in the word.
3. E(-) – The second E is in the word but in the wrong place (it can't be 3 or 4 either, since we already know E must be position 5 from AROSE).
4. E(-) – same as above.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong place (it can't be 5, but now we know it can't be 4 either).

So we now know:
- The word starts with S and ends with E.
- It contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 is S, 4 is invalid for T, and 5 is E).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, O, N.

Letters used so far that are confirmed:
- S at position 1
- E at position 5
- T must be in positions 2 or 3

The remaining three letters (positions 2,3,4) must be filled with letters we haven't ruled out yet. The available letters are all consonants except the banned ones (A,R,O,N,L) and include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since T must be in position 2 or 3, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: T in position 2
Word form: S T _ _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 3 and 4.

Case 2: T in position 3
Word form: S _ T _ E
Remaining letters must be from the allowed set for positions 2 and 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

For ST _ _ E:
- STONE – but O is banned
- STILE – but L is banned
- STEVE – but V and E are allowed, but we have E at 5
- STAKE – but A is banned
- STUPE – P and U allowed
- STYLE – Y allowed
- STIME – not common
- STUPE is possible but rare

For S _ T _ E:
- SUITE – O is banned
- SMITE – M,I allowed
- SPITE – P,I allowed
- SWATE – A banned
- SCUTE – O is banned
- SKITE – K,I allowed

Among these, common words are:
- STYLE (ST _ _ E)
- SMITE (S _ T _ E)
- SPITE (S _ T _ E)

Let's choose STYLE as our next guess because:
- It uses Y (new letter)
- It places T in position 2 (testing the ST _ _ E pattern)
- It doesn't use any banned letters

- E(✓) – confirms E is the fifth letter.

So we now have:

with T somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 5, and 1 is S).

Letters still banned: A, R, O, N, L, Y  
Letters still untested for positions 2,3,4: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Template: S _ T _ E   or   S _ _ T E.

Let’s try the more common pattern first: S _ T _ E.

Possible common words:

- SPITE – P, I ok
- SUITE – I ok, but O is banned (good, no O)
- SKITE – K, I ok
- SCUTE – O banned
- SWATE – A banned

- S(✓) – correct letter in correct position (1st)
- M(x) – M is not in the word
- I(✓) – correct letter in correct position (3rd)
- T(✓) – correct letter in correct position (4th)
- E(✓) – correct letter in correct position (5th)

So the pattern is now:
S _ I T E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has I in the 3rd position, T in the 4th, and E in the 5th. 

Possible letters for the 2nd position (must not be any of the banned letters: A, R, O, N, L, Y, M):
Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Common 5-letter words matching S _ I T E:
- SUITE (but O is banned)
- SKITE (K is allowed)
- SPITE (P is allowed)
- SCITE (C is allowed)
- SWITE (W is allowed)

Among these, the most common word is ""SPITE"".

Let's verify:
- S(✓) - correct position
- P - not yet tested, not banned
- I(✓) - correct position
- T(✓) - correct position
- E(✓) - correct position

This perfectly matches the pattern.",Guess 6: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓),FAIL
