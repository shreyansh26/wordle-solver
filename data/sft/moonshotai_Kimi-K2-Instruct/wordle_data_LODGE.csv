Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize the chance of getting hits. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are typically vowels and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. 

A good starting strategy is to use a word with these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and likely provide some useful feedback.

Let’s digest the new feedback on TONED:

- T(x) – T is out

- N(x) – N is out  
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it must be in position 5 from AROSE)  
- D(-) – D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (we already have E there), so it must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Summary so far:
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ E
- Known letters to include: O (locked in slot 2), E (locked in slot 5), D (somewhere else)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, T, N
- Still need to test some common consonants (C, L, M, P, B, G, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

I want a word that:

- Uses D in one of the open slots (1, 3, or 4)
- Introduces two or three new common letters

Candidate check:
- DOPEE – invalid (double E outside slot 5)  
- LODGE – invalid (ends in E but has G and L, yet doesn’t fit pattern)  
- COMBE – invalid (B isn’t eliminated, but M and C are new)  
- PODGE – P and G are new, but G is okay; fits: P O D G E → doesn’t place D correctly  
- MODEL – fits M O D E L → 5 letters, but ends in L, not E  
- WODGE – W is uncommon  
- COBDE – invalid

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are typically vowels and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. \n\nA good starting strategy is to use a word with these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". \n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis should give us good coverage of common letters and likely provide some useful feedback.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.  \n- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  \n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  \n- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.  \n- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in the 5th (last) position.\n\nSo we know:\n- Word ends with E\n- O is present somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4)\n- Letters A, R, S are out\n- We still have no info on several other common letters (T, N, L, I, C, etc.)\n\nA good next word should:\n1.

From the latest feedback on BODGE:

- B(x) – not in the word at all  
- O(✓) – correct and already in slot 2  
- D(✓) – correct and in slot 3  
- G(✓) – correct and in slot 4  
- E(✓) – correct and in slot 5  

So the revealed pattern is:  
_ O D G E  

Only the first letter is unknown.  
We need a common 5-letter English word that ends in ODGE.  
Quick scan:

- FODGE – not a real word  
- HODGE – nickname, not standard  
- WODGE – dialectal, not common  
- LODGE – perfectly valid word and common  

Therefore the only common candidate is LODGE. Let’s lock it in.
