For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters and their positions. A good starting word should contain commonly used letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but I'll go with a balanced word that has both common vowels and consonants: ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly identify which of these frequently occurring letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed: E is 5th letter.
   - Confirmed: O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in AROSE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”), and NOT in position 3 (because in CLOVE it was 3rd and again marked “wrong position”).
   - Letters A, R, S, C, V are ruled out.

2. CLOVE → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed again: E is 5th.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in CLOVE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3, so O must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Ruled-out letters so far: A, C, R, S, V.

Therefore possible letters left (excluding ruled-out ones and using the clues):
- Fixed: _ _ _ _ E
- Positions 1 or 4 must contain O.
- L must occupy one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5—but 5 is E, and 2 is already excluded for L, so L could be 1, 3, or 4.
- Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: only I and U, since A is out and O is already placed somewhere.

A good next guess should:
- Put O in the 1st or 4th slot (to test its correct spot).
- Include L in a new position (1, 3, 4).
- Avoid all ruled-out letters (A, C, R, S, V).
- Use other common English letters.

Candidate words:
- If O is 1st: O _ _ _ E → need 3 letters including L somewhere. Example: OLDIE (but D and I untested, and OLDIE uses D, I, L). However, we want to test L in a new position (not 2nd, already tested).
- If O is 4th: _ _ _ O E → but that’s impossible (word ends in OE; few common 5-letter words).

Better: Place O in 1st position, and L in 3rd position to test both letters in new spots. Example: O L D I E → but D and I are guesses. OLDIE is valid (OLDIE is a recognized word meaning “an old person”).

Another candidate: OLDEN (but N not yet tested). OLDEN uses L in 2nd, which is already excluded for L, so no.

OILED fits perfectly:
- O in 1st (new spot)
- L in 3rd (new spot)
- I and D are fresh letters.

Let’s choose OILED.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Ruled-out letters (never appear in the word):
A, R, S, C, V, I, D

Confirmed:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- O must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was marked “wrong position” in OILED when placed first, in CLOVE when placed third, and in AROSE when placed second).
- L must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked “wrong position” when it appeared there in CLOVE and OILED).  The only remaining possibility for L is position 1.
- E is already locked in position 5.

So far: L _ _ _ E, and O must occupy either position 3 or 4 (since 1, 2, 3 are excluded for O, but 3 was just ruled out in OILED, so O must be in position 4).

Thus the pattern is L _ _ O E.

We need two more distinct consonants (or vowels) that have not been ruled out yet and fit common 5-letter patterns.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, plus U (only remaining vowel).

Likely candidates for the second and third positions must be common consonants.  Consider words like:
- L U N O E → not a valid word.
- L U M O E → not valid.
- L U G O E → not valid.
- L U N G E → not valid (G, N, U, etc.).
- L U N G E → no, ends in E but spelling issues.

On reflection, the most common pattern fitting L _ _ O E is probably L U G O E → but is LUGOE a word?  No.

Instead, let’s list valid words that fit L _ _ O E:
- LONGE (a rope used in training horses) – uses O in 4th, N and G untested, fits pattern.
- LOUSE – but S is ruled out.
- LORGE – not a word.
- LODGE – but D is ruled out.

LONGE seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
L – must be in position 1 ✓
O – must be in position 4 ✓
N and G haven’t been used yet ✓
Ends in E ✓

So LONGE is the logical next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the second position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the fifth position.

So we know:
- The last letter is E.
- The letter O is somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; but 5 is taken by E, so 1, 3, or 4).
- We must avoid A, R, S.

I’ll pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Uses O in a new position (1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Uses common remaining consonants.

A good candidate is “CLOVE”:
- C, L, V are common consonants we haven’t tested.
- O is in the third position (a new spot).
- E is fixed at the end.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed: E is 5th letter.
   - Confirmed: O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in AROSE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”), and NOT in position 3 (because in CLOVE it was 3rd and again marked “wrong position”).
   - Letters A, R, S, C, V are ruled out.

2. CLOVE → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed again: E is 5th.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in CLOVE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3, so O must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Ruled-out letters so far: A, C, R, S, V.

Therefore possible letters left (excluding ruled-out ones and using the clues):
- Fixed: _ _ _ _ E
- Positions 1 or 4 must contain O.
- L must occupy one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5—but 5 is E, and 2 is already excluded for L, so L could be 1, 3, or 4.
- Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: only I and U, since A is out and O is already placed somewhere.

A good next guess should:
- Put O in the 1st or 4th slot (to test its correct spot).
- Include L in a new position (1, 3, 4).
- Avoid all ruled-out letters (A, C, R, S, V).
- Use other common English letters.

Candidate words:
- If O is 1st: O _ _ _ E → need 3 letters including L somewhere. Example: OLDIE (but D and I untested, and OLDIE uses D, I, L). However, we want to test L in a new position (not 2nd, already tested).
- If O is 4th: _ _ _ O E → but that’s impossible (word ends in OE; few common 5-letter words).

Better: Place O in 1st position, and L in 3rd position to test both letters in new spots. Example: O L D I E → but D and I are guesses. OLDIE is valid (OLDIE is a recognized word meaning “an old person”).

Another candidate: OLDEN (but N not yet tested). OLDEN uses L in 2nd, which is already excluded for L, so no.

Another: OILED – uses O 1st, I 2nd, L 3rd, E 5th – all positions new for O and L, and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

OILED fits perfectly:
- O in 1st (new spot)

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, plus U (only remaining vowel).

Likely candidates for the second and third positions must be common consonants.  Consider words like:

- L U M O E → not valid.
- L U G O E → not valid.
- L U N G E → not valid (G, N, U, etc.).
- L U N G E → no, ends in E but spelling issues.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LODGE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters and their positions. A good starting word should contain commonly used letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but I'll go with a balanced word that has both common vowels and consonants: ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly identify which of these frequently occurring letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the second position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the fifth position.

So we know:
- The last letter is E.
- The letter O is somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; but 5 is taken by E, so 1, 3, or 4).
- We must avoid A, R, S.

I’ll pick a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Uses O in a new position (1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Uses common remaining consonants.

A good candidate is “CLOVE”:
- C, L, V are common consonants we haven’t tested.
- O is in the third position (a new spot).
- E is fixed at the end.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CLOVE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed: E is 5th letter.
   - Confirmed: O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in AROSE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”), and NOT in position 3 (because in CLOVE it was 3rd and again marked “wrong position”).
   - Letters A, R, S, C, V are ruled out.

2. CLOVE → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
   - Confirmed again: E is 5th.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in CLOVE it was 2nd and marked “wrong position”).
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3, so O must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Ruled-out letters so far: A, C, R, S, V.

Therefore possible letters left (excluding ruled-out ones and using the clues):
- Fixed: _ _ _ _ E
- Positions 1 or 4 must contain O.
- L must occupy one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5—but 5 is E, and 2 is already excluded for L, so L could be 1, 3, or 4.
- Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: only I and U, since A is out and O is already placed somewhere.

A good next guess should:
- Put O in the 1st or 4th slot (to test its correct spot).
- Include L in a new position (1, 3, 4).
- Avoid all ruled-out letters (A, C, R, S, V).
- Use other common English letters.

Candidate words:
- If O is 1st: O _ _ _ E → need 3 letters including L somewhere. Example: OLDIE (but D and I untested, and OLDIE uses D, I, L). However, we want to test L in a new position (not 2nd, already tested).
- If O is 4th: _ _ _ O E → but that’s impossible (word ends in OE; few common 5-letter words).

Better: Place O in 1st position, and L in 3rd position to test both letters in new spots. Example: O L D I E → but D and I are guesses. OLDIE is valid (OLDIE is a recognized word meaning “an old person”).

Another candidate: OLDEN (but N not yet tested). OLDEN uses L in 2nd, which is already excluded for L, so no.

Another: OILED – uses O 1st, I 2nd, L 3rd, E 5th – all positions new for O and L, and only uses letters not yet ruled out.

OILED fits perfectly:
- O in 1st (new spot)
- L in 3rd (new spot)
- I and D are fresh letters.

Let’s choose OILED.

Guess 3: OILED -> FEEDBACK: O(-) I(x) L(-) E(-) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Ruled-out letters (never appear in the word):
A, R, S, C, V, I, D

Confirmed:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- O must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was marked “wrong position” in OILED when placed first, in CLOVE when placed third, and in AROSE when placed second).
- L must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked “wrong position” when it appeared there in CLOVE and OILED).  The only remaining possibility for L is position 1.
- E is already locked in position 5.

So far: L _ _ _ E, and O must occupy either position 3 or 4 (since 1, 2, 3 are excluded for O, but 3 was just ruled out in OILED, so O must be in position 4).

Thus the pattern is L _ _ O E.

We need two more distinct consonants (or vowels) that have not been ruled out yet and fit common 5-letter patterns.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z, plus U (only remaining vowel).

Likely candidates for the second and third positions must be common consonants.  Consider words like:
- L U N O E → not a valid word.
- L U M O E → not valid.
- L U G O E → not valid.
- L U N G E → not valid (G, N, U, etc.).
- L U N G E → no, ends in E but spelling issues.

On reflection, the most common pattern fitting L _ _ O E is probably L U G O E → but is LUGOE a word?  No.

Instead, let’s list valid words that fit L _ _ O E:
- LONGE (a rope used in training horses) – uses O in 4th, N and G untested, fits pattern.
- LOUSE – but S is ruled out.
- LORGE – not a word.
- LODGE – but D is ruled out.

LONGE seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
L – must be in position 1 ✓
O – must be in position 4 ✓
N and G haven’t been used yet ✓
Ends in E ✓

So LONGE is the logical next guess.

This word contains:\n- A (common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (very common consonant)\n- E (the most common letter in English)\n\nThis should help me quickly identify which of these frequently occurring letters are in the secret word and potentially their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the second position.\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the fifth position.\n\nSo we know:\n- The last letter is E.\n- The letter O is somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; but 5 is taken by E, so 1, 3, or 4).\n- We must avoid A, R, S.\n\nI’ll pick a word that:\n- Ends in E.\n- Uses O in a new position (1, 3, or 4).\n- Avoids A, R, S.\n- Uses common remaining consonants.\n\nA good candidate is “CLOVE”:\n- C, L, V are common consonants we haven’t tested.\n- O is in the third position (a new spot).\n- E is fixed at the end.\n- No forbidden letters (A, R, S).\n\n<guess>CLOVE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CLOVE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two pieces of feedback:\n\n1.

However, we want to test L in a new position (not 2nd, already tested).\n- If O is 4th: _ _ _ O E → but that’s impossible (word ends in OE; few common 5-letter words).\n\nBetter: Place O in 1st position, and L in 3rd position to test both letters in new spots. Example: O L D I E → but D and I are guesses. OLDIE is valid (OLDIE is a recognized word meaning “an old person”).\n\nAnother candidate: OLDEN (but N not yet tested). OLDEN uses L in 2nd, which is already excluded for L, so no.\n\nAnother: OILED – uses O 1st, I 2nd, L 3rd, E 5th – all positions new for O and L, and only uses letters not yet ruled out.\n\nOILED fits perfectly:\n- O in 1st (new spot)\n- L in 3rd (new spot)\n- I and D are fresh letters.\n\nLet’s choose OILED.\n\n<guess>OILED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CLOVE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: OILED -> FEEDBACK: O(-) I(x) L(-) E(-) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.\n\nRuled-out letters (never appear in the word):\nA, R, S, C, V, I, D\n\nConfirmed:\n- The word ends with E (position 5).\n- O must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was marked “wrong position” in OILED when placed first, in CLOVE when placed third, and in AROSE when placed second).\n- L must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked “wrong position” when it appeared there in CLOVE and OILED).

From the feedback so far we have locked-in letters:

L _ G _ E  
positions: 1 2 3 4 5

- Position 1: L ✓ (fixed)
- Position 2: O ✓ (fixed)
- Position 3: G ✓ (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown (U was just marked x, so U is out)
- Position 5: E ✓ (fixed)

Letters totally ruled-out (never appear anywhere):  
A, R, S, C, V, I, D, N, U

Thus the open slot (position 4) must be a letter from:  
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

Valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern L O G _ E:  
- LOGEE – not a standard word  
- LOGIE – Scottish “fire”, sometimes accepted  
- LOGME – not a word  
- LOGUE – 5-letter word meaning “speech” (as in prologue/epilogue)  

Only LOGUE uses a consonant (Q) that hasn’t been tested and forms a recognized word.

Hence the next logical guess is LOGUE.
