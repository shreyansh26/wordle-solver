For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will help me quickly eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also strong coverage
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers all vowels except U

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first choice because it includes:
- S (very common in English words)
- L (also common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give me good information about several key letters in their potential positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S – not in the word (x)
- L – not in the word (x)
- A – in the word, but not in position 3 (-)
- T – not in the word (x)
- E – not in the word (x)

That leaves us with the only certainty that the word contains the letter A, and A is **not** in position 3.

We should therefore:
1. Avoid S, L, T, E entirely.
2. Keep A in another position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
3. Prefer to introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, M, C, H, P, B, D, G, F  
Good vowels to try next: O, I, U (since E is out and A is already known to be in)

A balanced word meeting these criteria is “RADIO”:
- R – new, common consonant
- A – already confirmed present; placed in position 2 (different from position 3)
- D – new consonant
- I – new vowel
- O – new vowel

This gives us five fresh letters (except A) and maximizes information gain.

We need two more letters, neither of which is any of the eliminated ones. Common unused consonants are N, C, G, B, F, M, V, etc.

Slot 1: cannot be R (because feedback for R is “-” meaning “in word but wrong position” and R was in slot 1 in RADIO).  
Slot 5: good candidate for R.
