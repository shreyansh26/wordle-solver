For my first word, I want to maximize information gain by using common letters and avoiding duplicates. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it uses 5 distinct common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage across different letter positions.

- R is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:
- Pattern: _ A U N T
- Letters confirmed correct: A (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), T (position 5).
- Only the first letter is unknown.
- Letters we have ruled out: C, R, E, P, I, D.

We need the first letter to be one of the remaining consonants that can start an English word ending in AUNT. Common possibilities:
- B (BAUNT – not a word)
- F (FAUNT – archaic, unlikely)
- G (GAUNT – valid 5-letter word)
- H (HAUNT – valid 5-letter word)
- J (JAUNT – valid 5-letter word)
- L (LAUNT – not a word)
- M (MAUNT – not a word)
- S (SAUNT – archaic/Scots, unlikely)
- V (VAUNT – valid 5-letter word)
- W (WAUNT – not a word)
- Y (YAUNT – not a word)

The most common valid English words are GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT. Since we have only one remaining slot to test, we can choose any of these. Let’s select ""HAUNT"" as it is the most frequent among them.

Known-good letters: A, U, N, T  
Known-bad letters (from earlier guesses): C, R, E, P, I, D, H  
Letters still possible in position 1 must be consonants not yet ruled out.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern *AUNT* and start with a remaining consonant are:

- GAUNT
- JAUNT
- VAUNT

Among these, only one possibility has NOT been tried yet, and that is “GAUNT”.  
(“JAUNT” and “VAUNT” haven’t been tried either, but we only need one.)

Therefore, the next logical guess is GAUNT.

After Guess 5 (GAUNT) we got:

- A ✓ (already known, correct in position 2)
- U ✓ (already known, correct in position 3)
- N ✓ (already known, correct in position 4)
- T ✓ (already known, correct in position 5)

So the pattern is: _ A U N T  
The only remaining consonants that can start an English word ending with AUNT and have not been ruled out are:

- J  →  JAUNT
- V  →  VAUNT

No other starting letter yields a valid 5-letter English word. We have one remaining guess, so we simply pick one of the two.

Between JAUNT and VAUNT, both are valid; JAUNT is slightly more common.  
Thus the final guess must be JAUNT.
