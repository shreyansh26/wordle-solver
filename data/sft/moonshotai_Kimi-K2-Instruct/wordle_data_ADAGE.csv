For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants. Some good options include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A and E (very common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another common vowel)

This combination should help me identify which vowels are present and give me some consonant information as well.

From both clues so far we know:

1. Pattern: A _ _ _ E
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, N, L
3. G is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (it was marked “-”, so it must appear somewhere else: positions 2, 3 is ruled out, 4, or 5, but 5 is E, so 2 or 4
4. Remaining consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, etc.
5. Vowels already placed (A, E), so no more vowels needed

A good next candidate should:
- Keep A and E fixed
- Include G somewhere (positions 2 or 4)
- Use only allowed consonants

Let’s try A G _ _ E with G in position 2.  
Common consonants left: C, H, K, M, P, T  
A promising pattern is A G _ _ E.  
A word that fits: A G A V E – but that repeats A, which is fine, but G in position 2 and V is allowed. However, V wasn’t excluded yet.  

Another: A G I V E – but I and V are still allowed, but uncommon.  

Let’s pick A G A V E or A G I V E? Both are valid, but let’s use “AGAVE” because it’s a known word and fits.

Alternatively, a simpler word: A G L E E— but L is excluded.

Let’s check another: A G O N E – O is excluded.

A G U E – too short.

Actually, “AGATE” is a five-letter word with A-G-A-T-E, but T not excluded. Let’s double-check: pattern A _ _ _ E, G must be in 2 or 4. “AGATE” has G in 2. T hasn’t been used or excluded yet. So let’s go with AGATE.

But wait, we must ensure no excluded letters: A, G, T are allowed (T wasn’t in guesses so far). So “AGATE” is acceptable.

However, AGATE has T in 4th position, which is allowed.

But let’s think of a word with G in 4th: A _ _ G E.  
Example: A M I G E – but not a valid English word.

Another: A B I G E – not valid.

Current knowledge:

1. Pattern so far: A _ _ _ E (A 1st, E 5th are locked)
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, N, L, V
3. G is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (those spots gave “x” or “-”)

Therefore G must be in position 4.

Word skeleton: A _ _ G E

Remaining consonants not yet used or excluded:  
B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, etc.  
(We already know R, S, N, L, V are out.)

We need 2 letters in positions 2 and 3, chosen only from remaining allowed letters.

Valid English words fitting A _ _ G E:
- A C H G E – invalid
- A M I G E – invalid
- A B O G E – invalid
- A C I G E – invalid
- A D A G E – invalid
- A F A G E – invalid
- A H O G E – invalid
- A K I G E – invalid
- A M A G E – invalid
- A P A G E – invalid
- A R I G E – invalid (R excluded)

Let me list every valid 5-letter English word with pattern A _ _ G E:

- ABAGE – not valid
- ADAGE – valid word!  A-D-A-G-E (D and A allowed, no exclusions)
- AFAGE – not valid
- AHAGE – not valid
- ALAGE – L is excluded
- APAGE – not valid
- ASAGE – S excluded
- ATAGE – not valid
- ABIGE – not valid
- ACIGE – not valid
- ADIGE – not valid
- AFIGE – not valid
- AHIGE – not valid
- AKIGE – not valid
- AMIGE – not valid
- APIGE – not valid

Only clear hit so far: ADAGE
- Letters used: A, D, A, G, E → all allowed
- D and second A not excluded
- G now tested in position 4 → will reveal if G is actually there

Therefore best next guess is ADAGE.
