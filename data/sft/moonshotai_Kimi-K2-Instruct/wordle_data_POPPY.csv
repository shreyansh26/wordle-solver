For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give maximum information by covering common letters and letter positions. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word and where they might be positioned.

From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are **NOT** in the word (x).
- O is in the word but **NOT** in position 3 (-).

That leaves us needing a word that:
1. Contains the letter O, but not in the third position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Maintains typical English letter patterns.

Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels still possible: I, U, and O (but O must be elsewhere).

To probe further, I’ll pick a word that:
- Puts O in a different position (say, position 2 or 4).
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.
- Uses other common consonants to gather more information.

Candidate: “CLOUD” – but C is okay, L, U, D are fine; however, this places O in position 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: “POINT” – P, I, N, T are okay, but O is in position 2 again.

Yet another: “COULD” – C, U, L, D are fine, O is in position 2.

I’ll go with “POINT” because it introduces P, I, N, T and keeps O in position 2.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters ABSOLUTELY NOT in the word (x feedback):
A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G

Letters CONFIRMED and LOCKED IN place:
P (position 1)
O (position 2)
Y (position 5)

Current pattern: P O _ _ Y

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining unused letters.  
Remaining letters (excluding the banned ones) include: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z – but of these, only some will form a valid English word with PO _ _ Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit PO _ _ Y:
- PO K E Y – the E is banned.
- PO K A Y – the A is banned.
- PO L L Y – but L is still allowed.
- PO B B Y – B is allowed, but double B seems less likely.
- PO C K Y – K is allowed, C and K are both still possible.
- PO U C Y – U is allowed.

Let’s pick a word that uses two of the remaining letters in positions 3 and 4. A good candidate is “POCKY” – but K is allowed and C is allowed. However, checking if ""POCKY"" is a valid English word – it’s a brand name, but ""POCKY"" itself is not standard. Another candidate is “POOFY” – but F is allowed and so is double O, but we already have O in position 2. Another candidate is “POOKY” – but K is allowed and second O is allowed (but we only need one O in the word, which we already have). 

Let’s try “POCKY” as the next guess, since C and K are still allowed and it fits the pattern.

Wait – but ""POCKY"" uses C and K in positions 3 and 4, which are allowed. However, ""POCKY"" is not a standard English dictionary word. Instead, ""POOFY"" is a valid word, but uses F and O (but O is already used). Another valid word is ""POOKY"" – which uses K and another O. 

But ""POOKY"" is a valid word meaning ""spooky or eerie"". So let’s go with ""POOKY"".

Alternatively, ""POMMY"" – but M is allowed, and M and M are allowed. However, ""POMMY"" is slang and may not be recognized. 

Another valid word is ""POCKY"" – but let me check again. Actually, ""POCKY"" is not a valid English word in most dictionaries. 

Looking again, ""POLYP"" – but P is already used in position 1 and 5. 

Another valid word is ""POCKY"" – but it’s not valid. 

Wait, let me think of other words: ""POOFY"" is valid, but F is allowed, and O is already used. 

""PORKY"" – but R is banned. 

""POOFY"" is a valid word meaning fluffy. It uses F and O in positions 3 and 4. But we already have O in position 2, so position 4 could be another O? But words don’t usually double O like that. 

""POMMY"" – uses M and M. 

""POOKY"" – uses K and O. 

""POOKY"" seems like the best remaining choice, even if it’s slang. Another option is ""POOFY"".

Let me check ""POOFY"": P O O F Y – but we already have Y in position 5, and O in position 2. So positions 3 and 4 would be O and F. 

But ""POOFY"" is a valid word. 

But do we have any constraints on double letters? No. 

""POOFY"" seems valid, using F (allowed) and another O (allowed). 

But maybe ""POOKY"" is better. 

Actually, ""POOFY"" is more commonly recognized. 

I’ll go with ""POOFY"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give maximum information by covering common letters and letter positions. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word and where they might be positioned. Some strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- Common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- Good letter distribution across positions

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are **NOT** in the word (x).
- O is in the word but **NOT** in position 3 (-).

That leaves us needing a word that:
1. Contains the letter O, but not in the third position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Maintains typical English letter patterns.

Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels still possible: I, U, and O (but O must be elsewhere).

To probe further, I’ll pick a word that:
- Puts O in a different position (say, position 2 or 4).
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.
- Uses other common consonants to gather more information.

Candidate: “CLOUD” – but C is okay, L, U, D are fine; however, this places O in position 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: “POINT” – P, I, N, T are okay, but O is in position 2 again.

Yet another: “COULD” – C, U, L, D are fine, O is in position 2.

I’ll go with “POINT” because it introduces P, I, N, T and keeps O in position 2.

2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word and **correctly placed**:

   - O in position 2
3. We still need 3 more letters (positions 3-5).

We know the pattern so far: P O _ _ _

We need to pick three consonants (or possibly U/Y) that:
- Are not in the banned list (A,R,S,E,I,N,T).
- Form a valid 5-letter word starting with PO.

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible PO*** words:
- P O B B Y – not a common word.
- P O C K Y – okay, but “POCKY” is trademarked.
- P O C K S – S banned.
- P O D G Y – valid, uses D, G, Y.
- P O D G Y is a real word meaning “short and fat”.

Let’s try P O D G Y.  
Check letters: P(✓), O(✓), D, G, Y – none are banned.

From the last feedback, we learned the second O in POOFY is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it shows as “-”).

Letters absolutely out: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, F  
Remaining usable letters (positions 3 & 4): B, C, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z, plus the already-known O (but it cannot sit in position 4 again).

We now need two letters—one of which must be O placed in position 3 (the only open spot allowed for it)—plus one more consonant for position 4.

Therefore the word must be P O O _ Y.

We need a consonant for position 4 that is still allowed: B, C, H, K, L, M, U (vowel), V, W, X, Z.

Looking for English 5-letter words that fit POO _ Y:
- P O O C Y – not standard
- P O O K Y – “POOKY” (colloquial but valid)
- P O O L Y – not standard
- P O O B Y – not standard
- P O O M Y – not standard
- P O O V Y – not standard

The only common-enough dictionary entry is “POOKY.”  
Letters: P (allowed), O (allowed), O (allowed), K (allowed), Y (allowed).  
K has never been ruled out and isn’t on the banned list.

Hence, the logical next guess is POOKY.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,POPPY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can give maximum information by covering common letters and letter positions. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants to help identify which letters are in the word and where they might be positioned. Some strategic first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- Common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- Good letter distribution across positions

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, S, E are **NOT** in the word (x).
- O is in the word but **NOT** in position 3 (-).

That leaves us needing a word that:
1. Contains the letter O, but not in the third position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Maintains typical English letter patterns.

Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels still possible: I, U, and O (but O must be elsewhere).

To probe further, I’ll pick a word that:
- Puts O in a different position (say, position 2 or 4).
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters.
- Uses other common consonants to gather more information.

Candidate: “CLOUD” – but C is okay, L, U, D are fine; however, this places O in position 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: “POINT” – P, I, N, T are okay, but O is in position 2 again.

Yet another: “COULD” – C, U, L, D are fine, O is in position 2.

I’ll go with “POINT” because it introduces P, I, N, T and keeps O in position 2.

1. Letters **absent**: A, R, S, E, I, N, T  
2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word and **correctly placed**:
   - P in position 1
   - O in position 2
3. We still need 3 more letters (positions 3-5).

We know the pattern so far: P O _ _ _

We need to pick three consonants (or possibly U/Y) that:
- Are not in the banned list (A,R,S,E,I,N,T).
- Form a valid 5-letter word starting with PO.

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible PO*** words:
- P O B B Y – not a common word.
- P O C K Y – okay, but “POCKY” is trademarked.
- P O C K S – S banned.
- P O D G Y – valid, uses D, G, Y.
- P O D G Y is a real word meaning “short and fat”.

Let’s try P O D G Y.  
Check letters: P(✓), O(✓), D, G, Y – none are banned.

So, new guess: PODGY.

Guess 3: PODGY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters ABSOLUTELY NOT in the word (x feedback):
A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G

Letters CONFIRMED and LOCKED IN place:
P (position 1)
O (position 2)
Y (position 5)

Current pattern: P O _ _ Y

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining unused letters.  
Remaining letters (excluding the banned ones) include: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z – but of these, only some will form a valid English word with PO _ _ Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit PO _ _ Y:
- PO K E Y – the E is banned.
- PO K A Y – the A is banned.
- PO L L Y – but L is still allowed.
- PO B B Y – B is allowed, but double B seems less likely.
- PO C K Y – K is allowed, C and K are both still possible.
- PO U C Y – U is allowed.

Let’s pick a word that uses two of the remaining letters in positions 3 and 4. A good candidate is “POCKY” – but K is allowed and C is allowed. However, checking if ""POCKY"" is a valid English word – it’s a brand name, but ""POCKY"" itself is not standard. Another candidate is “POOFY” – but F is allowed and so is double O, but we already have O in position 2. Another candidate is “POOKY” – but K is allowed and second O is allowed (but we only need one O in the word, which we already have). 

Let’s try “POCKY” as the next guess, since C and K are still allowed and it fits the pattern.

Wait – but ""POCKY"" uses C and K in positions 3 and 4, which are allowed. However, ""POCKY"" is not a standard English dictionary word. Instead, ""POOFY"" is a valid word, but uses F and O (but O is already used). Another valid word is ""POOKY"" – which uses K and another O. 

But ""POOKY"" is a valid word meaning ""spooky or eerie"". So let’s go with ""POOKY"".

Alternatively, ""POMMY"" – but M is allowed, and M and M are allowed. However, ""POMMY"" is slang and may not be recognized. 

Another valid word is ""POCKY"" – but let me check again. Actually, ""POCKY"" is not a valid English word in most dictionaries. 

Looking again, ""POLYP"" – but P is already used in position 1 and 5. 

Another valid word is ""POCKY"" – but it’s not valid. 

Wait, let me think of other words: ""POOFY"" is valid, but F is allowed, and O is already used. 

""PORKY"" – but R is banned. 

""POOFY"" is a valid word meaning fluffy. It uses F and O in positions 3 and 4. But we already have O in position 2, so position 4 could be another O? But words don’t usually double O like that. 

""POMMY"" – uses M and M. 

""POOKY"" – uses K and O. 

""POOKY"" seems like the best remaining choice, even if it’s slang. Another option is ""POOFY"".

Let me check ""POOFY"": P O O F Y – but we already have Y in position 5, and O in position 2. So positions 3 and 4 would be O and F. 

But ""POOFY"" is a valid word. 

But do we have any constraints on double letters? No. 

""POOFY"" seems valid, using F (allowed) and another O (allowed). 

But maybe ""POOKY"" is better. 

Actually, ""POOFY"" is more commonly recognized. 

I’ll go with ""POOFY"".

From every guess so far, the set of letters that are **not** in the word is:
A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, F, K

So for the two remaining blanks (positions 3 and 4) we must pick from the still-allowed letters:  
B, C, H, L, M, U, V, W, Z — plus the fact that another O must be in the word **somewhere**, yet every feedback showed “-” for any extra O, meaning it can’t be in 3 or 4 either.  
That only leaves one possibility: the extra O must be in the word **twice**, but we already have O in position 2, so the *other* O must be in position 3 or 4 *without triggering an “x”*.  
However, every time we placed O in 3 or 4 it was marked “-” (wrong position) rather than “x” (not present).  
Therefore the word actually contains **only one** O — the one locked in position 2 — and the earlier “O(-)” simply meant “letter is present but not here”; it doesn’t force a second O.  
Hence we are looking for two new consonants for positions 3 & 4, none of which appear in the banned list.

Scanning the remaining consonants for common English 5-letter PO _ _ Y words:
- PO B B Y – uses B twice (allowed) → “BOBBY” starts with B, not PO.
- PO B L Y – “PO BLY” not valid.
- PO C H Y – “POCHY” not valid.
- PO L L Y – “POLLY” — P O L L Y.  
  Letters: P(allowed), O(allowed), L(allowed), L(allowed), Y(allowed).  
  None of L, L are banned and it matches the pattern.

“POLLY” is a valid English word and fits every constraint.

However, every time we placed O in 3 or 4 it was marked “-” (wrong position) rather than “x” (not present).  
Therefore the word actually contains **only one** O — the one locked in position 2 — and the earlier “O(-)” simply meant “letter is present but not here”; it doesn’t force a second O.  
Hence we are looking for two new consonants for positions 3 & 4, none of which appear in the banned list.

Scanning the remaining consonants for common English 5-letter PO _ _ Y words:
- PO B B Y – uses B twice (allowed) → “BOBBY” starts with B, not PO.
- PO B L Y – “PO BLY” not valid.
- PO C H Y – “POCHY” not valid.
- PO L L Y – “POLLY” — P O L L Y.  
  Letters: P(allowed), O(allowed), L(allowed), L(allowed), Y(allowed).  
  None of L, L are banned and it matches the pattern.

“POLLY” is a valid English word and fits every constraint.",Guess 6: POLLY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL
