As this is the first guess, we have no prior feedback to base our decision on. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words (vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S, T, N, L)
2. Avoid rare letters (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid English word

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters while being a valid word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Use common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words (vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S, T, N, L)
2. Avoid rare letters (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid English word

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters while being a valid word.

- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) – specifically, E is in the last position (5th)

So now we know:
1. Word ends with …E
2. Contains L somewhere, but NOT in position 2
3. Does NOT contain S, A, or T
4. Only 5 letter word, positions 1-4 need new letters (except L somewhere)

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus L in a new spot)

Good second-guess strategy:
- Keep E in place (position 5)
- Place L in a new spot (1, 3, or 4)
- Introduce other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, I, O, etc.)

A balanced word satisfying these: “OLIVE”
- O, L, I, V, E
- E locked in place
- L moved to position 2 (acceptable since feedback only said it wasn’t in 2 originally)
- Introduces O, I, V which are common enough to give good info

Vowels left: U, Y (sometimes)

Common remaining letters to test: R, N, D, G, C, M, P, B, F, H, K

We want a word that:
- Has E in 5
- Has I in 3
- Has L in 1 or 4
- Uses two new letters in the remaining spots

Try L in position 1: L _ I _ E  
Fill positions 2 and 4 with common unused letters: B and R → LBIRE (invalid)

""CHILE"": C, H, I, L, E  
- E in 5 ✓  
- I in 3 ✓  
- L in 4 ✓  
- C and H are new letters and both common.  
Valid word.

Check constraints against CHILE:
Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)
- C and H are new letters, not yet eliminated.

Another: “DR ILE” – no.

Another: “BR ILE” – B and R.

“BRILE” is a surname or rare variant.

But there is a common word: “FR ILE” is not.

Another: “PR ILE” – no.

Another: “TR ILE” – T is out.

Another: “WR ILE” – W and R.

“WR ILE” is not a word.

Another: “KN ILE” – no.

Another: “GN ILE” – no.

Another: “PH ILE” – P and H, H is out.

Another: “GH ILE” – no.

Another: “RH ILE” – no.

Another: “SH ILE” – S and H are out.

Another: “TH ILE” – T and H are out.

Another: “CH ILE” – C and H are out.

Another: “WH ILE” – W and H, H is out.

Another: “PH ILE” – H is out.

Another: “QU ILE” – no.

Another: “GU ILE” – G and U, but U is a vowel.

“GUILE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Check if U and G are available – they are.

“GUILE”:
- G: new, not eliminated
- U: new, not eliminated
- I: correct position
- L: correct position
- E: correct position

So pattern: G U I L E → “GUILE”

Is “GUILE” a valid common English word? Yes – it means sly or cunning.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Use common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words (vowels like A, E, I and consonants like R, S, T, N, L)
2. Avoid rare letters (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain
3. Be a valid English word

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters while being a valid word.

- S: not in the word at all (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) – specifically, E is in the last position (5th)

So now we know:
1. Word ends with …E
2. Contains L somewhere, but NOT in position 2
3. Does NOT contain S, A, or T
4. Only 5 letter word, positions 1-4 need new letters (except L somewhere)

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus L in a new spot)

Good second-guess strategy:
- Keep E in place (position 5)
- Place L in a new spot (1, 3, or 4)
- Introduce other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, I, O, etc.)

A balanced word satisfying these: “OLIVE”
- O, L, I, V, E
- E locked in place
- L moved to position 2 (acceptable since feedback only said it wasn’t in 2 originally)
- Introduces O, I, V which are common enough to give good info

Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, O, V.

We need two more distinct letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) that haven’t been tried yet and are among the remaining alphabet.

Using the template: _ _ I _ E

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: U, Y (sometimes)

Common remaining letters to test: R, N, D, G, C, M, P, B, F, H, K

We want a word that:
- Has E in 5
- Has I in 3
- Has L in 1 or 4
- Uses two new letters in the remaining spots

Try L in position 1: L _ I _ E  
Fill positions 2 and 4 with common unused letters: B and R → LBIRE (invalid)  
Try N and K → LN IKE (invalid)  
Try D and R → LDIRE (invalid)

Try L in position 4: _ _ I L E  
We need letters for positions 1 and 2.  
Try F and R → FRILE (valid, but uncommon)  
Try C and R → CRILE (valid but often a surname)  
Try P and R → PRILE (not common)  
Try N and R → NRILE (invalid)  
Try B and R → BRILE (invalid)

A more common word: ""CHILE"" – but we already eliminated H (not used yet) but we haven't used C and H. But O was eliminated and we haven't used C or H yet.  
""CHILE"": C, H, I, L, E  
- E in 5 ✓  
- I in 3 ✓  
- L in 4 ✓  
- C and H are new letters and both common.  
Valid word.

Check constraints against CHILE:
Positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)
- C and H are new letters, not yet eliminated.
- L is now in position 4 – allowed (wasn't here before).
- I confirmed in 3, E confirmed in 5.

Common English words matching _ _ I L E:

- KRILE (no)
- PRILE (no)

- BRILE still feels shaky.

Another common word: “GRILE” is not standard.

Real common word: “WHILE” – but H is eliminated.

Another: “SPILE” – S and P are available, I, L, E in place. S is eliminated.

Wait, let’s list real words ending “ILE”:

- FILE (but needs 5 letters)
- PILE + E? No
- STILE – S and T eliminated

Another: “FRILE” – no.

Actually, a common word is “BRILE” but it’s rare.

Another: “DRILE” – no.

But “PRILE” is not a word.

The only valid common 5-letter word seems to be “BRILE” but it’s obscure.

Another thought: perhaps “F” and “R” – FRILE is not valid.

But actually, there is a common word: “B R I L E” is “BRILE” but not standard.

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern _ _ I L E.

Another: “WH ILE” – W and H, H is out.

Another: “PH ILE” – H is out.

Another: “QU ILE” – no.

Another: “GU ILE” – G and U, but U is a vowel.

“GUILE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Check if U and G are available – they are.

“GUILE”:
- G: new, not eliminated
- U: new, not eliminated
- I: correct position
- L: correct position
- E: correct position

So pattern: G U I L E → “GUILE”

Is “GUILE” a valid common English word? Yes – it means sly or cunning.

- U (position 2) is not in the word (x)
- I (position 3) is correct (✓)
- L (position 4) is correct (✓)
- E (position 5) is correct (✓)

So the locked-in pattern is: _ _ I L E

Letters already eliminated: S, A, T, O, V, C, H, G, U

Remaining available consonants: B, D, F, K, M, N, P, Q, R, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining available vowels: none (only E, I are present; U, A, O are out)

We just need two different consonants for positions 1 and 2 that haven’t been tried yet and that make a valid English word ending …I L E.

Real 5-letter words matching _ _ I L E:

- BRILE – B and R (valid, if rare)
- DRILE – D and R (not standard)
- FRILE – F and R (not standard)
- KRILE – K and R (not standard)
- PRILE – P and R (not standard)
- NRILE – N and R (invalid)
- MRILE – M and R (invalid)
- TRILE – T is out
- WRILE – W and R (invalid)

The only actual dictionary entry among these is “BRILE” (a dialectal or obsolete spelling of “brill”; acceptable in most word lists).

Hence we test BRILE.

So far we know the word ends in …I L E (positions 3-5 locked).

Letters we have tried and are **eliminated**:
S, A, T, O, V, C, H, G, U, B, R.

We still need two **new** consonants for positions 1 and 2.

Available consonants not yet used:
D, F, K, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter word: _ _ I L E.

Check the remaining consonants:

- D + (?) → DRILE is invalid (R is out) and no other common pair starts with D.
- F + (?) → FRILE is invalid.
- K + (?) → KRILE is invalid.
- M + (?) → MRILE invalid.
- N + (?) → NRILE invalid.
- P + (?) → PRILE invalid.
- W + (?) → WRILE invalid.
- Q + (?) → QRILE invalid.
- X, Y, Z give no valid words.

The only remaining plausible consonant pair that forms a recognized English word is **D** and **N** in the order **D N I L E**, but that is not a valid word.

Wait – “F” and “N” together? **FNILE** invalid.

Actually, the only *standard* dictionary entry left that fits is **DRILE**, but that’s not a word.

But there is one more common 5-letter word ending “…I L E” using letters we haven’t tried yet: **F** and **I**? No, **F I I L E** is invalid.

Wait – **P** and **I**? No.

Let me scan systematically:

- **D I I L E** invalid.
- **K I I L E** invalid.
- **M I I L E** invalid.
- **N I I L E** invalid.
- **P I I L E** invalid.
- **W I I L E** invalid.

The only remaining **valid** 5-letter word that ends in I L E and uses previously unused consonants is **DWILE** – an actual, though dialectal, English word referring to a dish-cloth or mop.

Both D and W are still available.

So we test **DWILE**.
