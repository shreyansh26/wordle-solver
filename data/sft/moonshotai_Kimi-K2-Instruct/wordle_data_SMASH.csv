My first guess should be a strategic choice that maximizes information gain. I'll use a word that contains common letters in the English language to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good starting word should use these common letters while avoiding repeats to maximize coverage. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me 5 unique, high-frequency letters to work with in my first guess.

From the latest feedback on CHADS:

- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (redundant confirmation since we already know S is at position 5).

Current knowledge:
1. Word structure: _ _ A _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed).
2. Forbidden letters from all guesses: R, O, E, P, L, N, C, D.
3. H is in the word but cannot be at position 2.

Possible positions for H: positions 1, 2, or 4. But since H(-) at position 2, it must be in 1 or 4.

Remaining common letters to use (excluding forbidden ones): B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: Any allowed letter (but H is possible here since it's not in position 2).
- Position 2: Any allowed letter (but H is possible here if it's not in position 2 - wait, H(-) means H is in the word but not at position 2. So H must be in position 1 or 4.
- Position 4: Any allowed letter (H could also be here).

Let's consider:
- H could be at position 1 or 4.
- We need to use new, common letters.

A good candidate is ""GHAST"":
- G: new letter, common.
- H: possible at position 2, but H(-) means it's in the word but not at position 2. So H must be at 1 or 4. This word has H at 2, which contradicts the feedback. So GHAST is invalid.

Next: ""SHAKY"" – but it's 5 letters and ends with Y, not S.

Wait, we need _ _ A _ S.

So position 4 must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet and isn't forbidden. H must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try ""BHAMS"" – but BHAMS isn't a valid English word.

Next: ""SHAMS"" – S is already at position 5, and position 1 is S, but S(-) from CHADS is redundant.

Actually, let's rethink: H must be in the word but not at position 2. Since the word is _ _ A _ S, H can only be at position 1 or 4.

Let's try ""HABAS"" – but H, A, B, A, S – A is repeated at 3 and 4, which is allowed but not optimal.

Next: ""HAMAS"" – same issue.

Next: ""HAGAS"" – H, A, G, A, S – same issue.

Next: ""HAHAS"" – invalid.

Next: ""HANKS"" – N is forbidden.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The 5th letter is S.
2. A is in the word but not in position 1.
3. R, O, E are not in the word.
4. S is already placed at the end.

We need a word that:

- Does not contain R, O, E.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess would use new common consonants and place A in a different position. Let's try ""PLANS"":

3. Still possible letters (common ones in priority): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant or vowel for position 4, avoiding the forbidden letters and using common choices.

Good candidates:
- Position 4: Common letters left include D, T, C, K, M, etc.
- Position 1-2: Common consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses frequently occurring remaining consonants and fits the pattern.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>My first guess should be a strategic choice that maximizes information gain. I'll use a word that contains common letters in the English language to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. According to letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good starting word should use these common letters while avoiding repeats to maximize coverage. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter)

This gives me 5 unique, high-frequency letters to work with in my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The 5th letter is S.
2. A is in the word but not in position 1.
3. R, O, E are not in the word.
4. S is already placed at the end.

We need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A somewhere (positions 2-4).
- Does not contain R, O, E.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess would use new common consonants and place A in a different position. Let's try ""PLANS"":
- P (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- A (in position 3, different from position 1)
- N (new letter)
- S (✓ already confirmed)

<guess>PLANS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on PLANS:

- P(x) → P is not in the word
- L(x) → L is not in the word
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N(x) → N is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (though we already know from Guess 1 that S is in the correct position 5; this is a minor redundancy)

Current knowledge:

1. Word shape: _ _ A _ S (position 3 = A, position 5 = S)
2. Forbidden letters accumulated so far: R, O, E, P, L, N
3. Still possible letters (common ones in priority): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant or vowel for position 4, avoiding the forbidden letters and using common choices.

Good candidates:
- Position 4: Common letters left include D, T, C, K, M, etc.
- Position 1-2: Common consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses frequently occurring remaining consonants and fits the pattern.
A balanced word: CHAOS – but O is already forbidden.
Next: CLASH – L is forbidden.
Next: BRASS – R is forbidden.
Next: CLASS – L is forbidden.
Next: CRASH – R is forbidden.
Next: GRASP – R and P are forbidden.
Next: CHADS – C, H, A, D, S → A is in position 3, S in 5, no forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
Guess 3: CHADS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) A(✓) D(x) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback on CHADS:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- H(-) → H exists in the word but is not in the correct position (currently placed at position 2).
- A(✓) → A is in the correct position (position 3), confirming the pattern _ _ A _ S.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (redundant confirmation since we already know S is at position 5).

Current knowledge:
1. Word structure: _ _ A _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed).
2. Forbidden letters from all guesses: R, O, E, P, L, N, C, D.
3. H is in the word but cannot be at position 2.

Possible positions for H: positions 1, 2, or 4. But since H(-) at position 2, it must be in 1 or 4.

Remaining common letters to use (excluding forbidden ones): B, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: Any allowed letter (but H is possible here since it's not in position 2).
- Position 2: Any allowed letter (but H is possible here if it's not in position 2 - wait, H(-) means H is in the word but not at position 2. So H must be in position 1 or 4.
- Position 4: Any allowed letter (H could also be here).

Let's consider:
- H could be at position 1 or 4.
- We need to use new, common letters.

A good candidate is ""GHAST"":
- G: new letter, common.
- H: possible at position 2, but H(-) means it's in the word but not at position 2. So H must be at 1 or 4. This word has H at 2, which contradicts the feedback. So GHAST is invalid.

Next: ""WHATS"":
- W: new letter.
- H: at position 2, but H(-) means it can't be at 2. Invalid.

Next: ""THAWS"":
- T: new letter, common.
- H: at position 2, but H(-) means it can't be at 2. Invalid.

Next: ""KHAKS"" – but K, H, A, K, S – K is repeated and position 3 is A, position 5 is S. But we need unique letters where possible.

Next: ""SHAKY"" – but it's 5 letters and ends with Y, not S.

Wait, we need _ _ A _ S.

So position 4 must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet and isn't forbidden. H must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try ""BHAMS"" – but BHAMS isn't a valid English word.

Next: ""SHAMS"" – S is already at position 5, and position 1 is S, but S(-) from CHADS is redundant.

Actually, let's rethink: H must be in the word but not at position 2. Since the word is _ _ A _ S, H can only be at position 1 or 4.

Let's try ""HABAS"" – but H, A, B, A, S – A is repeated at 3 and 4, which is allowed but not optimal.

Next: ""HAMAS"" – same issue.

Next: ""HAGAS"" – H, A, G, A, S – same issue.

Next: ""HAHAS"" – invalid.

Next: ""HANKS"" – N is forbidden.

Next: ""HAWKS"" – W is new, K is new, H at position 1. Let's check:
- H at 1: allowed (not at 2)
- A at 3: ✓
- W at 2: new
- K at 4: new
- S at 5: ✓
- No forbidden letters.

HAWKS seems valid.

Step 1 – What the new feedback tells us  
BAHTS → B(x) A(-) H(-) T(x) S(-)  
- B is not in the word.  
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (contradicts our earlier lock).  
- H is in the word but not in position 4.  
- T is not in the word.  
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (contradicts our earlier lock).

Step 2 – Reconciling the locks  
Previous guesses already had:  
- Guess 1 (AROSE): S(✓) = S is in position 5.  
- Guess 2 (PLANS): A(✓) = A is in position 3.  

These earlier “✓” confirmations are definitive; later “-” symbols for those exact positions are simply redundant.  
So we still know:  
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ S  
- Letters NOT in the word (from all x marks): R, O, E, P, L, N, C, D, W, K, B, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word (from “-” marks that aren’t in the fixed positions): H must appear somewhere except positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (all have been ruled out by “-”) … yet H can’t be in position 3 because that’s A.  

Step 3 – Conclusion  
There is **no possible position left for H** that satisfies every “-” result.  
Therefore the feedback chain is internally inconsistent; no 5-letter English word can satisfy every symbol shown.  
We cannot propose a valid next guess under these constraints.

The accumulated feedback implies **no 5-letter English word can satisfy every symbol given** (H has nowhere left to go).  
In a real game I would report this contradiction to the host; since I must still provide a 5-letter guess, I’ll submit the closest forced pattern:
