- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we received:
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x) – R is not in the word.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

Summary of constraints so far:
1. A is present but not in position 1.
2. R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.
3. Unknown: positions of the remaining letters.

Because we now know A is the only vowel (since E and O are out), the word must contain at least one other vowel, but the only other possible vowels are I and U. We also know the letters NOT to use: R, O, S, E.

A good next guess should introduce new letters that haven’t been tested yet while keeping the A somewhere it hasn’t been (positions 2-5). A common 5-letter word that uses A, keeps it out of position 1, and uses fresh consonants is “PAINT”.

Collecting all information so far:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(-)  → A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x) → R, O, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: PAINT  
P(x) → P is not in the word.  
A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 2.  
I(x) N(x) T(x) → I, N, T are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word has A in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, N, T.
- Vowels still available: U and sometimes Y (but Y is rarely the only remaining vowel).
- Consonants still untested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we know A is fixed in position 2, we have pattern _A___.
We need three more consonants plus one more vowel or consonant.

We have not tested U yet, so let’s place U somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5) and choose consonants for the other spots.

A common pattern that satisfies the constraints: C A U L K.

C – untested consonant  
A – known to be in position 2  
U – untested vowel  
L – untested consonant  
K – untested consonant
