- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters, particularly vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of frequently used letters to work with.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of frequently used letters to work with.

3. S, L, T are not in the word at all.
4. We still have 4 positions to fill with letters we haven’t eliminated.

Letters we have not ruled out yet:
All letters except S, L, T.

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Contains A but not in position 3.
- Avoids S, L, T.

I’ll try focusing on common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is CRANE:
- C, R, N, A, E.
- E is in the correct position.
- A is in position 2, which is allowed because it’s not in position 3.

From the newest feedback (CADGE):

1. C is correct in position 1 (✓) – already known.
2. A is now correct in position 2 (✓) – so the word starts “CA”.
3. D is not in the word (x).
4. G is not in the word (x).
5. E is correct in position 5 (✓) – already known.

So the word is exactly:  
C A _ _ E

Letters still allowed (have not been marked x anywhere):  
B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(but we also know from earlier that H is somewhere, because it appeared as “-” in CHAFE; therefore H must occupy either position 3 or 4).

Hence the remaining pattern is CA H _ E or CA _ H E.

Looking for common 5-letter English words fitting CA _ _ E with H in position 3 or 4:

- CACHE – repeats C (invalid, C already used).  
- CAHVE – not a word.  
- CAVHE – not a word.  
- CAPHE – not a word.  
- CAWHE – not a word.  
- CAHME – not a word.  
- CAHPE – not a word.  
- CAHSE – S eliminated.  
- CAHEM – not the right length.  

The only valid candidate left that fits all constraints is CACHE, but it repeats the letter C, which we already have in position 1.  
Wait, let me double-check: the word must be C A _ _ E, not necessarily C A H _ E.  
But we know H must appear once somewhere (from CHAFE feedback).  

Re-scanning valid words:

- CABLE – L eliminated.

- CASTE – S and T eliminated.  
- CAVIE – not a standard word.  
- CAWKE – not standard.  
- CAKEY – Y at the end?  
- CAPEK – not a word.  

Wait – “CACHE” does repeat C but is actually still valid as a word; however, Wordle rules allow repeated letters unless they’ve been ruled out. In our case, C is already fixed in position 1, and there’s no info preventing a second C.  

But let’s check: CACHE → C A C H E  
Positions: 1 C ✓, 2 A ✓, 3 C (not ruled out), 4 H (must appear somewhere; this satisfies the earlier “H is in the word”), 5 E ✓.

No eliminated letters are used, and all constraints are met.

- CAVHE – not a word.  
- CAPHE – not a word.  
- CAWHE – not a word.  
- CAHME – not a word.  
- CAHPE – not a word.  
- CAHSE – S eliminated.  
- CAHEM – not the right length.  

The only valid candidate left that fits all constraints is CACHE, but it repeats the letter C, which we already have in position 1.  
Wait, let me double-check: the word must be C A _ _ E, not necessarily C A H _ E.  
But we know H must appear once somewhere (from CHAFE feedback).  

Re-scanning valid words:

- CABLE – L eliminated.  
- CADRE – R eliminated.  
- CAFFE – F eliminated.  
- CALVE – L eliminated.  
- CAMBE – not a standard word.  
- CANOE – N eliminated.  
- CAPER – R eliminated.  
- CARET – R and T eliminated.  
- CARVE – R eliminated.  
- CASTE – S and T eliminated.  
- CAVIE – not a standard word.  
- CAWKE – not standard.  
- CAKEY – Y at the end?  
- CAPEK – not a word.  

Wait – “CACHE” does repeat C but is actually still valid as a word; however, Wordle rules allow repeated letters unless they’ve been ruled out. In our case, C is already fixed in position 1, and there’s no info preventing a second C.  

But let’s check: CACHE → C A C H E  
Positions: 1 C ✓, 2 A ✓, 3 C (not ruled out), 4 H (must appear somewhere; this satisfies the earlier “H is in the word”), 5 E ✓.

No eliminated letters are used, and all constraints are met.",Guess 5: CACHE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) C(✓) H(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
