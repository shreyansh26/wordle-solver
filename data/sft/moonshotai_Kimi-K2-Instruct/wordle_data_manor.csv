For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters in English. This gives us maximum coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

Another strong candidate would be ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"", but AROSE seems slightly better as it includes the letter O which is also very common. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

- O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.

- Does not contain S or E.
- Contains A, R, and O somewhere, but not in their previous positions (A not in 1, R not in 2, O not in 3).
- Uses new letters to gain more information.

A strong word that includes A, R, O plus common new letters would be “NORMA” or “CORAL” or “AROUND”. However, since R can’t be in position 2 and O can’t be in position 3, let’s check:
- “CORAL”: C (new), O (in word, but position 2 is allowed for O since it was only excluded from position 3), R (in word, position 3 is allowed), A (in word, position 4 is allowed), L (new). This seems good.

We now have two bits of new, extremely useful information:

1. A is in the word **and is in position 2**.  
   (From RADIO: A(✓) in position 2.)

2. R, O are still confirmed to be in the word, but their positions are still unknown.

Positional bans so far:
- A: cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from AROSE and CORAL) – already satisfied since we now know A is in position 2.
- R: cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and CORAL).
- O: cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and CORAL).

Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, C, L, D, I.

Remaining known letters: A (fixed in position 2), R, O (somewhere else), plus we need a new set of consonants to test.

We therefore need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- Exactly one each of R and O in remaining slots (1, 3, 4, 5), respecting their positional bans.
- The remaining two letters must be from the unused common consonants: T, N, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s list the available positions for R and O:

R cannot be 2 or 3, so R may be in 1, 4, 5.  
O cannot be 2 or 3, so O may be in 1, 4, 5.  

We must place one R and one O among positions 1, 4, 5, and add two brand-new consonants in the remaining two slots.

A good, common combination is to try putting R and O in positions 4 and 5 (or 1 and 4, etc.) while filling the remaining slots with T and N, which are very common consonants.

A word that does this while sounding natural is “BARON”:
- B (new letter)
- A (position 2, ✓)
- R (position 3 – but R is banned from 3) – Oops, that fails.

Try “TAROT” – but T, A, R, O, T: duplicate T and O would appear twice, and we have no evidence duplicates are allowed.

Try “MORAL” – but L is banned.

How about “GROAN”?
- G, R, O, A, N
- Positions: G(1) R(2) O(3) A(4) N(5) – R at 2 is banned.

We need to keep A fixed at 2.

A valid pattern is:
- Position 1: new consonant
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: new consonant
- Position 4: R or O
- Position 5: R or O (whichever left)

Let’s try “BARGE” – but E is banned.

Try “PARTY” – but Y is uncommon and P, T are ok, but we need to include R and O.

Best is to place R and O in positions 1 and 4 or 1 and 5.

Try “GRANT” – but N, T are new, but we need to include O.

We need R and O both present.

Try “FRONT” – fails R in 2.

Try “FROND” – D banned.

Try “MORON” – duplicate O and N, but we don’t know about duplicates.

Instead, let’s systematically build a word with A in position 2, one R and one O, and two new consonants.

Possible word skeleton:
- 1: new consonant (T, N, B, M, P, G, etc.)
- 2: A
- 3: new consonant
- 4: R or O
- 5: R or O (whichever not used in 4)

For example:
- T A B O R – T(1) A(2) B(3) O(4) R(5)
  - R is in 5 (allowed: 1,4,5)
  - O is in 4 (allowed: 1,4,5)
  - B and T are new consonants.

From Guess 4 (TABOR) we now know:

- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓)
- O is confirmed in position 4 (✓)
- R is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the word structure so far is: _ A _ O R

We also know letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, C, L, D, I, T, B.

We need to find two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3 from the remaining unused common letters. The remaining common consonants are: N, G, M, P, F, K, H, etc.

Let's think of valid 5-letter words that fit _ A _ O R:

- G A M O R (but GAMOR isn't a valid word)
- H A M O R (HAMOR isn't valid)
- N A G O R (NAGOR isn't valid)
- F A V O R (F is allowed, V hasn't been tested, R is already confirmed)
- N A V O R (NAVOR isn't valid)
- M A N O R (MANOR is a valid word)

Looking at MANOR:
- M (position 1) - new letter
- A (position 2) - confirmed ✓
- N (position 3) - new letter
- O (position 4) - confirmed ✓
- R (position 5) - confirmed ✓

All letters used (M, A, N, O, R) haven't been eliminated, and MANOR is a valid English word. This seems to be the correct word.

Given the confirmed positions from previous guesses:
