For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. I'll pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening choice because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another frequent letter)

This should give good coverage to help narrow down the secret word.

So far we have:

- Letters not in the word at all: C, R, A, S, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: N, E, O (each marked ""-"" once so far, meaning each is in the word but in the wrong spot in the guesses made)

We also know:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or in position 3 (from STONE) → N must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or in position 2 (from STONE) → E must be in 1, 3, or 4.
- O cannot be in position 3 (from STONE) → O must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no C, R, A, S, T)
- Contains N, E, O (since each has been confirmed present)
- Places them in legal positions

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: D, L, M, P, U, I, G, B, F, H, K, Y, W, etc.

Let’s try to build a word with positions that satisfy all constraints:

Possible positions:
- N: 1, 2, 5
- E: 1, 3, 4
- O: 1, 2, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word using N, E, O plus two more letters from the allowed set.

  - U (1) – new letter
  - N (2) – allowed position for N
  - I (3) – new letter
  - O (4) – allowed position for O
  - N (5) – allowed position for N
But this has N twice and we don’t know yet if letters can repeat. It might be safer to avoid repeats for now.

Another good choice is “DEMON”:
- D, M are new letters.
- Positions:
  - D (1) – new
  - E (2) – but E cannot be in position 2 (from STONE feedback), so this is invalid.

“ENDOW”:

I\'ll pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening choice because it includes:\n- C and R (common consonants)\n- A and E (common vowels)\n- N (another frequent letter)\n\nThis should give good coverage to help narrow down the secret word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n\nC(x) – C is not in the word.  \nR(x) – R is not in the word.  \nA(x) – A is not in the word.  \nN(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).  \nE(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Must contain N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.\n- Must not contain C, R, or A.\n\nGood remaining consonants to test: T, S, L, D, M, etc.  \nGood vowels: O, I, U.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that uses N and E in new positions, avoids the banned letters, and ideally tests new common consonants.

From the latest feedback on ENDOW:

- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D(-) – D is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position 4.
- W(x) – W is not in the word.

So we now know:

Required letters: E, N, D, O (with O fixed in position 4)
Forbidden positions:
  – E ≠ 1,5 (from CRANE and STONE)
  – N ≠ 2,3,4
  – D ≠ 3
  – O = 4 (fixed)

Allowed positions for each:
  – E: 2 or 3
  – N: 1 or 5
  – D: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is O, so 1,2,5)

Letters already ruled out: C,R,A,S,T,W

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses E,N,D,O plus one more still-allowed consonant (from L,M,P,U,I,G,B,F,H,K,Y, etc.)
- Has O in position 4
- Places E, N, D in their allowed spots.

Let’s try positions:

Possible slotting:
_ _ _ O _

We need:
- One of positions 1,5 for N
- One of positions 2,3 for E
- One of positions 1,2,5 for D (but 1 or 5 might already be N)

Case 1: N in position 5
Then word ends in N: _ _ _ O N
E must go in 2 or 3.
D must go in 1 or 2.

Sub-cases:
a) E in 2, D in 1 → D E _ O N  → DENON (invalid, N repeats)
b) E in 3, D in 1 → D _ E O N → D _ E O N → “DEMON” (D,E,M,O,N) → M is new and allowed.

Check “DEMON”:
Positions:
D(1) – allowed
E(2) – allowed (E can be 2)
M(3) – new
O(4) – fixed ✓
N(5) – allowed (N can be 5)

No repeats, no banned letters, satisfies all positional constraints.

Let’s choose DEMON.
