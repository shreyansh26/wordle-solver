For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This combination should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Every letter in CRANE was rejected, so we now know the secret word contains **none** of C, R, A, N, or E.

I want a new starter word that avoids those five letters entirely and still gives good coverage of the remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Looking at the remaining frequent letters:  
Consonants left: S, T, L, D, B, M, P, H, G, K, F, W, V, etc.  
Vowels left: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

A very common second starter is “SLATE”, but it contains E which is already ruled out.  
Another good choice is “SOUTH”; let’s check its letters:
- S, O, U, T, H – none of C, R, A, N, E appear, and it covers three vowels and two common consonants.

So “SOUTH” should give us a fresh, informative set of letters.

From the two guesses we have:

CRANE → all letters x (C, R, A, N, E are out)  
SOUTH → S(x) O(-) U(x) T(x) H(-)

So the still-unknown word:
- Contains O and H in some positions (both marked “in word, wrong place”).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Letters left that are both common and still available:  
I, L, D, B, M, P, G, K, F, W, V, Y, plus the confirmed O and H.

Since O and H must appear, let’s search for 5-letter words that contain both O and H and use only the still-allowed letters.

Possible patterns we can test quickly:
– O _ _ _ H  
– _ O _ _ H  
– _ _ O _ H  
– _ _ _ O H  
– H _ _ _ O  
– etc.

Looking at common words satisfying these constraints, “PHLOM” is not a word. “DHOLE” contains E (out). “BOUGH” contains U (out). “HOLLY” contains L twice, but let’s list an actual word: “HOMILY” is 6 letters. The only clear 5-letter word that fits is “HOBBY” (but B and Y are allowed).  
However, we need to make sure we only use allowed letters.

Let’s pick a word that has both O and H and uses three other new, high-frequency letters from the remaining set: B, I, M, D, P, L…

A good candidate is “BHOID” – but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “PHLOM” – invalid.  
Valid word: “HOBBY” – uses H, O, B, Y (all still allowed).  
Let’s confirm: letters H, O, B, B, Y. None of C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T appear. So “HOBBY” is a legal next guess.

Current confirmed information:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, B, Y

2. H is in the word **and** is in the first position (✓).

3. O is in the word but **not** in the second position (-).

So the pattern we have so far:  
H _ _ _ _   (H is locked in the first spot)  
and somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 we must have an O.

Available letters still allowed:  
Consonants: D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
Vowels: I, O (already confirmed present), sometimes Y (but Y is out).

We need three more letters (positions 2, 3/4/5, and whichever spot O does not occupy).  
Since O must appear, let’s try placing it in position 3, for example:  
H _ O _ _

We want a common word with that shape, using only allowed letters.

Possible brainstorm:  
H D O M ? – “HDOM”+? Not valid.  
H D O L _ – “HDOL”+? Not valid.  
H I O M ? – “HIOM”+? Not valid.  
H D O I M – “HDOIM” – not a word.

Better approach: list common 5-letter words starting with H, avoiding forbidden letters, and containing O somewhere after position 2.

Examples:  
- H I D O ? – “HIDON” – invalid.  
- H I L O ? – “HILOS” – invalid.  
- H I V O ? – invalid.

Let’s pick a simple word: **HILOW** – but W is allowed, but this isn’t a common word.

Actually, “HIMOL” isn’t a word. Think of “HOIST” – but T and S are out.

Another valid word: “H D O M E” – but E is out.

Wait, let’s choose a word like **HILDO** – but not valid.

Let me step back: a known 5-letter word starting with H and having O in position 3 is **HIDON**? No.

Actually a common word that fits is **HILDO**? No.

Think of **HILOX**? Not valid.

I need to look for a real word. Let me recall: **HILDO** no.

Actually, **HILDO** is not a word.

Another pattern: H _ _ O _  
For example, **HIMOS** – but S is out.

Let me think of: **HIMBO** – but B is out.

Actually, a real word that starts with H and has O not in position 2: **HILLO** – but L is allowed, and double L is okay, but we need to check: letters H, I, L, L, O.  
Letters used: H (position 1 ✓), I, L, L, O. None of forbidden letters appear. This word is valid.

Therefore, **HILLO** is a valid guess.

But to be double sure:  
H I L L O – all letters allowed, H is fixed at position 1, O is somewhere else (position 5 here), and positions 2,3,4 are filled with allowed letters.

Let me proceed with **HILLO**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This means selecting a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This combination should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Every letter in CRANE was rejected, so we now know the secret word contains **none** of C, R, A, N, or E.

I want a new starter word that avoids those five letters entirely and still gives good coverage of the remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Looking at the remaining frequent letters:  
Consonants left: S, T, L, D, B, M, P, H, G, K, F, W, V, etc.  
Vowels left: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

A very common second starter is “SLATE”, but it contains E which is already ruled out.  
Another good choice is “SOUTH”; let’s check its letters:
- S, O, U, T, H – none of C, R, A, N, E appear, and it covers three vowels and two common consonants.

So “SOUTH” should give us a fresh, informative set of letters.

CRANE → all letters x (C, R, A, N, E are out)  
SOUTH → S(x) O(-) U(x) T(x) H(-)

So the still-unknown word:
- Contains O and H in some positions (both marked “in word, wrong place”).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Letters left that are both common and still available:  
I, L, D, B, M, P, G, K, F, W, V, Y, plus the confirmed O and H.

Since O and H must appear, let’s search for 5-letter words that contain both O and H and use only the still-allowed letters.

Possible patterns we can test quickly:
– O _ _ _ H  
– _ O _ _ H  
– _ _ O _ H  
– _ _ _ O H  
– H _ _ _ O  
– etc.

Looking at common words satisfying these constraints, “PHLOM” is not a word. “DHOLE” contains E (out). “BOUGH” contains U (out). “HOLLY” contains L twice, but let’s list an actual word: “HOMILY” is 6 letters. The only clear 5-letter word that fits is “HOBBY” (but B and Y are allowed).  
However, we need to make sure we only use allowed letters.

Let’s pick a word that has both O and H and uses three other new, high-frequency letters from the remaining set: B, I, M, D, P, L…

A good candidate is “BHOID” – but that isn’t a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “PHLOM” – invalid.  
Valid word: “HOBBY” – uses H, O, B, Y (all still allowed).  
Let’s confirm: letters H, O, B, B, Y. None of C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T appear. So “HOBBY” is a legal next guess.

Let's summarize what we now know:

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, B, Y, L
2. H must be the first letter (fixed in position 1)
3. I must be the second letter (fixed in position 2)
4. O must be the fifth letter (fixed in position 5)

So the pattern is: H I _ _ O

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits: H I _ _ O, using only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let's think of common words matching this pattern:
- H I D D O – not a word
- H I M E O – E is out
- H I K E O – E is out
- H I G G O – valid word ""HIGGO"" but this seems obscure
- H I D G O – not a word
- H I P P O – valid word ""HIPPO""

Checking ""HIPPO"":
- H (position 1) ✓
- I (position 2) ✓
- P, P, O - all letters are still allowed
- P and P are not in the eliminated list
- O is already confirmed to be at position 5
- This forms the word HIPPO
</think>

The only remaining possibility that forms a common 5-letter word with the pattern HI__O is:

<guess>HIPPO</guess>",HIPPO,"Let's summarize what we now know:

Known facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, B, Y, L
2. H must be the first letter (fixed in position 1)
3. I must be the second letter (fixed in position 2)
4. O must be the fifth letter (fixed in position 5)

So the pattern is: H I _ _ O

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits: H I _ _ O, using only letters that haven't been eliminated.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let's think of common words matching this pattern:
- H I D D O – not a word
- H I M E O – E is out
- H I K E O – E is out
- H I G G O – valid word ""HIGGO"" but this seems obscure
- H I D G O – not a word
- H I P P O – valid word ""HIPPO""

Checking ""HIPPO"":
- H (position 1) ✓
- I (position 2) ✓
- P, P, O - all letters are still allowed
- P and P are not in the eliminated list
- O is already confirmed to be at position 5
- This forms the word HIPPOThe only remaining possibility that forms a common 5-letter word with the pattern HI__O is:",Guess 5: HIPPO -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) P(✓) P(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
