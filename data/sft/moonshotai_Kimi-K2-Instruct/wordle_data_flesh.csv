2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters and avoid repeating any letters in the first guess.

Looking at letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

I'll construct a word using these high-frequency letters. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters without any repeats, covering both vowels and consonants that should give good coverage for determining the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter)
- A and T are not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth)

So we know:
1. Word is _ L _ _ _
2. Letters to avoid: A, T
3. Letters we know are present: L (in place), S, E (somewhere else)
4. Possible positions for S: positions 2,3,4,5 (but position 2 is taken by L)
5. Possible positions for E: positions 1,2,3,4 (but position 2 is taken by L)

Let me think of 5-letter words that fit _ L _ _ _, contain S and E, and don't have A or T.

Some candidates:
- CLUES (but C is not high frequency)
- FLEES (but double E might be less likely)
- SLEEP (but double E and double S)
- SLEPT (but T is ruled out)
- ELVES (E first, L second, V, E, S)
- PLEBS (but P and B aren't great coverage)

""ELVES"" seems good as it places E in first position (since E can't be last), L is already confirmed in second, and uses V and S. However, V isn't a super common letter.

""CLUES"" uses C which isn't ideal.

""FLEES"" has double E which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""SLEEK"" has double E and K which isn't great.

Let me reconsider - I want to maximize information. Since we know L is in position 2, S is somewhere, E is somewhere, and we can't use A or T.

How about ""SLICE""? But that has an I and C which aren't great.

""PLIES"" - but that has P and I.

""FLIES"" - F, L, I, E, S - but we know T is out, A is out, this seems reasonable.

Actually, since we know L is in position 2, and we need to place S and E, let me think more systematically.

Words with L in position 2:
- _ L _ _ _

And must contain S and E, no A or T:

""ELVES"" - E, L, V, E, S - this uses E twice which might be okay
""FLIES"" - F, L, I, E, S
""SLIDE"" - but D and I, plus T is out (but this has D which is okay)
Wait, SLIDE has D and I, but we know T is out (which it doesn't have) and A is out (which it doesn't have)

But we know S is in wrong position (not first), so SLIDE is invalid.

""CLIPS"" - but P and S, but no E yet.

I think ""FLIES"" is a good option - it has F, L, I, E, S - covering F and I which are new letters.

But let me think simpler - ""ELDER"" but has D and R, and E twice? No, has R.

Actually, ""ELBOW"" - but B, O, W.

""OLDER"" - but has D, R.

""FLESH"" - F, L, E, S, H - this seems good. Uses F, H as new letters, places E in 3rd position, S in 4th or 5th.

""FLESH"" - positions: F, L, E, S, H - this seems like a strong guess.

But let me check if this makes sense with the constraints:
- L is correct in position 2 ✓
- Contains S and E ✓
- No A or T ✓
- S is not in position 1 (which it isn't) ✓
- E is not in position 5 (which it isn't) ✓

Yes, ""FLESH"" seems like the best next guess.
