### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good candidates are ""RAISE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This spread gives us good coverage to quickly identify or eliminate many possible letters.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R (1st pos) is not in the word → eliminate all positions of R.
- A (2nd pos) is not in the word → eliminate all positions of A.
- I (3rd pos) is in the word and correctly placed → keep I at position 3.
- S (4th pos) is not in the word → eliminate all positions of S.
- E (5th pos) is not in the word → eliminate all positions of E.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I _ _
- Must not contain: R, A, S, E
- Must contain: I (fixed in 3rd position)

A good next guess uses new consonants and vowels to narrow further. Good letters left: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, etc.

Candidate words fitting _ _ I _ _ without R/A/S/E:
- POINT (but has T at end, often useful)
