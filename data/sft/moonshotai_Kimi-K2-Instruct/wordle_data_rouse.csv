For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities efficiently. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" stands out because it includes A, R, O, S, E - five of the top most common letters. This gives us a strong starting point to gather information about what letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – the 4th letter is S
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – the 5th letter is E

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ S E

Letters known to be in the word: R, O, S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A

For the next guess, I’ll try a word that:
- keeps S in the 4th spot and E in the 5th spot,
- re-uses R and O but in different positions,
- avoids the letter A,
- and introduces a new common letter to test.

A good candidate is “RODES”: it re-uses R and O in new positions (1st and 2nd), keeps S and E fixed, and introduces D. It’s also a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s interpret the new feedback step by step.

Pattern so far:
- 1st letter: R is correct (✓) → R _ _ _ _
- 2nd letter: O is correct (✓) → R O _ _ _
- 3rd letter: D is not in the word (x)
- 4th letter: E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  However, we already know from Guess 1 that E belongs in the 5th position (✓), so this feedback simply confirms E is not in the 4th slot.
- 5th letter: S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  From Guess 1 we know S belongs in the 4th slot (✓), so this feedback also simply confirms S is not in the 5th slot.

So the confirmed correct letters/positions are:
R O _ S E

The only mystery letter is the 3rd position, which must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out yet and is still fairly common.  Good candidates are N, T, L, M, etc.

A common word that fits R O _ S E is “ROUSE”.  It uses only letters we haven’t eliminated and keeps the confirmed letters in place.

Let’s test ROUSE.
