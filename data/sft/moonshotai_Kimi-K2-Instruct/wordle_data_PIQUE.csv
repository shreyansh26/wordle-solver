For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE we know:
- E is in the word and is in position 5.
- The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, D, C, M, and vowels we still have I and U available.  
A high-value second guess should include several of these untested letters while keeping the known E in position 5.  
“UNTIE” is tempting, but it repeats the already-eliminated letter A sound and doesn’t use many fresh consonants.  
“CLEFT” places E in position 5, uses C, L, F, T — none of which have been ruled out — and is a valid word.  
Another strong candidate is “MIDGE” (M, I, D, G, plus the fixed E) but “CLEFT” gives us three brand-new consonants and a vowel in one go.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A R O S are all absent; only E is present, and it must be in position 5 (from the first guess).
2. CLEFT → E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”), so E must appear somewhere else besides the 5th spot.  
   C, L, F, T are all absent.

Letters we know:
- Must contain at least one E, and that E is NOT at position 5.
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y … plus we still have the vowels I and U fresh.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only allowed letters (no A,R,O,S,C,L,F,T).
- Ends in something other than E (because E is not allowed at 5).
- Contains at least one E somewhere in positions 1–4.

Let’s look for such words.  
Examples that fit: “HUMID” (but it doesn’t have an E), “DRIVE” (contains R and V: R is out), “WIDGE” (G is allowed, but we need to verify).

A good candidate that fits all constraints is “WEDGE”:
- W, E, D, G, E – letters all allowed.
- Ends in E but now we know E can’t be in position 5, so this would place an E in positions 2 and 5, but feedback says E is not in position 5 in “CLEFT” (which it isn’t), so our new word can have E in other positions.

Wait — “WEDGE” ends in E, yet we know E must be in the word but NOT necessarily only once. However, we need to cover new letters.

Another valid word: “MIDGE” — but G and D are new, I is new, and it has an E in position 2.  
But let me search for a word that uses more fresh letters.

A better choice: “BINGE”
- B, I, N, G, E
- B, I, N, G are all fresh and allowed.
- E is in position 5, but feedback from CLEFT only told us E is not in position 5 in that word, not that it can never be in 5. However, from AROSE, we saw that in AROSE, E is in position 5 and was marked ✓, but in CLEFT, E was in position 5 and marked “-”. This seems conflicting — but rereading: the feedback on CLEFT shows E(-), meaning the letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, in the final word, E must appear at least once, and none of those occurrences are in position 5. So any guess with E in 5 is wasteful.

Therefore, we need a word with E not in 5.

Let’s pick “DINGE”:
- D, I, N, G, E
- E is in position 4 (valid, since it’s not in 5).
- All letters are fresh and allowed.

Another valid candidate: “PINED” — but D at end is fine, but it ends in D, not E.

Better: “MINED”
- M, I, N, E, D

“MINED” is a valid 5-letter word using fresh letters.

So far we know:

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T, M, N, D.
- Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus I and E.

We need a 5-letter word with:

Looking for words:  
""BEVEL"" – uses E twice, but V and B allowed.  
""PIVOT"" – O and T forbidden.  
""JUVIE"" – ends in E, which we know is not allowed in 5.  
""JIVED"" – D forbidden.  
""JIBES"" – S forbidden.  
""GUILE"" – ends in E (position 5, forbidden).  
""GUISE"" – S forbidden.

""JUVIE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.  
""GUILE"" invalid for same reason.  

""BEVEL"" has E in position 1 (allowed) and uses fresh letters B, V, L — but L is forbidden.  
""PIVOT"" – O and T forbidden.  

Next candidate: ""JUIVE"" – but it's not a valid word.  

Think again. We need a word with only allowed letters: B, G, H, J, K, P, U, V, W, Y, I, E.

How about ""JUVIE"" – but not valid.  
""JIBED"" – D forbidden.  

Another: ""PIQUE"" – Q is unused so far, but is it allowed? Q is not in forbidden list.  
""PIQUE"" – P, I, Q, U, E  
Check forbidden letters: none of P, I, Q, U, E are forbidden.  
E is in position 5 – but we know E cannot be in position 5 from CLEFT feedback.  
So ""PIQUE"" is invalid.

""JUICE"" – C forbidden.  

How about ""JIVEY"" – uses J, I, V, E, Y.  
E is in position 4 – but from MINED we know E is not in position 4.  

Next: ""JIVED"" – D forbidden.  

Try ""JIVEY"" again – E in 4 is invalid.  

Next: ""VIBEY"" – no E at all.  

We need E in 1, 2, or 3.  

""EXILE"" – X not used yet, but E in 1 and 5. 5 is invalid.  

""EXINE"" – E in 1 and 5.  

""EXPIE"" – E in 1, 5.  

""EXUDE"" – E in 1, 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, D, C, M, and vowels we still have I and U available.  
A high-value second guess should include several of these untested letters while keeping the known E in position 5.  
“UNTIE” is tempting, but it repeats the already-eliminated letter A sound and doesn’t use many fresh consonants.  
“CLEFT” places E in position 5, uses C, L, F, T — none of which have been ruled out — and is a valid word.  
Another strong candidate is “MIDGE” (M, I, D, G, plus the fixed E) but “CLEFT” gives us three brand-new consonants and a vowel in one go.

I’ll choose CLEFT.

   C, L, F, T are all absent.

Letters we know:
- Must contain at least one E, and that E is NOT at position 5.
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y … plus we still have the vowels I and U fresh.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only allowed letters (no A,R,O,S,C,L,F,T).
- Ends in something other than E (because E is not allowed at 5).
- Contains at least one E somewhere in positions 1–4.

Let’s look for such words.  
Examples that fit: “HUMID” (but it doesn’t have an E), “DRIVE” (contains R and V: R is out), “WIDGE” (G is allowed, but we need to verify).

A good candidate that fits all constraints is “WEDGE”:
- W, E, D, G, E – letters all allowed.
- Ends in E but now we know E can’t be in position 5, so this would place an E in positions 2 and 5, but feedback says E is not in position 5 in “CLEFT” (which it isn’t), so our new word can have E in other positions.

Wait — “WEDGE” ends in E, yet we know E must be in the word but NOT necessarily only once. However, we need to cover new letters.

Another valid word: “MIDGE” — but G and D are new, I is new, and it has an E in position 2.  
But let me search for a word that uses more fresh letters.

A better choice: “BINGE”
- B, I, N, G, E
- B, I, N, G are all fresh and allowed.
- E is in position 5, but feedback from CLEFT only told us E is not in position 5 in that word, not that it can never be in 5. However, from AROSE, we saw that in AROSE, E is in position 5 and was marked ✓, but in CLEFT, E was in position 5 and marked “-”.

Therefore, we need a word with E not in 5.

Let’s pick “DINGE”:
- D, I, N, G, E
- E is in position 4 (valid, since it’s not in 5).
- All letters are fresh and allowed.

Another valid candidate: “PINED” — but D at end is fine, but it ends in D, not E.

From the new feedback on PIKEY:
- P is in the word and in position 1 (✓).
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- K and Y are not in the word at all (x).

So we now have:
- Word starts with P.
- Second letter is I.
- Must contain E somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since E is not in 4).
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T, M, N, D, K, Y.
- Allowed remaining letters: B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, plus I and E.

Possible pattern: P I _ _ E   or   P I _ E _ (but E cannot be in 4)  
So only possible is P I _ _ E or P I _ _ _ with E in 3, but we need E somewhere.

Wait, we know from CLEFT that E is not in position 5 (from the feedback E(-) in CLEFT).  
Wait, no — actually, let's re-check:

- From AROSE: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).  
- From CLEFT: E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).  
This is a contradiction unless the word has more than one E.

But Wordle rules imply there's only one of each letter unless the word has repeats.  
However, the feedback only indicates presence/absence and positions, not counts.  
But the standard Wordle interpretation is that letters can repeat and feedback is per instance.

Given the two conflicting E positions, the only resolution is that the word has E in position 5 (from AROSE) and another E elsewhere, but that seems unlikely.  
Re-reading the feedback:

Wait, feedback on AROSE: E(✓) means E is correct in position 5.  
Feedback on CLEFT: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
This implies the word has at least two E's: one in position 5 and one elsewhere.

But this is extremely rare in 5-letter words.  
Given that, and that PIKEY shows P in 1 and I in 2, and E must appear somewhere (and not in 4), the only possible positions for the second E are 3.

So pattern: P I E _ E  
The last blank must be from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W.

Looking for words:  
""PIECE"" – but C is forbidden.  
""PIEGE"" – not a word.  
""PIEZE"" – rare, but valid (variant spelling).  
""PIEVE"" – not a word.  

""PIECE"" is invalid (C forbidden).  
""PIENE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEGE"" – not valid.  
""PIEVE"" – not valid.  

Next: ""PIESE"" – S is forbidden.

Next: ""PIEHE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEJE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEVE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEWE"" – not a word.  

This seems impossible.  
Re-evaluate: perhaps the word does not have two E's, and the feedback interpretation is that E is in the word but not in the positions we've tried so far.  

But AROSE showed E in position 5 (✓), so E must be in position 5.  
Then in CLEFT, E in position 5 was marked (-), which would mean E is in word but not in position 5 — this is only possible if the word has two E's, one in 5 and one elsewhere.  

Given this, and PIKEY showing P in 1, I in 2, and E must be in 5 (from AROSE), the only possible pattern is P I _ _ E, and the third and fourth letters must be from allowed letters B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W.

Looking for words:  
""PIGGE"" – G allowed.  
""PIBGE"" – not a word.  
""PIUGE"" – not a word.  
""PIVGE"" – not a word.  

""PIGGE"" is valid (like pig + e).  
""PIGGE"" – P, I, G, G, E

This seems the only possible word left under constraints.

- Starts with P and has I in position 2 (from PIKEY)
- Ends with E (from AROSE)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage of possible letters in the secret word.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we know:
- E is in the word and is in position 5.
- The letters A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, S.  
Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, D, C, M, and vowels we still have I and U available.  
A high-value second guess should include several of these untested letters while keeping the known E in position 5.  
“UNTIE” is tempting, but it repeats the already-eliminated letter A sound and doesn’t use many fresh consonants.  
“CLEFT” places E in position 5, uses C, L, F, T — none of which have been ruled out — and is a valid word.  
Another strong candidate is “MIDGE” (M, I, D, G, plus the fixed E) but “CLEFT” gives us three brand-new consonants and a vowel in one go.

I’ll choose CLEFT.

Guess 2: CLEFT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) E(-) F(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A R O S are all absent; only E is present, and it must be in position 5 (from the first guess).
2. CLEFT → E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”), so E must appear somewhere else besides the 5th spot.  
   C, L, F, T are all absent.

Letters we know:
- Must contain at least one E, and that E is NOT at position 5.
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T.

Remaining common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, W, Y … plus we still have the vowels I and U fresh.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only allowed letters (no A,R,O,S,C,L,F,T).
- Ends in something other than E (because E is not allowed at 5).
- Contains at least one E somewhere in positions 1–4.

Let’s look for such words.  
Examples that fit: “HUMID” (but it doesn’t have an E), “DRIVE” (contains R and V: R is out), “WIDGE” (G is allowed, but we need to verify).

A good candidate that fits all constraints is “WEDGE”:
- W, E, D, G, E – letters all allowed.
- Ends in E but now we know E can’t be in position 5, so this would place an E in positions 2 and 5, but feedback says E is not in position 5 in “CLEFT” (which it isn’t), so our new word can have E in other positions.

Wait — “WEDGE” ends in E, yet we know E must be in the word but NOT necessarily only once. However, we need to cover new letters.

Another valid word: “MIDGE” — but G and D are new, I is new, and it has an E in position 2.  
But let me search for a word that uses more fresh letters.

A better choice: “BINGE”
- B, I, N, G, E
- B, I, N, G are all fresh and allowed.
- E is in position 5, but feedback from CLEFT only told us E is not in position 5 in that word, not that it can never be in 5. However, from AROSE, we saw that in AROSE, E is in position 5 and was marked ✓, but in CLEFT, E was in position 5 and marked “-”. This seems conflicting — but rereading: the feedback on CLEFT shows E(-), meaning the letter E is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, in the final word, E must appear at least once, and none of those occurrences are in position 5. So any guess with E in 5 is wasteful.

Therefore, we need a word with E not in 5.

Let’s pick “DINGE”:
- D, I, N, G, E
- E is in position 4 (valid, since it’s not in 5).
- All letters are fresh and allowed.

Another valid candidate: “PINED” — but D at end is fine, but it ends in D, not E.

Better: “MINED”
- M, I, N, E, D
- E in position 4 (not 5), all letters allowed.

“MINED” is a valid 5-letter word using fresh letters.

I’ll choose “MINED”.

Guess 3: MINED -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- The word contains the letter I and the letter E (both are present somewhere).
- E is NOT in position 4 (from MINED) and NOT in position 5 (from CLEFT).
- Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T, M, N, D.
- Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, K, P, U, V, W, Y, plus I and E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I somewhere
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- no forbidden letters

Possible patterns:
E _ I _ _  
_ E I _ _  
E _ _ I _  
_ _ E I _  
etc.

Looking for words:  
""BEVEL"" – uses E twice, but V and B allowed.  
""PIVOT"" – O and T forbidden.  
""JUVIE"" – ends in E, which we know is not allowed in 5.  
""JIVED"" – D forbidden.  
""JIBES"" – S forbidden.  
""GUILE"" – ends in E (position 5, forbidden).  
""GUISE"" – S forbidden.

""JUVIE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.  
""GUILE"" invalid for same reason.  

""BEVEL"" has E in position 1 (allowed) and uses fresh letters B, V, L — but L is forbidden.  
""PIVOT"" – O and T forbidden.  

Next candidate: ""JUIVE"" – but it's not a valid word.  

Think again. We need a word with only allowed letters: B, G, H, J, K, P, U, V, W, Y, I, E.

How about ""JUVIE"" – but not valid.  
""JIBED"" – D forbidden.  

Another: ""PIQUE"" – Q is unused so far, but is it allowed? Q is not in forbidden list.  
""PIQUE"" – P, I, Q, U, E  
Check forbidden letters: none of P, I, Q, U, E are forbidden.  
E is in position 5 – but we know E cannot be in position 5 from CLEFT feedback.  
So ""PIQUE"" is invalid.

""JUICE"" – C forbidden.  

How about ""JIVEY"" – uses J, I, V, E, Y.  
E is in position 4 – but from MINED we know E is not in position 4.  

Next: ""JIVED"" – D forbidden.  

Try ""JIVEY"" again – E in 4 is invalid.  

Next: ""VIBEY"" – no E at all.  

We need E in 1, 2, or 3.  

""EXILE"" – X not used yet, but E in 1 and 5. 5 is invalid.  

""EXINE"" – E in 1 and 5.  

""EXPIE"" – E in 1, 5.  

""EXUDE"" – E in 1, 5.  

""JUKE_"" – not helpful.

""JEBIX"" – not a word.

""PIKEY"" – E in 3, I in 2, P, K, Y allowed.  
""PIKEY"" is a valid word.  
Letters: P, I, K, E, Y – none forbidden.  
E is in position 3 (allowed).  
I is in position 2.

This seems like our best fresh-word option.

- P is in the word and in position 1 (✓).
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- K and Y are not in the word at all (x).

So we now have:
- Word starts with P.
- Second letter is I.
- Must contain E somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since E is not in 4).
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, S, C, L, F, T, M, N, D, K, Y.
- Allowed remaining letters: B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, plus I and E.

Possible pattern: P I _ _ E   or   P I _ E _ (but E cannot be in 4)  
So only possible is P I _ _ E or P I _ _ _ with E in 3, but we need E somewhere.

Wait, we know from CLEFT that E is not in position 5 (from the feedback E(-) in CLEFT).  
Wait, no — actually, let's re-check:

- From AROSE: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓).  
- From CLEFT: E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).  
This is a contradiction unless the word has more than one E.

But Wordle rules imply there's only one of each letter unless the word has repeats.  
However, the feedback only indicates presence/absence and positions, not counts.  
But the standard Wordle interpretation is that letters can repeat and feedback is per instance.

Given the two conflicting E positions, the only resolution is that the word has E in position 5 (from AROSE) and another E elsewhere, but that seems unlikely.  
Re-reading the feedback:

Wait, feedback on AROSE: E(✓) means E is correct in position 5.  
Feedback on CLEFT: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
This implies the word has at least two E's: one in position 5 and one elsewhere.

But this is extremely rare in 5-letter words.  
Given that, and that PIKEY shows P in 1 and I in 2, and E must appear somewhere (and not in 4), the only possible positions for the second E are 3.

So pattern: P I E _ E  
The last blank must be from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W.

Looking for words:  
""PIECE"" – but C is forbidden.  
""PIEGE"" – not a word.  
""PIEZE"" – rare, but valid (variant spelling).  
""PIEVE"" – not a word.  

""PIECE"" is invalid (C forbidden).  
""PIENE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEGE"" – not valid.  
""PIEVE"" – not valid.  

Next: ""PIESE"" – S is forbidden.  

Next: ""PIEED"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEBE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEHE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEJE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEVE"" – not a word.  

Next: ""PIEWE"" – not a word.  

This seems impossible.  
Re-evaluate: perhaps the word does not have two E's, and the feedback interpretation is that E is in the word but not in the positions we've tried so far.  

But AROSE showed E in position 5 (✓), so E must be in position 5.  
Then in CLEFT, E in position 5 was marked (-), which would mean E is in word but not in position 5 — this is only possible if the word has two E's, one in 5 and one elsewhere.  

Given this, and PIKEY showing P in 1, I in 2, and E must be in 5 (from AROSE), the only possible pattern is P I _ _ E, and the third and fourth letters must be from allowed letters B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W.

Looking for words:  
""PIGGE"" – G allowed.  
""PIBGE"" – not a word.  
""PIUGE"" – not a word.  
""PIVGE"" – not a word.  

""PIGGE"" is valid (like pig + e).  
""PIGGE"" – P, I, G, G, E  
All letters allowed (G not forbidden).  

This seems the only possible word left under constraints.Given the constraints:
- Starts with P and has I in position 2 (from PIKEY)
- Ends with E (from AROSE)
- Must contain the sequence P I _ _ E
- Allowed letters for blanks: B, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W
- Only valid word is ""PIGGE"".
