For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starter words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, C, and O. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good spread of likely letters and positions that can help narrow down future guesses effectively.

So far we know:

- Letter R is in the word and is correctly placed in the 4th position ( _ _ _ R _ )
- Letter E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since SLATE had E at position 5 and it got “-”).

Therefore the word pattern is: _ _ _ R E   OR   _ _ E R _   OR   _ E _ R _   OR   E _ _ R _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 4
- Contains E somewhere else (1, 2, or 3)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, A, T, C, H, O)

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, B, V, F, M, K, P, Y, W
Good remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), I, U

Candidate words that fit:
- F I R E D → but D is allowed
- M I R E D → D allowed
- N E R V E → but V and second E are allowed
- P E R K Y → K and Y allowed
- B E R R Y → but double R might not be optimal
- W I N E R → but W is allowed and N, I, E fit

From the new feedback on EMERY:

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
M(-) – M is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
E(-) – second E also not in position 3.  
R(✓) – R is correct in position 4.  
Y(✓) – Y is correct in position 5.

So the word ends with “…RY”.
Letters known to be present: E (somewhere before 4), M (somewhere), R (pos 4), Y (pos 5).
Letters still excluded: S, L, A, T, C, H, O.

The pattern is: _ _ _ R Y   (positions 1-2-3-4-5)

We need a 5-letter word ending in RY where:
- E and M both appear somewhere in the first three positions.  
- No banned letters.

Possible fits:
1. MERCY – contains C (banned).  
2. MARRY – double R (position 4 already R) but contains A (banned).  
3. DERRY – D not tested, but double R not helpful and second E missing.  
4. FERRY – F not tested, but second E missing.  
5. MERRY – double R, A banned.  
6. VERRY – invalid.  
7. PERKY – K not tested, P not tested, but missing E.  
8. MUDRY – missing E.  
9. FIERY – contains I, E, and ends in RY; letters: F, I, E, R, Y – no banned letters, and both E and a new letter I are introduced.  Wait, FIERY has the R in position 4, Y in 5.  Letters: F, I, E, R, Y – no banned letters, both E and I are tested.

But M is still not placed.  We need M in the word.

Let’s list all 5-letter words ending in RY that contain both E and M (with no banned letters):

- M E R R Y – invalid (double R and A banned).  
- M I E R Y – isn’t a valid English word.  
- M U E R Y – not valid.  
- F E M R Y – not valid.  
- P E M R Y – not valid.  
- M E F R Y – not valid.

Actually, let’s check valid English words ending in RY that include M and E:

- D A M P E R Y – too long.  
- R E M A I N – doesn’t end in RY.  
- I need a dictionary check.

Valid 5-letter words ending in RY with M and E:
- M E E R Y – isn’t a word.  
- M E T R Y – isn’t a word.  
- M E R R Y – A banned.  
- M A E R Y – A banned.  
- M U R R Y – missing E.  

Hmm, seems limited.  Let’s relax: we know M is in the word (but not in position 2), E is in the word (but not positions 1, 3, 5).  So E must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be _ E _ R Y (with E in position 2).  And M must appear in position 1 or 3, and no banned letters.

Candidates for _ E _ R Y:

- B E D R Y – D ok, but missing M.  
- D E N R Y – N ok, missing M.  
- F E M R Y – not a word.  
- G E M R Y – not a word.  
- K E M R Y – not a word.  
- M E M R Y – but M at 1 and 3, but M must be in the word and we can reuse letters.  MEMRY isn’t a valid word.  
- P E M R Y – not a word.  
- V E M R Y – not a word.  
- W E M R Y – not a word.  

Actually, “FERRY” has F, E, R, R, Y – but double R and missing M.  We need a word with M in one of the first three positions and E and R and Y.

Wait, let’s systematically generate:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Pattern: ? E ? R Y

Letters allowed: B, D, E, F, G, I, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus M, E, R, Y already confirmed)
But E is already in position 2.  M must appear in 1 or 3.

Thus the possibilities are:

1. M E ? R Y → ME?RY.  Valid 5-letter words:
   - M E W R Y – not a word.
   - M E D R Y – not a word.
   - M E N R Y – not a word.
   - M E G R Y – not a word.
   - M E B R Y – not a word.

2. ? E M R Y → ?EMRY.  Valid 5-letter words:
   - B E M R Y – not a word.
   - D E M R Y – not a word.
   - F E M R Y – not a word.
   - G E M R Y – not a word.
   - I E M R Y – not a word.
   - N E M R Y – not a word.
   - P E M R Y – not a word.
   - V E M R Y – not a word.
   - W E M R Y – not a word.
   - Z E M R Y – not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid English words.  Let me double-check a dictionary for 5-letter words ending in RY that contain both M and E.

Upon checking, the only valid 5-letter words ending in RY that contain both M and E are:

- M E R R Y – but contains A (wait, MERRY is M-E-R-R-Y, no A, but R is duplicated.  However, the word is valid and contains M and E.  But the feedback shows R at position 4, so MERRY would have R at 3 and 4 – both would be marked as ✓ for the 4th R and - for the 3rd R.  That’s acceptable, but the game does not penalize double letters unless they’re invalid.

But is MERRY a valid word?  Yes.

But we have:
- M in position 2 – feedback shows M(-), meaning M is in the word but not in position 2.  Thus MERRY has M in position 1, which is allowed.

Let me verify MERRY against all constraints:
- Letters: M, E, R, R, Y
- Ends with RY: yes.
- Contains M and E: yes.
- M is in position 1 (allowed since feedback said M(-) in position 2, but M can be elsewhere).
- E is in position 2 – but feedback on EMERY indicated E(-) in positions 1 and 3, but the second E in EMERY was at position 3, so E can be in position 2.
- No banned letters (S, L, A, T, C, H, O).

Thus MERRY satisfies all conditions.
