For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and gives me good information about what letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, maximizing information gain

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- R and O are in the word but in wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

I need a new guess that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both R and O somewhere other than positions 2 and 3.
- Avoids A and S.

A good next guess would be ""TROPE"":
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains R and O in different positions.
- Uses common letters T, P which weren't in the first guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L).

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique, maximizing information gain

This gives me the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- R and O are in the word but in wrong positions.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

I need a new guess that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains both R and O somewhere other than positions 2 and 3.
- Avoids A and S.

A good next guess would be ""TROPE"":
- Ends with E (confirmed).
- Contains R and O in different positions.
- Uses common letters T, P which weren't in the first guess.

2. The word contains R and O, but never in positions 2 or 3 (R was in 2 both times, O in 3 both times).
3. Letters we can eliminate: A, S, T, P.

So:
- We have _ _ _ _ E confirmed.
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 1 or 4).
- O must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E, so 1, 2, or 4).

Looking for 5-letter words that:
- End with E.
- Contain both R and O.

- Place R and O in permissible positions.

Possible placements:
- R in 1 and O in 2: R O _ _ E (""RODGE"" - D and G not eliminated yet)
- R in 1 and O in 4: R _ _ O E (""RODGE"" - but O would be 3 which is invalid)
- R in 4 and O in 1: O _ _ R E (""OCHRE"" - C, H not eliminated)
- R in 4 and O in 2: _ O _ R E (""MOURE"" - M, U not eliminated)

Among these, ""BROKE"" comes to mind but has K and B not tested yet, and it would place R in 2 which we know is invalid. 

""RODGE"" - R in 1 (valid), O in 2 (valid), D and G untested.

""OCHRE"" - O in 1 (valid), R in 4 (valid), C and H untested.

""GROVE"" - R in 2 (invalid - we know R can't be 2 from feedback).

1. Position 1 R is still wrong → R is NOT in position 1 (contradicts the earlier deduction).

2. Position 2 O is now correct (✓).
3. Position 5 E is confirmed correct (✓).
4. U and G are not in the word at all.
5. Current pattern: _ O _ _ E with R necessarily in position 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all three guesses we now have:

1. Position 5 is E (all three ✓).
2. The word contains R and O, but:
   - R has been in positions 2, 2, and 4 – all marked as “wrong position”.
   - O has been in positions 3, 3, and 3 – all marked as “wrong position”.
   Therefore R cannot be in 2 or 4 and must be in 1 (only remaining spot).
   Similarly, O cannot be in 3 and must be in 2 (only remaining spot).
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, T, P, C, H.
4. So the pattern so far is: R O _ _ E.

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with RO, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out. Good candidates:
- R O U G E
- R O D G E
- R O V E … (but 4 letters, so invalid)

ROUGE and RODGE are the two most common. Between them, ROUGE uses common letters G and U, neither of which has been tried, so it’s a good next test.

Pattern: R O _ _ E, letters G and U still possible.

Guess 3: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) O(-) R(-) E(✓)
Guess 4: ROUGE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback (ROUGE → R(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) E(✓)) we learn:

1. Position 1 R is still wrong → R is NOT in position 1 (contradicts the earlier deduction).
   Previously we thought R must be in position 1 because it had been ruled out of 2 and 4, but it was also ruled out of 1 just now. That leaves the only possible place for R as position 3.

2. Position 2 O is now correct (✓).
3. Position 5 E is confirmed correct (✓).
4. U and G are not in the word at all.
5. Current pattern: _ O _ _ E with R necessarily in position 3.

Hence the word must be of the form _ O R _ E and the missing letters (positions 1 and 4) must be from the set of letters never yet tried: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words that fit _ O R _ E:
- DORGE (not common)
- WORSE (but S is already out)
- MORSE (S out)
- BORNE
- FORGE (G is out)
- HORSE (H out)
- LORGE (uncommon)
- PORGE (P out)

Among these, BORNE is a common English word, uses B and N which are still possible, and fits _ O R _ E.

So the next guess is BORNE.
