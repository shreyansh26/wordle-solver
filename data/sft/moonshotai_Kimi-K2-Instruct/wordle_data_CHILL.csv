- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me a good spread of common letters to work with.
