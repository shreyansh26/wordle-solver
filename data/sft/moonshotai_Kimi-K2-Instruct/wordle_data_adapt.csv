For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some classic starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at these:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers 3 vowels and 2 common consonants
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers 2 vowels and 3 common consonants
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covers 2 vowels and 3 common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels which are crucial for narrowing down word structure, plus the very common R and S consonants.

Feedback means:  
- A is correct and must be in the first position.  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word is of the form A _ _ _ _ and may not contain R, O, S, E.

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.  
Common vowels still available: I, U (and sometimes Y, but not used here).

I want a word that tests several new consonants plus the remaining vowels.  
Good candidates:
- A C I D / A C I T – but we need 5 letters.
- A N I M A – but A is already fixed at first position; no repeated A needed.
- A L I N T – not a word.
- A L I N E – E is out.
- A M I N T – not a word.
- A M I N G – AM I N G → “aming” not valid.
- A M I N T → “amint” not valid.
- A T I C K → “atic k” not valid.
- A T I L T – valid word “ATILT” (poetic/archaic, but allowed).
- A F I N T → “afint” not valid.
- A N I M A → “anima” valid (though less common).

A practical, common word that fits A _ _ _ _, avoids R/O/S/E, and introduces I and several new consonants: “AMITY” (but Y is sometimes treated as vowel; safe, but we already have A I T Y… and no O/S/R/E).

Another common word: “AMBIT” – but B and M are good, and I and T – but it contains B and M and I and T and avoids all forbidden letters. Checking validity: A M B I T → “ambit” is valid 5-letter word.

Let’s use “ambit”.

Letters used: A (✓ already), M, B, I, T. None of these are R/O/S/E, and we test new consonants plus the vowel I.
