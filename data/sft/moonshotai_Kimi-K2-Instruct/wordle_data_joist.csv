This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback. The goal is to maximize the amount of information gained from this guess. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, preferably with no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular starting words for Wordle include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words contain high-frequency letters like A, E, S, T, R, and N. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters that could give me good information regardless of where they appear in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was fourth, so it can be positions 1-3 or 5).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T, but not L, A, or E.
- S cannot be in position 1, and T cannot be in position 4.

I need a new guess that:
1. Keeps S (but not in position 1) and T (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids L, A, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible next words: ""STINT"" (but repeats T), ""STING"" (but T is in position 2, which might be valid), ""SHIRT"" (but T is in position 5, which is allowed), ""SPOTS"" (but repeats S), etc.

""SHIRT"" looks good:
- Uses S, T, and introduces H, I, R.
- S is in position 1 (but we know S cannot be in position 1 from feedback), so that's invalid.

""STRIP"":
- S is in position 1 (invalid), T in 2, R in 3, I in 4, P in 5. S cannot be in position 1.

""STICK"":
- S in 1 (invalid), T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, K in 5.

""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T. S is in position 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Uses new letters C, R, U.

""TRUST"":
- T in 1, R in 2, U in 3, S in 4, T in 5. T is duplicated, which is inefficient for information gain.

""CRUST"" seems like the best option: uses S and T in allowed positions, avoids L/A/E, and tests C, R, U.

Remaining three positions (1, 2, 3) must be filled with new letters that have not been ruled out.

A good next guess should:
- Keep T and S locked in their correct spots (positions 4 and 5).
- Try three new consonants/vowels that are still possible.
- Avoid any letters we have already excluded.

A sensible word following _ _ _ T S is “BINTS”, but “I” is a vowel and “N” and “B” are fresh consonants; however “BINTS” is not a common English word.

4. Letters that could still appear: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So the secret word is of the form:
_ _ _ T S

Remaining three positions (1, 2, 3) must be filled with new letters that have not been ruled out.

A good next guess should:
- Keep T and S locked in their correct spots (positions 4 and 5).
- Try three new consonants/vowels that are still possible.
- Avoid any letters we have already excluded.

A sensible word following _ _ _ T S is “BINTS”, but “I” is a vowel and “N” and “B” are fresh consonants; however “BINTS” is not a common English word.

Better, let’s pick “HINTS”:
- H, I, N are all fresh letters.
- Positions 4-5 are T S, satisfying the known pattern.
- “HINTS” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Step 1 – interpret the newest feedback  
Guess 3: HINTS → H(x) I(-) N(x) T(-) S(-)

- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- T is in the word but not in position 4.  
- S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- H and N are NOT in the word.

Step 2 – combine all facts so far  
Known letters and positions  
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 → possible positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- T must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- I must be in the word but NOT in position 2 → possible positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Letters ruled out: L, A, E, C, R, U, H, N.

Thus the secret word contains (S, T, I) and possibly others from the remaining alphabet {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Step 3 – decide a new guess  
We need a word that  
- includes S, T, I (to keep confirming them),  
- places S, T, I in still-allowed positions,  
- introduces fresh letters only from the still-possible set.

A simple structure that satisfies all constraints is:

_ I S _ _

We can fill the first and fourth slots with two new letters, e.g., F and M.

A valid English word under this pattern is “FISTS”.

Check constraints:  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Letters F and S are new and not yet ruled out.  
- No disallowed letters appear.

Therefore “FISTS” is a good next probe.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- A is not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was fourth, so it can be positions 1-3 or 5).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T, but not L, A, or E.
- S cannot be in position 1, and T cannot be in position 4.

I need a new guess that:

""SHIRT"" looks good:
- Uses S, T, and introduces H, I, R.
- S is in position 1 (but we know S cannot be in position 1 from feedback), so that's invalid.

""STRIP"":
- S is in position 1 (invalid), T in 2, R in 3, I in 4, P in 5. S cannot be in position 1.

""STICK"":

""TRUST"":
- T in 1, R in 2, U in 3, S in 4, T in 5. T is duplicated, which is inefficient for information gain.

""CRUST"" seems like the best option: uses S and T in allowed positions, avoids L/A/E, and tests C, R, U.

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from the cumulative feedback: S couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 5th from CRUST, now also can't be 3rd or 4th).
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from cumulative feedback: couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 4th from CRUST, now also can't be 5th).

But wait - we have a contradiction here:
- S must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. That only leaves position 2 for S.
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. With S taking position 2, T could be in positions 2 or 3, but position 2 is taken by S. So T must be in position 3.
- I must be in the word but cannot be in position 2 (S is there) and cannot be in position 5 (from CRUST feedback where position 5 was S). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Given these constraints, the word structure must be:
I S T _ _ or _ S T I _

But we need to check which letters are still possible:
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, E, C, R, U, H, N, F
Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given that I must be in the word and the positions are constrained as above, the only viable positions are:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: must be from available letters

Looking for 5-letter words with ""IST"" starting:
ISTLE - but E and L are ruled out
ISTHM - M is available, but H is ruled out
ISTEM - E is ruled out
ISTAR - A and R are ruled out

This suggests the word must have ""IST"" in the middle:
_ I S T _ - but this would make position 2 = I, but we know I can't be in position 2.

Wait, let's re-examine the S positioning:
From cumulative feedback:
- S can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- S can't be in position 5 (CRUST)
- S can't be in position 3 (FISTS)
- S can't be in position 4 (FISTS)
So S MUST be in position 2.

Similarly for T:
- T can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- T can't be in position 4 (CRUST)
- T can't be in position 5 (FISTS)
- With S in position 2, T must be in position 3.

This gives us the structure: _ S T _ _

I must be in the word but can't be in position 2 (S is there), and can't be in position 5 (CRUST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Looking at available letters for positions 1,4,5:
Letters available: B, D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
If I is in position 1: I S T _ _
ISTEM - E is ruled out
ISTAR - A and R are ruled out
ISTHM - H is ruled out
ISTLE - L and E are ruled out
ISTOS - O is available
ISTOP - O and P are available

ISTOS and ISTOP are valid 5-letter words using available letters.

Let's choose ISTOP as our next guess since it's a valid word fitting all constraints.
</think>

Based on the cumulative feedback, we can now lock in:

- S must be in position 2 (only remaining allowed spot)
- T must be in position 3 (only remaining allowed spot)
- I must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 5

This gives us the structure: _ S T I _ or I S T _ _

Testing the pattern I S T _ _, the only valid word using remaining allowed letters is ISTOP.

<guess>ISTOP</guess>",ISTOP,"Let's interpret the new feedback:

Guess 4: FISTS → F(x) I(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)

- F is NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from the cumulative feedback: S couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 5th from CRUST, now also can't be 3rd or 4th).
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from cumulative feedback: couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 4th from CRUST, now also can't be 5th).

But wait - we have a contradiction here:
- S must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. That only leaves position 2 for S.
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. With S taking position 2, T could be in positions 2 or 3, but position 2 is taken by S. So T must be in position 3.
- I must be in the word but cannot be in position 2 (S is there) and cannot be in position 5 (from CRUST feedback where position 5 was S). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Given these constraints, the word structure must be:
I S T _ _ or _ S T I _

But we need to check which letters are still possible:
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, E, C, R, U, H, N, F
Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given that I must be in the word and the positions are constrained as above, the only viable positions are:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: must be from available letters

Looking for 5-letter words with ""IST"" starting:
ISTLE - but E and L are ruled out
ISTHM - M is available, but H is ruled out
ISTEM - E is ruled out
ISTAR - A and R are ruled out

This suggests the word must have ""IST"" in the middle:
_ I S T _ - but this would make position 2 = I, but we know I can't be in position 2.

Wait, let's re-examine the S positioning:
From cumulative feedback:
- S can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- S can't be in position 5 (CRUST)
- S can't be in position 3 (FISTS)
- S can't be in position 4 (FISTS)
So S MUST be in position 2.

Similarly for T:
- T can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- T can't be in position 4 (CRUST)
- T can't be in position 5 (FISTS)
- With S in position 2, T must be in position 3.

This gives us the structure: _ S T _ _

I must be in the word but can't be in position 2 (S is there), and can't be in position 5 (CRUST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Looking at available letters for positions 1,4,5:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,joist,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback. The goal is to maximize the amount of information gained from this guess. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, preferably with no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. 

Some popular starting words for Wordle include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words contain high-frequency letters like A, E, S, T, R, and N. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters that could give me good information regardless of where they appear in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- L is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was fourth, so it can be positions 1-3 or 5).
- E is not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and T, but not L, A, or E.
- S cannot be in position 1, and T cannot be in position 4.

I need a new guess that:
1. Keeps S (but not in position 1) and T (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids L, A, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible next words: ""STINT"" (but repeats T), ""STING"" (but T is in position 2, which might be valid), ""SHIRT"" (but T is in position 5, which is allowed), ""SPOTS"" (but repeats S), etc.

""SHIRT"" looks good:
- Uses S, T, and introduces H, I, R.
- S is in position 1 (but we know S cannot be in position 1 from feedback), so that's invalid.

""STRIP"":
- S is in position 1 (invalid), T in 2, R in 3, I in 4, P in 5. S cannot be in position 1.

""STICK"":
- S in 1 (invalid), T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, K in 5.

""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T. S is in position 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Uses new letters C, R, U.

""TRUST"":
- T in 1, R in 2, U in 3, S in 4, T in 5. T is duplicated, which is inefficient for information gain.

""CRUST"" seems like the best option: uses S and T in allowed positions, avoids L/A/E, and tests C, R, U.

<guess>CRUST</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRUST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word
   - S — must be in position 5 (because in CRUST it got ✓ in slot 5).
   - T — must be in position 4 (because in CRUST it got ✓ in slot 4).

2. Letters that are NOT in the word
   - L, A, E (from SLATE)
   - C, R, U (from CRUST)

3. Positions already locked in
   - 4th letter = T
   - 5th letter = S

4. Letters that could still appear: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So the secret word is of the form:
_ _ _ T S

Remaining three positions (1, 2, 3) must be filled with new letters that have not been ruled out.

A good next guess should:
- Keep T and S locked in their correct spots (positions 4 and 5).
- Try three new consonants/vowels that are still possible.
- Avoid any letters we have already excluded.

A sensible word following _ _ _ T S is “BINTS”, but “I” is a vowel and “N” and “B” are fresh consonants; however “BINTS” is not a common English word.

Better, let’s pick “HINTS”:
- H, I, N are all fresh letters.
- Positions 4-5 are T S, satisfying the known pattern.
- “HINTS” is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>HINTS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: CRUST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)
Guess 3: HINTS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) N(x) T(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – interpret the newest feedback  
Guess 3: HINTS → H(x) I(-) N(x) T(-) S(-)

- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- T is in the word but not in position 4.  
- S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- H and N are NOT in the word.

Step 2 – combine all facts so far  
Known letters and positions  
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 → possible positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- T must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- I must be in the word but NOT in position 2 → possible positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Letters ruled out: L, A, E, C, R, U, H, N.

Thus the secret word contains (S, T, I) and possibly others from the remaining alphabet {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Step 3 – decide a new guess  
We need a word that  
- includes S, T, I (to keep confirming them),  
- places S, T, I in still-allowed positions,  
- introduces fresh letters only from the still-possible set.

A simple structure that satisfies all constraints is:

_ I S _ _

We can fill the first and fourth slots with two new letters, e.g., F and M.

A valid English word under this pattern is “FISTS”.

Check constraints:  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Letters F and S are new and not yet ruled out.  
- No disallowed letters appear.

Therefore “FISTS” is a good next probe.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRUST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)
Guess 3: HINTS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(-) N(x) T(-) S(-)
Guess 4: FISTS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's interpret the new feedback:

Guess 4: FISTS → F(x) I(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)

- F is NOT in the word.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from the cumulative feedback: S couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 5th from CRUST, now also can't be 3rd or 4th).
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from cumulative feedback: couldn't be 1st from SLATE, couldn't be 4th from CRUST, now also can't be 5th).

But wait - we have a contradiction here:
- S must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. That only leaves position 2 for S.
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5. With S taking position 2, T could be in positions 2 or 3, but position 2 is taken by S. So T must be in position 3.
- I must be in the word but cannot be in position 2 (S is there) and cannot be in position 5 (from CRUST feedback where position 5 was S). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Given these constraints, the word structure must be:
I S T _ _ or _ S T I _

But we need to check which letters are still possible:
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, E, C, R, U, H, N, F
Available letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Given that I must be in the word and the positions are constrained as above, the only viable positions are:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: must be from available letters

Looking for 5-letter words with ""IST"" starting:
ISTLE - but E and L are ruled out
ISTHM - M is available, but H is ruled out
ISTEM - E is ruled out
ISTAR - A and R are ruled out

This suggests the word must have ""IST"" in the middle:
_ I S T _ - but this would make position 2 = I, but we know I can't be in position 2.

Wait, let's re-examine the S positioning:
From cumulative feedback:
- S can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- S can't be in position 5 (CRUST)
- S can't be in position 3 (FISTS)
- S can't be in position 4 (FISTS)
So S MUST be in position 2.

Similarly for T:
- T can't be in position 1 (SLATE)
- T can't be in position 4 (CRUST)
- T can't be in position 5 (FISTS)
- With S in position 2, T must be in position 3.

This gives us the structure: _ S T _ _

I must be in the word but can't be in position 2 (S is there), and can't be in position 5 (CRUST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Looking at available letters for positions 1,4,5:
Letters available: B, D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words:
If I is in position 1: I S T _ _
ISTEM - E is ruled out
ISTAR - A and R are ruled out
ISTHM - H is ruled out
ISTLE - L and E are ruled out
ISTOS - O is available
ISTOP - O and P are available

ISTOS and ISTOP are valid 5-letter words using available letters.

Let's choose ISTOP as our next guess since it's a valid word fitting all constraints.Based on the cumulative feedback, we can now lock in:

- S must be in position 2 (only remaining allowed spot)
- T must be in position 3 (only remaining allowed spot)
- I must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 5

This gives us the structure: _ S T I _ or I S T _ _

Testing the pattern I S T _ _, the only valid word using remaining allowed letters is ISTOP.

From the feedback on ISTOP:  
- I is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
- S is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
- T is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
- O is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- P is **not** in the word.

Combine all constraints so far:
- S must be in the word and can only be in positions 3, 4 (already excluded 1, 2, 5).  
- T must be in the word and can only be in positions 2, 5 (already excluded 1, 3, 4).  
- I must be in the word and can only be in positions 3, 4, 5 (already excluded 1, 2).  
- O must be in the word and can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (already excluded 4).

We need a 5-letter word that contains S, T, I, O each in one of their allowed slots, and uses only letters not yet ruled out: available set = {B, D, G, J, K, M, W, X, Y, Z} plus the required S, T, I, O.

Possible patterns:
- Position 2 = T, Position 3 = S, Position 4 = I → _ T S I _  
  Only remaining letter to place is O, which can go in 1 or 5.

The only valid word fitting this is **OTSIT** (not common) or **TSIO_** – none standard.

Reverse pattern:
- Position 3 = I, Position 5 = T → _ _ I _ T  
  Need S and O in the first two slots (positions 1 and 2) without repeating.

The only common 5-letter word with these constraints is **STOIT** (a rare but valid word meaning to stop or cease; recognized in Scrabble dictionaries).

Thus, **STOIT** is the only remaining plausible guess that satisfies all constraints.
