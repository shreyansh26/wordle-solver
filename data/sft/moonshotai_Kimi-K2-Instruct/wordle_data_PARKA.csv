For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a solid first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters in one guess.

However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has:
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests more vowels in the first guess.

From the feedback:
- A(-) means A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) means R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (marked with x).

So the secret word:
- contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- does NOT contain O, S, or E.

We need a word with A and R, avoiding O/S/E. Also avoid having A in position 1 and R in position 2.

Good candidates include:
- DRAIN (R in 2 is wrong per feedback, but A is in 3)
- TRAIL (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- CRANK (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- FRANK (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- BRAND (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)

""DRAIN"" seems like a strong choice as it uses common letters and tests new consonants D, N while keeping A and R in different positions.

But checking positions: in DRAIN, R is in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so this is bad.

Better options:
- CRANK (A in 3, R in 2 - still R in wrong spot)
- FRANK (same issue)
- TRAIN (R in 2 again)

Let me think differently: we need A not in position 1 and R not in position 2. Possible positions:
A could be in 2-5
R could be in 1,3-5

Good words:
- CARGO (invalid - has O)
- MARRY (invalid - has two Rs and Y)
- HARDY (valid: A in 2, R in 3)
- MARCH (invalid - has C and H but let's see... E is out so no)

- GUARD (A in 3, R in 4)
- RAPID (R in 1, A in 2 - but A can't be in 1, this is valid)

Between HARDY and RAPID, RAPID uses more new letters (P,I,D vs H,D,Y). I'll choose RAPID.

From the new feedback:

1. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 1.
2. A(✓) – A is in position 2 and is correct.
3. P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 3.
4. I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
5. D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So the secret word must:
- Have A in position 2.
- Contain R somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).
- Contain P somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 3).
- Not contain O, S, E, I, or D.

We need a 5-letter word that looks like: _ A _ _ _, and includes both R and P in the remaining slots (positions 1,3,4,5), with R not in position 1 and P not in position 3.

Possible positions for R and P:
- R could be in 3,4, or 5
- P could be in 1,2,4, or 5 (but A is already in 2, so 1,4,5)

Let's list possible combinations:
- If R is in 3: word would be _ A R _ _ → P must be in 1,4, or 5 → e.g., P A R _ _, _ A R P _, _ A R _ P
- If R is in 4: word would be _ A _ R _ → P must be in 1 or 5 → e.g., P A _ R _, _ A _ R P
- If R is in 5: word would be _ A _ _ R → P must be in 1 or 4 → e.g., P A _ _ R, _ A _ P R

Now let's think of valid English words fitting these patterns while excluding banned letters (O,S,E,I,D).

Examples:
- P A R K _ → PARK? but needs 5 letters, PARK_ maybe PARKA (but A is already used)
- P A R _ Y → PARRY (but Y is allowed)
- B A R P _ → BARPS is invalid
- C A R P _ → CARPS is plural, might not be accepted
- P A R C H → PARCH is invalid
- P A R T Y → PARTY (valid, no banned letters)
- F A R P _ → FARPS invalid
- C A R P S → CARPS (could be valid if plurals allowed)
- P A R C H → PARCH invalid
- P A R K Y → PARKY (valid word, means chilly)

Looking at PARTY:
- P A R T Y → positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
- R is in 3 (allowed, not 1)
- P is in 1 (allowed, not 3)
- No banned letters (O,S,E,I,D absent)
- A is correctly in 2

This seems perfect. 

Alternative PARKY also fits but is less common. PARTY is a better guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- A is correctly in position 2.
- R must be in positions 2-5 (but not 1, and not position 2 since A is there), so positions 3-5.
- P must be in positions 1,4, or 5 (cannot be position 3).
- Cannot contain O, S, E, I, or D.

The word ""PARTY"" fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- P is in position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Contains no banned letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PARKA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a solid first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me good coverage to test multiple letters in one guess.

However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which has:
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests more vowels in the first guess.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(-) means A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) means R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (marked with x).

So the secret word:
- contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- does NOT contain O, S, or E.

We need a word with A and R, avoiding O/S/E. Also avoid having A in position 1 and R in position 2.

Good candidates include:
- DRAIN (R in 2 is wrong per feedback, but A is in 3)
- TRAIL (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- CRANK (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- FRANK (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)
- BRAND (R in 2 is wrong, but A is in 3)

""DRAIN"" seems like a strong choice as it uses common letters and tests new consonants D, N while keeping A and R in different positions.

But checking positions: in DRAIN, R is in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so this is bad.

Better options:
- CRANK (A in 3, R in 2 - still R in wrong spot)
- FRANK (same issue)
- TRAIN (R in 2 again)

Let me think differently: we need A not in position 1 and R not in position 2. Possible positions:
A could be in 2-5
R could be in 1,3-5

Good words:
- CARGO (invalid - has O)
- MARRY (invalid - has two Rs and Y)
- HARDY (valid: A in 2, R in 3)
- MARCH (invalid - has C and H but let's see... E is out so no)
- PARTY (invalid - has Y)
- CARDS (invalid - has S)
- GUARD (A in 3, R in 4)
- RAPID (R in 1, A in 2 - but A can't be in 1, this is valid)
- RABID (same)
- RAVEN (invalid - has E)

Between HARDY and RAPID, RAPID uses more new letters (P,I,D vs H,D,Y). I'll choose RAPID.

Wait, checking RAPID positions: R is 1st, A is 2nd, P is 3rd, I is 4th, D is 5th.
From feedback:
- A is wrong in position 1 (ok, it's in 2)
- R is wrong in position 2 (ok, it's in 1)

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rapid -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

1. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 1.
2. A(✓) – A is in position 2 and is correct.
3. P(-) – P is in the word but not in position 3.
4. I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
5. D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So the secret word must:
- Have A in position 2.
- Contain R somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1).
- Contain P somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 3).
- Not contain O, S, E, I, or D.

We need a 5-letter word that looks like: _ A _ _ _, and includes both R and P in the remaining slots (positions 1,3,4,5), with R not in position 1 and P not in position 3.

Possible positions for R and P:
- R could be in 3,4, or 5
- P could be in 1,2,4, or 5 (but A is already in 2, so 1,4,5)

Let's list possible combinations:
- If R is in 3: word would be _ A R _ _ → P must be in 1,4, or 5 → e.g., P A R _ _, _ A R P _, _ A R _ P
- If R is in 4: word would be _ A _ R _ → P must be in 1 or 5 → e.g., P A _ R _, _ A _ R P
- If R is in 5: word would be _ A _ _ R → P must be in 1 or 4 → e.g., P A _ _ R, _ A _ P R

Now let's think of valid English words fitting these patterns while excluding banned letters (O,S,E,I,D).

Examples:
- P A R K _ → PARK? but needs 5 letters, PARK_ maybe PARKA (but A is already used)
- P A R _ Y → PARRY (but Y is allowed)
- B A R P _ → BARPS is invalid
- C A R P _ → CARPS is plural, might not be accepted
- P A R C H → PARCH is invalid
- P A R T Y → PARTY (valid, no banned letters)
- F A R P _ → FARPS invalid
- C A R P S → CARPS (could be valid if plurals allowed)
- P A R C H → PARCH invalid
- P A R K Y → PARKY (valid word, means chilly)

Looking at PARTY:
- P A R T Y → positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
- R is in 3 (allowed, not 1)
- P is in 1 (allowed, not 3)
- No banned letters (O,S,E,I,D absent)
- A is correctly in 2

This seems perfect. 

Alternative PARKY also fits but is less common. PARTY is a better guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is correctly in position 2.
- R must be in positions 2-5 (but not 1, and not position 2 since A is there), so positions 3-5.
- P must be in positions 1,4, or 5 (cannot be position 3).
- Cannot contain O, S, E, I, or D.

The word ""PARTY"" fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- P is in position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Contains no banned letters.

Examples:
- P A R K _ → PARK? but needs 5 letters, PARK_ maybe PARKA (but A is already used)
- P A R _ Y → PARRY (but Y is allowed)
- B A R P _ → BARPS is invalid
- C A R P _ → CARPS is plural, might not be accepted
- P A R C H → PARCH is invalid
- P A R T Y → PARTY (valid, no banned letters)
- F A R P _ → FARPS invalid
- C A R P S → CARPS (could be valid if plurals allowed)
- P A R C H → PARCH invalid
- P A R K Y → PARKY (valid word, means chilly)

Looking at PARTY:
- P A R T Y → positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
- R is in 3 (allowed, not 1)
- P is in 1 (allowed, not 3)
- No banned letters (O,S,E,I,D absent)
- A is correctly in 2

This seems perfect. 

Alternative PARKY also fits but is less common. PARTY is a better guess.Based on the feedback:
- A is correctly in position 2.
- R must be in positions 2-5 (but not 1, and not position 2 since A is there), so positions 3-5.
- P must be in positions 1,4, or 5 (cannot be position 3).
- Cannot contain O, S, E, I, or D.

The word ""PARTY"" fits all constraints:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not position 1).
- P is in position 1 (allowed, not position 3).
- Contains no banned letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: party -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)

- A(✓) → A is correct in position 2
- R(✓) → R is correct in position 3
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word

So the secret word now looks like P A R _ _ and we know it does NOT contain:
O, S, E, I, D, T, Y

Letters still available that have not been ruled out:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 4-5 from the remaining alphabet, forming a valid 5-letter word starting with PAR.

Possible endings:
- PAR + K + ? → PARK? (but we need 5 letters exactly)
- PAR + B + ? → PARB? (no common word)
- PAR + C + ? → PARC? (no)
- PAR + H + ? → PARH? (no)
- PAR + L + ? → PARL? (no)
- PAR + M + ? → PARM? (no)
- PAR + K + ? → PARK? (only 4 letters)
- PAR + K + ? → PARKE? (E is out)
- PAR + K + ? → PARKS (but S is out)
- PAR + K + ? → PARKI (I is out)
- PAR + K + ? → PARKY (Y is out)
- PAR + C + ? → PARCH (H is allowed, C is allowed)
- PAR + C + ? → PARC? (no valid 5-letter word)
- PAR + G + ? → PARG? (no)
- PAR + V + ? → PARV? (no)
- PAR + B + ? → PARB? (no)

Looking through, ""PARCH"" seems valid:
- P A R C H
- All letters are allowed (no banned letters)
- Forms a known 5-letter English word

Let me verify constraints:
- P, A, R in correct positions
- C and H are new letters not yet tested
- No banned letters present

This appears to be the only logical word fitting all constraints.

Alternative check:
PAR + G + ? → No common 5-letter words
PAR + K + ? → PARKS (S is out)
PAR + V + ? → PARVE (E is out)
PAR + C + ? → PARCH is indeed valid

Now we know:

1. P(✓) A(✓) R(✓) _ _  
   So the word starts exactly with PAR.

2. Letters already ruled out:
   O, S, E, I, D, T, Y, C, H

3. Remaining letters that have not appeared yet (and are not ruled out):
   B, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that begins with PAR and ends with any two letters from the remaining set, forming a valid English word.

List of 5-letter words starting with PAR that do NOT use any excluded letters:

- PAR + B + ? → PARB_ (none)
- PAR + F + ? → PARF_ (none)
- PAR + G + ? → PARG? (none)
- PAR + K + ? → PARK_ (only 4 letters)
- PAR + L + ? → PARL_ (none)
- PAR + M + ? → PARM_ (none)
- PAR + N + ? → PARN? (none)
- PAR + G + ? → PAR?G (none)
- PAR + K + ? → PARK? (only 4 letters)

Wait, let’s list every known English word beginning with PAR:

PARCH, PARKA, PARKS, PARKY, PAROL, PARSE, PARTI, PARTS, PARTY, PARVE, PARVO, PARIS

From these, eliminate any containing excluded letters (O,S,E,I,D,T,Y,C,H):

- PARCH – H excluded
- PARKA – ends with A (already used in position 2)
- PARKS – S excluded
- PARKY – Y excluded
- PAROL – O excluded
- PARSE – S,E excluded
- PARTI – T,I excluded
- PARTS – T,S excluded
- PARTY – T,Y excluded
- PARVE – E excluded
- PARVO – O excluded
- PARIS – I,S excluded

The only remaining possibility is PAR + K + ? → PARK? but PARK is only 4 letters.

Actually, checking again carefully, the word ""PARKA"" is 5 letters, but it repeats the letter A which is already fixed in position 2, and we cannot have A twice.

Therefore, the only valid remaining English word that fits all constraints is:

PARKY – but Y is excluded.

This implies I must have missed a word. Let me recheck:

Looking up 5-letter words starting with PAR (no repeats of excluded letters):

- PARGO – O excluded
- PARMA – A already used twice
- PARKI – I excluded
- PAREU – E,U excluded

It appears the only valid candidate is ""PARKA"" even though it repeats A, but we can't have A again. This suggests I need to look for other combinations.

Upon reflection, the correct word must use only unused letters. The remaining valid endings are:

PAR + K + ? → PARK? (no 5-letter word)
PAR + V + ? → PARV? (no)
PAR + B + ? → PARB? (no)
PAR + F + ? → PARF? (no)
PAR + G + ? → PARG? (no)
PAR + N + ? → PAR N? → PARN? (no)

But I've realized I missed ""PARKY"" (Y is excluded) and ""PARMA"" (A would repeat). 

However, there's one more: ""PARMA"" – but A repeats in position 4.

Actually, the only valid word left is ""PARKA"" even though it repeats A, but since A is already used in position 2 and cannot appear twice, this is invalid.

This suggests the only possible combination left is:

PAR + K + ? → PARK? (4 letters)

Wait, let me list all 5-letter ""PAR"" words and re-eliminate:

PARAE – E excluded
PARAS – S excluded
PARCH – H,C excluded
PARDI – D,I excluded
PARDO – O,D excluded

After exhaustive checking, the only possible word is:

""PARMA"" – but it repeats A, which is already in position 2. This is invalid.

This indicates an error in my earlier assumptions. Let me re-evaluate remaining letters and possible endings.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible endings for PAR:

PAR + B + ? → PARB? (none)
PAR + F + ? → PARF? (none)
PAR + G + ? → PARG? (none)
PAR + K + ? → PARK? (4 letters)
PAR + L + ? → PARL? (none)
PAR + M + ? → PARM? (none)
PAR + N + ? → PARN? (none)
PAR + V + ? → PARV? (none)

The only valid 5-letter word I can find that starts with PAR and uses only allowed letters is ""PARKA"", but this repeats A.

However, consulting a comprehensive dictionary, the word ""PARKA"" is indeed 5 letters and acceptable even with A repeating, as the game allows letter repetition.

But since A is already fixed in position 2, and we cannot have A again, this is impossible.

Upon deeper inspection, the correct word must be ""PARKA"" even with the repeated A, as it's the only valid English word left fitting the pattern and constraints. The feedback system would handle duplicates correctly.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

<guess>parka</guess>

The three known letters are fixed: P A R _ _.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, I, D, T, Y, C, H.  
Among 5-letter words starting with PAR that avoid those letters, only “PARKA” remains (the A is allowed to repeat).
