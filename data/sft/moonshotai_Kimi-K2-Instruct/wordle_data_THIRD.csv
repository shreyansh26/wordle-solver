Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently occurring consonants. This helps maximize information gain. A good starting word should ideally include:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. Another strong alternative is ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""SLATE"" is widely recognized as one of the best starting words statistically.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it provides a balanced mix of common letters and good positional coverage.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word  
- L: x → not in the word  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: - → exists in the word but is in the wrong position (currently in fourth slot)  
- E: x → not in the word  

We now know:
- The word contains T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position.  
- The letters S, L, A, E are all absent.  

Next steps:
1. Eliminate all words with S, L, A, or E.  
2. Ensure the word has at least one T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
3. Pick a new set of high-frequency consonants and vowels to test.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G  
Good vowels left: I, O, U  

We want a word with:
- T (not in 4th position)  
- Maybe I or O or U  
- Common consonants like R, N, C, etc.  

Candidate words:
- “TRIO” – only 4 letters, invalid.  
- “TRUNK” – has U and N, T in 1st slot.  

Let me check: TRUNK
Letters: T, R, U, N, K  
T is in 1st slot (not 4th), and we haven’t tested R, U, N, K yet.  

Another good candidate is “CRIMP” but it lacks T.  
“POINT” has T in 5th slot, so it’s valid.  

Between TRUNK and POINT, I’ll choose TRUNK because it tests more unused letters (U, N, K) and keeps T in 1st slot (a new position).

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we already knew:  
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- S, L, A, E are absent.  

From Guess 2 (TRUNK) we now learn:  
- T(✓) — T is in the word and is now locked into position 1 (T _ _ _ _).  
- R(-) — R is in the word but in a wrong position (so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5).  
- U(x), N(x), K(x) — these three letters are not in the word at all.  

So far we know the secret word looks like:  
T _ _ _ _  
and it definitely contains R somewhere (positions 2-5), but NOT in position 2.  
Letters already excluded: S, L, A, E, U, N, K.  

Remaining letters of high frequency include:  
Vowels: I, O (U is out)  
Consonants: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.  

Looking for 5-letter words beginning with T, containing R somewhere after position 1, and using none of the excluded letters.  

Quick scan of possibilities:  
- T R is locked in first position, R must appear later.  
- Early candidates:  
  – THIRD (but D is still untested, I and O are good vowels)  
  – TORCH (but O is allowed, C and H are fresh)  
  – TIGER (but G and E; E is already excluded)  
  – TROOP (but O is repeated)  

A strong fresh set of letters would be T, R, I, O, D.  
So “THIRD” tests I, D, and keeps R in a new slot (position 3).  

Therefore, my next guess: THIRD.
