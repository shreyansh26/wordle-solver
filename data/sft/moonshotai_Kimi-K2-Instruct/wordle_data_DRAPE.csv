For the first guess, since we have no information about the secret word, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help us eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses the most frequently used letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants.

The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good first guess that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, and E (common consonants and the most common letter E)

This will help us get feedback on 5 very common letters and their positions, which should provide good information for subsequent guesses.

From the three guesses we have:
- Pattern is now fixed at _ R A _ E
- Letters **not** in the word so far: C, N, O, S, G, T
- Letters **confirmed**: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5)

We need to fill the remaining positions 1 and 4 with letters that have not yet been ruled out and still form a valid 5-letter English word.

Remaining common letters (excluding the forbidden ones) include: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking at _ R A _ E:
- 1st letter options: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- 4th letter options: same set (must be a consonant since only one vowel slot is left; all vowels except A and E are ruled out)

Let’s list possible legal combinations:
- B R A V E
- B R A D E
- F R A M E
- D R A K E  → K hasn’t been used, but hasn’t been ruled out yet
- H R A P E  – not a word
- P R A C E  – C already ruled out
- L R A M E  – not a word
- M R A D E  – not a word
- F R A K E  – not a word, but F R A M E is valid
- D R A V E  – valid
- B R A V E – valid

The most common, valid words still remaining are:
- BRAVE
- FRAME
- DRAVE (less common)
- BRAKE (but K hasn’t been ruled out yet, though it’s less common)

Between BRAVE and FRAME:
- BRAVE uses B and V – both not yet tested.
- FRAME uses F and M – both not yet tested.

Both are equally valid guesses. Since B and V are slightly less common, I’ll go with BRAVE first.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, since we have no information about the secret word, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help us eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses the most frequently used letters in English, particularly vowels and common consonants.

The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good first guess that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A and O (common vowels)
- R, S, and E (common consonants and the most common letter E)

This will help us get feedback on 5 very common letters and their positions, which should provide good information for subsequent guesses.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E  
Known letters: R, E  
Letters not in the word: O, S  
Letters somewhere in the word (but not in position 1): A

We need a 5-letter word with R in position 2 and E in position 5, and an A somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be first). We also cannot use O or S.

Possible letters to try: other common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, B, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

Candidate words:
- TRAPE (but P isn't super common)
- CRANE (C, N are common, and A is in position 3)
- DRAIN (but this would put A in position 3, which is allowed, and N is common)
- BRINE (but B is less common than C or N)
- CRATE (but A is in position 3, which is allowed)

""CRANE"" fits perfectly:
- C in position 1 (not yet tested)
- R in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed, not yet tested)
- N in position 4 (common)
- E in position 5 (✓)

Possible middle consonants (pos 4) from the remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, etc.

Try a few:
- BRAVE – but V is allowed and fits: B R A V E

- FRAME – but M is allowed and fits: F R A M E
- TRACE – but C is forbidden
- BRACE – C is forbidden

“GRATE” uses G, R, A, T, E. G and T haven’t been tested yet, and T is a very common consonant. So GRATE is a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, O, S
- Letters that are definitely in: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5)

We need a 5-letter word that is _ R A _ E and avoids C, N, O, S.

Possible middle consonants (pos 4) from the remaining high-frequency letters: T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, etc.

Try a few:
- BRAVE – but V is allowed and fits: B R A V E
- GRADE – but D is allowed and fits: G R A D E
- FRAME – but M is allowed and fits: F R A M E
- TRACE – but C is forbidden
- BRACE – C is forbidden
- GRATE – T is allowed and fits: G R A T E

“GRATE” uses G, R, A, T, E. G and T haven’t been tested yet, and T is a very common consonant. So GRATE is a good next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:
- Pattern is now fixed at _ R A _ E
- Letters **not** in the word so far: C, N, O, S, G, T
- Letters **confirmed**: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5)

We need to fill the remaining positions 1 and 4 with letters that have not yet been ruled out and still form a valid 5-letter English word.

Remaining common letters (excluding the forbidden ones) include: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking at _ R A _ E:
- 1st letter options: B, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- 4th letter options: same set (must be a consonant since only one vowel slot is left; all vowels except A and E are ruled out)

Let’s list possible legal combinations:
- B R A V E
- B R A D E
- F R A M E
- D R A K E  → K hasn’t been used, but hasn’t been ruled out yet
- H R A P E  – not a word
- P R A C E  – C already ruled out
- L R A M E  – not a word
- M R A D E  – not a word
- F R A K E  – not a word, but F R A M E is valid
- D R A V E  – valid
- B R A V E – valid

The most common, valid words still remaining are:
- BRAVE
- FRAME
- DRAVE (less common)
- BRAKE (but K hasn’t been ruled out yet, though it’s less common)

Between BRAVE and FRAME:
- BRAVE uses B and V – both not yet tested.
- FRAME uses F and M – both not yet tested.

Both are equally valid guesses. Since B and V are slightly less common, I’ll go with BRAVE first.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- Fixed pattern: _ R A _ E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, O, S, G, T, B, V
- Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, H, L, M, P, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R A _ E and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s test possible consonants in position 1 and 4:

- D R A K E – K hasn’t been ruled out, and D hasn’t been ruled out.
- F R A M E – F and M haven’t been ruled out.
- D R A M E – not a valid word.
- P R A D E – P and D haven’t been ruled out.
- H R A M E – not a valid word.
- L R A D E – not a valid word.

Among these, DRAKE is a valid word and uses letters (D, K) that haven’t been ruled out yet. K is less common, but DRAKE is a valid word and fits the constraints.

Next best option is FRAME (F and M), but let’s check if there’s a better option.

PRADE is not a valid word. DRAKE is the only valid option left with the remaining letters.

Therefore, DRAKE is the best next guess.
