For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that includes common letters to quickly identify which letters are in or out of the secret word. The most effective first guesses typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in English words. Common choices include words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel placement early.
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words.
This gives us good coverage to maximize information gain from the first guess.

From the feedback:

- A is in the word but is not in position 1.  
- R is in the word and is in position 2.  
- O is not in the word at all.  
- S is not in the word at all.  
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- R is locked in the second position.
- E is locked in the fifth position.
- A must appear somewhere else (positions 2–5, but 2 and 5 are already taken by R and E, so positions 3 or 4).
- Letters O and S are completely out.

To maximize new information, I want a word that keeps R in slot 2 and E in slot 5, adds A in either slot 3 or 4, and introduces fresh consonants/vowels that haven’t been tested yet (avoiding O, S). Good fresh letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- BREAD – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 3, introduces B, D.
- CREAM – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 4, introduces C, M.
- FREAK – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 3, introduces F, K.
- GREAT – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 4, introduces G, T.

“GREAT” looks good because G and T are common and haven’t been used yet, and it places A in slot 4 (a new spot). Let’s go with it.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most effective first guesses typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in English words. Common choices include words like ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel placement early.
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words.
This gives us good coverage to maximize information gain from the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- A is in the word but is not in position 1.  
- R is in the word and is in position 2.  
- O is not in the word at all.  
- S is not in the word at all.  
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- R is locked in the second position.
- E is locked in the fifth position.
- A must appear somewhere else (positions 2–5, but 2 and 5 are already taken by R and E, so positions 3 or 4).
- Letters O and S are completely out.

To maximize new information, I want a word that keeps R in slot 2 and E in slot 5, adds A in either slot 3 or 4, and introduces fresh consonants/vowels that haven’t been tested yet (avoiding O, S). Good fresh letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- BREAD – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 3, introduces B, D.
- CREAM – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 4, introduces C, M.
- FREAK – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 3, introduces F, K.
- GREAT – keeps R-E in 2-5, puts A in 4, introduces G, T.

“GREAT” looks good because G and T are common and haven’t been used yet, and it places A in slot 4 (a new spot). Let’s go with it.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints from the two guesses:

   - R is in spot 2.

   - A is in the word but not in spot 1.
   - O and S are not in the word at all.

2. GREAT → G(x) R(✓) E(-) A(-) T(x)
   - Confirms R is in spot 2.
   - Confirms E is not in spot 3 (so E remains locked in spot 5).
   - A is in the word but not in spot 4 (so A must be in spot 3).
   - G and T are not in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E
- Known absent letters: O, S, G, T
- Still need to test: B, C, D, F, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need two more consonants to fill the first and fourth positions. Let’s pick common ones that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates:
- B and K → BRAKE
- C and K → CRANE
- F and M → FRAME
- D and M → DRAKE

“CRANE” uses C, N (both new), keeps R, A, E in their correct spots, and doesn’t reuse any excluded letters.
