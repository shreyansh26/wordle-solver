Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. Among the most frequent letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

A good opening word should:
1. Include several common letters
2. Avoid repeating any letter to cover more possibilities
3. Be a common word itself

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. After considering these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats.

From the first guess AROSE, we learned that:
- A appears in the word but is NOT in position 1.
- R, O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S, E
- Letter A is somewhere in positions 2-5.
- We should pick new letters that are common and haven't been tried yet.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, H, Y, K, W, V, etc.

We also want to avoid the forbidden letters R, O, S, E, and not put A in position 1.

Possible candidates: UNTIL, LAUGH, TANGO, NIGHT, CHANT, PLAIN, etc.

Let me pick a word that uses several completely new common letters and places A in a non-first position. ""UNTIL"" doesn't contain A. ""PLAIN"" contains A and avoids the forbidden letters. But let's try ""UNTIL"" first since it's very common, but actually it doesn't have A. ""PLANT"" is good but has T which we haven't tried, and A isn't first. ""CHINA"" uses C, H, I, N, A - all new except A which we know is in the word somewhere.

Another good option is ""UNTIL"" but it lacks A. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N - all new except A.

3. MATCH → M(x) A(✓) T(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – A is now fixed in position 2 (✓).  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – M, C, H are NOT in the word.

Summary of current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, M, C, H
- T appears somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, U, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V, J, Q, X, Z (but we can ignore very rare ones).  
We also know T must appear once.

So the word must be in the form: T A _ _ _ or _ A T _ _ or _ A _ T _ or _ A _ _ T.

But since T is NOT in position 3 (from MATCH feedback), and A is fixed in position 2, the possible patterns are:
- T A _ _ _
- _ A _ T _
- _ A _ _ T

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using only allowed letters.

Candidates:
- TABBY (B appears twice, but B is allowed)  
- TACIT (I is forbidden)  
- TAFKY (not a word)  
- TACKY (C is forbidden)  
- TAWNY (W, N, Y: N is forbidden)  
- TAXED (D, X, E: E is forbidden)  
- TANGO (O is forbidden)  
- TAKEN (K, E, N: E and N are forbidden)  
- TARDY (R is forbidden)  
- YAULD (not common)  
- GAUDY (G, A, U, D, Y – fits _ A _ _ T, but Y is allowed)  
- GAULT (not a word)  
- DAUNT (D, A, U, N, T: N is forbidden)  
- DAUBT (not a word)  
- BAWDY (B, A, W, D, Y – fits _ A _ _ T, but T is missing)  
- BAGGY (G appears twice)  

Actually, let’s focus on words with T and A in allowed positions.  
From the pattern _ A _ _ T seems promising.

Possible endings: A _ _ T  
Common letters left: D, U, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in T with A in position 2:
- DAUNT (N is forbidden)  
- GAUNT (N is forbidden)  
- BAUKT (not a word)  
- FAUST (F, A, U, S, T: S is forbidden)  
- DAUBT (not a word)  
- VAULT (V, A, U, L, T: L is forbidden)  

Hmm, none of these work due to forbidden letters.

TABBY seems the only valid one here, despite double B.

Another check: _ A _ _ T  
Word must be 5 letters, A in 2nd, T in 5th.  
Letters left: D, U, G, B, F, Y, K, W, V  
Possible: DAUBT (not a word), BAUKT (no), DAFTY (no), GAUMY (no)  
Actually, ""DAUBT"" isn't valid, but ""DAUNT"" would be if N weren't forbidden.

Wait, let’s try ""BAGGY"" – but G repeats and Y is allowed.  
""GABBY"" – G, A, B, B, Y: fits _ A _ _ T, but T is missing.  
""TABBY"" – T, A, B, B, Y: fits T A _ _ _. T is in position 1, which is allowed.

""TABBY"" uses:
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (fixed)  
- B twice (B is allowed)

No forbidden letters are used. This seems valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good opening word should:
1. Include several common letters

3. Be a common word itself

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. After considering these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, we learned that:
- A appears in the word but is NOT in position 1.
- R, O, S, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S, E
- Letter A is somewhere in positions 2-5.
- We should pick new letters that are common and haven't been tried yet.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, H, Y, K, W, V, etc.

We also want to avoid the forbidden letters R, O, S, E, and not put A in position 1.

Possible candidates: UNTIL, LAUGH, TANGO, NIGHT, CHANT, PLAIN, etc.

Let me pick a word that uses several completely new common letters and places A in a non-first position. ""UNTIL"" doesn't contain A. ""PLAIN"" contains A and avoids the forbidden letters. But let's try ""UNTIL"" first since it's very common, but actually it doesn't have A. ""PLANT"" is good but has T which we haven't tried, and A isn't first. ""CHINA"" uses C, H, I, N, A - all new except A which we know is in the word somewhere.

Another good option is ""UNTIL"" but it lacks A. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N - all new except A.

I'll go with ""PLAIN"" as it includes A (which we know is in the word), and four completely new letters P, L, I, N.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – P, L, I, N are NOT in the word.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 4.

Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N  
Known contained letter: A (but not in positions 1 or 4).

We still need to place A in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.  
Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: T, D, U, C, M, G, B, F, H, Y, K, W, V, etc.

A good third guess should:
- Include A (since we know it’s in the word).  
- Avoid all forbidden letters.  
- Place A in spot 2, 3, or 5.  
- Use new, common letters.

Candidate words:
- A in position 2: TACIT, HABIT (but I is forbidden) → not suitable.  
- A in position 3: MATCH (T, C, H, M unused), but MATCH has T, C, H.  
- A in position 5: GULAG (but G appears twice), not ideal.

Better: “MATCH” uses M, A, T, C, H – none forbidden, and places A in position 2.

After considering these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the first guess AROSE, we learned that:\n- A appears in the word but is NOT in position 1.\n- R, O, S, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore:\n- Letters to avoid: R, O, S, E\n- Letter A is somewhere in positions 2-5.\n- We should pick new letters that are common and haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nGood remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, G, B, F, H, Y, K, W, V, etc.\n\nWe also want to avoid the forbidden letters R, O, S, E, and not put A in position 1.\n\nPossible candidates: UNTIL, LAUGH, TANGO, NIGHT, CHANT, PLAIN, etc.\n\nLet me pick a word that uses several completely new common letters and places A in a non-first position. ""UNTIL"" doesn\'t contain A. ""PLAIN"" contains A and avoids the forbidden letters. But let\'s try ""UNTIL"" first since it\'s very common, but actually it doesn\'t have A. ""PLANT"" is good but has T which we haven\'t tried, and A isn\'t first. ""CHINA"" uses C, H, I, N, A - all new except A which we know is in the word somewhere.\n\nAnother good option is ""UNTIL"" but it lacks A. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N - all new except A.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PLAIN"" as it includes A (which we know is in the word), and four completely new letters P, L, I, N.\n\n<guess>PLAIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'After two guesses we have:\n\n1.

From the four guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, not in position 1.

2. PLAIN → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – A is in the word, not in position 4.

3. MATCH → M(x) A(✓) T(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – A locked in position 2.
   – T is in the word, but not in position 3.

4. TABBY → T(✓) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(✓)  
   – T locked in position 1.
   – A locked in position 2.
   – Y locked in position 5.
   – B is NOT in the word.

Current known pattern: T A _ _ Y  
Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, M, C, H, B  
Still-missing letters must be placed in positions 3 and 4, using any letters not yet ruled out.

Available letters (common ones): D, U, G, F, K, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form T A _ _ Y.

Possible letters for positions 3 & 4:  
Looking for common two-letter combinations that make valid words ending in T A _ _ Y.

Candidate words:
- TAFFY (T, A, F, F, Y) → F is allowed, and we have no info against it.
- TANGY (N is forbidden) – invalid.
- TARDY (R is forbidden) – invalid.
- TAWNY (N is forbidden) – invalid.
- TAUTY (not a word).
- TACKY (C is forbidden) – invalid.
- TAWDY (W, D, Y – all allowed) but is ""TAWDY"" a word? It’s not standard.
- TAFFY is valid.

""TAFFY"" uses T, A, F, F, Y – all allowed letters, fits the pattern, and is a legitimate 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess is TAFFY.
