- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that will give maximum information. A good strategy is to use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I want to include as many of these as possible in my first guess while making a valid word.

Some strong first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good as it includes 5 of the most common letters and avoids less common consonants like C or T in the first position. This should give us good coverage to learn about the secret word's letters.

Good candidate letters to try next: I, N, T, L, U, D, P, M, Y, G, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) - has R, O and good coverage

From the first two guesses we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – No A, S, E  
   – R exists, but not in position 1  
   – O exists, but not in position 2  

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)  
   – No N, D  
   – R exists, but not in position 1 (confirms earlier)  
   – O exists, but not in position 2 (confirms earlier)  
   – U exists somewhere (but not in position 3)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters R, O, U (each at least once)  
- Must NOT contain A, S, E, N, D  
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because ROUND showed R not in position 1, and AROSE already showed R not in position 2)  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3  
- U cannot be in position 3  

We still need to place R, O, U plus two other consonants drawn from the still-legal letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s build candidate words:
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5  
- O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- U must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but can’t repeat positions already excluded)

One high-frequency word that satisfies:
  – R in position 3 or 4  
  – O in position 1 or 5  
  – U in position 2 or 4  
and introduces new common letters is “PROXY” (but Y is sometimes disliked).  
A better, fully legal word is “CURIO”, but it contains I and duplicates no letters.

Wait: CURIO contains C, U, R, I, O – all legal so far:
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed)  
- C and I are new letters.

So CURIO is a strong next guess.
