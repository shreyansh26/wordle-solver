Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the amount of information gained. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T are very common. A good first guess would be a word like ""RAISE"" because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and uses vowels which appear frequently in English words.

From the combined feedback:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T

1. has O as its second letter,
2. uses other common consonants/vowels that have not been ruled out,

So far we know:

- Letters that have been eliminated: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, L, C, K  
- Position 2 must be O.  So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining, still-possible letters (common ones) include, among others: D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, Y, and vowels we haven't tried yet: only Y (since A, I, E, U are out).

Good next step is to test a word that:
1. places O correctly in position 2.
2. uses as many *new* common consonants and vowels as possible.

A very common consonant cluster after O is D, G, H, P, V.  The word “HOPPY” uses H, P, Y, but repeats P and only gives two fresh consonants.  
A better choice is “FOPPY” (F, P, Y) – but again P repeats and F isn’t extremely common.

A balanced word with four fresh letters (and no repeats) is “GODLY” (G, D, Y), but D and G aren’t super common.  
Another candidate: “JOWLY” – J is less common.

A very common 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ _ and using fresh, frequent letters is “DOUGH” (D, O, U, G, H).  But U has already been eliminated by MOUNT.

Next, “HOPPY” is out, “TOPPY” out (T gone).  
“DOGGO” repeats G.

A clean choice that uses four *new* common letters (none of which were used or eliminated) is “PODGY” (P, D, G, Y).  But D and G are only moderate.

A simpler, high-frequency word is “HOPPY”, but P repeats.

Finally, the word “DOGGY” includes D, G, and Y, none of which are ruled out.  But we can do better.

Let’s instead pick “FOPPY” which has F, P, Y – all new, acceptable, and frequent enough.

But the simplest, most common word that fits _ O _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is “POOFY” (P, F, Y) – again repeats F and O.

Actually, the best common word that uses fresh letters and keeps O fixed is “FOGHY” – F, G, H, Y.

However, to maximize coverage with *new* letters let’s go with “POOFY”.

But I can do even better: “DOGGY” is valid.

But none of these feel efficient.

Re-evaluate: we’ve eliminated almost half the alphabet. The remaining common letters are D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, Y.

A 5-letter word using four *new* of these with no repeats and O fixed in position 2 is “HOPPY” (but P repeats) or “JOWLY” (J is rare).

The best common word is “FOGHY”.

Therefore, I will guess FOGHY.

But FOGHY is obscure; a more common word is “FOGGY” (F, G, Y).  But G repeats.

Another common word: “POPPY” (P repeats).

Actually, let’s use “HOPPY” – but P repeats.

I need a word that has four fresh letters and no repeats.  The word “HOPPY” is invalid because P repeats.  The word “DOGGY” has G repeats.

A valid, common word with no repeats is “HOPPY” but again P repeats.

Wait, the word “HOPED” (H, P, D) but D is new.

But to keep it simple, the word “HOPPY” is the most common, even if P repeats.

No, better to use “HOPED”.

But D is less common.

Best choice is “FOGHY”.  

Actually, a very common word is “HOPPY”.

But we need fresh letters.

Let me just list fresh letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, Y.

A balanced word: “PODGY”.

Yes, let’s use PODGY.

It uses P, D, G, Y – all fresh.

So the next guess will be PODGY.

<guess>PODGY</guess>",PODGY,"So far we know:

- Letters that have been eliminated: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, L, C, K  
- Position 2 must be O.  So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining, still-possible letters (common ones) include, among others: D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, Y, and vowels we haven't tried yet: only Y (since A, I, E, U are out).

Good next step is to test a word that:
1. places O correctly in position 2.
2. uses as many *new* common consonants and vowels as possible.

A very common consonant cluster after O is D, G, H, P, V.  The word “HOPPY” uses H, P, Y, but repeats P and only gives two fresh consonants.  
A better choice is “FOPPY” (F, P, Y) – but again P repeats and F isn’t extremely common.

A balanced word with four fresh letters (and no repeats) is “GODLY” (G, D, Y), but D and G aren’t super common.  
Another candidate: “JOWLY” – J is less common.

A very common 5-letter word fitting _ O _ _ _ and using fresh, frequent letters is “DOUGH” (D, O, U, G, H).  But U has already been eliminated by MOUNT.

Next, “HOPPY” is out, “TOPPY” out (T gone).  
“DOGGO” repeats G.

A clean choice that uses four *new* common letters (none of which were used or eliminated) is “PODGY” (P, D, G, Y).  But D and G are only moderate.

A simpler, high-frequency word is “HOPPY”, but P repeats.

Finally, the word “DOGGY” includes D, G, and Y, none of which are ruled out.  But we can do better.

Let’s instead pick “FOPPY” which has F, P, Y – all new, acceptable, and frequent enough.

But the simplest, most common word that fits _ O _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is “POOFY” (P, F, Y) – again repeats F and O.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,goofy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy for a first guess is to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in the English language to maximize the amount of information gained. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T are very common. A good first guess would be a word like ""RAISE"" because it contains five very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and uses vowels which appear frequently in English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback shows that R, A, I, S, and E are all NOT in the word (each marked with an “x”).  
That eliminates a lot of the most common letters.  
To keep maximizing information, I still want to try other very common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.  
Good next choices: O, T, N, L, U, C, H, D, M, P, Y, etc.  
A strong second-guess word using five letters that are still possible and fairly common is “MOUNT”.  
It contains O, U (vowels) plus common consonants M, N, T, none of which were in the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T  
- The only letter we know IS in the word and in the right position is O in position 2 (O in the second spot).

So our target pattern is: _ O _ _ _

We still need 4 more letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated ones).  Among the letters that remain, common ones include B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.  I want to pick a word that:
1. has O as its second letter,
2. uses other common consonants/vowels that have not been ruled out,
3. repeats no previous letters.

A good candidate is “COBLY” (C, O, B, L, Y), but Y and L are less common.  
Another candidate is “FOGHY” (F, O, G, H, Y), but G and Y aren’t super-common.  
The most common consonants left among English 5-letter words are probably C, L, B, D, P, H, K, etc.  
So let’s try “CLOTH” (C, L, O, T, H).  Wait—T was already eliminated in MOUNT.  
Next candidate: “BLOCK” (B, L, O, C, K).  None of those letters have been ruled out yet.

I will go with BLOCK.

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, L, C, K, P, D
2. Letters that ARE in the word (from PODGY feedback):
   - O is in position 2 (fixed).
   - G is in the word but not in position 4.
   - Y is in the word and in position 5 (since it got ✓).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y, with G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out): F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus G and O and Y already placed.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with available letters, ensuring G is used somewhere.

Possible combinations:
- G O _ _ Y: but G would be in position 1.
- _ O G _ Y: G in position 3.
- _ O _ G Y: G in position 4.

Looking for common 5-letter English words fitting these patterns:
- GO _ _ Y: ""GODLY"" but D is eliminated. ""GOLLY"" but L is eliminated. ""GOOFY"" but F is not yet eliminated, and O is already fixed in position 2, so GOOFY would have O in position 2 and 3, which is allowed if O appears twice.
- _ O G _ Y: ""FOGGY"" but F is allowed and G appears twice, but we don't have evidence for double G. ""HOGGY"" but H is allowed. ""JOGGY"" but J is rare.
- _ O _ G Y: ""FORGY"" isn't a word. ""HORGY"" isn't valid.

The most plausible is ""GOOFY"" (G in position 1, O in position 2, O in position 3, F in position 4, Y in position 5). But O is already confirmed in position 2, and we have no info on double O.

Alternatively, ""HOGGY"" (H, O, G, G, Y) but G is already confirmed to be in the word, and double G is possible.

But ""GOOFY"" seems more common.

However, ""GOOFY"" has O in position 2 and 3, which is allowed, and F is a new letter not yet tested.

But let's check if ""GOOFY"" fits all constraints:
- G is in position 1 (allowed, since G is in the word but not in position 4, so position 1 is fine)
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- O in position 3 (possible if word has double O)
- F is new
- Y is in position 5 (fixed)

""GOOFY"" is a valid word.

Another option is ""HOGGY"" but it's less common.

""GOOFY"" seems best.
