- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct, common letters to test as many possibilities as possible.

Common first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

So far we know:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- The word definitely contains the letter O in the second position (index 2, 1-based).

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested: I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, etc.  
We still need to determine what the other four letters are and where they sit, with O locked in position 2.

Our next probe should introduce several new common consonants and vowels while keeping O fixed.  
A good tactic is to place O in the middle and surround it with fresh, frequent letters that haven’t appeared yet.

Candidate words:
- CHOMP: uses C, H, O, M, P (all new letters except O)
- MOPED: uses M, O, P, E, D – but D and E already ruled out.
- POKY: too short and Y is less common.
- GROIN: uses G, R, O, I, N – but R and N are ruled out.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Common first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

We still need to determine what the other four letters are and where they sit, with O locked in position 2.

A good tactic is to place O in the middle and surround it with fresh, frequent letters that haven’t appeared yet.

- MOPED: uses M, O, P, E, D – but D and E already ruled out.

- ROOFY (R and F still possible, but R is ruled out)
- WOODY (W and D ruled out)

Strongest candidates:  
BOOBY, BOGGY, FOGGY, GOOFY, KOOKY

We can filter by which of these use only allowed letters:
- BOOBY: B, O, O, B, Y — B and Y are allowed.
- BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y — B, G, Y are allowed.
- FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y — F, G, Y are allowed.
- GOOFY: G, O, O, F, Y — G, F, Y are allowed.
- KOOKY: K, O, O, K, Y — K, Y are allowed.

Let’s pick one that tests new letters.  
GOOFY uses G and F (new), and we already know O and Y are correct.  
BOOBY only adds B, which is less informative.

Next best choice: GOOFY (tests G and F).

Wait — but we have only two tries left, so we need a systematic approach.

Actually, let’s first list all possible letters for each slot:

- Position 1: must be from {B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V}
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: must be from {B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V} (but not Z, W, etc.)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Pattern: X O O _ Y

Looking up valid words:

- BOOBY
- BOGGY
- FOGGY
- GOOFY
- KOOKY

We can eliminate BOOBY (double B) and GOOFY (G and F), but we want to test letters efficiently.

Let’s try a word that introduces new consonants.  
BOGGY introduces G and G again (but only G is new).  
FOGGY introduces F and G.  
KOOKY introduces K.

But KOOKY is the only one introducing K, which is untested.

Let’s go with KOOKY to test K.

If KOOKY is fully correct, we win.  
If not, we’ll get more info.

But wait — KOOKY is a valid word and fits the pattern _ O O _ Y with K in positions 1 and 4.

   S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, H, M, P, W, Z

3. Letters still allowed (common ones):
   B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, X, Y (Y is already in position 5)

4. Pattern so far:  
   _ O O _ Y

Valid 5-letter English words fitting this pattern:
- BOOBY
- BOGGY
- DOOGY (not an actual word)
- FOOBY (slang, uncommon)
- FOGGY
- GOOFY
- JOOBY (not a word)
- KOOKY
- LOOBY (obscure, probably not the target)
- MOODY (but D and M are ruled out)
- ROOFY (R and F still possible, but R is ruled out)
- WOODY (W and D ruled out)

Strongest candidates:  
BOOBY, BOGGY, FOGGY, GOOFY, KOOKY

We can filter by which of these use only allowed letters:
- BOOBY: B, O, O, B, Y — B and Y are allowed.
- BOGGY: B, O, G, G, Y — B, G, Y are allowed.
- FOGGY: F, O, G, G, Y — F, G, Y are allowed.
- GOOFY: G, O, O, F, Y — G, F, Y are allowed.
- KOOKY: K, O, O, K, Y — K, Y are allowed.

Let’s pick one that tests new letters.  
GOOFY uses G and F (new), and we already know O and Y are correct.  
BOOBY only adds B, which is less informative.

Next best choice: GOOFY (tests G and F).

Wait — but we have only two tries left, so we need a systematic approach.

Actually, let’s first list all possible letters for each slot:

- Position 1: must be from {B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V}
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: must be from {B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V} (but not Z, W, etc.)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Pattern: X O O _ Y

Looking up valid words:

- BOOBY
- BOGGY
- FOGGY
- GOOFY
- KOOKY

We can eliminate BOOBY (double B) and GOOFY (G and F), but we want to test letters efficiently.

Let’s try a word that introduces new consonants.  
BOGGY introduces G and G again (but only G is new).  
FOGGY introduces F and G.  
KOOKY introduces K.

But KOOKY is the only one introducing K, which is untested.

Let’s go with KOOKY to test K.

If KOOKY is fully correct, we win.  
If not, we’ll get more info.

But wait — KOOKY is a valid word and fits the pattern _ O O _ Y with K in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s try KOOKY.

However, let’s double-check:  
KOOKY uses K, O, O, K, Y.  
Positions: K (new), O (correct), O (correct), K (new), Y (correct).  
If KOOKY is the word, we win.  
If not, we’ll learn whether K is in positions 1 or 4.

But we have only two guesses left, so let’s be a bit more targeted.

Looking back at the remaining letters:  
Allowed letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V

Possible words:
- BOOBY
- BOGGY
- FOGGY
- GOOFY
- KOOKY

Among these, BOOBY is a common word and introduces B.  
Let’s try BOOBY next to test B.

BOOBY: B, O, O, B, Y

If BOOBY is correct, we win.  
If not, we’ll know B is not in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s go with BOOBY.

- Position 2: O  ✓
- Position 3: O  ✓
- Position 4: not B, not any of the previously ruled-out letters
- Position 5: Y  ✓

So the word must be of the form  _  O  O  _  Y, and all letters used so far that are excluded are:

That leaves the following still-allowed consonants: F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, X

From an English-word list, the only common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O O _ Y with those remaining letters are:

- GOOFY   (G, F)

Both are valid and use only allowed letters.  
Between the two, I’ll pick FOGGY because it tests F in position 1 and G in position 4. If FOGGY is correct, we win; if not, we still have one more guess, but this is the last allowed turn, so we must choose the most likely candidate now.
