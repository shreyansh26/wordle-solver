For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. The best starting words typically contain vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good strategic first word would combine these. 

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common consonants (S, L, T)
2. It has 2 of the most common vowels (A, E)
3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information
4. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage to make an informed second guess based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x – not in the word
- L: x – not in the word
- A: - – is in the word but not in the 2nd position
- T: x – not in the word
- E: ✓ – is in the word and in the 5th position

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains the letter A, but A is not in position 2.
- The letters S, L, T are not in the word at all.
- Remaining positions 1, 3, 4 can be any letters except S, L, T.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Includes A somewhere (but not in position 2).
3. Does not contain S, L, T.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters like R, N, C, H, D, etc. A good candidate is “CHARE” (a variant spelling of “char” or “chare”), but that might be obscure. Another option is “RANGE” – let's check:
- R: allowed
- A: allowed and not in position 2
- N: allowed
- G: allowed
- E: in position 5 ✓

This seems valid and uses common letters.

The best starting words typically contain vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N to help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good strategic first word would combine these. \n\nAfter considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because:\n1. It contains 3 of the most common consonants (S, L, T)\n2. It has 2 of the most common vowels (A, E)\n3. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information\n4.

From the latest feedback (ABIDE):

1. A is now ✓ in position 1 – so the word starts with A.
2. B is ✓ in position 2 – so the second letter is B.
3. E is ✓ in position 5 – so the last letter is E.
4. I and D are x – they are NOT in the word at all.

Letters we already know are *not* in the word (from all feedback so far):
S, L, T, R, N, G, I, D.

So the word has the form:
A B _ _ E
with the blanks needing letters that have NOT been ruled out.
Available consonants/vowels still allowed that haven’t appeared yet include:
C, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters to fill positions 3 and 4.  The most common remaining letters are C, F, H, K, M, O, P, U, Y.

Let’s try common combinations quickly:

- A B C _ E → “AB C ? E” – possible.
- A B O _ E → “AB O ? E” – possible.
- A B U _ E → “AB U ? E” – possible.

Let’s pick “ABODE”.  
Check: A ✓, B ✓, O allowed, D already excluded (from feedback, D is x). So “ABODE” uses D which is x – invalid.

Next candidate: “ABUZZ” – ends in ZZ, not E – invalid.

Try “ABOVE”.  
Letters: A ✓, B ✓, O allowed, V allowed, E ✓.  
No forbidden letters (no I, D, S, L, T, R, N, G).  
“ABOVE” is a valid English word and fits every constraint.

Let’s go with “ABOVE”.
