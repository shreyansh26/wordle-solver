For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gained. A good starting strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This should give me good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the word, and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the fourth position ( _ _ _ S _ ).
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ S _ (fourth letter is S)
- Contains R (but not in position 2)
- Does NOT contain A, O, E

I need a word that fits _ _ _ S _ , has an R not in position 2, and avoids A/O/E.
Potential consonants left to try include D, I, L, N, T, U, etc. with common remaining vowels likely being I or U.

A good candidate word: ""TRUST""
- Fourth letter is S ✓
- Contains R (and R is in position 2 here, which we know is wrong, so this will test if R shows up elsewhere)
- Avoids A, O, E
- T and U are common remaining letters to test

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
2. TRUST → T(-) R(-) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)

Deductions:
- S is fixed in position 4: _ _ _ S _
- The word contains both R and T (because R(-) and T(-) in their guessed positions).
- Neither R nor T is in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since they were placed in positions 2 and 1/5 in the guesses and were marked wrong-position).
- Therefore R must be in position 3 or 5, and T must be in position 3 or 5 (but not the same position).
- Letters not in the word: A, O, E, U
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the known R and T)

Combining these constraints:
- Position 4 is S.
- R and T must occupy positions 3 and 5 in some order.
- Positions 1 and 2 can be any remaining consonants or I (the only remaining common vowel not yet ruled out).

Possible patterns:
Case 1: _ _ R S T
Case 2: _ _ T S R

I need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common remaining letters. The word ""FIRST"" fits Case 2 (_ _ T S R) and uses common letters F, I, R, S, T.
