For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gained.

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"" are good starting points because they contain frequently used letters in English. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

""RAISE"" is a valid 5-letter English word and covers several high-frequency letters that might appear in the secret word.

The feedback from RAISE:

A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.

1. First letter is R.
2. The word does NOT contain A, I, or S.
3. It does contain E, but not in position 5 (since E was the last letter and got “-”).

Common letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll pick a word that uses frequent consonants and puts E in a new position (2nd, 3rd, or 4th). A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Starts with R.
- Contains E in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Doesn’t have A, I, or S.

Other valid options could be “RHYME”, “ROGER”, “REBEL”, etc., but “ROUTE” feels like a balanced choice.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ROWER,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gained.

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"" are good starting points because they contain frequently used letters in English. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

""RAISE"" is a valid 5-letter English word and covers several high-frequency letters that might appear in the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from RAISE:
R(✓) – R is the first letter and is in the correct spot.
A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
1. First letter is R.
2. The word does NOT contain A, I, or S.
3. It does contain E, but not in position 5 (since E was the last letter and got “-”).

We need a 5-letter word starting with R, containing E somewhere other than the 5th position, and without A, I, or S.

Common letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll pick a word that uses frequent consonants and puts E in a new position (2nd, 3rd, or 4th). A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Starts with R.
- Contains E in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Doesn’t have A, I, or S.

Other valid options could be “RHYME”, “ROGER”, “REBEL”, etc., but “ROUTE” feels like a balanced choice.

- E must appear somewhere (but not in positions 2, 4 or 5)

- Therefore the word has the pattern R O _ E _ with the last letter unknown.

Remaining unused common letters that are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching R O _ E _. Possible options:
- ROBED
- ROGUE
- ROWER
- ROGER
- ROQUE
- ROVED
- ROYAL (contains A, rejected)
- ROUGE
- ROVED
- ROPEN (not a valid word)

Among these, ""ROGER"" is a common English word that fits the pattern and the constraints.
