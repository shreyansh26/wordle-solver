For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters in diverse positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Traditional strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- TARES (T, A, R, E, S)

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers:
- 2 very common vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- All letters in different positions
- Forms valid words with many combinations

I'll go with SLATE as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.  
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _ and contains E somewhere inside (positions 2-4).

Next step: find five–letter words beginning with S and containing E.  To maximize information, pick a word with:
- No L, A, T (already ruled out)  
- E moved to a new slot (I’ll try position 2)  
- Three new consonants that are frequent in English (e.g., N, R, D)

Good candidates: SNEER, SPREE, SCREE, SPEND, SPEAR, etc.  
Among these, “SNEER” hits common letters, keeps S fixed, positions E in the second spot, and introduces N and R (both very common) plus a second E in the fourth spot.  
It also satisfies the constraint that L, A, T are absent.

From the feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E must appear at least once, and it is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE and SNEER feedback).
3. R is in position 5 (✓).
4. The word is therefore: S _ _ E R (with the second E already confirmed in position 5, so the previous E(-) must refer to position 2 in SNEER).
5. Letters ruled out: L, A, T, N.

So the pattern is S _ _ E R, and we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with valid letters (not L, A, T, N).

Common consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels still available: I, O, U (since E is already used and A is ruled out).

Let’s consider common combinations:
- S P I E R (a legitimate word meaning a scout; also common in British English)
- S C U E R
- S W I E R

""SPIER"" is a valid 5-letter word and uses common letters (P and I). It fits all constraints:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters in diverse positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Traditional strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- TARES (T, A, R, E, S)

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers:
- 2 very common vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- All letters in different positions
- Forms valid words with many combinations

I'll go with SLATE as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position.  
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _ and contains E somewhere inside (positions 2-4).

Next step: find five–letter words beginning with S and containing E.  To maximize information, pick a word with:
- No L, A, T (already ruled out)  
- E moved to a new slot (I’ll try position 2)  
- Three new consonants that are frequent in English (e.g., N, R, D)

Good candidates: SNEER, SPREE, SCREE, SPEND, SPEAR, etc.  
Among these, “SNEER” hits common letters, keeps S fixed, positions E in the second spot, and introduces N and R (both very common) plus a second E in the fourth spot.  
It also satisfies the constraint that L, A, T are absent.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E must appear at least once, and it is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE and SNEER feedback).
3. R is in position 5 (✓).
4. The word is therefore: S _ _ E R (with the second E already confirmed in position 5, so the previous E(-) must refer to position 2 in SNEER).
5. Letters ruled out: L, A, T, N.

So the pattern is S _ _ E R, and we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with valid letters (not L, A, T, N).

Common consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels still available: I, O, U (since E is already used and A is ruled out).

Let’s consider common combinations:
- S P I E R (a legitimate word meaning a scout; also common in British English)
- S C U E R
- S W I E R

""SPIER"" is a valid 5-letter word and uses common letters (P and I). It fits all constraints:
- Starts with S and ends with R.
- E is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- Introduces new letters P and I for more information.

Thus, SPIER is a strong next guess.

4. The word is therefore: S _ _ E R (with the second E already confirmed in position 5, so the previous E(-) must refer to position 2 in SNEER).
5. Letters ruled out: L, A, T, N.

So the pattern is S _ _ E R, and we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with valid letters (not L, A, T, N).

Common consonants still available: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Vowels still available: I, O, U (since E is already used and A is ruled out).

Let’s consider common combinations:
- S P I E R (a legitimate word meaning a scout; also common in British English)
- S C U E R
- S W I E R

""SPIER"" is a valid 5-letter word and uses common letters (P and I). It fits all constraints:
- Starts with S and ends with R.
- E is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- Introduces new letters P and I for more information.

Thus, SPIER is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

- Pattern: S _ _ E R  (positions 1, 4, 5 are fixed)
- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, R  
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T, N, P, I  

So positions 2 and 3 must be chosen from letters not yet tested and not in the “no” list.  
Un-eliminated common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, B  
Un-eliminated vowels: O, U  

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, both consonants or one consonant + one vowel, forming a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, ends with ER, and uses only allowed letters.

Scrabble-valid options:
- SCUER (not common)
- SKIER (I already ruled out)
- SUGER (not a word)
- SWEER (valid in Scrabble)
- SOWER (O is allowed, W is allowed)
- SOBER (O, B allowed)
- SUPER (U, P ruled out)
- SHEER (H, E allowed)

Among these, ""SHEER"" uses S, H, E, E, R.  
- E is already known to appear at least once (actually twice is fine).  
- H and the second E are new letters that give maximum information.  
- It’s a common word.

Let’s go with SHEER.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated constraints after four guesses:

1. Pattern is still S _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, 5 fixed).
2. Letters ruled out so far: L, A, T, N, P, I, H (from feedback), plus earlier S, E, R are already placed.
3. E is confirmed in position 4 (✓), but the feedback from guesses 2 and 4 (E(-)) refers to E being absent in positions 2 and 3.  
   Therefore, the word must contain E only in positions 1, 4, 5 (positions already filled), and no extra E elsewhere.
4. We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O, U.  
   We must form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible valid words fitting S _ _ E R:
- SOWER (S-O-W-E-R) – O and W are unused.
- SOBER (S-O-B-E-R) – O and B are unused.
- SUGER (not a valid word)
- SWEER (valid, but W and E already considered; E must not appear again in positions 2-3).
- SCUER (not valid)
- SKIER (I already ruled out)
- SLYER (L ruled out)
- SUVER (not a word)

Best candidate: SOBER  
- Uses O and B (both untested).  
- Valid word.  
- No ruled-out letters.
