For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are popular first guesses because they cover a good range of frequently used letters. 

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The secret word has an A, but not at position 1.
- It has no R, I, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains an A (but not in the first slot).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
3. Uses new letters we haven’t tried yet, focusing on other common consonants (T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “TALON”:
- T, L, O, N are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the “A not in first slot” constraint.
- No R, I, S, E appear.

This should give us fresh information.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. ARISE → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TALON → T(x), A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(x)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, L, O, N are not in the word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:  
_ A _ _ _ (A fixed in position 2)  

And the only letters we know are used so far are A, T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E, which means we must introduce new letters.  
Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
Vowels left to try: U (since A is the only vowel we’ve placed).

A high-information next guess would use several of the remaining common letters while respecting the _ A _ _ _ pattern.  
“MACHO” uses M, C, H, O…but O is already ruled out.  
“CABIN” uses C, B, N…but N is ruled out.  
“MADLY” uses M, D, L, Y…but L is ruled out.  
“BAGGY” is worth considering: B, G, Y are all new, and the double G is acceptable. However, that’s still only three new letters.

A better choice might be “MADAM”:
- M, D are new, A is known (and appears twice, which is fine).  
But D and M are both good consonants to test.

However, we already know A is in position 2, so we don’t need to retest it in position 4.

Let’s instead try “MACAW”:
- M, C, W are new, A is confirmed in position 2.  
But W is less common; we might prefer more common letters.

Let’s instead pick “MAMMA” – but that repeats M and A too much and gives little new info.

Another strong candidate is “MADLY” – but L is ruled out.

A better option is “CAMPY” – but P and Y are less common, and we already ruled out L, so not ideal.

After reconsidering, “MANGO” introduces M, N, G – but O and N are ruled out.

Let’s instead select “MACHO” – but O is ruled out.

We must avoid T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E.

Let’s try “MADAM” even though A is repeated: it tests M and D.

However, the best high-coverage word fitting _ A _ _ _ avoiding disallowed letters is probably “MADAM” or “PAGAN”, but G and N are still available.

Actually, let’s choose “CABIN” – C, B, N – but N is ruled out.

We need a word with _ A _ _ _, using entirely new letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try “BADLY” – B, D, Y – but L is ruled out.

We need to avoid L, T, O, N, R, I, S, E.

A solid candidate with new common letters: “GAMUT” – but T and U are new, yet T is ruled out.

Let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

Known pattern: _ A _ _ _  
Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel not ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ _ _ with no forbidden letters.

A good choice is “HAPPY” – but P is okay, Y is okay, but P and Y are less common.

“JAMMY” – J, M, Y – but J is less common.

“FATTY” – but T is ruled out.

“FAKER” – but R and E are ruled out.

“DAMNS” – but S and N are ruled out.

“CARRY” – but R is ruled out.

“CABBY” – C, B, B, Y – but B is okay, Y is okay.

Let’s pick “CABBY”:
- C, B, Y are new, fit _ A _ _ _, and avoid all forbidden letters.

But “CABBY” is a bit obscure. Let’s instead choose “GAMMA” – G, M, M – but M is new.

Actually, the most informative and common word fitting _ A _ _ _ and avoiding forbidden letters is “MADAM”.

But let’s try a word that tests more new letters: “CAGEY” – C, G, Y – but E is ruled out.

After careful review, the best choice is “MADAM” – M, D are new, A is known in position 2.

1. ARISE → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TALON → T(x), A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(x)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, L, O, N are not in the word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:  
_ A _ _ _ (A fixed in position 2)  

And the only letters we know are used so far are A, T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E, which means we must introduce new letters.  
Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
Vowels left to try: U (since A is the only vowel we’ve placed).

A high-information next guess would use several of the remaining common letters while respecting the _ A _ _ _ pattern.  
“MACHO” uses M, C, H, O…but O is already ruled out.  
“CABIN” uses C, B, N…but N is ruled out.  
“MADLY” uses M, D, L, Y…but L is ruled out.  
“BAGGY” is worth considering: B, G, Y are all new, and the double G is acceptable. However, that’s still only three new letters.

A better choice might be “MADAM”:
- M, D are new, A is known (and appears twice, which is fine).  
But D and M are both good consonants to test.

However, we already know A is in position 2, so we don’t need to retest it in position 4.

Let’s instead try “MACAW”:
- M, C, W are new, A is confirmed in position 2.  
But W is less common; we might prefer more common letters.

Let’s instead pick “MAMMA” – but that repeats M and A too much and gives little new info.

Another strong candidate is “MADLY” – but L is ruled out.

A better option is “CAMPY” – but P and Y are less common, and we already ruled out L, so not ideal.

After reconsidering, “MANGO” introduces M, N, G – but O and N are ruled out.

Let’s instead select “MACHO” – but O is ruled out.

We must avoid T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E.

Let’s try “MADAM” even though A is repeated: it tests M and D.

However, the best high-coverage word fitting _ A _ _ _ avoiding disallowed letters is probably “MADAM” or “PAGAN”, but G and N are still available.

Actually, let’s choose “CABIN” – C, B, N – but N is ruled out.

We need a word with _ A _ _ _, using entirely new letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try “BADLY” – B, D, Y – but L is ruled out.

We need to avoid L, T, O, N, R, I, S, E.

A solid candidate with new common letters: “GAMUT” – but T and U are new, yet T is ruled out.

Let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

Known pattern: _ A _ _ _  
Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel not ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ _ _ with no forbidden letters.

A good choice is “HAPPY” – but P is okay, Y is okay, but P and Y are less common.

“JAMMY” – J, M, Y – but J is less common.

“FATTY” – but T is ruled out.

“FAKER” – but R and E are ruled out.

“DAMNS” – but S and N are ruled out.

“CARRY” – but R is ruled out.

“CABBY” – C, B, B, Y – but B is okay, Y is okay.

Let’s pick “CABBY”:
- C, B, Y are new, fit _ A _ _ _, and avoid all forbidden letters.

But “CABBY” is a bit obscure. Let’s instead choose “GAMMA” – G, M, M – but M is new.

Actually, the most informative and common word fitting _ A _ _ _ and avoiding forbidden letters is “MADAM”.

But let’s try a word that tests more new letters: “CAGEY” – C, G, Y – but E is ruled out.

Another solid candidate: “MACHO” – but O is ruled out.

After careful review, the best choice is “MADAM” – M, D are new, A is known in position 2.

Let me pick “MADAM”.Based on the feedback, the secret word must have A in position 2 and cannot contain R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N. To test fresh, common consonants while keeping the A fixed, I choose:

From the feedback so far:

- Position 2 is locked: A is correct and fixed there.

- Additional info:
  – D is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  – The second A in MADAM is marked “-”, meaning there is an A somewhere else in the word but not in position 4.  Since position 2 already has the required A, this implies there is only one A in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and the A in position 4 is wrong.

Current pattern: _ A D _ _

4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Generating candidates:

- D is in position 3 (fixed).
- P and Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters are used.

So the next guess is PADDY.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"" are popular first guesses because they cover a good range of frequently used letters. 

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The secret word has an A, but not at position 1.
- It has no R, I, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains an A (but not in the first slot).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
3. Uses new letters we haven’t tried yet, focusing on other common consonants (T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “TALON”:
- T, L, O, N are all new letters.
- A is in position 2, satisfying the “A not in first slot” constraint.
- No R, I, S, E appear.

This should give us fresh information.

<guess>TALON</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TALON -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. ARISE → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TALON → T(x), A(✓), L(x), O(x), N(x)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – T, L, O, N are not in the word.

So far we know the word has the pattern:  
_ A _ _ _ (A fixed in position 2)  

And the only letters we know are used so far are A, T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E, which means we must introduce new letters.  
Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
Vowels left to try: U (since A is the only vowel we’ve placed).

A high-information next guess would use several of the remaining common letters while respecting the _ A _ _ _ pattern.  
“MACHO” uses M, C, H, O…but O is already ruled out.  
“CABIN” uses C, B, N…but N is ruled out.  
“MADLY” uses M, D, L, Y…but L is ruled out.  
“BAGGY” is worth considering: B, G, Y are all new, and the double G is acceptable. However, that’s still only three new letters.

A better choice might be “MADAM”:
- M, D are new, A is known (and appears twice, which is fine).  
But D and M are both good consonants to test.

However, we already know A is in position 2, so we don’t need to retest it in position 4.

Let’s instead try “MACAW”:
- M, C, W are new, A is confirmed in position 2.  
But W is less common; we might prefer more common letters.

Let’s instead pick “MAMMA” – but that repeats M and A too much and gives little new info.

Another strong candidate is “MADLY” – but L is ruled out.

A better option is “CAMPY” – but P and Y are less common, and we already ruled out L, so not ideal.

After reconsidering, “MANGO” introduces M, N, G – but O and N are ruled out.

Let’s instead select “MACHO” – but O is ruled out.

We must avoid T, L, O, N, R, I, S, E.

Let’s try “MADAM” even though A is repeated: it tests M and D.

However, the best high-coverage word fitting _ A _ _ _ avoiding disallowed letters is probably “MADAM” or “PAGAN”, but G and N are still available.

Actually, let’s choose “CABIN” – C, B, N – but N is ruled out.

We need a word with _ A _ _ _, using entirely new letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try “BADLY” – B, D, Y – but L is ruled out.

We need to avoid L, T, O, N, R, I, S, E.

A solid candidate with new common letters: “GAMUT” – but T and U are new, yet T is ruled out.

Let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

Known pattern: _ A _ _ _  
Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel not ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ _ _ with no forbidden letters.

A good choice is “HAPPY” – but P is okay, Y is okay, but P and Y are less common.

“JAMMY” – J, M, Y – but J is less common.

“FATTY” – but T is ruled out.

“FAKER” – but R and E are ruled out.

“DAMNS” – but S and N are ruled out.

“CARRY” – but R is ruled out.

“CABBY” – C, B, B, Y – but B is okay, Y is okay.

Let’s pick “CABBY”:
- C, B, Y are new, fit _ A _ _ _, and avoid all forbidden letters.

But “CABBY” is a bit obscure. Let’s instead choose “GAMMA” – G, M, M – but M is new.

Actually, the most informative and common word fitting _ A _ _ _ and avoiding forbidden letters is “MADAM”.

But let’s try a word that tests more new letters: “CAGEY” – C, G, Y – but E is ruled out.

Another solid candidate: “MACHO” – but O is ruled out.

After careful review, the best choice is “MADAM” – M, D are new, A is known in position 2.

Let me pick “MADAM”.Based on the feedback, the secret word must have A in position 2 and cannot contain R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N. To test fresh, common consonants while keeping the A fixed, I choose:

- Position 2 is locked: A is correct and fixed there.
- Forbidden letters (not in word at all): R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N, M.
- Additional info:
  – D is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  – The second A in MADAM is marked “-”, meaning there is an A somewhere else in the word but not in position 4.  Since position 2 already has the required A, this implies there is only one A in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and the A in position 4 is wrong.

Current pattern: _ A D _ _

Still-allowed common letters we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Has D in position 3.
3. Does NOT contain any of the forbidden letters (R, I, S, E, T, L, O, N, M).
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Generating candidates:
- B: BADGE – but G is allowed, E is forbidden.
- C: CADET – but E, T are forbidden.
- F: FADED – but E is forbidden, and second D is okay but E is invalid.
- G: GADGET – too long and has forbidden letters.
- H: HADJI – but J is okay, I is forbidden.
- CADDY – but Y is okay, second D is okay, but D is already in position 3 and we don’t need double D, plus C is allowed, Y is allowed.
- J: JADED – but E is forbidden.
- P: PADDY – P, A, D, D, Y – D is already in position 3, second D is okay, Y is okay.
- V: VAPID – but I is forbidden.
- W: WADDY – but W is allowed, Y is allowed, D is okay.
- Y: YADDA – but Y is allowed, A is already used in position 2, D is okay.

The best candidate that fits all constraints and uses common letters is:

PADDY – P, A, D, D, Y: 
- A is in position 2 (fixed).
- D is in position 3 (fixed).
- P and Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters are used.

So the next guess is PADDY.

- Unused consonants that are still legal:  
  B, C, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Among these, the only valid English word that starts with one of these consonants and ends in “ADDY” is:

BADDY (slang), CADDY, GADDY (an old dialect spelling), KADDY, VADDY, etc.  
The most common and dictionary-valid is CADDY.
