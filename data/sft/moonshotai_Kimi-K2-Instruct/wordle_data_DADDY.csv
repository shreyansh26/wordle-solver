For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word uses a variety of these high-frequency letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

After considering several options like ""RAISE"" (R,A,I,S,E), ""AROSE"" (A,R,O,S,E), and ""CRANE"" (C,R,A,N,E), I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and covers both vowels (A,I,E) and consonants (R,S).

So far we know:
- A is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

Thus the pattern so far is: _ A _ _ _

Next-guess strategy:
1. Keep A in the 2nd slot.
2. Avoid R, I, S, E.
3. Try to introduce new common letters. The remaining high-frequency consonants are T, N, L, C, D, and remaining vowels are O, U.

Possible good candidates:  
- TALON (but uses N and L)  
- CANDY (but uses N, D, Y)  
- MANGO (but uses N, G, O)  
- PASTA (but uses S, which is eliminated)  

A balanced word that introduces several new common letters while avoiding the eliminated ones is “TALON”: T, L, O, N are all still possible, and none of R, I, S, E appear.

Therefore, next guess: TALON.

We now know the pattern is * A D D Y with the first letter unknown, but we have already tried C, B, and P for that position.  
Remaining consonants (that have not been ruled out): F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Z  
Among these, only F, G, M, and W can combine with “ADDY” to form real English words:  
- FADDY – common (though informal)  
- GADDY – rare/obsolete  
- MADDY – informal  
- WADDY – exists in some dialects  

The most standard English spelling of the four is FADDY.

Thus the only plausible, standard 5-letter word left is FADDY.
