For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", etc. These contain common letters like A, E, S, T, R which appear frequently in English words.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has:
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another vowel
- S: Very common consonant
- E: Second most common vowel

- A : not in the word at all (x)
- I : in the word but wrong spot
- S : in the word but wrong spot
- E : in the word but wrong spot

So we know:

2. It DOES contain R, I, S, E, but none of them are in their current positions.
3. Since R, I, S, E are all somewhere else, and all 5 letters are different, the remaining letter must be new.

Possible words:  
- TRIES (keeps R, I, S, E and adds T)  
- INSET (but A is already ruled out, and S in the same spot)  
- SIREN (R is now 2nd, S 1st, I 3rd, E 4th, N new) – this is promising.

Let’s choose SIREN because it:
- Moves S from 4th to 1st
- Moves I from 3rd to 3rd (invalid, same spot – scratch this)

From the latest feedback:

SIREN → S(✓) I(-) R(✓) E(-) N(x)

Interpretation:
- S is correct in the 1st position.
- R is correct in the 3rd position.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is not in the word.

So far we have:
- Letter 1 = S (locked)
- Letter 3 = R (locked)
- Letters 2, 4, 5 are unknown.
- Letters we know are present: I, E (still need to place them).
- Letters we know are absent: A, T, N.
- The fifth letter must be a new consonant we haven’t tried yet (cannot be A, T, N, S, R, I, E – wait, S, R, I, E are already used, but E must appear somewhere).

Constraints:
- I cannot be in position 2 (from SIREN feedback).
- E cannot be in position 4 (from SIREN feedback).
- E must appear somewhere (since it got “-” in both RAISE and TRIES).
  
Possible positions for I and E:
- I can be in 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is R, so I must be in 4 or 5.
- E can be in 2 or 5 (since 4 is disallowed). But if I is in 5, E must be in 2. If I is in 4, E must be in 2 or 5 – but 5 might be taken by another letter.

We need one new consonant for the remaining slot. Common unused consonants: L, D, C, M, K, etc.

Let’s list possible valid words:
- S _ R _ _ with letters {I, E, and one new consonant}.
  - S I R E _ → but E is in 4 (disallowed).
  - S _ R I E → positions: 1=S, 3=R, 4=I, 5=E, so 2 must be new consonant. Word: S _ R I E → needs consonant in 2.
  - Possible: S L R I E → but SLRIE is not a word. Real word: SLRIE invalid.
  - S C R I E → SCRIE invalid.
  - S D R I E → invalid.
  - S M R I E → invalid.
  - S K R I E → invalid.
  
Alternative placement:
- S _ R E _ → but E cannot be in 4 (it would be in 4 here), so invalid.
- S _ R _ E → E in 5 is valid. Then I must be in 4. So word is S _ R I E.
   - S _ R I E → valid English word: S P R I E (sprie – archaic, not common)
   - S C R I E – no
   - S L R I E – no
   - S M R I E – no
   - S K R I E – no
   - Actually, common word: S P R I E – but ""sprie"" isn't standard. Maybe ""spire"" but that's S P I R E, which would have I in 3 (invalid). Hmm.

Wait, another arrangement:
- S E R I _ → but E in 2 is valid, I in 4 is valid, need 5th letter new consonant.
  - S E R I L → SERIL invalid
  - S E R I D → SERID invalid
  - S E R I C → SERIC invalid
  - S E R I K → SERIK invalid
  - S E R I M → SERIM invalid
  - S E R I P → SERIP invalid
  - S E R I V → SERVI invalid

Hmm, perhaps I’m missing possible words. Let me re-examine.

We have:
S _ R _ _
Letters to place: I, E, and one new consonant (from unused: L, D, C, M, K, P, etc.).

Possible valid combinations:
1. S _ R I _ → I in 4 (valid), need E and new consonant in 2 and 5.
   - E cannot be in 4 (already ok), so:
   - S E R I _ → E in 2, then 5 is new consonant. Word: SERI_ → need valid 5-letter word.
     - SERIF – valid word, F is new consonant.
     - SERIO – invalid
     - SERIN – but N is excluded
     - SERIM – invalid
     - SERIK – invalid
   - SERIF seems valid.

2. S _ R _ I → I in 5, then E must be in 2, and new consonant in 4.
   - S E R _ I → SER_I → need 4th letter new consonant.
     - SERDI – invalid
     - SERCI – invalid
     - SERLI – invalid
     - SERMI – invalid
     - SERKI – invalid
   - No obvious valid word here.

Thus, the most plausible valid word is SERIF.

Check constraints:
- S in 1 – ✓
- R in 3 – ✓
- I in 4 – valid (was not in 2)
- E in 2 – valid (was not in 4 or 5)
- F new consonant – valid.

Word: SERIF.
