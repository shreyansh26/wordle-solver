Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include both vowels and consonants

Common choices include words like ARISE, ROATE, or SLATE, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- These letters are among the most frequent in English
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- The consonants R and S are very common in English words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (A _ _ _ _)
- E is correct in position 5 (A _ _ _ E)
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the form:
A _ _ _ E

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S

To maximize information gain on the second turn, we want to test common letters that fit this pattern. Good candidate letters for positions 2-4 include:
- T, N, L, C, D, M, G, B, F, etc.

Common patterns starting with A and ending with E include:
- ALONE
- AMBLE
- AGAVE
- ANGLE
- AGREE

""ALONE"" seems promising because:
- It fits the A _ _ _ E pattern
- Uses common letters L, N, O - but O was already ruled out, so this won't work
- Actually ""ALONE"" has O in position 3, which we know is not in the word

Better choices:
- AGREE (but has R which we know isn't in the word)
- AMBLE (uses M, B, L - all possible)
- ANGLE (uses N, G, L - all possible)

I'll go with ""ANGLE"" as it tests N, G, L which are all common letters not yet tested.

Include both vowels and consonants\n\nCommon choices include words like ARISE, ROATE, or SLATE, but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" because:\n- It contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E)\n- These letters are among the most frequent in English\n- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions\n- The consonants R and S are very common in English words\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is correct in position 1 (A _ _ _ _)\n- E is correct in position 5 (A _ _ _ E)\n- R, O, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word has the form:\nA _ _ _ E\n\nLetters we know are NOT in the word:\nR, O, S\n\nTo maximize information gain on the second turn, we want to test common letters that fit this pattern.

I made a mistake: “ABLE” is only 4 letters.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with A, ends with E, contains the letter L (but not in position 4), and does **not** contain R, O, S, N, or G.

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ E  
Available letters (besides A, E): B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y …

We must place L somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since position 4 is ruled out).

Candidate words:
- ALIKE (A-L-I-K-E) – L in position 2, I/K allowed  
- ALIVE (A-L-I-V-E) – L in position 2, I/V allowed  
- ALONE – rejected (O already ruled out)  
- AGILE – rejected (G already ruled out)  
- ABIDE, ACIDE – no L  
- AMIDE – no L

Best choices among the valid ones are ALIKE and ALIVE.  
Between them, ALIVE tests the new letter V, giving slightly more information.
