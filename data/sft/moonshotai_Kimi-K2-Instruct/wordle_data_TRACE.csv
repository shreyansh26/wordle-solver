For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters

The word ""STARE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common letter)
- T (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters that appear in many English words, which should provide good feedback to narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓, position 3)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓, position 5)

So the word looks like: _ _ A _ E
And it contains T and R somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Possible positions for T and R:
- T could be in positions 1, 3 (but 3 is A), 4, or 5 (but 5 is E) → T must be in position 1 or 4
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is A), or 5 (but 5 is E) → R must be in position 1 or 2

Let's consider:
If T is in position 1: T _ A _ E
Then R must be in position 2: T R A _ E
But this would make R in position 2, which was originally position 2 in STARE and got a ""-"" meaning wrong position. This would be valid since R wasn't in position 2 originally.

If T is in position 4: _ _ A T E
Then R must be in position 1 or 2: R _ A T E or _ R A T E

Let's try ""TRACE"" as our next guess:
- It keeps A and E in their correct positions
- Moves T to position 4 (from position 2)
- Moves R to position 1 (from position 3)
- Includes C as a new letter to test
