Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are all very common. A good first guess should cover as many of these letters as possible without repeating any letter.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage across different positions. This will help us quickly identify which of these letters might be in the secret word, even if they're not in the correct positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R is in the word and in the correct second position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word pattern is:
Position 1: A ✓
Position 2: R ✓
Positions 3–5: any letters except O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word whose first two letters are A R and that does not contain O, S, or E in any position.

Common letters remaining (excluding O,S,E) are T, I, N, L, D, U, M, C, H, P, etc.

Let’s think of AR- words: ARTSY, ARTAL, ARDOR, ARGON, ARMED, ARMOR, ARRAY, AROMA, ARROW… but we must avoid O,S,E.

- ARTSY: has S and Y is okay, but S is excluded.
- ARMED: has E.
- ARMOR: has O.
- ARRAY: has A twice, and Y is okay. Still possible.
- ARDOR: has O and R twice, but O is excluded.

Valid options: ARBUT (but not common), ARGIL (valid), ARILS (but has S), ARROW (O), ARDRI (valid but rare).

The most common word fitting the pattern is “ARRAY.” It has A R in the first two spots, no O/S/E, and uses only allowed letters.

So, ARRAY is the best next guess.
