For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It includes the vowels A, I, and E (three of the five most common vowels).
2. It includes the consonants R and S, which are very common in English words.
3. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, or Z.

This should give me good coverage for the first guess.

The first guess “RAISE” got all x’s, so none of those letters (R, A, I, S, E) are present in the secret word.  
That leaves us with the remaining 21 letters (minus the 5 already eliminated).  

To maximize information on the second guess, we want a new set of five common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Popular consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Popular vowels still available: O and U (since A, I, E are out).

A balanced choice that uses common letters and mixes vowels and consonants is “TOUCH”:

This should help quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

- H is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- T and U are also in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word ends in C, contains H somewhere except position 4, and contains both T and U in unknown spots.

2. Uses T and U somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses H somewhere in positions 1-3 (since it can’t be 4).
4. Uses only allowable letters and no repeats of ruled-out letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints and is common is “THUMP”:
- T at position 1 (possible).
- H at position 2 (possible).
- U at position 3 (possible).
- M at position 4 (allowed, and C is already at 5).

4. Allowed remaining letters: D, N, L, B, G, F, K, Y, V, W, J, Q, Z (but we want common ones).

The word pattern so far: _ _ _ _ C

We already have three letters that must appear (T, H, U) and we still need one more letter (because the fifth slot is already taken by C).  
Thus the word must be a permutation of T, H, U plus one additional letter (from the allowed set) in positions 1-4, with C locked at position 5.

Let’s list possible additional letters that haven’t been ruled out and are common: N, D, L, B, G, K, F, Y.

We need to choose one of them and arrange T, H, U and that extra letter so that T, H, U each appear exactly once and the word is valid.  
A quick check of plausible combinations gives “THUD C” which isn’t a word, “HUNT C” which becomes “HUNTC” (invalid), etc.

The only 5-letter English word that uses T, H, U plus one of the remaining common letters and ends in C is “DUTCH”:
- D-U-T-C-H with C fixed at position 5 → rearrange to D-U-T-C-H, but C must be last.  
Thus the correct permutation is D-U-T-H-C → “DUTCH”.

Let’s verify:
- Letters used: D, U, T, C, H – all allowed.
- Contains T, H, U as required.
- Ends with C.
- No eliminated letters appear.

Therefore, DUTCH is a valid and efficient next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,butch,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It includes the vowels A, I, and E (three of the five most common vowels).
2. It includes the consonants R and S, which are very common in English words.
3. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, or Z.

This should give me good coverage for the first guess.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The first guess “RAISE” got all x’s, so none of those letters (R, A, I, S, E) are present in the secret word.  
That leaves us with the remaining 21 letters (minus the 5 already eliminated).  

To maximize information on the second guess, we want a new set of five common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Popular consonants still available: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Popular vowels still available: O and U (since A, I, E are out).

A balanced choice that uses common letters and mixes vowels and consonants is “TOUCH”:
- T, O, U, C, H – none of these were in the first guess.

This should help quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current ruled-out letters (from previous guesses):  
R, A, I, S, E, O

Known so far:
- C is in the correct final position (✓ at position 5).
- H is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- T and U are also in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word ends in C, contains H somewhere except position 4, and contains both T and U in unknown spots.  
We have five positions: _ _ _ _ C

Remaining common letters we haven’t used yet that could fill the open spots: N, L, D, B, G, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in C (position 5).
2. Uses T and U somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses H somewhere in positions 1-3 (since it can’t be 4).
4. Uses only allowable letters and no repeats of ruled-out letters.

A word that satisfies these constraints and is common is “THUMP”:
- T at position 1 (possible).
- H at position 2 (possible).
- U at position 3 (possible).
- M at position 4 (allowed, and C is already at 5).

Thus “THUMP” is a valid next guess.

What we now know:

- The word ends with …TCH (T in position 3, C in position 4, H in position 5 – all ✓ in DUTCH).
- U is in the word and is now locked in position 2 (✓ in DUTCH).
- So the pattern is: _ U T C H.

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
All letters used so far (R, A, I, S, E, O, M, P, D) are eliminated.  
Remaining common consonants still allowed: N, L, B, G, F, K, Y, V, W, J, Q, Z.

A quick scan of 5-letter English words that match “? U T C H” gives:

- B U T C H   → uses B (valid and common)
- G U T C H
- L U T C H
- N U T C H
- K U T C H
- etc.

Among these, “BUTCH” is the most common everyday word.  
It fits all constraints:
1. No letter already ruled out.
2. Matches the fixed pattern _ U T C H.

Hence, BUTCH is the logical next guess.
