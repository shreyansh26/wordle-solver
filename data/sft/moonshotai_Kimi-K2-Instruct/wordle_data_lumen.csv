For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained by using common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to test multiple possibilities at once. 

Looking at 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give good initial coverage to help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- E is not in the 5th position (since E in AROSE was position 5 and marked wrong position).

Now I want a new 5-letter word with:
- E included (but not in position 5).
- No A, R, O, S.
- Other letters should be common but unused so far.

Good available letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, B, G, etc.

Let’s pick a word like ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E (position 5 – but we know E isn’t in position 5 from the feedback, so this is bad because E is in position 5 here).
Wait, that’s invalid since E can’t be in position 5.

Try ""ELITE"":
- E is in position 1 (allowed since we don’t know yet where E is).
- Letters: E, L, I, T, E.
- Letters not used yet: L, I, T.
- No A, R, O, S.
This seems valid.

But ""ELITE"" has two E’s – the feedback would treat both E’s separately. If the secret word has only one E, one of these would be marked x. To avoid confusion, let’s pick a word with one E and other new letters.

Better: ""ELDIN"" – but is this a word? Not sure.
""EDICT"" – E, D, I, C, T – all new letters except E, and E is in position 1 (allowed).
This seems good.

Also, ""INLET"" – I, N, L, E, T – E in position 4 (allowed), and all letters new except E.

- N and L are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked -).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (marked ✓ at position 4).

So we know:
1. The secret word has E in the 4th position.
2. It also contains N and L somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively (since N was in position 2 and L in position 3 in INLET, and both were wrong positions).
3. It does NOT contain A, R, O, S, I, T.

Available letters now (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N, L, and E in position 4.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has E in position 4.
- Uses N and L in new positions (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Uses new/untested letters for the remaining slots.

Good candidates:
- ""LENDS"" – but S is eliminated.
- ""BLANK"" – A and K are allowed, but A is eliminated.
- ""GLEN_"" – E is in position 4, but we need a 5-letter word. ""GLENS"" – S eliminated.
- ""FLUNK"" – U is new, but K is allowed. However, E must be in position 4, so this doesn't fit.
- ""MELON"" – E is in position 2, not 4. Doesn't fit.
- ""NEBEL"" – Not a common word.
- ""UNCLE"" – E is in position 5, but must be in position 4. Doesn't fit.
- ""PLANE"" – A is eliminated.
- ""CLEN_"" – Need to fill position 5. ""CLENK""? Not a word.
- ""BLEND"" – E is in position 4, B and D are new, N is in position 3 (allowed since N was in position 2 before and wrong), L is in position 2 (allowed since L was in position 3 before and wrong). This seems valid.

Let’s check ""BLEND"":
- B: new
- L: in position 2 (previously position 3, so okay)
- E: position 4 (correct, matches ✓)
- N: position 3 (previously position 2, so okay)
- D: new

No eliminated letters are used (A, R, O, S, I, T are avoided).

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s summarize everything we now know from the three clues:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, I, T, B, D  
   (from Guess 1 AROSE and Guess 2 INLET and Guess 3 BLEND).

2. Letters we know ARE in the word but we don’t yet know their exact positions:
   - E (was correct in position 4 in Guess 2 INLET, BUT in Guess 3 BLEND E showed up again and was marked ‘-’, i.e. “in the word but wrong spot”.  
     That tells us E is in the word but NOT in position 4 after all. So the earlier ✓ in INLET was misleading because it only referred to the instance of E in INLET’s 4th slot matching the secret word’s 4th slot. When we later put E in position 3 in BLEND and it was marked ‘-’, that confirms E is indeed in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.)

   - N (from Guess 2 INLET: N was in word but not in slot 2)  
   - L (from Guess 2 INLET: L was in word but not in slot 3)  
   - N (from Guess 3 BLEND: N was in word but not in slot 4)  
   - L (from Guess 3 BLEND: L was in word but not in slot 2)

   So overall, the secret word contains: E, N, L (each exactly once, since no duplicates have shown) and we know:
   - E is NOT in positions 3, 4
   - N is NOT in positions 2, 4
   - L is NOT in positions 2, 3

3. Positions still open: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
   We already have 3 letters (E, N, L) accounted for, so we need 2 more letters that have never been used yet.  
   Common remaining letters that haven’t been eliminated: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the known letters in allowable positions:

- E can be in 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- N can be in 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
- L can be in 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).

Let’s aim for a word that places these three letters and adds two new consonants. One good choice is to start with these placements:

Try E in position 1, then we need N and L in positions 3 and 5 respectively:
- E _ N _ L

Fill the gaps with new letters (never used before).  
Good consonants still available: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pick two that make a valid word.  
Try E G N U L → EGNUL? Not a word.  
Try E N G U L → ENGUL? Not standard.  
Try E N U G L → ENUGL? No.  
Try E N U L G → ENULG? No.

Instead, try E L N _ _ but we have to watch constraints.

Another plan: put L in position 5 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed), E in position 1 (allowed).  
So template: E _ N _ L  
We need two consonants for slots 2 and 4 that haven’t appeared and form a real word.

Try E C N U L → ECNUL? No.  
Try E C N Y L → ECNYL? No.

Try E N L _ _ with N in 1 and L in 2: but L cannot be in 2 (constraint from Guess 3).  
So N in 1 and L in 4: N _ _ L _  
Then E must go in 5 (since it cannot be 3 or 4): N _ _ L E  
Fill positions 2 and 3 with new letters.  
Try N U M B L E – but B and M are allowed? B was eliminated from BLEND, but M is still unused. So N U M L E? Not a word.  
Try N U C K L E – K, C are unused.  
N U C K L E = NUCLE. Not a standard word.

Try a fresh placement: E in 5, N in 1, L in 4.  
So: N _ _ L E  
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3 that are new and make a word.  
Try N U C L E? NUCLE is again not valid.  
Try N E C L E? Already has E in 5.

Try: N U M P L E? Not valid.

Try: N U C K L? 5 letters: NUCKL – no.

Try: N E C K L – again E is duplicated.

This path seems stuck. Let’s backtrack.

Try E in position 2.  
Then N and L must go in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 according to constraints.

One possibility:  
_ E _ N _ or _ E _ _ N  
or _ E N _ _ (but N cannot be in 3)  
so _ E N _ _ is invalid (N cannot be 3).

Try L E N _ _ – but L cannot be 1 (allowed), E in 2, N in 3 (invalid).  
Try L E _ N _ – E in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), N in 4 (invalid).  
Try L E _ _ N – E in 2, L in 1 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed).  
So template: L E _ _ N  
We need two new consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
Try L E G U N? LEGUN? No.  
Try L E G C N – LEGCN? No.  
Try L E M U N – LEMUN? No.  
Try L E G G N – LEGGN? No.

Try L E G C N? Still invalid.

Try L E M U N? Not a word.

Try L E G U N? No.

Switch to:  
E in position 1, N in 5, L in 3.  
So E _ L _ N  
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 4 that are unused and form a word.  
Try E G L U N? EGLUN? No.  
Try E F L U N? EFLUN? No.  
Try E C L U N? ECLUN? No.  
Try E G L C N? EGLCN? No.

This is tricky. Let’s list possible 5-letter words that:
- use E, N, L once each,  
- avoid all eliminated letters,  
- satisfy the positional constraints.

One word that jumps out is ""G L E N N"" but N is repeated and N is in invalid spots.  
""G L E N"" is 4 letters.  
""G L E N _ "" needs a fifth letter.

Another candidate: ""P L E N _ "" – P, L, E, N, and one more letter.  
But P L E N _ needs a fifth letter that is unused.

Let’s try a systematic approach: list all valid placements of E, N, L and see if we can find a word.

Valid placements:

1. E _ _ N L  
2. E _ N _ L  
3. E N _ _ L  
4. E _ _ L N  
5. E _ L _ N  
6. E L _ _ N  
7. _ E _ N L  
8. _ E N _ L  
9. _ E _ L N  
10. _ E L _ N  
11. _ L E _ N  
12. L E _ _ N (already tried)  
13. N E _ _ L  
14. N _ E _ L  
15. N _ _ E L  
16. N _ _ L E  
17. L _ _ E N  
18. L _ _ N E  
19. _ _ E N L  
20. _ _ N E L  
21. _ _ L E N  
22. _ _ L N E  
23. _ N _ E L  
24. _ N _ L E  
25. _ L _ E N  
26. _ L _ N E  
27. _ N L _ E  
28. _ L N _ E  
29. N _ L _ E  
30. L _ N _ E  

From these, let’s pick combinations that make real words.

Try E _ _ N L: we need two consonants.  
E C H N L → ECHNL? No.  
E G G N L? No.  
E F U N L? EFUNL? No.  
E G U N L? EGUNL? No.

Try _ E _ N L:  
C E N N L – N repeated, invalid.  
F E N N L – same.  
M E N N L – same.  
P E N N L – same.  
U N is allowed but no words.

Try _ E _ L N:  
F E L L N – L repeated.  
H E L L N – same.  
C E L L N – same.  
M E L L N – same.  
G E L L N – same.  
No good.

Try _ _ E N L:  
C U E N L? CUENL? No.  
F U E N L? FUENL? No.  
P U E N L? PUENL? No.

Try N _ _ E L:  
N U C E L? NUCE L? Not a word.  
N U M E L? NUMEL? No.  
N U G E L? NUGEL? No.  
N U F E L? NUFEL? No.

Try N _ E _ L:  
N U E G L? NUEGL? No.  
N U E F L? NUEFL? No.

Try N E _ _ L:  
N E C U L? NECUL? No.  
N E F U L? NEFUL? No.

Try L _ _ E N:  
L U C E N? LUCEN? Not a standard word.  
L U M E N? LUMEN – yes, that’s a real word (a unit of light).  
Check constraints:  
- L in position 1 (allowed).  
- U (new letter) in position 2.  
- M (new) in position 3.  
- E in position 4 (but we know E cannot be in position 4! From Guess 3 feedback: in BLEND, E was in position 3 and marked ‘-’, so E is not in 3 or 4. In LUMEN, E is in 5, which is allowed.  
Wait, in LUMEN, E is in 5 – that’s allowed!  
Also N is in 5 in LUMEN, but N needs to be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 4. In LUMEN, N is in 5 – that’s allowed!  
And L in 1 is allowed (was not restricted).  
Letters used: L, U, M, E, N – all new except E, N, L which we know must be present.  
All constraints met.

So ""LUMEN"" is a valid next guess.

Before finalizing, double-check:  
- Eliminated letters absent: A, R, O, S, I, T, B, D – none in LUMEN.  
- Contains E, N, L – yes.  
- E not in 3 or 4 – correct, E is in 5.  
- N not in 2 or 4 – correct, N is in 5.  
- L not in 2 or 3 – correct, L is in 1.

Thus LUMEN is a valid candidate.
</think>

Based on all the feedback, the secret word must contain E, N, and L exactly once, with these restrictions:
- E is NOT in positions 3 or 4
- N is NOT in positions 2 or 4
- L is NOT in positions 2 or 3

Searching for a valid 5-letter word that meets these constraints and uses only letters that have not been eliminated, I find:

From these, let’s pick combinations that make real words.

Try E _ _ N L: we need two consonants.  
E C H N L → ECHNL? No.  
E G G N L? No.  
E F U N L? EFUNL? No.  
E G U N L? EGUNL? No.

Try _ E _ N L:  
C E N N L – N repeated, invalid.  
F E N N L – same.  
M E N N L – same.  
P E N N L – same.  
U N is allowed but no words.

Try _ E _ L N:  
F E L L N – L repeated.  
H E L L N – same.  
C E L L N – same.  
M E L L N – same.  
G E L L N – same.  
No good.

Try _ _ E N L:  
C U E N L? CUENL? No.  
F U E N L? FUENL? No.  
P U E N L? PUENL? No.

Try N _ _ E L:  
N U C E L? NUCE L? Not a word.  
N U M E L? NUMEL? No.  
N U G E L? NUGEL? No.  
N U F E L? NUFEL? No.

Try N _ E _ L:  
N U E G L? NUEGL? No.  
N U E F L? NUEFL? No.

Try N E _ _ L:  
N E C U L? NECUL? No.  
N E F U L? NEFUL? No.

Try L _ _ E N:  
L U C E N? LUCEN? Not a standard word.  
L U M E N? LUMEN – yes, that’s a real word (a unit of light).  
Check constraints:  
- L in position 1 (allowed).  
- U (new letter) in position 2.  
- M (new) in position 3.  
- E in position 4 (but we know E cannot be in position 4! From Guess 3 feedback: in BLEND, E was in position 3 and marked ‘-’, so E is not in 3 or 4. In LUMEN, E is in 5, which is allowed.  
Wait, in LUMEN, E is in 5 – that’s allowed!  
Also N is in 5 in LUMEN, but N needs to be in the word and cannot be in 2 or 4. In LUMEN, N is in 5 – that’s allowed!  
And L in 1 is allowed (was not restricted).  
Letters used: L, U, M, E, N – all new except E, N, L which we know must be present.  
All constraints met.

So ""LUMEN"" is a valid next guess.

Before finalizing, double-check:  
- Eliminated letters absent: A, R, O, S, I, T, B, D – none in LUMEN.  
- Contains E, N, L – yes.  
- E not in 3 or 4 – correct, E is in 5.  
- N not in 2 or 4 – correct, N is in 5.  
- L not in 2 or 3 – correct, L is in 1.

Thus LUMEN is a valid candidate.Based on all the feedback, the secret word must contain E, N, and L exactly once, with these restrictions:
- E is NOT in positions 3 or 4
- N is NOT in positions 2 or 4
- L is NOT in positions 2 or 3

Searching for a valid 5-letter word that meets these constraints and uses only letters that have not been eliminated, I find:",Guess 4: LUMEN -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) U(✓) M(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
