For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters (to maximize information gain)
2. Avoids repeating letters (to test more unique letters)
3. Includes vowels to help narrow possibilities

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C,R,A,N,E - common letters with good vowel coverage)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with CRANE as it's statistically one of the best starting words, testing common consonants C and R, plus three vowels (A,E) with N being very common.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked x, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means our next guess should completely avoid those letters.

From the feedback:

- O is in the correct position (position 2).  
- B is in the word but not in position 4.  
- D, U, T are not in the word at all.  

So we know:  
- 2nd letter = O  
- B appears somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 5 are still possible).  
- We must avoid C, R, A, N, E, D, U, T.

Remaining common letters to consider:  
Consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels: I  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.  
- Contains B somewhere except position 4.  
- Only uses letters not ruled out.  

Candidate words:
- BLOWY – B in 1st, O in 2nd, but W and Y are less common.  
- BOGUS – B in 1st, O in 2nd, but G, S are okay, yet S is common.  
- SOLID – but D is invalid.  
- POLYP – invalid, contains P, but Y is less common.  
- LOBOS – B in 3rd, S in 5th, but S is common.  

Let’s pick “BOGUS” – it has B in 1st, O in 2nd, and uses G, U, S. However, U was invalid from Guess 2, so this is invalid.  

Next candidate: “FOBBY” – but Y and F are less common.  
“MOBIL” – but L is okay, but I is a good vowel. I is allowed.  

Actually, let’s try “MOBIL”:
- M (1st), O (2nd), B (3rd), I (4th), L (5th).  
- Uses only allowed letters (avoiding ruled-out ones).  
- B is in 3rd, satisfying the B rule.  

But is MOBIL a valid word? Yes, it’s a recognized word (short for mobile).  

Another better option: “HOBOS” (but S might be less useful).  

Actually, let’s check “FOULS” – but U and T are invalid.  

Best seems “MOBIL”, but let me think of a more common word.  

“POLIS” – P, O, L, I, S. All allowed. O is in 2nd, B is not used here, but we need to include B.  

Wait, we must include B (since B(-) means it’s in the word). So we must have B in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.  

Re-evaluate:  
- B must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.  
- O is fixed in 2nd.  

Candidate words:
- BISON – B in 1st, O in 2nd, I, S, N. But N is invalid.  
- BOXER – X, E, R invalid.  
- BOSOM – O in 2nd and 4th, but M is okay, but double O not helpful.

Next best: “FOBBY” – not common.  
“BOBBY” – double B, and double B might not help.  

“GOBIK” – but K is okay, but G is okay. Not a word.  

“HOBOS” – H, O, B, O, S. Double O, not great.  

“MOBIL” seems the best valid word fitting constraints.  

Let me check “GIMBO” – but O is in 2nd, B in 4th is invalid (B cannot be in 4th).  

“BOGUS” invalid U.  

“BOILS” – B, O, I, L, S. All allowed, B in 1st, O in 2nd. This works.  

Yes, BOILS is valid and fits all constraints.

The second letter must be O, and B must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).

- Contains B somewhere except position 4.  
- Only uses letters not ruled out.  

Candidate words:
- BLOWY – B in 1st, O in 2nd, but W and Y are less common.  
- BOGUS – B in 1st, O in 2nd, but G, S are okay, yet S is common.  
- SOLID – but D is invalid.  
- POLYP – invalid, contains P, but Y is less common.  
- LOBOS – B in 3rd, S in 5th, but S is common.  

Let’s pick “BOGUS” – it has B in 1st, O in 2nd, and uses G, U, S. However, U was invalid from Guess 2, so this is invalid.  

Next candidate: “FOBBY” – but Y and F are less common.  
“MOBIL” – but L is okay, but I is a good vowel. I is allowed.  

Actually, let’s try “MOBIL”:
- M (1st), O (2nd), B (3rd), I (4th), L (5th).  
- Uses only allowed letters (avoiding ruled-out ones).  
- B is in 3rd, satisfying the B rule.  

But is MOBIL a valid word? Yes, it’s a recognized word (short for mobile).  

Another better option: “HOBOS” (but S might be less useful).  

Actually, let’s check “FOULS” – but U and T are invalid.  

Best seems “MOBIL”, but let me think of a more common word.  

“POLIS” – P, O, L, I, S. All allowed. O is in 2nd, B is not used here, but we need to include B.  

Wait, we must include B (since B(-) means it’s in the word). So we must have B in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.  

Re-evaluate:  
- B must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.  
- O is fixed in 2nd.  

Candidate words:
- BISON – B in 1st, O in 2nd, I, S, N. But N is invalid.  
- BOXER – X, E, R invalid.  
- BOSOM – O in 2nd and 4th, but M is okay, but double O not helpful.  
- BLOWY – already saw.  
- BOGUS – invalid U.  

“SOLID” invalid (D).  

Next best: “FOBBY” – not common.  
“BOBBY” – double B, and double B might not help.  

“GOBIK” – but K is okay, but G is okay. Not a word.  

“HOBOS” – H, O, B, O, S. Double O, not great.  

“MOBIL” seems the best valid word fitting constraints.  

Let me check “GIMBO” – but O is in 2nd, B in 4th is invalid (B cannot be in 4th).  

“BOGUS” invalid U.  

“BOILS” – B, O, I, L, S. All allowed, B in 1st, O in 2nd. This works.  

Yes, BOILS is valid and fits all constraints.The second letter must be O, and B must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
From the remaining valid letters, BOILS satisfies:

- B in position 1  
- O in position 2  
- I, L, S are all still possible letters

- L(x) – L is not in the word.

Consonants: F, G, H, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z

Therefore the word is of the form B O _ _ _, must include S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and use only remaining letters (no A, E, I, L, U, C, R, N, T, D).

Valid candidate letters for positions 3-5:

3. Includes vowels to help narrow possibilities

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C,R,A,N,E - common letters with good vowel coverage)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)

I'll go with CRANE as it's statistically one of the best starting words, testing common consonants C and R, plus three vowels (A,E) with N being very common.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) were marked x, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means our next guess should completely avoid those letters.

So we need a 5-letter word with:
- No C, R, A, N, E  
- Preferably still hitting common consonants and vowels that remain

Letters left that are common: B, D, I, O, S, T, L, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- STOLI – S, T, O, L, I (but L and I are a bit less common)
- BUILT – B, U, I, L, T (but I and L are less common)
- DOUBT – D, O, U, B, T (B is common enough, O and U are good vowels)

DOUBT hits three new vowels (O, U) and common consonants D, B, T. It tests five entirely new letters.

Feedback summary so far:
- Pattern: B O S _ _
- Disallowed letters: C, R, A, N, E, D, U, T, I, L, K, Y (all crossed out in previous guesses)
- Therefore the only possible remaining letters for positions 4 and 5 are consonants not yet ruled out: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Z  
- S is already fixed in position 3, so we must fill positions 4 and 5 using only the remaining consonants.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that starts with BOS and ends with two letters from {F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Z}.

Candidate endings:
- BOSHM – not a standard word
- BOSPH – not a word
- BOSGM – no
- BOSFW – no
- BOSPH – no
- BOSHM – no
- BOSFY – Y is invalid
- BOSPH – no

Real words that fit:
- BOSOM – but M is allowed, O is already in position 2, so position 4 would be O which is already in position 2, and position 5 M. However, we have no restriction on repeated letters yet, but the previous feedback only ruled out letters in positions, not their presence elsewhere. However, O is already correct in position 2, but we have no info on other positions. Wait, O is already confirmed in position 2, so BOSOM has O in position 4 which is not yet ruled out, but we have no info that O is elsewhere. But the word must be B O S _ _ and the remaining letters can be any from the allowed set.

But looking at the remaining consonants: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Z

Let's list possible combinations:
- BOSOM – uses M and O (but O is already in position 2, no restriction on other O's)
- BOSPH – no
- BOSGM – no
- BOSHW – no
- BOSVM – no
- BOSFG – no
- BOSHM – no
- BOSMZ – no

Actually, the only valid English word that starts with BOS and uses the remaining letters is BOSOM (B-O-S-O-M). While it repeats O, there's no feedback indicating O isn't allowed elsewhere. The feedback only confirmed O in position 2, not that it can't appear again.

But let me double-check: are there other words?
- BOSPY – Y is invalid
- BOSGH – no
- BOSVH – no
- BOSPM – no

BOSOM seems to be the only plausible remaining word. The other combinations don't form valid English words.

Therefore, the secret word must be BOSOM.
