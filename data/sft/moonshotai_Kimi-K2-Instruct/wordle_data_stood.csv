For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and T are frequent. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats, giving broad coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- S must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are taken by O and not-S respectively).
- No A, R, or E allowed.
We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints and uses mostly new common letters to gather more information.

Good candidates using common remaining letters (like D, N, I, T, L, etc.):
- SOUND (but uses U, which is rarer)
- STONY (uses T, N, Y)
- SNOUT (uses N, U, T)
- SLING (uses L, I, N, G - but L is common)

I'll choose STONY as it uses common letters T and N along with the known O and S, while avoiding banned letters.

3. S, O, T are fixed and confirmed.

Possible remaining letters for the blanks (positions 2 and 5), keeping only common letters:
   D, I, L, C, G, P, B, K, M, F, W, V, Z

4. Need a 5-letter English word matching S _ O T _ :

   - SPOT_  → no 5-letter word
   - SLOTH → uses eliminated H
   - SCOTS → uses S twice (but S already in position 1)
   - SCOOT → uses O twice (but O already in position 3)
   - SPORT → was ruled out because R is eliminated

   - SPOIL → S P O I L → fits pattern S _ O T _ ?  NO, it’s S P O I L — not matching S _ O T _ because T is not in position 4.
   
Wait, we know:
- T is in position 4 (from SHOUT feedback: T(-) means not position 5, so must be position 4)
- So word is S _ O T _

Thus valid words:
   - S P O T → only 4 letters
   - S W O T   (not common)
   - S L O T   (valid)
   - S C O T   (not a word)
   - S M O T   (not a word)

SLOT is a valid English 5-letter word (though it can also be 4-letter, it is acceptable in Wordle), but it’s missing a letter. Actually SL O T is only four letters. The correct pattern is S _ O T _.

Let me list all valid English 5-letter words fitting S _ O T _:

Using a word list:
- SLOTS → S L O T S (but then T is position 4, S position 5, fits S _ O T S)
- SPOUT → eliminated U
- SCOOT → uses O twice
- SMOOT → not a common word
- SCOFF → doesn’t fit O in position 3 and T in position 4
- SCOFF → no
- SCOOT → S C O O T → has O twice
- SMOKE → doesn’t fit
- SMOCK → doesn’t fit

Actually, the correct word fitting S _ O T _ is S L O T S is 5 letters: S L O T S.

But then we have S L O T S → S ✓, L ?, O ✓, T ✓, S ?. However, we already have S in position 1 confirmed, so having another S in position 5 is possible.

But we have no restriction on double letters yet.

Is there a more common word? Let me check other possibilities:

- S _ O T _ with valid letters left: positions 2 and 5 must be from D, I, L, C, G, P, B, K, M, F, W, V, Z.

Looking at common words:
   - S L O T S   (common)
   - S C O T S   (but C would be position 2, then S position 5, but S already at 1)
   - S P O T S   (P position 2, S position 5)
   - S W O T S   (rare)
   - S P O T S is a common word.

Let me check if P is allowed: yes, P hasn’t been eliminated.

S P O T S fits the pattern S _ O T _ , uses only allowed letters, and is a common English word.

Therefore, S P O T S is the most logical next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,stood,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and T are frequent. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats, giving broad coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- S must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are taken by O and not-S respectively).
- No A, R, or E allowed.
We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints and uses mostly new common letters to gather more information.

Good candidates using common remaining letters (like D, N, I, T, L, etc.):
- SOUND (but uses U, which is rarer)
- STONY (uses T, N, Y)
- SNOUT (uses N, U, T)
- SLING (uses L, I, N, G - but L is common)

I'll choose STONY as it uses common letters T and N along with the known O and S, while avoiding banned letters.

Current pattern: S _ O _ _

Letters still needed: T must appear in position 4 or 5.

Common 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ _ and contain T:
– SPORT (T is in position 5)  
– SOOTY (invalid, contains Y)  
– SHOUT (T in position 5)  
– STOUT (invalid, T is in position 2 which we know is wrong)  
– SCOTT (invalid, double T and no other new info)

Best candidate: SPORT — uses P and R, but R was already ruled out in AROSE feedback.  
Next best: SHOUT — uses H and U, both still possible, and places T in the last slot.

From the new feedback on SPOTS:

– O ✓ in position 3 (confirmed)
– T – — T is in the word but not in position 4.
– S – — second S is in the word but not in position 5.

This gives us the exact pattern:
S _ O _ _  
and shows T must appear once, but not in position 4.  
Therefore T must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, the second S must appear somewhere else in the word.  
Because we already have S in position 1 fixed, the only other possible place for S is position 5.

Hence the pattern becomes:
S _ O _ S and T must be in position 2 (since position 5 is already taken by S).

So the only possible template is:
S T O _ S

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and T are frequent. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to cover as many unique letters as possible. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats, giving broad coverage.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, and E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _
- S must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are taken by O and not-S respectively).
- No A, R, or E allowed.
We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits these constraints and uses mostly new common letters to gather more information.

Good candidates using common remaining letters (like D, N, I, T, L, etc.):
- SOUND (but uses U, which is rarer)
- STONY (uses T, N, Y)
- SNOUT (uses N, U, T)
- SLING (uses L, I, N, G - but L is common)

I'll choose STONY as it uses common letters T and N along with the known O and S, while avoiding banned letters.

<guess>STONY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) N(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word and now we see it’s in position 1 (✓).
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- N and Y are not in the word (x).

Current pattern: S _ O _ _

Letters still needed: T must appear in position 4 or 5.

Common 5-letter words that fit S _ O _ _ and contain T:
– SPORT (T is in position 5)  
– SOOTY (invalid, contains Y)  
– SHOUT (T in position 5)  
– STOUT (invalid, T is in position 2 which we know is wrong)  
– SCOTT (invalid, double T and no other new info)

Best candidate: SPORT — uses P and R, but R was already ruled out in AROSE feedback.  
Next best: SHOUT — uses H and U, both still possible, and places T in the last slot.

Therefore, SHOUT is the most informative remaining guess.

<guess>SHOUT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) N(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: SHOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:

1. Pattern: S _ O _ T  (from feedback on SHOUT: S ✓, O ✓, T must be in the word but not at position 5 → must be position 4)
   So the word is: S _ O T _

2. Eliminated letters so far (cannot appear anywhere):
   A, R, E, N, Y, H, U

3. S, O, T are fixed and confirmed.

Possible remaining letters for the blanks (positions 2 and 5), keeping only common letters:
   D, I, L, C, G, P, B, K, M, F, W, V, Z

4. Need a 5-letter English word matching S _ O T _ :

   - SPOT_  → no 5-letter word
   - SLOTH → uses eliminated H
   - SCOTS → uses S twice (but S already in position 1)
   - SCOOT → uses O twice (but O already in position 3)
   - SPORT → was ruled out because R is eliminated
   - SMOOT → not a common word
   - SPOUT → eliminated U
   - SLIPT → not a word
   - SLATE → eliminated A and E
   - SLOTT → not a word
   - SPOIL → ends in L (valid)
   - SPOIL → S P O I L → fits pattern S _ O T _ ?  NO, it’s S P O I L — not matching S _ O T _ because T is not in position 4.
   
Wait, we know:
- T is in position 4 (from SHOUT feedback: T(-) means not position 5, so must be position 4)
- So word is S _ O T _

Thus valid words:
   - S P O T → only 4 letters
   - S W O T   (not common)
   - S L O T   (valid)
   - S C O T   (not a word)
   - S M O T   (not a word)

SLOT is a valid English 5-letter word (though it can also be 4-letter, it is acceptable in Wordle), but it’s missing a letter. Actually SL O T is only four letters. The correct pattern is S _ O T _.

Let me list all valid English 5-letter words fitting S _ O T _:

Using a word list:
- SLOTS → S L O T S (but then T is position 4, S position 5, fits S _ O T S)
- SPOUT → eliminated U
- SCOOT → uses O twice
- SMOOT → not a common word
- SCOFF → doesn’t fit O in position 3 and T in position 4
- SCOFF → no
- SCOOT → S C O O T → has O twice
- SMOKE → doesn’t fit
- SMOCK → doesn’t fit

Actually, the correct word fitting S _ O T _ is S L O T S is 5 letters: S L O T S.

But then we have S L O T S → S ✓, L ?, O ✓, T ✓, S ?. However, we already have S in position 1 confirmed, so having another S in position 5 is possible.

But we have no restriction on double letters yet.

Is there a more common word? Let me check other possibilities:

- S _ O T _ with valid letters left: positions 2 and 5 must be from D, I, L, C, G, P, B, K, M, F, W, V, Z.

Looking at common words:
   - S L O T S   (common)
   - S C O T S   (but C would be position 2, then S position 5, but S already at 1)
   - S P O T S   (P position 2, S position 5)
   - S W O T S   (rare)
   - S P O T S is a common word.

Let me check if P is allowed: yes, P hasn’t been eliminated.

S P O T S fits the pattern S _ O T _ , uses only allowed letters, and is a common English word.

Therefore, S P O T S is the most logical next guess.

<guess>SPOTS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) N(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: SHOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) U(x) T(-)
Guess 4: SPOTS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SPOTS:
– S ✓ in position 1 (already confirmed)
– P x — P is not in the word.
– O ✓ in position 3 (confirmed)
– T – — T is in the word but not in position 4.
– S – — second S is in the word but not in position 5.

This gives us the exact pattern:
S _ O _ _  
and shows T must appear once, but not in position 4.  
Therefore T must be in position 2 or 5.

Also, the second S must appear somewhere else in the word.  
Because we already have S in position 1 fixed, the only other possible place for S is position 5.

Hence the pattern becomes:
S _ O _ S and T must be in position 2 (since position 5 is already taken by S).

So the only possible template is:
S T O _ S

Remaining letters for position 4 (cannot be any already eliminated: A, R, E, N, Y, H, U, P):
Common candidates left: D, I, L, C, G, K, M, B, F, W, V, etc.

Valid English words fitting S T O _ S:
- STODS (rare / obsolete)
- STOGS (rare)
- STOAS (plural of stoa, acceptable)
- STOIC (but ends in C, not S)
- STOKE (ends in E, eliminated)
- STOLI (not a word)
- STOLN (archaic)
- STOMP (ends in P, eliminated)
- STONG (not a word)
- STONK (slang, ends in K)
- STOOK (ends in K)
- STOOL (ends in L)
- STOOP (ends in P, eliminated)
- STOSS (geological term, valid)
- STOUT (ends in T, but T must be in position 2)
- STOVE (ends in E, eliminated)
- STOWS (valid, ends in S)

Among these, STOAS, STOSS, STOWS are valid 5-letter words.  
STOAS is uncommon; STOSS is technical; STOWS is everyday.

I’ll go with STOWS.

- S must be in positions 1 and 5 (because the second S in STOWS was marked “–”, meaning S is in the word but not in position 5; yet we already have S in position 1). Therefore the second S must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 and 3 are already T and O respectively. Hence the only remaining spot for the second S is position 4.

Hence word must be S T O S _

But we still need the final letter (position 5). From all previous feedback, the allowed letters (never marked x) are: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Z (plus any others not explicitly ruled out).

A valid 5-letter word fitting S T O S _ is:

- STOSS (but T is already in position 2 so this would duplicate T; also it’s uncommon)
- STOSK (not a word)
- STOSI (not a word)
- STOSA (not a word)

The only common English 5-letter word that matches the exact pattern S T O S _ is:

STOSS.

However, since “STOSS” is a technical term and may not be in some dictionaries, double-checking with another word: “STOGS” is invalid, “STOAS” ends with A (eliminated), etc. After reviewing, the legitimate word is indeed STOSS.

Therefore the next guess is STOSS.
