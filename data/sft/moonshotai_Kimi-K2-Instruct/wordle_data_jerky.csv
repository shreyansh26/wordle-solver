For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter distribution to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good options are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test and gather information about the secret word.

From the first feedback (SLATE: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)) we learn:

1. E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.
3. That leaves possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E somewhere among positions 1-4.

Good follow-up words should avoid S, L, A, T and try to introduce new common letters while also re-using E in an earlier position. Popular second-guess choices under these constraints include:

- CRONE (but O and N are still unknown)
- PRONE (but P is not super-common)
- RINSE (but S is ruled out)
- NERDY (but Y is less common)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) – introduces D, R, I, V while re-using E.

“DRIVE” is appealing because:
- It contains the now-known letter E in position 5 → feedback tells us E is NOT at position 5, so putting it in 5 would give us an immediate “-” telling us E is earlier. However, since we already know E is not at 5, we can safely place E in positions 1-4 now.  
- It introduces three very common consonants D, R, V plus the vowel I.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters OUT: S, L, A, T, C, N, F, I, D  
Letters definitely IN: R (correct position 3), E (present but not in positions 3, 4, 5)

So far the word pattern looks like: _ _ R _ _  
and E must be in either position 1 or 2.

We need three more distinct letters (none of the above rejects) and they must be common enough.  
Remaining consonants that have not been tested and are fairly common: B, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since I, A are out)

We want a word that places E in slot 1 or 2 and completes the remaining three positions with untested letters.

One candidate that fits:  
- E in position 1 → E R _ _ _  
- Need three more letters. A good choice: B, O, W → E R B O W? Not a word.  
- Another: E R G O T? No.  
- Switch to E in position 2 → _ E R _ _  
   Then we need a first letter and last two letters. Let’s try common combos:

   – W, E, R, O, K → W E R O K? Not a word.  
   – K, E, R, O, X → K E R O X? Not a word.  
   – Y, E, R, O, B → Y E R O B? Not a word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,jerky,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter distribution to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good options are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test and gather information about the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first feedback (SLATE: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)) we learn:

1. E is in the word but not in position 5.
2. S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all.
3. That leaves possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E somewhere among positions 1-4.

Good follow-up words should avoid S, L, A, T and try to introduce new common letters while also re-using E in an earlier position. Popular second-guess choices under these constraints include:

- CRONE (but O and N are still unknown)
- PRONE (but P is not super-common)
- RINSE (but S is ruled out)
- NERDY (but Y is less common)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) – introduces D, R, I, V while re-using E.

“DRIVE” is appealing because:
- It contains the now-known letter E in position 5 → feedback tells us E is NOT at position 5, so putting it in 5 would give us an immediate “-” telling us E is earlier. However, since we already know E is not at 5, we can safely place E in positions 1-4 now.  
- It introduces three very common consonants D, R, V plus the vowel I.

Actually, let’s instead use “CRANE” because it places E in position 4, and introduces C, R, N – all very common letters still allowed.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (SLATE): S, L, A, T are absent; E is present but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CRANE): C, A, N are absent; R is present but not in position 2; E is present but not in position 5 (again).

So we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E
- Known positions: E is NOT in 5, R is NOT in 2.

We still need three more letters. Good remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
We also haven’t tested vowels I, O, U yet.

We want to place R and E in new positions and introduce new common letters.

Option 1: place E in position 1 or 3 and R in 3 or 4.
Option 2: pick a word like “MERGE” – but G and second E might be risky.
Option 3: pick “BREAD” – B, D are common, A is out, so skip.
Option 4: pick “PERVY” – P, V, Y are not super common.
Option 5: pick “DRIER” – R twice, I once, E once, D once. Seems good because it tests:
   - D, I (new letters)
   - R in position 2 (previously R was in position 2 and gave “-”, so R can’t be in 2; if we try R in 2 again we’ll get “-” again. So avoid.)
Option 6: pick “FIRED” – F, I, R, E, D. Places E in 4 (already allowed), R in 3 (allowed), introduces F, I, D. This seems balanced.

I'll go with “FIRED” to test F, I, D, and place R and E in new spots.

Seems good because it tests:\n   - D, I (new letters)\n   - R in position 2 (previously R was in position 2 and gave “-”, so R can’t be in 2; if we try R in 2 again we’ll get “-” again. So avoid.)\nOption 6: pick “FIRED” – F, I, R, E, D. Places E in 4 (already allowed), R in 3 (allowed), introduces F, I, D.

From Guess 4 we suddenly have four exact hits:

P(x)  → P is not in the word.
E(✓)  → E is in position 2.
R(✓)  → R is in position 3.
K(✓)  → K is in position 4.
Y(✓)  → Y is in position 5.

Therefore the hidden word is **E R K Y** with a single missing first letter.

Letters already ruled out include S, L, A, T, C, N, F, I, D, P.  
That leaves many consonants still legal, e.g. B, G, H, M, V, W, Z.

The only requirement is:
– a five-letter word of the form  _ E R K Y.

Scanning common vocabulary the only everyday word that fits is:

W E R K Y  →  “WERKY” is not a recognized English word.  
B E R K Y  →  “BERKY” is likewise not valid.  
G E R K Y  →  “GERKY” (not a word).  
H E R K Y  →  “HERKY” (not a word).  
V E R K Y  →  “VERKY” (not a word).  
Z E R K Y  →  “ZERKY” (not a word).  
M E R K Y  →  “MERKY” (archaic variant of “murky,” but not in modern Scrabble/Wordle lists).

The only legitimate English word matching that pattern is:

J E R K Y  →  “JERKY”.

All letters—J, E, R, K, Y—are consistent with every clue so far.
