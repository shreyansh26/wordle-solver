For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. I'll use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, and A are NOT in the word at all (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, or A.
- Contains T somewhere not in position 4.
- Contains E somewhere not in position 5.

I’ll pick a new word that:
1. Uses T and E in different positions.
2. Avoids S, L, A.
3. Uses common consonants and vowels I haven’t tried yet.

A good candidate is ""ETHER"":
- E in position 1 (new position for E)
- T in position 2 (new position for T)
- H and R are common letters I haven’t tested yet.
- The second E might give info on whether E is doubled or appears twice.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ETHER → E(-) T(-) H(x) E(✓) R(x)

Summary of constraints so far:
- Letters not in the word at all: S, L, A, H, R.  
- Letters that ARE in the word: T and E.
- Position constraints:
  – T cannot be in position 4 (SLATE) and cannot be in position 2 (ETHER).  
  – E cannot be in position 1 (ETHER) or position 5 (SLATE), but it is known to be in position 4 (ETHER, E(✓)).

So the secret word must:
1. Contain T and E.
2. Have E in position 4 (since ETHER gives E(✓) in position 4).
3. Have T in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 4).
4. Avoid S, L, A, H, R.

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that fits:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E _
- Must contain T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Must not contain S, L, A, H, R.
- Other letters must be from the remaining alphabet (common ones like N, C, D, M, I, O, U, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- If T is in position 1: T _ _ E _
- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E _
- If T is in position 5: _ _ _ E T

Let’s try T in position 3: _ _ T E _
We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2. Good ones could be D and I (common and unused so far): D I T E _? No, “DIT” isn’t a valid 5-letter word extension.

Try T in position 5: _ _ _ E T. Good ones: C O M E T? “COMET” – but O and M haven’t been ruled out yet.

Check constraints for COMET:
- Letters: C, O, M, E, T.

Good ones: C O M E T? “COMET” – but O and M haven’t been ruled out yet.\n\nCheck constraints for COMET:\n- Letters: C, O, M, E, T.\n- No S, L, A, H, R.\n- E in 4 and T in 5 fit the constraints.\n- All letters are new (except E and T, which we know are in the word).\n\nCOMET looks valid and useful.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, H, R, C, M  
Letters definitely IN the word: E, T, O  
Position facts:
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- T is somewhere except positions 2, 4, 5 → T must be in position 1 or 3.
- O is in the word; in Guess 3 it was in position 2 and got ✓, so O is fixed at position 2.

So the pattern so far is:
T or _   O   T or _   E   _

Remaining consonants/vowels we haven’t tried and are still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
We need a single letter for position 3 or 1 and another for position 5.

Case 1: T is in position 1  
Pattern: T O _ E _

Case 2: T is in position 3  
Pattern: _ O T E _

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Case 1: T O _ E _  
Possible: TOKEN, TONER, TOPEE, TOWER, etc.
- TOKEN: K, N unused → good.
- TONER: R is already excluded.
- TOWER: R excluded.
So TOKEN seems best.

Case 2: _ O T E _  
Possible: VOTED, DOTER, WOTEN, etc.
- VOTED: D is fine, but VOTED uses D and V which are both new and okay.
- DOTER: R excluded.

Between the two, TOKEN is a common word, fits all constraints, and introduces two new letters (K, N).  
Let’s guess TOKEN.
