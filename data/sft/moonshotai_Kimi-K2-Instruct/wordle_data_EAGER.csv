For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in English to maximize information gain
2. Uses different letters to test as many possibilities as possible
3. Is a valid 5-letter word

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This gives us 5 different letters including 3 of the top 5 most common letters, and both common vowels and consonants.

From Guess 3 we now know:
- E is in the correct position 1 (✓).
- A is in the correct position 2 (✓).
- R is still in the wrong place (-) but definitely in the word.
- T and H are NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern we have is:
E A _ _ _
with R somewhere in positions 3, 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A and E are already placed, and O was ruled out)

We need two more letters for the final three positions (R plus one more). The most common remaining letters are N, L, I, K, M, etc.

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit E A _ _ _ with R in positions 3, 4, or 5:

Possible patterns:
- E A R _ _
- E A _ R _
- E A _ _ R

Let’s think of valid words:

1. E A R _ _: 
   - EARLY – but L and Y have not been tested, and Y was ruled out in Guess 2.
   - EARNS – N and S (S was ruled out in Guess 1)
   - EARTH – already used
   - EARLS – S ruled out
   Seems none fit.

2. E A _ R _:
   - EAGER – G and E (E already used in position 1)
   - EARLY – Y ruled out
   - EABER – invalid
   - EAMER – invalid
   - EAKER – K and E
   - EATER – T ruled out
   - EAGER – possible, but we already have E in position 1, and G is new
   - EAGER fits: E A G E R
   - But E is repeated, and we already have E in position 1. Need to check if duplicates allowed – seems allowed.

3. E A _ _ R:
   - E A _ _ R:
   - EAGER could also fit as E A G E R
   - EATER – T ruled out
   - EAGER seems best so far.

Another candidate: E A R _ _:
   - EARLS – S ruled out
   - EARNS – S ruled out
   - EARLS – invalid
   Seems E A _ R _ or E A _ _ R is better.

Let me think of other words:
- E A R Y L – invalid
- E A R G E – EAGER
- E A K E R – EAKER (valid word, but K and E)
- E A M E R – EAMER (less common)
- E A N G E – invalid
- E A L G E – invalid

EAGER seems to be the most common valid word:
- E A G E R
- Letters: E (pos 1 ✓), A (pos 2 ✓), G (new), E (already in word), R (needs to be in word but not in position 5)
- R is in position 5 here. From Guess 3, R was in position 3 and marked (-), so position 3 was wrong for R. Position 5 is new for R, so this is okay.

But let me double-check:
From Guess 3, R was in position 3 and marked (-), meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3. So R can now be in 4 or 5. EAGER has R in position 5, which is new and allowed.

Thus EAGER is a valid next guess, introducing G and placing R in a new spot.

Alternative word: E A N G E – invalid
E A L E R – EALER (rare)
E A K E R – EAKER (rare)

EAGER is the best choice.
