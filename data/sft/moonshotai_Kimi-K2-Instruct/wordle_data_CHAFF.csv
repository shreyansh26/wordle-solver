This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. The best strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has good vowel coverage.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

So far we have:

- A is in the word and is in position 3 (from PLANT feedback: A(✓)).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T.

That leaves the following letters still possibly in the word:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Keeps A in the 3rd position.
2. Uses as many new, common consonants as possible.
3. Avoids all the eliminated letters.

A good candidate using common remaining consonants is ""COBRA"" but it has R (eliminated). Next option using B, C, D, G, H, M, etc. is ""BADGY"" (but G and Y are less common). Let's pick ""COMMA"" but it has M twice and may not give us as much information.

A better option is ""MACHO"" which uses M, A, C, H, O. But A is in position 3, so pattern is _ _ A _ _. So ""MACHO"" doesn't fit this pattern.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 and using new common letters. Possible options:
- ""CABIN"" - but N is eliminated
- ""MACAW"" - but W is less common
- ""GAMMA"" - but G and M are fine, though double M may not help
- ""HABIT"" - but T is eliminated
- ""VAPID"" - but P is eliminated
- ""BAGEL"" - but E, L are eliminated

Actually ""MACAW"" uses M, A, C, A, W. A is in position 3 as required. Letters M, C, W are new.

But ""MACAW"" has A twice which may not be optimal. Alternatively ""CAMEL"" - but E and L are eliminated.

Another good option is ""GAMMA"" - G, A, M, M, A. But double letters aren't ideal.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The simplest word filling _ _ A _ _ with new common consonants would be ""BADLY"" - but L is eliminated. ""CADDY"" - but D is fine, but ends with Y. ""CABBY"" - but B is fine, double B.

But ""CABBY"" uses C, A, B, B, Y. All letters are new except A which we know is correct in position 3. This seems like a good choice to test C, B, Y.

However, ""CABBY"" may not be the most common word. Let me try ""MANGO"" - but N and G are fine, O is fine. Pattern _ _ A _ _. ""MANGO"" would have A in position 3 - M, A, N, G, O. But N is eliminated (from PLANT feedback).

Next: ""VAGUE"" - but E is eliminated. ""WACKY"" - W, A, C, K, Y. All letters new except A. This looks good.

From the feedback so far:

Known facts  
1. A must be in the word and is in position 3.  
   Pattern so far: _ _ A _ _

2. Letters that are NOT in the word (✗):  
   R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, W, K, Y

3. Letters that ARE in the word but wrong place so far:  
   - From WACKY: C(-) ⇒ C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Remaining usable consonants (common ones first):  
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z  

Vowels: A is already fixed in position 3; U and O are still possible (U, O).  

We need a 5-letter word where
- 3rd letter = A  
- Contains C somewhere (not in position 4)  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated  

One common word matching these constraints is “MACAW” but W is eliminated.  
Try “CABAL”: C is in position 1, A is in position 3, but L is eliminated.  
Next: “GAMMA”: G, A, M, M, A. Both M’s are new, but double letters aren’t ideal.  

A better choice is “CAMBO” – C, A, M, B, O.  
- C is in position 1 (allowed because C must be somewhere other than 4).  
- A is in position 3 (required).  
- M, B, O have never been tried and are not eliminated.  
- No eliminated letters appear.

So we’ll guess CAMBO.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

So the word:

Popular letters left to test: T, N, O, L, C, U, etc.  
A word that uses fresh common consonants and keeps A elsewhere is “TOADY” (T, O, A, D, Y).  
But the A would again be in position 3 (same as in RAISE), and we know A is not in position 2, but it could still be in position 3 or 4 or 5. However, to maximize new information and avoid repeating disallowed letters, let’s try a word that places A in a different spot and introduces fresh consonants.

That leaves the following letters still possibly in the word:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Keeps A in the 3rd position.
2. Uses as many new, common consonants as possible.
3. Avoids all the eliminated letters.

A good candidate using common remaining consonants is ""COBRA"" but it has R (eliminated). Next option using B, C, D, G, H, M, etc. is ""BADGY"" (but G and Y are less common). Let's pick ""COMMA"" but it has M twice and may not give us as much information.

A better option is ""MACHO"" which uses M, A, C, H, O. But A is in position 3, so pattern is _ _ A _ _. So ""MACHO"" doesn't fit this pattern.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 and using new common letters. Possible options:
- ""CABIN"" - but N is eliminated
- ""MACAW"" - but W is less common
- ""GAMMA"" - but G and M are fine, though double M may not help
- ""HABIT"" - but T is eliminated
- ""VAPID"" - but P is eliminated
- ""BAGEL"" - but E, L are eliminated

Actually ""MACAW"" uses M, A, C, A, W. A is in position 3 as required. Letters M, C, W are new.

But ""MACAW"" has A twice which may not be optimal. Alternatively ""CAMEL"" - but E and L are eliminated.

Another good option is ""GAMMA"" - G, A, M, M, A. But double letters aren't ideal.

Wait, let me list all possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The simplest word filling _ _ A _ _ with new common consonants would be ""BADLY"" - but L is eliminated. ""CADDY"" - but D is fine, but ends with Y. ""CABBY"" - but B is fine, double B.

3. Eliminated letters (x in any position)  
   R, I, S, E, P, L, N, T, W, K, Y, M, B, O

4. Remaining possible letters  
   Consonants still allowed: D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z  
   Vowels still allowed: U (A already fixed, E/O/I eliminated)

5. Filling in C _ A _ _  
   We need two more letters, both from the still-allowed set, and one of them must be C (since C appears twice: once in position 1 and once elsewhere).  
   But position 1 is already C and we can’t use the same position twice, so the second C must be in position 4 or 5.

   Looking for common 5-letter words matching C _ A _ _ with either C in position 4 or 5 and using only the allowed letters:

   - C A _ C _ : No common words.  
   - C A _ _ C : “CHACC” (not a word), “CUBIC” (B and I eliminated), etc. — none fit.

   Since we cannot place a second C without repeating elimination issues, the above implies that the letter C only appears once, but the feedback shows it must appear (from both WACKY and CAMBO). This means my earlier assumption was wrong: CAMBO’s C was marked ✓ for position 1, which tells us that C is in position 1 and NOT elsewhere (because ✓ means exact match, and no other C was marked ✓ or -). Therefore, the C(-) from WACKY’s position 4 must have meant C is in the word but not in position 4, and CAMBO’s ✓ in position 1 satisfies both: C is in position 1 and not in position 4. So C appears exactly once.

   Therefore, the pattern is definitely C _ A _ _, and we need two more letters from the remaining allowed set.

   Remaining allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z.

   We need to pick two letters from this set to complete C _ A _ _. Let’s try common combinations:

   - C F A U D (not a word)  
   - C H A F F (F twice, H allowed)  
   - C H A D U (not a word)  
   - C H A V E (E eliminated)  
   - C H A R D (R eliminated)  
   - C H A D S (S eliminated)  
   - C H A D D (D allowed, double D)  
   - C H A D _ : “CHAD” is 4 letters.  
   - C H A F T (T eliminated)  
   - C H A D _ : Let’s try “CHAD” + another letter, but we need 5 letters.  

   Actually, the valid 5-letter words with C _ A _ _ from remaining letters are rare. Let me list:

   - C H A D ? : “CHADS” (S eliminated)  
   - C H A F ? : “CHAFE” (E eliminated)  
   - C H A D ? : No.  
   - C H A V ? : “CHAVE” (E eliminated)  
   - C H A U ? : “CHAUP” (P eliminated)  

   It seems difficult. Another approach: use U as vowel since it’s allowed.

   Possible word: C H A U D (not a standard word)  
   Another: C H A U L (L eliminated)  
   Another: C H A U K (K eliminated)  

   Let me try “CHARD”: C H A R D. R is eliminated.  

   Next: “CHAUD” – not a word.  

   Another angle: use D and U. Possible word: C H A U D.  

   Alternatively, “CHADZ” – not a word.  

   Re-examining the allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z.  

   The only plausible 5-letter word starting with C, second letter from remaining, third A, and last two from remaining is “CHARD” but R is out.  

   Wait, let me list all remaining letters and brute-force possible combinations:

   C H A _ _ : H is allowed.  
   Then last two letters from D, F, G, J, Q, U, V, X, Z.  

   Possible:  
   - C H A D U (not a word)  
   - C H A D D (word: CHADD – variant spelling, but rare)  
   - C H A U D (not a word)  
   - C H A F F (word: CHAFF) – uses C, H, A, F, F. F is allowed.  

   “CHAFF” is a valid 5-letter word: C H A F F.  

   Check letters:  
   - C (position 1) ✓  
   - H (new)  
   - A (position 3) ✓  
   - F (new)  
   - F (new, but duplicate)  

   All letters are from the allowed set, and none are eliminated.  

   Therefore, the best next guess is “CHAFF”.
