For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me as much information as possible about the letters in the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. 

Commonly occurring letters in 5-letter English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses a variety of these common letters without repeating any.

One effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage across different letter types.

However, another strong contender is ""SLATE"" which also uses common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers different positions well.

After considering both, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

The feedback for AROSE tells us:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1
- R, O, S are NOT in the word at all
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5

So our word so far:
- Does NOT contain: R, O, S
- Contains: A (not in slot 1) and E (not in slot 5)

We need a word with A and E, but A not in 1 and E not in 5, and no R, O, S. Common consonants left: T, N, L, D, etc.

Let's try ""TALEN"" - but E is in slot 5 which is invalid.
Try ""LATED"" - but E is in slot 4 which is valid (and A is in slot 2). But we don't know about D yet.

A better choice might be ""TALEN"" rearranged to avoid E in 5: ""LATEN"" - E is in 4 (valid), A in 2 (valid), no R,O,S.

Wait, ""LATEN"" might be too obscure. Let's go with ""TALEN"" but swap E to 3: ""TANEL"" - but A is in 2 (valid), E in 3 (valid), no R,O,S.

Actually ""TALEN"" isn't valid - let's pick ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. A is in 3 (valid), E in 5 (invalid).

""PLANT"" - no E.

""LEANT"" - E in 2 (valid), A in 4 (valid), no R,O,S. This seems good.

From the two guesses we already have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R, O, S are not in the word at all
   - E is in the word but not in position 5

2. LEANT → L(-) E(✓) A(-) N(x) T(-)
   - E is in the correct position (position 2)
   - L, A, N, T are all in the word but in the wrong positions
   - N is not in the word (N(x))
   - T is in the word but not in position 5
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - L is in the word but not in position 1

So we know:
- E is in position 2: _ E _ _ _
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3
- T and L are in the word but their positions are unknown
- R, O, S, N are not in the word

Possible letters: A, E, T, L plus other letters not yet tried (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

A is in the word: must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 3 and E is in 2)
But in LEANT, A was in position 3 and marked (-), so A can't be 3, but in AROSE it was (-) when in position 1. So A is in 4 or 5.

Similarly, T and L are in the word somewhere.

Let's try placing A in position 4: _ E _ A _

We need two more letters to fill positions 3 and 5, using T and L (since they're in the word).

Possible arrangements:
- _ E T A L
- _ E L A T

""L"" in position 5 was marked (-) in LEANT (which had L in position 1), so L can be in positions 2,3,4,5 but 2 is E, 4 is A, so 3 or 5. In LEANT, L was in 1 (-), so L can be in 3 or 5.

Similarly, T was in position 5 (-) in LEANT, so T cannot be in 5, must be in 1 or 3.

Let's try:
- Position 1: must be a new letter we haven't tried. From remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: T or L
- Position 5: T or L

But T can't be in 5 (was in 5 (-) in LEANT), so T must be in 3, and L must be in 5.

Thus: _ E T A L

We need a letter for position 1. Let's pick a common consonant not yet used, like D.

DETAL - but DETAL is not a valid word.

Next common consonant: B → BETAL - invalid
C → CETAL - invalid
F → FETAL - this is a valid word!

Let's try FETAL:
- F (new letter, not in any previous guess)
- E is correct in position 2
- T is in position 3 (was in 5 (-) in LEANT, so this is valid)
- A is in position 4 (was in 1 (-) in AROSE and 3 (-) in LEANT, so 4 is new)
