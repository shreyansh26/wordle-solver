For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good coverage of common letters in English 5-letter words. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible or find hits on letters in the correct positions.

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers high-frequency letters C, R, A, N, E. These letters appear in many English words and should give good feedback. The word itself is valid and uses common letters that could help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
2. The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

Since R is confirmed present but in wrong position, let's try placing R in position 1. A good next word would test new vowels and consonants while incorporating R in the first position. 

""ROIST"" would be ideal as it tests R in position 1, plus O, I, S, T - but ""ROIST"" isn't a valid English word. 

""ROUST"" tests O, U, S, T with R in position 1 - but ""ROUST"" isn't common.

""RIGHT"" tests I, G, H, T with R in position 1 - but G and H are less common.

""RIOTS"" tests I, O, T, S with R in position 1 - but this uses O which might be too early.

""TRUMP"" would test T, U, M, P - but we should probably keep R in position 1.

""DRIFT"" tests D, I, F, T with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

After considering, ""BRISK"" would test B, I, S, K with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

Actually, let's try ""TRASH"" - this tests T, A, S, H with R in position 2, but A is already ruled out.

Better approach: Let's try ""STORM"" - this tests S, T, O, M with R in position 3. This seems good as it tests new vowel O and new consonants S, T, M.

3. Position clues so far:
   - R is NOT in position 2 (CRANE) and NOT in position 4 (STORM)  
   - S is in position 1 (STORM)

We now know:
- S is fixed in position 1
- R must be in positions 3 or 5 (since it’s not 2 or 4)
- The remaining three letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet excluding C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

We still need to test common vowels I and U and consonants like L, D, P, B, F, G, H, etc.

A good next word should:
  - Keep S in position 1
  - Place R in position 3 to test it there
  - Use new, common letters for the other spots

Example structure: S _ R _ _

Candidate words:
- SURLY (but L and Y untested)
- SIRUP (tests I, U, P)
- SPIRE (tests P, I) – but E is ruled out
- STRIP – but T is ruled out
- SCRUB – C is ruled out
- SHRUG – H, U, G are new

Between these, “SHRUG” tests H, U, G while keeping S in position 1 and placing R in position 3. This seems optimal for covering new letters efficiently.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible or find hits on letters in the correct positions.

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers high-frequency letters C, R, A, N, E. These letters appear in many English words and should give good feedback. The word itself is valid and uses common letters that could help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains R somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
2. The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

Since R is confirmed present but in wrong position, let's try placing R in position 1. A good next word would test new vowels and consonants while incorporating R in the first position. 

""ROIST"" would be ideal as it tests R in position 1, plus O, I, S, T - but ""ROIST"" isn't a valid English word. 

""ROUST"" tests O, U, S, T with R in position 1 - but ""ROUST"" isn't common.

""RIGHT"" tests I, G, H, T with R in position 1 - but G and H are less common.

""RIOTS"" tests I, O, T, S with R in position 1 - but this uses O which might be too early.

""TRUMP"" would test T, U, M, P - but we should probably keep R in position 1.

""DRIFT"" tests D, I, F, T with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

After considering, ""BRISK"" would test B, I, S, K with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

Actually, let's try ""TRASH"" - this tests T, A, S, H with R in position 2, but A is already ruled out.

3. U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
4. R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already knew it wasn’t in 2 or 4, so this confirms it must be in 3 or 5).
5. P(✓) – P is in the word and correctly placed in position 5.

Current certainties:

- Position 1: S  
- Position 5: P  

Skeleton: S _ _ _ P

Confirmed letters still to place: U and R  
(Remember we’ve eliminated C, A, N, E, T, O, M, H, G, L.)

Therefore U and R must occupy positions 2 and 3/4, but U cannot be in position 4 (from SLURP feedback), so U must be in position 2 or 3, and R must fill the remaining slot.

Possible placements:

Option 1:  
S U R _ P → needs a 4th-letter consonant.  
Valid English word: SURFP (invalid)  
SUR__P: only SURAP (invalid), SURIP (invalid)

Option 2:  
S R U _ P → needs a 4th-letter consonant.  
Valid English word: SRUMP (invalid)  
SRU _ P: SRUBP (invalid), SRUDP (invalid) … none look valid.

Wait – let’s list all consonants still available (excluding used and eliminated letters):

Available consonants not yet tested:  
B, D, F, I, K, V, W, Y

(Note: I is actually a vowel, but is still untested.)

So possible valid words fitting S _ _ _ P:

We have to place R and U across positions 2 and 3 or 2 and 4, etc., while meeting constraints.

Re-express positions:

- Position 1: S  
- Position 5: P  

We need to fill positions 2, 3, 4 with letters from {B, D, F, I, K, R, U, V, W, Y}, ensuring R and U both appear once, and U not in position 4.

Possible valid English words:

With U fixed somewhere and R filling another slot:

1. S U R _ P: need 4th consonant → SUR _ P  
   Only valid 5-letter word in English: SURIP (not recognized), SURYP (invalid)

2. S R U _ P: SRU _ P  
   Only valid word: “SCRUP” is invalid (C ruled out)

3. S _ U R P: positions 2 and 3, 4  
   S _ U R P → need consonant in position 2  
   Valid English word: S + D + U + R + P → “SDURP” (invalid)  
   S + F + U + R + P → “SFURP” (invalid)  
   S + I + U + R + P → “SIURP” (invalid)  
   S + K + U + R + P → “SKURP” (invalid)  
   S + B + U + R + P → “SBURP” (invalid)

4. S _ R U P: positions 2,3,4  
   Need consonant in 2, R in 3, U in 4 → S _ R U P  
   Valid English word: “SCRUP” (invalid, C ruled out)  
   “SFRUP” (invalid)  

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider.

Actually, the only way to place R and U legally is:

- U can’t be in 4, so U must be in 2 or 3.  
- R must be somewhere not yet eliminated (allowed in 3 or 5, but 5 is P, so R must be in 3).

Thus the only possibility is:

S _ R U P → but U would be in 4, which is forbidden.

Wait, that’s impossible. So U must be in 2, and R must be in 3:

S U R _ P → but that requires a consonant in position 4, and the only unused consonants are B, D, F, I, K, V, W, Y.

Valid English word: S U R B P → “SURBP” invalid  
S U R D P → “SURDP” invalid  
S U R F P → “SURFP” invalid  
S U R K P → “SURKP” invalid  

None are words. This implies I’ve missed something. Let me re-list all 5-letter English words matching S _ _ _ P and see which use only allowed letters.

Looking at an English word list, valid 5-letter words ending in ‘-SP’ that start with ‘S’ and have no C, A, N, E, T, O, M, H, G, L:

- SIRUP (uses I, R, U, P)  
- SCRIP (C ruled out)  
- SULPH (H ruled out)  
- SUSPY (but Y and S repeated)  

Only SIRUP meets criteria and uses letters already confirmed (R, U, P) plus the vowel I.

But SIRUP has U in position 3 – is that allowed? Yes, because SLURP feedback only said U is not in position 4, so position 3 is fine.

So SIRUP fits:

Positions:  
1: S (confirmed)  
2: I (new vowel)  
3: R (confirmed)  
4: U (new position, allowed)  
5: P (confirmed)  

This uses all confirmed letters (S, R, U, P) plus the new vowel I.

Therefore, the logical next guess is SIRUP.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good coverage of common letters in English 5-letter words. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible or find hits on letters in the correct positions.

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - all vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers high-frequency letters C, R, A, N, E. These letters appear in many English words and should give good feedback. The word itself is valid and uses common letters that could help narrow down the possibilities significantly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
2. The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.
3. We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants.

Since R is confirmed present but in wrong position, let's try placing R in position 1. A good next word would test new vowels and consonants while incorporating R in the first position. 

""ROIST"" would be ideal as it tests R in position 1, plus O, I, S, T - but ""ROIST"" isn't a valid English word. 

""ROUST"" tests O, U, S, T with R in position 1 - but ""ROUST"" isn't common.

""RIGHT"" tests I, G, H, T with R in position 1 - but G and H are less common.

""RIOTS"" tests I, O, T, S with R in position 1 - but this uses O which might be too early.

""TRUMP"" would test T, U, M, P - but we should probably keep R in position 1.

""DRIFT"" tests D, I, F, T with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

After considering, ""BRISK"" would test B, I, S, K with R in position 2 - but we know R isn't in position 2.

Actually, let's try ""TRASH"" - this tests T, A, S, H with R in position 2, but A is already ruled out.

Re-evaluating: we need to test new letters while keeping R somewhere. Let's try ""DRIER"" - but this has E which is ruled out.

Better approach: Let's try ""STORM"" - this tests S, T, O, M with R in position 3. This seems good as it tests new vowel O and new consonants S, T, M.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both rounds of feedback:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, M  
2. Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position unknown), S  
3. Position clues so far:
   - R is NOT in position 2 (CRANE) and NOT in position 4 (STORM)  
   - S is in position 1 (STORM)

We now know:
- S is fixed in position 1
- R must be in positions 3 or 5 (since it’s not 2 or 4)
- The remaining three letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet excluding C, A, N, E, T, O, M.

We still need to test common vowels I and U and consonants like L, D, P, B, F, G, H, etc.

A good next word should:
  - Keep S in position 1
  - Place R in position 3 to test it there
  - Use new, common letters for the other spots

Example structure: S _ R _ _

Candidate words:
- SURLY (but L and Y untested)
- SIRUP (tests I, U, P)
- SPIRE (tests P, I) – but E is ruled out
- STRIP – but T is ruled out
- SCRUB – C is ruled out
- SHRUG – H, U, G are new

Between these, “SHRUG” tests H, U, G while keeping S in position 1 and placing R in position 3. This seems optimal for covering new letters efficiently.

Let’s go with SHRUG.

Letters still available:  
B, D, F, I, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus any other unused letters.

We still need to find the 2nd and 5th letters.  
Common candidates to test quickly:  
I, L, P, D, F, K, Y.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern S _ R U _ with unused letters.

Possible choices:  
- SURFY (but Y is less common, and F already available)  
- SIRUP (I is a vowel we still need to test)  
- SLURP (L is very common)  
- SCRUB (C already eliminated)  
- SPRUG (P and G: G already eliminated)  

Between SIRUP and SLURP, SLURP uses L and P, both common and untested. Since we already have U in position 4, either could work, but SLURP gives us two new consonants at once (L and P) while SIRUP reuses I and P.

Let’s try SLURP; it fills L in position 2 and P in position 5.

A good next word would test new vowels and consonants while incorporating R in the first position. \n\n""ROIST"" would be ideal as it tests R in position 1, plus O, I, S, T - but ""ROIST"" isn\'t a valid English word. \n\n""ROUST"" tests O, U, S, T with R in position 1 - but ""ROUST"" isn\'t common.\n\n""RIGHT"" tests I, G, H, T with R in position 1 - but G and H are less common.\n\n""RIOTS"" tests I, O, T, S with R in position 1 - but this uses O which might be too early.\n\n""TRUMP"" would test T, U, M, P - but we should probably keep R in position 1.\n\n""DRIFT"" tests D, I, F, T with R in position 2 - but we know R isn\'t in position 2.\n\nAfter considering, ""BRISK"" would test B, I, S, K with R in position 2 - but we know R isn\'t in position 2.\n\nActually, let\'s try ""TRASH"" - this tests T, A, S, H with R in position 2, but A is already ruled out.\n\nRe-evaluating: we need to test new letters while keeping R somewhere. Let\'s try ""DRIER"" - but this has E which is ruled out.\n\nBetter approach: Let\'s try ""STORM"" - this tests S, T, O, M with R in position 3.
