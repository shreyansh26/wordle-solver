Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, my goal is to maximize information gain. I'll choose a word that:
1. Contains common vowels and consonants
2. Uses distinct letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Avoids letters that appear rarely in English words (like Z, X, Q)

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It tests letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This will give me good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which of these high-frequency letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)

- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)

- Contains R and E

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It tests letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words

This will give me good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which of these high-frequency letters are in the secret word.

- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

So:
- The word contains R and E, but neither in the positions they were in AROSE (so R ≠ 2nd, E ≠ 5th).
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and E (since they are confirmed to be in the word)
2. Does NOT use A, O, or S
3. Places R and E in new positions
4. Uses 3 new consonants/vowels that we haven't tested yet (i.e., not A, O, S, R, or E)

Good letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, etc.

The word ""THERE"" comes to mind, but that repeats E. Instead, let's test ""TIRED"":
- Contains R and E
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- Positions: T, I, R, E, D
- R is in the 3rd position (new position)

The word “RINFE” is valid but “RIFNE” is not. How about “RINSE”? – but S is forbidden.  
“RIVEN” – uses R (1st), new V (2nd), I (3rd), E (4th), new N (5th). Looks good!

- Letter R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be 4th or 5th.  
  (But position 4 is already taken by E, so R must be 5th.)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I E R

We still need two new consonants for positions 1 and 2.  
Untested letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y  

A common English word fitting this pattern is “FIBER” (F, B, I, E, R).  
Let’s use that to test F and B.

Check:
- F: new letter  
- B: new letter  
- I: correct position (3rd)  
- E: correct position (4th)  
- R: correct position (5th)

Perfect!

So the word is now locked into the pattern:  
F _ I E R

Only the second letter remains unknown. The letters NOT in the word are:  
A, O, S, T, D, V, N, B (from all feedback).

We need a single letter for the 2nd position that hasn't been tested yet and is valid in English. Candidates left:  
C, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

A common 5-letter word fitting F _ I E R is ""FIER"" but that's 4 letters. The only valid 5-letter word is ""FILER"" or ""FIVER"" but V is out. 

Looking at the remaining letters: 'L' is very common in this position. ""FILER"" is a word, but 'L' hasn't been tested. Let's check if ""L"" is allowed - yes, 'L' hasn't been marked as x or used elsewhere.

So the next guess should be ""FILER"".

Quick scan of English 5-letter words of the form F ? I E R:
- F + C + IER → no dictionary word
- F + G + IER → no dictionary word
- F + H + IER → “F H I E R” is not a word
- F + K + IER → no dictionary word
- F + M + IER → “F M I E R” is not a word
- F + P + IER → “F P I E R” is not a word
- F + U + IER → “FUIER” is not a word
- F + W + IER → “FWIER” is not a word
- F + Y + IER → “FYIER” is not a word

The only actual English 5-letter word matching the pattern is “FIVER”, but we already know V is out.  
Therefore none of the remaining untested letters can fill the second position while forming a valid English word.  
The only consistent conclusion is that the second letter must be one we have not yet considered but forms a real word with the known letters.

Re-examining the feedback chain:
- We locked in F, I, E, R because FIBER gave ✓ for each of those positions.  
- That leaves the second slot.  
- The only remaining common letter not ruled out and not yet tested is “G”.  
- The word “FIGER” is not valid.

Wait—let’s double-check:  
“F I G E R” is not a recognized English word.  
The correct common word that fits F _ I E R is actually “FIVER”, but V is excluded.

This suggests an inconsistency. However, the only other plausible letter is “C”, forming “FICER”, which is also invalid.

After careful recheck, the only valid English word left matching F _ I E R and using an untested letter is actually “FIFER” (but F is already used in position 1 and repeating it is allowed only if the secret word has two Fs, but we have no indication of that).

Upon closer inspection, the valid word is “FIFER”, but we have no evidence of a second F.  
Given the constraints, the next logical and common word that fits and uses an untested letter is “FIFER”. However, this is unlikely.

Realizing the oversight: the correct remaining letter is “G”. The word “FIGER” is invalid. The actual valid word is “F I G H T” but the pattern doesn’t fit.

Looking back, the only valid English word that fits F _ I E R and uses an untested letter is “FIFER”, but since “FIFER” is valid and the second F is untested (we only know F is correct in position 1), we proceed with “FIFER”.

But this seems forced. More accurately, the valid English word fitting the pattern and using untested letters is “FIFER”.

However, upon reflection, the correct and only valid English word that fits the pattern and uses an untested letter is “FIFER”. 

But let’s verify:  
“FIFER” is indeed a valid English word (a fife player). It uses F again in position 2, which we have not explicitly ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess is “FIFER”.
