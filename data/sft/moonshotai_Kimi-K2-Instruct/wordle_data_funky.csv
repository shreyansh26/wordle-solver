For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain by testing frequently occurring letters early. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some popular starting words in Wordle include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This should give me a lot of information about which vowels and consonants are in the word.

From the feedback so far:

- From UNTIL:  
  – U is in the word but not in position 1.  
  – N is in the word but not in position 2.  
  – T, I, L are absent.

So the secret word must:
- Contain U and N.  
- Not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L.  

Remaining common letters that are still allowed:  
Vowels: none left (only U is permitted).  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need 5-letter words using only these consonants plus the vowel U, with U and N present, and neither U in position 1 nor N in position 2.

A good candidate is “BUMPY”.
- Letters: B, U, M, P, Y — all allowed.  
- Contains U (position 2, allowed) and N is missing — oops, N is required.  Scratch that.

I need to keep both U and N.  
Consider “FUNNY”: but it has N in position 2 which is disallowed.

“JUNKY”:
- Letters: J, U, N, K, Y — all allowed.  
- Contains U (position 2) and N (position 3) — neither in their forbidden positions.  
- 5 letters, no repeats except N is allowed since feedback only told us letters, not counts.

Any other consonant (or vowel) is still possible.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain by testing frequently occurring letters early. 

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize letter coverage

Some popular starting words in Wordle include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This should give me a lot of information about which vowels and consonants are in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All the letters in AROSE—A, R, O, S, E—are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore the word is made up solely of letters not in {A, R, O, S, E}.

I need a new 5-letter word that avoids these five letters entirely.  
Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

A balanced choice that uses common letters from the remaining pool is “UNTIL”.  
It contains:
- U (vowel)
- N, T, I, L (all common, none excluded)

No letter overlaps with the banned set.

<guess>UNTIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- All letters in AROSE are absent.
- From UNTIL:  
  – U is in the word but not in position 1.  
  – N is in the word but not in position 2.  
  – T, I, L are absent.

So the secret word must:
- Contain U and N.  
- Not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L.  

Remaining common letters that are still allowed:  
Vowels: none left (only U is permitted).  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need 5-letter words using only these consonants plus the vowel U, with U and N present, and neither U in position 1 nor N in position 2.

A good candidate is “BUMPY”.
- Letters: B, U, M, P, Y — all allowed.  
- Contains U (position 2, allowed) and N is missing — oops, N is required.  Scratch that.

I need to keep both U and N.  
Consider “FUNNY”: but it has N in position 2 which is disallowed.

“JUNKY”:
- Letters: J, U, N, K, Y — all allowed.  
- Contains U (position 2) and N (position 3) — neither in their forbidden positions.  
- 5 letters, no repeats except N is allowed since feedback only told us letters, not counts.

Looks good.
