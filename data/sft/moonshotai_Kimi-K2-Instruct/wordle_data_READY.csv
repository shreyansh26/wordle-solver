- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the amount of information I get from the feedback. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

One such word is ""ARISE"" - it uses A, R, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good coverage to start deducing the secret word.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- A is in the word but not in position 1 → A appears somewhere in positions 2-5  
- R is in the word but not in position 2 → R appears somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5  
- I is NOT in the word → eliminate any word that contains I  
- S is NOT in the word → eliminate any word that contains S  
- E is in the word but not in position 5 → E appears somewhere in positions 1-4  

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Has no I and no S  
- Contains A (not in position 1)  
- Contains R (not in position 2)  
- Contains E (not in position 5)  

A word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters (like T, L, N, O) is ""TREAT"":
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)  
- E (known to be in word, now in position 3)  
- A (known to be in word, now in position 4)  
- T (new consonant again)  

Checking: positions of A, R, E are all different from first guess, and it uses no S or I.
