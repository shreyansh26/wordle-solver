Since this is the first guess, we have no information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and can help us quickly eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. 

Popular starting words often include vowels and common consonants. For example:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - all vowels except sometimes Y

I think a balanced approach is good. Let me choose a word that has 3 vowels and 2 common consonants. ""AUDIO"" is a strong starting word because it covers 4 vowels (A, U, I, O) and a consonant (D). This will help us quickly determine which vowels are in the word and in what positions.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is very popular and covers S, L, A, T, E - giving a good spread of common letters. 

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers some of the most common letters in English words (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This will give us decent information about these letters.

Wait, actually, let me reconsider - ""AROSE"" is also excellent as it has A, R, O, S, E - covering many common letters. 

But to maximize information, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters in 5-letter words.

2. Uses only letters we haven't ruled out yet (i.e., none of C,R,A,E,S,O,U,D)

Remaining commonly-used letters include: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting the pattern:
- N is in 1, 2, or 3
- No excluded letters

One high-value candidate is ""NIGHT"":
- N in position 1
- Uses G, H, I, T – none of which have been eliminated
- Good spread of common consonants and a vowel (I)

Another could be ""NYLON"", but ""Y"" and ""L"" are acceptable and N is in position 2.

But ""NIGHT"" is more straightforward and common, so I'll go with that.

The best strategy is to pick a word that contains common letters and can help us quickly eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. \n\nPopular starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

From the new feedback:

- N is in position 1 (✓).
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓).
- G is NOT in the word (x).
- H is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

So the word now looks like: N I _ _ _

Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, O, U, D, G  
Letters confirmed somewhere in the word: N, I, H, T  
Positions still unknown: 3, 4, 5  
Constraints:
- H must go in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 4).
- T must go in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 5).

The only way to satisfy both:
- T must go in position 3 or 4, H in the other of 3/5.

Possible patterns:
- N I T H _  → H would be in position 4 (invalid, because H can’t be in 4)
- N I T _ H  → T in 3, H in 5 (valid)
- N I H T _  → H in 3, T in 4 (valid)

So two possibilities remain:
1. N I T _ H  → missing letter must fit in position 4
2. N I H T _  → missing letter must fit in position 5

Let’s list 5-letter words fitting these patterns with letters not yet excluded.
Available letters: B, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

The valid word is “NIFTY” but that doesn’t fit H and T.

Wait, let me double-check. We have:
- N in 1 (fixed)
- I in 2 (fixed)
- H and T must be in 3,4,5 with constraints:
   - H not in 4
   - T not in 5

So the only valid placements are:
- N I H T _  (H in 3, T in 4, fifth letter any remaining valid letter)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I missed a letter or constraint.

Wait, let me re-examine available letters. We've excluded:
C, R, A, E, S, O, U, D, G

Letters used in guesses but not yet excluded:
From NIGHT: N, I, H, T are confirmed in word (positions partly known)
All other letters not yet used or excluded are available: B, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking again at possible words:
- N I T H _ – but H cannot be in 4, so N I T H _ is invalid
- N I _ T H – T in 4, H in 5
   - N I B T H – invalid
   - N I F T H – invalid
   - N I K T H – invalid
   - N I L T H – invalid
   - N I M T H – invalid
   - N I P T H – invalid
   - N I V T H – invalid
   - N I W T H – invalid
   - N I Y T H – invalid

- N I H _ T – H in 3, T in 5 (but T cannot be in 5)
- N I _ H T – H in 4 (invalid, H cannot be in 4)
- N I H T _ – H in 3, T in 4, fifth letter needed
   - NIHTB – no

   - NIHTL – no
   - NIHTM – no
   - NIHTP – no
   - NIHTV – no
   - NIHTW – no

This suggests there might be no valid words under these constraints, which can't be right. I must have missed an available letter or misapplied constraints.

Let me re-list exact constraints:
- Word: N I _ _ _
- Letters in word: N, I, H, T
- H not in 4
- T not in 5

Possible positions:
- H must be in 3 or 5
- T must be in 3 or 4

Therefore:
Case 1: H in 3, T in 4 → N I H T _
   - Fifth letter must be one not yet excluded and form valid word
   - Available letters: B, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - NIHTB – invalid
   - NIHTF – invalid
   - NIHTK – invalid
   - NIHTL – invalid (no such word)
   - NIHTM – invalid
   - NIHTP – invalid
   - NIHTV – invalid
   - NIHTW – invalid
   - NIHTY – invalid

Case 2: T in 3, H in 5 → N I T _ H
   - Fourth letter must be one not yet excluded
   - NITBH – invalid
   - NITFH – invalid
   - NITKH – invalid
   - NITLH – invalid
   - NITMH – invalid
   - NITPH – invalid
   - NITVH – invalid
   - NITWH – invalid
   - NITYH – invalid

This is puzzling. The only remaining possibility is that I have overlooked an allowed letter or misremembered exclusions.

Re-checking excluded letters: C,R,A,E,S,O,U,D,G. Correct.
Confirmed letters: N,I,H,T must be present.

Looking at actual word lists, the word ""NINTH"" comes to mind:
- N I N T H
   - N in 1 and 3: allowed, as N can repeat
   - I in 2
   - T in 4 (valid, T can't be in 5)
   - H in 5 (valid, H can't be in 4)
   - Letters: N,I,T,H – all confirmed

""NINTH"" fits all constraints perfectly.
