For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. The goal is to cover as many frequently used consonants and vowels as possible to quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word. 

After considering several options, ""SLATE"" comes to mind as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S: A very common consonant
- L: Another common consonant
- A: A very common vowel
- T: A frequently occurring consonant
- E: The most common vowel in English

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Feedback so far:
- L is in the word and is in the 2nd position.
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

That leaves us with:
- Fixed letter: L in position 2.
- S must appear somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1st).
- We can ignore A, T, E.

Good consonants still to test: R, N, B, C, D, G, etc.
Good vowels still to test: I, O, U.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps L in position 2.
2. Tests new common consonants and vowels.
3. Possibly places S in a new position.

Candidate words:
- BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P – tests new letters but might be too obscure.
- CLINK: C, L, I, N, K – also a bit obscure.
- FLING: F, L, I, N, G – common letters, good coverage.
- SLING: We already know S is somewhere in the word, and this would place it 1st (but feedback said S is not in 1st). So SLING is invalid because S cannot be 1st.
- CLIPS: C, L, I, P, S – but S is last here, which is allowed (since S is in the word but not 1st). This tests C, I, P, S in new positions.

""FLING"" seems strong because it tests F, I, N, G around the known L in position 2, and avoids S for now since we know it's not 1st and can be placed later.

But actually, to maximize information, maybe it's better to test S in a new position right away. ""CLIPS"" would place S in the 5th position, which is allowed. Also tests C, L, I, P.

However, ""FLING"" seems more straightforward with common letters. I'll go with ""FLING"".

- S must be placed at positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1st).
- Try S in position 3: _ L S _ _
- Remaining letters to pick from (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, W, Y.
- Choose common consonant-vowel-consonant endings. A good, common pattern is C L O S E, but E is banned.  
- Try C L O S K? “CLOSK” not a word.
- Try P L O S H? “PLOSH” uncommon.
- Try C L O S H? Not a word.
- Try S in position 4 instead: _ L _ S _
- Common pattern: B L O S S? “BLOSS” not valid.
- Try S in position 5: _ L _ _ S
- First letter: C? O? U? R?
- C L U B S – uses C, U, B and places S in 5th, all letters fresh and common.
- R L U C S – not a word.
- C L U B S is the best I can see.

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E, F, I, N, G.
3. Letters we know ARE in the word somewhere: S.
4. Letters we haven’t tested yet (common ones): B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, W, Y.

Word constraints:
- Position 2 = L
- S must appear once somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since feedback on SLATE said S is in the word but not in position 1).
- No A, T, E, F, I, N, G anywhere else.

I want a word that:
- Keeps L in position 2.
- Places S in a new, allowable spot.
- Uses fresh, common consonants/vowels to learn more.

Candidate word built step-by-step:
- L is fixed at position 2: _ L _ _ _
- S must be placed at positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1st).
- Try S in position 3: _ L S _ _
- Remaining letters to pick from (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, R, U, W, Y.
- Choose common consonant-vowel-consonant endings. A good, common pattern is C L O S E, but E is banned.  
- Try C L O S K? “CLOSK” not a word.
- Try P L O S H? “PLOSH” uncommon.
- Try C L O S H? Not a word.
- Try S in position 4 instead: _ L _ S _
- Common pattern: B L O S S? “BLOSS” not valid.
- Try S in position 5: _ L _ _ S
- First letter: C? O? U? R?
- C L U B S – uses C, U, B and places S in 5th, all letters fresh and common.
- R L U C S – not a word.
- C L U B S is the best I can see.

Let me double-check:
- C – not yet tested.
- L – required at 2nd.
- U – not yet tested.
- B – not yet tested.
- S – required (and allowed at 5th, since earlier feedback only ruled out 1st).

“CLUBS” fits all constraints.

Current status:
- Position 2 is definitely L.
- S must appear somewhere (not position 1, and now feedback shows it’s not position 5 either), so S is in position 3 or 4.
- U is in the word, but we don’t yet know its position.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, T, E, F, I, N, G, C, B.
- Remaining untested common letters: D, H, K, M, O, P, R, W, Y.

We know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- S must be in position 3 or 4.
- U must appear once (not yet placed).

Let’s test S in position 3:
- _ L S _ _
- U must fit in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, 5).
- Try U in position 1: U L S _ _
- Need two more letters from allowed set (D, H, K, M, O, P, R, W, Y).
- Common word: “ULSER” – not valid (not a real word).
- “ULS… ” – nothing common.

Try U in position 4:
- _ L S U _
- First letter: D, H, K, M, O, P, R, W, Y.
- “PLUSH” – P, L, S, U, H – all allowed letters, common word.
- Check constraints:
  - L is 2nd – ✓
  - S is 3rd – allowed (feedback on SLATE ruled out 1st, and on CLUBS ruled out 5th, so 3rd or 4th – 3rd is fine).
  - U is 4th – allowed (we only know U is in word, not position).
  - P and H are new letters, both allowed.

“PLUSH” seems perfect.
