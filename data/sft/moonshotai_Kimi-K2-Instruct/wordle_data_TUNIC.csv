Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include several vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

Other good starting options might include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid choice for maximizing information gain.

The feedback from the first guess tells us that none of the letters A, R, O, S, or E are in the secret word.  
Therefore, we must choose a word that avoids all of these letters.

Common 5-letter words that have none of A, R, O, S, or E include:
- TUMID
- LUNGI
- NYMPH
- THUMB
- QUICK
- BLUNT
- CHIMP
- DUMPY

Among these, ""BLUNT"" is short, easy to remember, and contains a good mix of consonants plus the vowel U, which wasn’t tested yet. It’s also a valid English word.

From the first two guesses we know:

Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, S, E, B, L  
Letters **that are in the word** but whose positions are unknown: U, N, T  

So every remaining letter must use only the pool {U, N, T} plus any other letters **not** already ruled out.  
To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Contains U, N, T (to confirm their positions or reveal new ones)
2. Introduces new, common letters we haven’t tested (e.g., C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, Y, etc.)
3. Uses none of the already-eliminated letters.

Looking at 5-letter words satisfying those constraints, ""UNFIT"" fits perfectly:
- It uses U, N, T.
- It adds F and I, which haven’t appeared yet.
- It avoids every letter we know is absent.

Therefore, UNFIT is an excellent third guess.

What we know so far:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, E, B, L, F

2. Letters **confirmed in the word** (but positions still unknown except for I):  
   U, N, T, I  
   (I is in position 4)

3. Positional constraints from UNFIT:  
   - U is in the word but not in position 1  
   - N is in the word but not in position 2  
   - T is in the word but not in position 5  
   - I is in the word **and** in position 4 (✓)

4. Remaining unused common letters: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses I in position 4  
- Uses U, N, T (but not in their disallowed positions)  
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E, B, L, F  
- Adds one new letter to narrow down possibilities

Looking at possible arrangements:
- _ _ _ I _ where 4th letter is I  
- U must be in positions 2, 3, or 5  
- N must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is I, so 1, 3, or 5)  
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is I, so 1, 2, or 3)

Let’s try to place:
- I fixed at position 4  
- T in position 3 (since it can’t be 5)  
- U in position 2 or 5  
- N in remaining spot

Possible combinations:
1. N U T I _  
   - Last letter must be unused (not A,R,O,S,E,B,L,F) → could be C,D,G,H,K,M,P,V,W,Y  
   - ""NUTIC"" isn’t valid, but ""NUTID"" isn’t either.  
   - Actually ""NUTID"" is invalid - no dictionary word.  

2. _ U T I N  
   - First letter must be unused. Could be C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
   - ""CUTIN"" is a valid word (biological term for skin layer)  
   - ""DUTIN"", ""GUTIN"" not valid  
   - ""HUTIN"" not valid  
   - ""MUTIN"" is archaic spelling of ""mutiny"" but not common  
   - ""PUTIN"" is a proper noun (invalid)  
   - ""CUTIN"" seems best

3. _ N T I U  
   - ""CNTIU"" invalid  
   - Doesn't form words

4. T _ N I U  
   - ""TUNIU"" invalid

5. T U N I _  
   - ""TUNIC"" is valid! Uses all required letters and adds C.

Between ""CUTIN"" and ""TUNIC"", both are valid, but ""TUNIC"" is more common and fits perfectly:
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)

<guess>TUNIC</guess>",TUNIC,"What we know so far:

1. Letters **not** in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, E, B, L, F

2. Letters **confirmed in the word** (but positions still unknown except for I):  
   U, N, T, I  
   (I is in position 4)

3. Positional constraints from UNFIT:  
   - U is in the word but not in position 1  
   - N is in the word but not in position 2  
   - T is in the word but not in position 5  
   - I is in the word **and** in position 4 (✓)

4. Remaining unused common letters: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses I in position 4  
- Uses U, N, T (but not in their disallowed positions)  
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E, B, L, F  
- Adds one new letter to narrow down possibilities

Looking at possible arrangements:
- _ _ _ I _ where 4th letter is I  
- U must be in positions 2, 3, or 5  
- N must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is I, so 1, 3, or 5)  
- T must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is I, so 1, 2, or 3)

Let’s try to place:
- I fixed at position 4  
- T in position 3 (since it can’t be 5)  
- U in position 2 or 5  
- N in remaining spot

Possible combinations:
1. N U T I _  
   - Last letter must be unused (not A,R,O,S,E,B,L,F) → could be C,D,G,H,K,M,P,V,W,Y  
   - ""NUTIC"" isn’t valid, but ""NUTID"" isn’t either.  
   - Actually ""NUTID"" is invalid - no dictionary word.  

2. _ U T I N  
   - First letter must be unused. Could be C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
   - ""CUTIN"" is a valid word (biological term for skin layer)  
   - ""DUTIN"", ""GUTIN"" not valid  
   - ""HUTIN"" not valid  
   - ""MUTIN"" is archaic spelling of ""mutiny"" but not common  
   - ""PUTIN"" is a proper noun (invalid)  
   - ""CUTIN"" seems best

3. _ N T I U  
   - ""CNTIU"" invalid  
   - Doesn't form words

4. T _ N I U  
   - ""TUNIU"" invalid

5. T U N I _  
   - ""TUNIC"" is valid! Uses all required letters and adds C.

Between ""CUTIN"" and ""TUNIC"", both are valid, but ""TUNIC"" is more common and fits perfectly:
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- U in position 2 (allowed)  
- N in position 3 (allowed - wasn't disallowed here)  
- I in position 4 (correct)  
- C new letter  
No letters from excluded set",Guess 4: TUNIC -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
