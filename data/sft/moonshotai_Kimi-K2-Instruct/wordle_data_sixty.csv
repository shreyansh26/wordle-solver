As this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. Therefore, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage
4. Be a valid word that can eliminate many possibilities

Common strategic starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)
- SLATE (test common consonants with vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common letters)
- RAISE (tests multiple common letters)

I think ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- R is very common in English
- A and I are common vowels
- S and E are also very frequent letters
- Together, these letters appear in many 5-letter words
- No duplicate letters, so we get feedback on 5 unique letters

This should give us good information about which directions to explore next.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
R, A, E, P, O, N, H, L

Letters that ARE in the word:  
I (position 2 confirmed), T (position 4 confirmed), S (in the word but not position 5)

Thus, the secret word has the form:  
_ I _ T _  

and must contain S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Letters still available (never tested or not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus any already-known letters S, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and T in position 4  
- Contains S exactly once (and not in position 5)  
- Uses only the allowed letters

Possible forms:  
S I _ T _  
_ I S T _  
_ I _ T S

Looking at English 5-letter words that fit these patterns and contain only allowed letters, two good candidates emerge:

1. FISTS  (but S is duplicated and one S would be forced into position 5 which is disallowed) → invalid
2. WISTS  (same duplicate-S issue) → invalid
3. MISTY  (Y is allowed, T is already in position 4, S position 3) → positions: _ I S T _ but we only have 4 letters and need one more.
   Actually MISTY is M I S T Y → positions: 1=M, 2=I, 3=S, 4=T, 5=Y  
   Check constraints:
   - I is in position 2 ✓
   - T is in position 4 ✓
   - S is in the word (position 3) and not in position 5 ✓
   - All letters (M, I, S, T, Y) are allowed (M, Y never tested; I,S,T already known good)

MISTY is valid and should help confirm whether M or Y appear.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Therefore, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage
4. Be a valid word that can eliminate many possibilities

Common strategic starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)
- SLATE (test common consonants with vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common letters)
- RAISE (tests multiple common letters)

I think ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- R is very common in English
- A and I are common vowels
- S and E are also very frequent letters
- Together, these letters appear in many 5-letter words
- No duplicate letters, so we get feedback on 5 unique letters

This should give us good information about which directions to explore next.

- R(x): R is **not** in the word.

- I(-): I is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word, but **not** in position 4.
- E(x): E is **not** in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains I and S, but not in their prior positions.
- The word has no R, A, or E at all.
- We still have to test other common letters.

A good second guess should:
1. Re-use I and S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (like O, U, N, T, L, etc.).
3. Avoid the eliminated letters R, A, E.

A word like “POINT” fits these criteria:
- Uses new letters P, O, N, T (none of which have been tested).
- Places I in position 3 (still possible since I is allowed in positions 1,2,4,5).
- Places S in position 5 (allowed).

So I’ll try POINT next.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   R, A, E, P, O, N, H, L, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   I is in position 2 (✓)  
   T is in position 4 (✓)  
   S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from S(-) in MISTY)  
   Y is in the word (✓ from MISTY) and, since only one letter is still missing, must be in position 5 (because positions 2 and 4 are already taken by I and T, and S is excluded from positions 3 & 5).  

3. Therefore the word has the fixed pattern:  
   _ I _ T Y  

4. We now need a single consonant for position 1 or 3.  
   Allowed, still-untested consonants include:  
   B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

5. S must appear exactly once and can only go in position 1 or 3.  
   - Position 1: S I _ T Y  → needs a letter in position 3.  
   - Position 3: _ I S T Y  → needs a letter in position 1.  

Let’s list 5-letter English words that fit:

- S I _ T Y → “SICTY”, “SIFTY”, “SIGHT”, “SILTY” … none are valid.  
- _ I S T Y → “BISTY”, “CISTY”, “FISTY”, “GISTY”, “WISTY” … most are invalid except “WISTY” (but W is still allowed).  

However “WISTY” duplicates Y in position 5, which is already filled by Y, so that’s not possible. The only valid candidate that remains is:

F I S T Y → but F, I, S, T, Y all fit constraints.  
Check letters: F (never tested), I✓, S (allowed position 3), T✓, Y✓.  
This satisfies every constraint.

Hence the next (and logically forced) guess is FISTY, but since Y is already confirmed in position 5 and we have _ I S T Y, the only exact match left is:

“FISTY” is indeed the word we are seeking, but to confirm, we will play it as the final guess.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   R, A, E, P, O, N, H, L, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   I is in position 2 (✓)  
   T is in position 4 (✓)  
   S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from S(-) in MISTY)  
   Y is in the word (✓ from MISTY) and, since only one letter is still missing, must be in position 5 (because positions 2 and 4 are already taken by I and T, and S is excluded from positions 3 & 5).  

3. Therefore the word has the fixed pattern:  
   _ I _ T Y  

4. We now need a single consonant for position 1 or 3.  
   Allowed, still-untested consonants include:  
   B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

5. S must appear exactly once and can only go in position 1 or 3.  
   - Position 1: S I _ T Y  → needs a letter in position 3.  
   - Position 3: _ I S T Y  → needs a letter in position 1.  

Let’s list 5-letter English words that fit:

- S I _ T Y → “SICTY”, “SIFTY”, “SIGHT”, “SILTY” … none are valid.  
- _ I S T Y → “BISTY”, “CISTY”, “FISTY”, “GISTY”, “WISTY” … most are invalid except “WISTY” (but W is still allowed).  

However “WISTY” duplicates Y in position 5, which is already filled by Y, so that’s not possible. The only valid candidate that remains is:

F I S T Y → but F, I, S, T, Y all fit constraints.  
Check letters: F (never tested), I✓, S (allowed position 3), T✓, Y✓.  
This satisfies every constraint.

Hence the next (and logically forced) guess is FISTY, but since Y is already confirmed in position 5 and we have _ I S T Y, the only exact match left is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>As this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. Therefore, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Include a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoid duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage
4. Be a valid word that can eliminate many possibilities

Common strategic starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)
- SLATE (test common consonants with vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common letters)
- RAISE (tests multiple common letters)

I think ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- R is very common in English
- A and I are common vowels
- S and E are also very frequent letters
- Together, these letters appear in many 5-letter words
- No duplicate letters, so we get feedback on 5 unique letters

This should give us good information about which directions to explore next.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x): R is **not** in the word.
- A(x): A is **not** in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- S(-): S is in the word, but **not** in position 4.
- E(x): E is **not** in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains I and S, but not in their prior positions.
- The word has no R, A, or E at all.
- We still have to test other common letters.

A good second guess should:
1. Re-use I and S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (like O, U, N, T, L, etc.).
3. Avoid the eliminated letters R, A, E.

A word like “POINT” fits these criteria:
- Uses new letters P, O, N, T (none of which have been tested).
- Places I in position 3 (still possible since I is allowed in positions 1,2,4,5).
- Places S in position 5 (allowed).

So I’ll try POINT next.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the secret word:  
R, A, E, P, O, N

Letters that ARE in the secret word:  
I, S, T (but their positions are still uncertain)

Additional constraints:
- I cannot be in position 3 (from RAISE feedback)  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from RAISE feedback)  
- T cannot be in position 5 (from POINT feedback)

Remaining common unused letters to test:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and S (and possibly T)  
2. Does NOT contain the eliminated letters  
3. Places I, S, T in allowed positions  
4. Uses some new consonants to narrow the search

A promising candidate is “LISTY” (though Y is uncommon).  
A better choice is “WHIST” – it contains I, S, T and only new letters (W and H), and respects all positional constraints:
- W: untested
- H: untested
- I: position 2 (allowed)
- S: position 3 (allowed, since S was banned from position 4)
- T: position 5 (banned from position 5 by POINT feedback) → FAIL

Next candidate: “TWIST”
- T: position 1 (allowed)
- W: new letter
- I: position 3 (banned) → FAIL

Candidate: “HILTS”
- H: new
- I: position 2 (allowed)
- L: new
- T: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (allowed)

All constraints satisfied.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
R, A, E, P, O, N, H, L

Letters that ARE in the word:  
I (position 2 confirmed), T (position 4 confirmed), S (in the word but not position 5)

Thus, the secret word has the form:  
_ I _ T _  

and must contain S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Letters still available (never tested or not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus any already-known letters S, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and T in position 4  
- Contains S exactly once (and not in position 5)  
- Uses only the allowed letters

Possible forms:  
S I _ T _  
_ I S T _  
_ I _ T S

Looking at English 5-letter words that fit these patterns and contain only allowed letters, two good candidates emerge:

1. FISTS  (but S is duplicated and one S would be forced into position 5 which is disallowed) → invalid
2. WISTS  (same duplicate-S issue) → invalid
3. MISTY  (Y is allowed, T is already in position 4, S position 3) → positions: _ I S T _ but we only have 4 letters and need one more.
   Actually MISTY is M I S T Y → positions: 1=M, 2=I, 3=S, 4=T, 5=Y  
   Check constraints:
   - I is in position 2 ✓
   - T is in position 4 ✓
   - S is in the word (position 3) and not in position 5 ✓
   - All letters (M, I, S, T, Y) are allowed (M, Y never tested; I,S,T already known good)

MISTY is valid and should help confirm whether M or Y appear.
