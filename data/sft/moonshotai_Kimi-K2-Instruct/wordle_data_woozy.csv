For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, since we have no prior information about the secret word, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable. Let me choose ""AROSE"" as it gives good coverage of common letters.

FOLLY is a good choice as it introduces F and L, and keeps Y.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,woozy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, since we have no prior information about the secret word, any valid 5-letter word is acceptable. Let me choose ""AROSE"" as it gives good coverage of common letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.

- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the target word has the pattern: _ _ O _ _.  
Letters we have ruled out so far: A, R, S, E.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Has other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate: “POINT” – it keeps O in the third position and introduces P, I, N, T (none of which have been ruled out).

4. We need two more consonants plus U to form a valid 5-letter word with pattern: _ _ O _ _.

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ that avoid all eliminated letters (A,R,S,E,P,I,N,T) and use remaining frequent letters. Remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Candidate words:
– MOUTH (M, U, T, H) – but T is already eliminated.
– COUGH – C, U, G, H – none of these letters have been ruled out.

COUGH keeps O in position 3 and uses entirely new letters.

From the feedback so far we now know:

- Position 3 = O (✓)
- Position 5 = Y (✓)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, G, H, F, L

This leaves only a small set of un-tested letters: B, D, K, M, V, W, Z plus the already-placed O and Y.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ _ O _ Y

Possible remaining letters for positions 1, 2, and 4:
B, D, K, M, V, W, Z

Scanning common 5-letter words ending in O _ Y:

- BLOWY – contains L (eliminated)
- DOWDY – D, W, D; fits D _ O _ Y → D O W D Y? Doesn’t fit _ _ O _ Y.
- WOOZY – O is already in position 3, can’t be in position 2 or 4. Besides, double O would conflict with position 3 already being O.
- MOGGY – contains G, eliminated
- BOBBY – contains B, B, B; but pattern must be _ _ O _ Y → B O B B Y? Doesn’t fit because positions 1,2,4 must all be from {B,D,K,M,V,W,Z}. B O B B Y has B in position 4 which is fine, but we need to test unknown letters.
- BOBBY fits: B _ O _ Y → B O B B Y, but position 4 must be from remaining letters. B is still available.

Let me list all possible combinations of remaining letters for positions 1, 2, 4:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters available: B,D,K,M,V,W,Z for positions 1,2,4.

Possible words:
- B O B B Y – B, O, B, B, Y → but we have B available and it is a valid word.
- D O O M Y – but O can’t be in position 4 because position 3 is already O and we don’t know yet about double letters.
- M O O D Y – again double O is unlikely given position 3 is already O.
- B O N K Y – N is eliminated.
- B O D G Y – G is eliminated.
- W O O D Y – W is available, O already used in position 3, so position 4 D is possible: W O D Y – but needs 5 letters, W O O D Y has double O.
- B O D Y – too short.
- B O N Y – too short.

Actually, looking carefully, the only common 5-letter word fitting _ _ O _ Y with remaining letters is BOBBY (B O B B Y). 

Let me check:
- B: not eliminated
- O: locked in position 3

What we now know:

- Positions fixed:  
  3 = O  
  5 = Y  

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all (eliminated so far):  
  A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, G, H, F, L, B  

- Remaining unused letters (from the standard alphabet) that could still appear in positions 1, 2, or 4:  
  D, K, M, V, W, Z, J, Q, X – but we want a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a word of the pattern: _ _ O _ Y

Let’s list the common English words that fit _ _ O _ Y and contain only the remaining letters (D, K, M, V, W, Z). Scanning mentally:

- DOWDY – letters: D, O, W, D, Y → D and W not eliminated → fits pattern D(1) O(3) W(4) Y(5).  
- MOODY – M, O, O, D, Y → O is already in position 3, so O can’t appear again unless the word allows double O. Moody fits M(1) O(3) O(4) Y(5), but position 4 would be O which hasn’t been eliminated (it was only position 3 confirmed).  
- VOGUE – letters: V, O, G, U, E – but G, U, E are eliminated.  
- WOOZY – W, O, O, Z, Y – fits W(1) O(3) O(4) Z(5) Y(5).  
- ZOOID – letters Z, O, O, I, D – I is eliminated.  

Looking at the constraints:

From remaining letters, the only valid words are DOWDY and MOODY and WOOZY.  
Between them, DOWDY and WOOZY both use letters not yet tried. Since DOWDY uses D twice and W once, and WOOZY uses W, O, Z, Y – with W and Z new.

Let me pick DOWDY because it covers D and W which are new.

But wait – pattern is _ _ O _ Y, so:

DOWDY → D O W D Y → positions 1=D, 2=O? No, pattern is 1,2,4 letters unknown. So for DOWDY:
Positions: 1=D, 2=O (but position 2 must be from remaining letters, D is allowed as 1 and 4.

Actually, let's check:

DOWDY:
1: D (new letter)
2: O (already fixed at position 3)
3: W (but position 3 is O, so this doesn't fit.)

I had the positions mixed up. The correct pattern is:

Positions: 1, 2, 4 must be from remaining letters; 3 is O, 5 is Y.

So valid word must be: X Y O Z Y where X, Y, Z are from remaining letters.

Re-evaluate:

Valid words ending in O _ Y:

Looking at the dictionary, the only common 5-letter word ending in O _ Y that fits and uses remaining letters is ""DOOMY"" (though rare) or ""DOWDY"" (but DOWDY is D O W D Y – positions 1=D, 2=O, 3=W, 4=D, 5=Y – which doesn't fit _ _ O _ Y).

Actually, the correct pattern is positions 1, 2, 4 unknown, position 3 is O, position 5 is Y.

So word is: 1 2 O 4 Y.

With letters left: D, K, M, V, W, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words of this exact form:

- DOOMY: D O O M Y – fits 1=D, 2=O, 4=M → O is in position 3, so this doesn't fit because position 2 would be O which is not allowed (position 3 is O, position 2 unknown must be from remaining letters).  
- VROOM – V R O O M – R is eliminated.  
- DOWDY – D O W D Y – positions 1=D, 2=O (but position 3 is O, so position 2 can't be O unless word has double O).  

The only actual 5-letter common word that fits _ _ O _ Y with remaining letters is ""DOWDY"" if we allow position 2 to be O, but that's unlikely.

Recheck: possible combinations:

1 2 O 4 Y with letters D, K, M, V, W, Z.

Possible combinations:

- D K O M Y → ""DKOMY"" – not a word.  
- D M O W Y – ""DMOWY"" – not a word.  
- M D O W Y – ""MDOWY"" – not a word.  
- D W O M Y – ""DWOMY"" – not a word.  

Realizing that ""DOWDY"" is actually D O W D Y – positions are 1=D, 2=O, 3=W, 4=D, 5=Y – which does not fit our fixed pattern _ _ O _ Y.

I realize now that the only valid 5-letter word I can find that fits _ _ O _ Y with remaining letters is ""MOODY"" (M O O D Y). It has M as position 1, O as position 2, O as position 3 (allowed to repeat), D as position 4, Y as position 5.

Given the constraints, this is the only plausible word.

So, the guess is MOODY.
