For the first guess, we want to maximize information about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities early.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A well-chosen starting word uses these letters effectively without repeating any.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, CRANE is excellent because:
1. Contains 5 distinct letters
2. Includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E)
3. Covers both vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)
4. Has been statistically shown to perform well in Wordle

So I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE we know:

- C is NOT in the word (x)  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)  
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains R, A, and N, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in CRANE.  
We also know the word has no C or E.

Letters we can rule out: C, E  
Letters we know are present: R, A, N  
Positions ruled out:  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- A cannot be in position 3  
- N cannot be in position 4  

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses R, A, N in new positions (and doesn’t repeat any of them in the forbidden spots).  
2. Does not use C or E.  
3. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Good candidates:  
- TRAIN – uses T, R, A, I, N. R moves to position 2 (forbidden), so skip.  
- RANID – obscure, not ideal.  
- DRAIN – D, R, A, I, N. R in position 2 (forbidden), skip.  
- GRAIN – G, R, A, I, N. R in position 2 (forbidden), skip.  
- BRAUN – B, R, A, U, N. R in position 2 (forbidden), skip.

Let’s pick a word that shifts all three known letters to new positions and introduces fresh consonants.

A good choice is RADIO:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since forbidden was position 2).  
- A is now in position 2 (allowed, forbidden was position 3).  
- D and I are new letters.  
- O is new.  
- N is missing, but we can test N again in a later guess if needed.

However, RADIO doesn’t include N, and we know N is present. So we must include N.

A better choice is RANTS:
- R in position 1 (allowed).  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- N in position 3 (allowed, forbidden was position 4).  
- T and S are new letters.

  - A S N R _ – S at 2 is allowed, A at 1 is allowed → ASN R? Need a valid word ending.  
    ASNRA? Not a word. ASNR_? ASNRK? Not valid.

- If R is at 5, then A can be at 1 or 4, and S must be at 1, 2, or 4  
  - A S N _ R – S at 2 is allowed, A at 1 is allowed → ASN _R → need a letter at 4  
    Valid word: A S N A R? Not valid. A S N D R? ASNDR? No.  
    A S N I R? ASNIR – no.  
    A S N U R? ASNUR – no.

  - S A N _ R – A at 2 is forbidden (from RANTS feedback) → skip  
  - S _ N _ R – A could be at 4 → S _ N A R → need a letter at 2  
    S U N A R – valid word!

Let’s verify SUNAR – not a valid English word.

  - S _ N _ R → S I N A R – SINAR is not valid.  
  - S O N A R – SONAR is valid!  
    Check constraints:  
    - N is at 3 (✓)  
    - R is at 5 (allowed, not ruled out)  
    - A is at 4 (allowed, not ruled out)  
    - S is at 1 (allowed, not ruled out)  
    - O is a new letter (allowed)  

SONAR fits all constraints and is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: SONAR -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
