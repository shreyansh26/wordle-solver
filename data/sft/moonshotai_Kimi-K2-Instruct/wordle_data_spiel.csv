For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly gather information about which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" follow this strategy. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses all 5 very common letters and all vowels except U.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it’s not the 4th letter).
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it’s not the 5th letter).

So the word contains both S and E, but neither is in their original positions. The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Next guess: I want to keep using common letters while avoiding A, R, O. A good choice would include S and E in new positions, plus common remaining consonants like T, N, L, etc. I’ll try a word like “STEIN” or “SLEET” but “STEIN” repeats no letters and uses I and N, which are common. However, E is already confirmed so let’s place E in position 2 and S elsewhere. Maybe “TENSE”? Wait, T is good, N is good, E is confirmed, S is confirmed. Let’s try a word that moves S to position 1 and E to position 2: “SPELT”? No, P is okay but L is fine. Actually, “TENSE” is better: T, E, N, S, E – but that repeats E. Let’s avoid repeats. “LINES”? L, I, N, E, S. This uses S and E in new positions (S is now 5th, E is 4th), plus common consonants L, I, N. And avoids A, R, O.

- S cannot be in position 4 or 5  

So far:
_ _ _ E _   (E locked)
We must place I, L, S in the remaining four slots, plus one new letter.

Letters never yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Goal: pick a valid 5-letter word that
- keeps E in 4th
- uses I, L, S in allowable spots
- adds one unused consonant

Possible placements:
- S must be in 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- I must avoid 2
- L must avoid 1

Let’s try S in position 1:
S _ _ E _

Now we need to fit I and L in positions 2 and 3, plus one new letter (5th).  
We need a common unused consonant that fits.

Try S, I, L in 1-2-3 and pick a new letter for 5:

“SILEX” is valid (a type of silica or old flint material).

SILEX:

Try S in 2:

L must go to 5.  
Word becomes PSIEL – invalid.

Try L in 3:

Need a 5th letter. Try unused letter D: ISLED – valid past tense of “isle”.

ISLED fits:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" follow this strategy. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses all 5 very common letters and all vowels except U.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it’s not the 4th letter).
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it’s not the 5th letter).

So the word contains both S and E, but neither is in their original positions. The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Next guess: I want to keep using common letters while avoiding A, R, O. A good choice would include S and E in new positions, plus common remaining consonants like T, N, L, etc. I’ll try a word like “STEIN” or “SLEET” but “STEIN” repeats no letters and uses I and N, which are common.

- N(x) → N is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is correct in the 4th position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but is not the fifth letter.

2. Letters confirmed in the word: E (position 4), L, I, S.
3. S cannot be in position 4 or 5 (it was 4th in AROSE and 5th in LINES).

5. I cannot be in position 2 (it was second in LINES).

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed ones.

We still need to place L, I, S and E is locked in slot 4. A sensible next step is to test positions for S and L while keeping I away from position 2.

Try a word that:

- S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (or 2 from ISLED feedback? Actually, in ISLED, S was 2nd and got (-), so S is not in position 2 either.  
  So S is not in positions 2, 4, 5 → only possible in 1 or 3)  

So the word must be of the form:

Available slots: 1, 2, 3, 5  
We must place I, L, S in three of these four slots, plus one unused letter.

Unused consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Let's list the remaining constraints explicitly:

- I: allowed positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2)  
- L: allowed positions 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3)  
- S: allowed positions 1 or 3 (cannot be 2, 4, 5)  

We need to fit I, L, S and one more letter (call it X) into the four free slots 1,2,3,5.

Possible assignments:

SLICE is a valid English word.

Let’s check if this fits all previous feedback:
- Previous feedback: S(-) in 1st (from ISLED 4th guess: S is 2nd and got “-”, so S is not at 2. Putting S at 1 is fine.)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,spiel,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly gather information about which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" follow this strategy. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses all 5 very common letters and all vowels except U.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it’s not the 4th letter).
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it’s not the 5th letter).

So the word contains both S and E, but neither is in their original positions. The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Next guess: I want to keep using common letters while avoiding A, R, O. A good choice would include S and E in new positions, plus common remaining consonants like T, N, L, etc. I’ll try a word like “STEIN” or “SLEET” but “STEIN” repeats no letters and uses I and N, which are common. However, E is already confirmed so let’s place E in position 2 and S elsewhere. Maybe “TENSE”? Wait, T is good, N is good, E is confirmed, S is confirmed. Let’s try a word that moves S to position 1 and E to position 2: “SPELT”? No, P is okay but L is fine. Actually, “TENSE” is better: T, E, N, S, E – but that repeats E. Let’s avoid repeats. “LINES”? L, I, N, E, S. This uses S and E in new positions (S is now 5th, E is 4th), plus common consonants L, I, N. And avoids A, R, O.

Yes, let’s go with LINES.

<guess>LINES</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: LINES -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback on LINES:

- L(-) → L is in the word but is not the first letter.
- I(-) → I is in the word but is not the second letter.
- N(x) → N is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is correct in the 4th position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but is not the fifth letter.

So far we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N.
2. Letters confirmed in the word: E (position 4), L, I, S.
3. S cannot be in position 4 or 5 (it was 4th in AROSE and 5th in LINES).
4. L cannot be in position 1 (it was first in LINES).
5. I cannot be in position 2 (it was second in LINES).

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed ones.

We still need to place L, I, S and E is locked in slot 4. A sensible next step is to test positions for S and L while keeping I away from position 2.

Try a word that:
- Has E in 4th spot.
- Moves S to position 2 or 3.
- Moves L to position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).
- Introduces a new consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

A convenient candidate: “WILES”.
- W (new letter)
- I (allowed, not position 2)
- L (allowed, not position 1)
- E ✓ (position 4)
- S (allowed, not position 5)

Constraints:
- I cannot be in position 2  
- L cannot be in position 1  
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5  

So far:
_ _ _ E _   (E locked)
We must place I, L, S in the remaining four slots, plus one new letter.

Letters never yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

Goal: pick a valid 5-letter word that
- keeps E in 4th
- uses I, L, S in allowable spots
- adds one unused consonant

Possible placements:
- S must be in 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- I must avoid 2
- L must avoid 1

Let’s try S in position 1:
S _ _ E _

Now we need to fit I and L in positions 2 and 3, plus one new letter (5th).  
We need a common unused consonant that fits.

Try S, I, L in 1-2-3 and pick a new letter for 5:
S I L E ?  
Need a 5th letter. A quick scan gives B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, T…  
“SILET” is not a valid English word.  
“SILED” is archaic.  
“SILEX” is valid (a type of silica or old flint material).

SILEX:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (forbidden) → violation.

Try S in 2:
_ S _ E _

Then I must be 1 or 3 (cannot be 2), L must be 3 or 5 (cannot be 1).

Quick word: P (new letter) in 1, S in 2, I in 3:
P S I E ?  
L must go to 5.  
Word becomes PSIEL – invalid.

Try L in 3:
_ S L E _

Now I must go to 1 or 5 (but 5 is last and E is at 4, so I at 1):

I S L E ?  
Need a 5th letter. Try unused letter D: ISLED – valid past tense of “isle”.

ISLED fits:
I 1, S 2, L 3, E 4, D 5  
Checks all constraints:
- I not at 2 ✔  
- L not at 1 ✔  
- S not at 4 or 5 ✔  
- No banned letters ✔  
- All required letters present (I, L, S, E) plus new letter D which is unused.

Therefore, ISLED is a valid next guess.

Current known facts:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, N, W, D, C  
Letters confirmed in the word: S (position 1), I (position 3), E (position 4)  
Letters confirmed in the word somewhere: L (but not in position 2)  

So the word structure is: S _ I _ _  
E is already at position 4, so the word must be: S _ I E _  

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has I at 3, E at 4, and ends with a letter not yet ruled out. The remaining letters must come from: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.  

We also know L is in the word but cannot be in position 2 (from SLICE feedback: L(-) at position 2), so L must be in position 5.  

Thus the word must be: S _ I E L  

The only missing letter is at position 2. It must be a letter not yet used (from the allowed list above) and form a valid English word.  

Let’s check possible letters for position 2:  
- B: SBIEL – not a word  
- F: SFIEL – not a word  
- G: SGIEL – not a word  
- H: SHIEL – valid (Scottish word for ""hut"")  
- J: SJIEL – not a word  
- K: SKIEL – not a word  
- M: SMILE – valid word  
- P: SPIEL – valid word  
- T: STILE – valid word  
- V: SVIEL – not a word  

The valid candidates are: SHIEL, SMILE, SPIEL, STILE.  

We need to choose one that fits all constraints. Let’s pick SMILE first as it’s common.  

Check constraints:
- Starts with S (position 1) ✓  
- Position 2: M (new letter, not ruled out) ✓  
- Position 3: I ✓  
- Position 4: E ✓  
- Position 5: L (must be here since L cannot be in position 2) ✓  

SMILE is a valid word and fits all constraints.
