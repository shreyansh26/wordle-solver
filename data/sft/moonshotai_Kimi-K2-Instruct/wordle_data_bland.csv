For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good spread of common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. The word should contain letters that appear frequently in English words.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would ideally include some of these.

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It avoids less common letters like Q, Z, X, J, etc.

This gives us good coverage to potentially identify multiple correct letters in their positions or at least determine their presence in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first; must be 2,3,4, or 5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. Word has an A somewhere, but not first.
2. No R, O, S, E anywhere.
3. Still need to test other common consonants and vowels (next most frequent in English: T, N, L, C, U, I, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q).

Popular second guess patterns often use “T, I, N, D / L, U / C” etc. A well-balanced word that covers several new common letters while placing A in a different spot is “UNTIL”.  
- U and I are common vowels we haven’t tried.  
- N, T, L are common consonants we haven’t tried.  
- A is not present here, but that’s okay; we will reintroduce A in a later guess once we have more consonant information.

However, we must include A somewhere to confirm its location. A good alternative that re-uses A in a new spot and introduces new consonants is “TALON” – but O and N are already excluded or unused.

Let’s try “UNTIL” first and see what we learn about these new letters, then handle A in the next guess.

Actually, since we know A is in the word but not first, let’s pick a word that keeps A in a new spot and introduces other new common letters. A good choice is “PAINT”.

- P, N, T are new consonants.  
- I is a new vowel.  
- A is repositioned to second.

So far we know:

- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- N is in the word and is in position 5.

We still need to place A in positions 3 or 4 and fill the other three positions with new letters.

Since N is locked at position 5, the word looks like: _ _ _ _ N with A somewhere in 3 or 4.

Good candidates that use remaining common letters:
- C, U, L, D are high-frequency survivors.
- The pattern _ _ A _ N or _ _ _ A N seems likely.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common consonants and keeps A in one of the two remaining slots. A balanced choice is “CANDY” but Y is less common and D is fine.

Better still: “CLANK” but K is allowed, but A is in 3rd, N is known in 5th, and C, L are new common consonsants.

However, we need to test more letters. A more balanced word that covers new letters and places A in a new position is “CHALK” but K is acceptable.

Actually, since we know N is last, let’s focus on a word that puts A in position 3 or 4 and brings in new consonants.

A good fit is “MACON” but O is excluded.  
“CANAL” but A is repeated and L is at end but N is already at 5.

- The pattern _ _ A _ N or _ _ _ A N seems likely.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common consonants and keeps A in one of the two remaining slots. A balanced choice is “CANDY” but Y is less common and D is fine.

Better still: “CLANK” but K is allowed, but A is in 3rd, N is known in 5th, and C, L are new common consonsants.

However, we need to test more letters. A more balanced word that covers new letters and places A in a new position is “CHALK” but K is acceptable.

Actually, since we know N is last, let’s focus on a word that puts A in position 3 or 4 and brings in new consonants.

A good fit is “MACON” but O is excluded.  
“CANAL” but A is repeated and L is at end but N is already at 5.

Let’s try “CLANG” but G is okay. No, G is okay but let’s focus.

Best simple word: “CLANK” – C, L, A, N, K.  
- N is at 5 (correct from feedback).  
- A is at 3 (new position).  
- C, L, K are new consonants to test.

Let’s go with that.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would ideally include some of these.

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular first choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It avoids less common letters like Q, Z, X, J, etc.

This gives us good coverage to potentially identify multiple correct letters in their positions or at least determine their presence in the word.

3. Still need to test other common consonants and vowels (next most frequent in English: T, N, L, C, U, I, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q).

Popular second guess patterns often use “T, I, N, D / L, U / C” etc. A well-balanced word that covers several new common letters while placing A in a different spot is “UNTIL”.  
- U and I are common vowels we haven’t tried.

But wait, let me rethink – the word structure is B L A _ N, and we need a valid 5-letter word.

Common 5-letter English words fitting pattern: BLAND, BLOND (but O excluded), BLUNT (U, T – T excluded), BLAWN (rare), BLAIN (I excluded), BLAMS (rare), etc.

The only common word left: BLAND

Check letters:
- B, L, A, N are confirmed.
- D is a new letter not yet excluded.

So BLAND seems to be the only common word left.",Guess 5: BLAND -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
