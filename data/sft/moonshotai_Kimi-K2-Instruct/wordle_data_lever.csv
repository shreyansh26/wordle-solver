For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N are good choices. A typical strong first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good feedback on multiple letters at once.

From the feedback:
- A, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- R and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
1. Must contain R and E (but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5).
2. Must not contain A, O, S.
3. Is 5 letters.

Now I need a new word that uses R and E in different positions and avoids A, O, S. A good strategy is to test new common consonants (T, L, N, D, etc.) and a different vowel (I or U) to narrow things down. 

A strong next guess could be ""TRIES"":

Current constraints:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I.

So far we know: _ _ _ _ E with R somewhere and no A,O,S,T,I.

We still need three more letters, chosen from the remaining unused alphabet excluding the eliminated ones. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, C, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Vowels left: U (only vowel not ruled out).

Let’s try a word that:
1. Ends in E (fixed).
2. Uses R in a new position (1 or 3 or 4).
3. Avoids A,O,S,T,I.
4. Uses other common letters.

Candidate structure: R _ _ _ E or _ R _ _ E or _ _ R _ E.

Good common letters to test next: N, L, D.

First candidate: ""UNDER"" – but uses U (allowed) and N, D, R, E. However R is in position 4 here, which is new.  
Second candidate: ""CREPE"" – but uses C, P, E; however R in 3 is new, but we need to ensure no T/I etc.  
Third candidate: ""RIDGE"" – but includes I (eliminated).  
Fourth candidate: ""LURED"" – uses L, U, R, E, D. R is in 3, E in 5. All letters are allowed and not previously eliminated.  

""LURED"" seems solid:  
- R is in 3 (never tested there before).  
- E is in 5 (matches ✓).  
- Uses new letters L, U, D.  
- No forbidden letters A,O,S,T,I.

From all three rounds of feedback we now have strict constraints:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. L is fixed in position 1.
3. R is somewhere in the word but NOT positions 2 or 3 (and not 1 or 5 because L and E are there).
   Therefore R must be in position 4.
4. Letters that have been ruled out completely: A, O, S, T, I, U, D.
5. So far the word looks like: L _ _ R E

We still need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3, drawn only from the unused set:
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, plus the letter “R” already placed.

Common remaining consonants to test: N, C, G, B, M, F, H, K, P.

A very common pattern ending in “L _ _ R E” is “L O C R E”, “L A N R E”, etc., but O and A are banned.  
Instead we can try:

- L N C R E – not a known word.
- L C N R E – not a known word.
- L B R R E – not valid (duplicate R).
- L G N R E – not a word.
- L M N R E – not a word.
- L F N R E – not a word.
- L N G R E – “LNGRE” not a word.
- L C H R E – “LCHRE” not a word.
- L B N R E – not a word.
- L H N R E – not a word.

Scanning valid 5-letter words that obey:
- starts with L
- ends with RE
- has R in position 4
- uses no A, O, S, T, I, U, D

The only common word left is “LUMRE” – but U is banned.  
“LAVRE” – A banned.  
“LINER” – I banned.  
“LANER” – A and N allowed, but A banned.  
“LACER” – A banned.  
“LIBRE” – I banned.  
“LOWER” – O banned.  
“LEVER” – E in position 2, but E is already in position 5 (double E is possible).

Let’s test “LEVER”:
- L(✓) E(?) V(?) E(✓) R(✓)
- Double E is acceptable if the puzzle allows repeated letters (Wordle rules do).
- Letters used: L, E, V, R – none of the banned ones.

Therefore, the only plausible remaining candidate with the current constraints is “LEVER”.
