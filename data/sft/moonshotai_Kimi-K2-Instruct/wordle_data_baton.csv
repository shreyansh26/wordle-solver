For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word should ideally include letters like A, E, I, O, U along with frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. 

A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (very common consonant, often at start or end)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This gives a good spread of common letters in different positions to help identify the secret word quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- L: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word, but not in position 3
- T: - → in the word, but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word at all

So we know:
- No S, L, E anywhere in the word.
- A and T are somewhere, but A ≠ 3rd letter and T ≠ 4th letter.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and T, but place them in new positions.
2. Avoid S, L, E entirely.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels (R, N, I, O, etc.).

Possible placements:  
A could be 1,2,4,5 and T could be 1,2,3,5.

Let’s pick a word that uses A and T in new slots and brings in fresh letters.  
“TRAIN” uses T in 1st, A in 3rd, but we already know A can’t be 3rd (from SLATE feedback).  
“RATIO” uses A in 2nd and T in 3rd – both allowed.  
“RATIO” also introduces R, I, O – all common.

So “RATIO” seems like a solid second guess.

From the feedback so far:
1. Letters known to be absent: S, L, E, R, I, M, C, H  
2. Fixed letters:  
   - A is in the word and is in position 2  
   - T is in the word and is in position 3  
3. Letter present but wrong place: O (cannot be in position 5)  

Remaining alphabet (no repeats):  
Vowels available: U, Y (O is already known to exist, but not yet located)  
Consonants available: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Word template: _ A T _ _ (with A at 2, T at 3) and somewhere O must appear (positions 1, 4, or 5, since 5 is excluded for O it must be 1 or 4).

Let’s explore possible placements for O:
- If O is at position 1: O A T _ _ (need 2 consonants for positions 4 & 5 from remaining letters)  
- If O is at position 4: _ A T O _ (need 2 consonants for positions 1 & 5 from remaining letters)

Considering common English words and remaining letters, let’s try ""BATON"":
- B (new, allowed)  
- A (fixed at 2)  
- T (fixed at 3)  
- O (fits position 4, satisfying ""O in word"" and not in 5)  
- N (new, allowed)  

This checks all constraints.
