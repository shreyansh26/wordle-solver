For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters.

- A is at the correct spot (position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong spot (not position 2).
- O and S are not in the word.
- E is at the correct spot (position 5).

So far the pattern is:

R is somewhere in those three positions, but not in position 2.

""ALERT"" seems strong:  
- A and E already confirmed.  
- L, T are common and not yet tested.  
- R is placed in position 3 (allowed since it must move from position 2).

2. Letters confirmed present:
   A (position 1), R (somewhere), E (somewhere)

3. Letters ruled out:
   O, S (from first guess)

4. Additional clues from ALERT:
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4, so E must be in position 5 (but position 5 already has E marked as ✓). Therefore, the feedback for E(-) just reinforces that E is definitely in position 5.
   - R is now confirmed in position 4 (marked ✓), so R is fixed at position 4.

Thus the pattern is now:
A _ _ R E

  – L, T (from ALERT)

We still need two letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining high-frequency letters not yet tried: N, D, C, H, M, P, U, Y, G, B, K, etc.

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words that fit A _ _ R E and use only letters that haven’t been excluded:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,AZURE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters.

- A is at the correct spot (position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong spot (not position 2).
- O and S are not in the word.
- E is at the correct spot (position 5).

So far the pattern is:
A _ _ _ E

We need three more letters for positions 2-4.  
R is somewhere in those three positions, but not in position 2.  
Letters to avoid: O, S.

Good candidate letters that haven't been ruled out: T, I, N, L, C, H, D.

I want a common word fitting A _ _ _ E, with R somewhere in the middle and using other high-frequency letters.  
Possible words: ALERT, ANGER, AIDER, AFTER, ALDER, AIMER, etc.

""ALERT"" seems strong:  
- A and E already confirmed.  
- L, T are common and not yet tested.  
- R is placed in position 3 (allowed since it must move from position 2).

Let’s try ALERT.

2. Letters confirmed present:

3. Letters ruled out:
   O, S (from first guess)
   L, T (from second guess)

4. Additional clues from ALERT:
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4, so E must be in position 5 (but position 5 already has E marked as ✓). Therefore, the feedback for E(-) just reinforces that E is definitely in position 5.
   - R is now confirmed in position 4 (marked ✓), so R is fixed at position 4.

Thus the pattern is now:
A _ _ R E

We need to pick letters for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining unused common letters, excluding L, O, S, T.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet used: I, N, D, C, H, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting A _ _ R E:
- A C I R E → ""ACIRE"" is not valid
- A M I R E → ""AMIRE"" is not valid
- A N I R E → ""ANIRE"" not valid
- A F I R E → ""AFIRE"" is valid
- A D I R E → ""ADIRE"" not valid
- A C H R E → ""ACHRE"" not valid
- A C I R E → same as above

- Pattern: A _ _ R E
  – Position 1 = A
  – Position 4 = R
  – Position 5 = E
- Letters ruled out so far: O, S, L, T, F, I, N
- Letters still allowed for positions 2 & 3 (common, not yet tested): C, D, H, M, P, U, Y, G, B, K, V, W, etc.

Valid English words matching A _ _ R E:
- A C H R E → “ACHRE” (obscure variant spelling)
- A C C R E → “ACCRE” (rare)
- A M B R E → “AMBRE” (French spelling variant)
- A D D R E → “ADDRE” (not standard)
- A P P R E → “APPRE” (prefix, not a word)
- A C H R E already noted

The most reasonably common remaining candidate is “ACHRE”.  Even though it’s uncommon, it’s the only remaining 5-letter English word that fits the pattern and uses only letters not yet disqualified.

The only common valid word left that fits the pattern A _ _ R E and uses letters that have not yet been ruled out is:

AWARE

Let’s check:
- A (position 1) ✓
- W (not yet tried) → allowed
- A (not yet tried in position 2) → allowed
- R (position 4) ✓
- E (position 5) ✓

Letters used: A, W, A, R, E — none of these have been marked as “x” in prior feedback except R and E which are confirmed correct in their positions.

Therefore, the only reasonable candidate left is AWARE.

If AWARE is rejected, then the only other theoretical candidate would be AWERE (not a word), so AWARE is the logical final guess.
