- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular starting choices because they contain high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

- Cannot include: A, O, T, N
- Letters tried so far: S, E, R are confirmed; no info yet on I, U, Y, D, L, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains E and R, with E not in position 3 and R not in position 4
- Avoids A, O, T, N

Candidate letters left (common, not yet ruled out):  
E, R, I, U, Y, D, L, C, H, K, M, P, etc.

One straightforward word that fits: “SURER”
- S _ _ _ _ (good)
- Contains U, R, E (good)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden from 5 and 3)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since R was only forbidden from 2 and 4)
- No A, O, T, N (good)

Another check: no duplicates that violate counts (SURER has two R’s; we don’t yet know if the secret word has two R’s, but it’s still a valid guess).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular starting choices because they contain high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Known letters that must appear: R, S, E
Known letters that cannot appear: A, O
Positions to avoid:

- E cannot be in position 5

I need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, E, avoiding A and O, and respecting the positional constraints. A good candidate is ""REUSE"" but it contains U and the duplicated E might not help much. Another option is ""TRIES"" but it has an I and the T is untested. ""STERN"" is also good but has an N. 

I’ll choose “TRIES” because it introduces a new consonant T and vowel I while reusing the known letters R, S, E in new positions:
- T: new letter
- R: must be in word, now in position 2 (allowed)
- I: new vowel
- E: must be in word, now in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden from 5)

Current state:

S _ _ E R  (positions 1,4,5 are locked)

Known letters:
- Letters that must appear: S, E, R (already placed)
- Letters that cannot appear: A, O, T, N, U, D

From SIDER:
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)

So second and third letters remain unknown; they must be from the remaining unused letters (excluding A,O,T,N,U,D). Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We also know I must be somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but not in position 2). Therefore I must be in position 3 and position 2 must be another consonant.

Thus the pattern is:
S [consonant] I E R

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

Quick scan for common words fitting S  I E R:
- S C I E R
- S H I E R
- S K I E R
- S L I E R
- S P I E R

All of these are valid 5-letter English words.  
""SHIER"" is a little uncommon; ""SKIER"" is common.  
Let’s pick SKIER.

Check:
- S K I E R
- No forbidden letters (A,O,T,N,U,D)
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 2)
- K, previously untested, is acceptable.

Looks good.
