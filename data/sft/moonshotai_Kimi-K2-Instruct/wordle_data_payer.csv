For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular starting choices because they cover common letters. Among these, ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common in English. 

Let me go with ""SLATE"" as it balances vowels (A, E) with common consonants (S, L, T).

From the feedback on SLATE:

So:

From the latest feedback:

APERY → A(-) P(-) E(-) R(-) Y(-)

All five letters are marked (-), meaning they are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Therefore:

- The set of letters in the hidden word is exactly {A, P, E, R, Y}.  
- The hidden word is an anagram of “APERY” (no letter repeats, none missing).

We must rearrange A P E R Y so that:

- A is **not** in position 1  
- P is **not** in position 2  
- E is **not** in position 3  
- R is **not** in position 4  
- Y is **not** in position 5  

Possible permutations that satisfy these constraints:

1 2 3 4 5  
P A Y R E  – P in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), Y in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (forbidden) ❌  
P R A Y E  – R in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden) ❌  
P R Y A E  – R in 2 (allowed), Y in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), E in 5 (forbidden) ❌  
P Y A R E  – Y in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (forbidden) ❌

Y P A R E  – P in 2 (forbidden) ❌  
Y P R A E  – P in 2 (forbidden) ❌  

The only valid permutation that satisfies all positional bans is:

R A P E Y  
Check each position:  
R in 1 (allowed)  
A in 2 (allowed)  
P in 3 (allowed)  
E in 4 (allowed)  
Y in 5 (forbidden) ❌  

Wait, none of the simple permutations work because Y is banned from position 5 yet must occupy some position; since every other letter is also restricted, the only way is to find the single valid rearrangement.

Let’s list the 120 permutations and pick the one that meets all bans:

Valid permutation found by systematic check:

P E A R Y  
- P in 1 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (forbidden) ❌  

Next:

P E R A Y  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (forbidden) ❌  

P E Y R A  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- Y in 3 (allowed)  
- R in 4 (forbidden) ❌  

P R E Y A  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 3 (forbidden) ❌  

P R Y E A  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- Y in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- A in 5 (allowed) ✅  

Verify this one:

Letters: P R Y E A  
Positions:  
1 P (allowed)  
2 R (allowed)  
3 Y (allowed)  
4 E (allowed)  
5 A (allowed)  

All positional bans satisfied.

Therefore, the only valid rearrangement is “PRYEA”. However, that is not a recognized English word. Let’s double-check other arrangements.

Another systematic scan reveals:

R Y P A E  
Positions:  
1 R (allowed)  
2 Y (allowed)  
3 P (allowed)  
4 A (allowed)  
5 E (forbidden) ❌  

Y E P R A  
Positions:  
1 Y (allowed)  
2 E (allowed)  
3 P (allowed)  
4 R (forbidden) ❌  

Y R A P E  
Positions:  
1 Y (allowed)  
2 R (allowed)  
3 A (forbidden) ❌  

Y R P A E  
Positions:  
1 Y (allowed)  
2 R (allowed)  
3 P (allowed)  
4 A (allowed)  
5 E (forbidden) ❌  

The only valid permutation that meets all positional restrictions **and** forms a real English word is:

“PAYER”.

Check:  
P A Y E R  
Positions:  
1 P (allowed)  
2 A (allowed)  
3 Y (allowed)  
4 E (allowed)  
5 R (allowed)  

All good.

Therefore the next (and likely correct) guess is “PAYER”.
