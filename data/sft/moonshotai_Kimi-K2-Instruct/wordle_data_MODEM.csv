For the first guess, the best strategy is to maximize information gain. This means choosing a word that contains common vowels and consonants, and avoids repeating letters to test as many distinct letters as possible. 

Common and effective starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It covers all five most common vowels (A, O, E) plus S and R which are very common consonants.
2. It doesn't repeat any letters, allowing us to test 5 unique letters.
3. The letters are in positions that can help identify patterns early.

Therefore, I'll start with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback:
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

Known:
- The word contains O and E, but not A, R, or S.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Next guess should:
1. Keep O and E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants since S and R are out.
3. Avoid A and S, and place O and E in new positions.

Let’s try a word like:
- OLDEN: Has O in position 1, E in position 4, and tests L, D, N.
But O is in position 1 here, which is fine (was originally in position 3).

Another option:
- OVOID: But repeats O, which is not ideal for info gain.
- OMBER: Has O in 1, E in 4, tests M, B.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to maximize information gain. This means choosing a word that contains common vowels and consonants, and avoids repeating letters to test as many distinct letters as possible. 

Common and effective starting words include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It covers all five most common vowels (A, O, E) plus S and R which are very common consonants.
2. It doesn't repeat any letters, allowing us to test 5 unique letters.
3. The letters are in positions that can help identify patterns early.

Therefore, I'll start with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

Known:
- The word contains O and E, but not A, R, or S.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Next guess should:
1. Keep O and E but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants since S and R are out.
3. Avoid A and S, and place O and E in new positions.

Good letters to test next: L, N, T, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like:
- OLDEN: Has O in position 1, E in position 4, and tests L, D, N.
But O is in position 1 here, which is fine (was originally in position 3).

Another option:
- OVOID: But repeats O, which is not ideal for info gain.
- OMBER: Has O in 1, E in 4, tests M, B.

But ""OLDEN"" seems better:
- O is now in position 1 (not 3, so valid move).
- E is now in position 4 (not 5, so valid move).
- Tests L, D, N.

So I'll go with OLDEN.

   - E is **correct in position 4**.
   - N is **not in the word**.

- Still-free positions: 1, 2, 5.

Let’s try:
- C O D E X → C O D E X
  - O in position 2 (allowed).
  - C and X are new letters to test.
CODEX is a valid English word meaning “a manuscript book”.

From every guess so far we now know:

Positions 2-3-4 are **O D E** (confirmed by ✓ marks on all three letters).

Letters we have proven **not** in the word:  
A, B, C, L, N, R, S, X.  

Letters still possibly in positions 1 or 5:  
Consonants → F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels → I, U (the only two not yet tried)

We need any real 5-letter English word that spells “_ O D E _” and uses only the still-allowed alphabet.

Quick scan of valid words:

- F O D E R – but R is ruled out.  
- K O D E K – not a word.  
- H O D E R – R is out.  
- P O D E D – “poded” is not standard.  
- M O D E M – M is allowed, and “modem” is a real word.

“MODEM” fits all constraints:
M (new, allowed)  
O (position 2)  
D (position 3)  
E (position 4)  
M (allowed again; letters may repeat).

No rule violation; every letter used is either confirmed correct or still untested and not yet ruled out.
