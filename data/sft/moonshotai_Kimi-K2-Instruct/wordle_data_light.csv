Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of likely letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

- Not in position 5 (from UNTIL)

- Not in position 4 (from SLATE)

- L can only be in position 1, 3, or 4  

We need a valid 5-letter word that

3. Places T and L in still-allowed positions

Looking for words that fit:
- Example 1: ""CLOTH"" – contains T but not L.  
- Example 2: ""MOLTY"" – contains M, O, L, T, Y – all letters still possible.  
- Example 3: ""TROLL"" – contains T, R, O, L, L – valid and meets all constraints.

""TROLL"" places T in position 1 (allowed), L in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed), and introduces new common letters R and O. It also doubles the L, which may help confirm how many L’s are in the word.

Thus, ""TROLL"" is a strong choice.

From the three guesses so far:

Letters confirmed in the word: L, T  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word:  
S, A, E, U, N, I, R, O  

Positions ruled out for L:  
- Position 2 (from SLATE)  
- Position 5 (from UNTIL)  
- Positions 3 & 4 (from TROLL)  

Positions ruled out for T:  
- Position 4 (from SLATE)  
- Position 3 (from UNTIL)  
- Position 1 (from TROLL)  

So:
- L can only be in position 1 (all other positions ruled out)  
- T can only be in position 2 or 5 (positions 1, 3, 4 ruled out)  

Remaining usable letters (not yet eliminated):  
C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L in position 1 and T in position 2 OR 5  
2. Uses only remaining valid letters (none of S,A,E,U,N,I,R,O)  

Possible options:
- LYMPH (but no T)  
- LATCH (but A is out)  
- LYFTS (but S is out)  
- LYCHT (archaic spelling of ""light"") – uses L, Y, C, H, T, and positions L in 1 and T in 5  

""LYCHT"" is acceptable, but perhaps better to use a more common word.  

Another option: ""LIGHT"" – but I and G are still possible? Wait, I is already out.  

Re-checking: I is already eliminated (from UNTIL feedback).  

Valid letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, B, V, etc.  

Best fit: ""LYMPH"" lacks T. ""LYCHT"" is obscure.  

Alternative: ""LATCH"" has A (out). ""LINTY"" has I and N (out).  

Realizing that most common words use eliminated vowels (A,E,I,O,U). The only remaining vowel-like letters are Y and sometimes H/W.  

Thus, the word must be structured around L in position 1 and T in position 2 or 5, with consonants only.  

Possible words:
- LYCHT (L-1, Y-2, C-3, H-4, T-5)  
- LYMPT (but P,M,Y,T are valid) – not a real word  
- LYFTS – S is out  

""LYCHT"" seems the only valid remaining word fitting all constraints.  

However, to be safer with common words, let's consider that if T is in position 2 (instead of 5), we could have:  
L _ T _ _  

But we need 3 more letters from remaining pool, e.g., L Y T C H – but this would be ""LYTCH"", which is also obscure.  

Re-evaluating: The constraints are extremely tight now. All positions except L in 1 and T in 5 are largely locked. The only viable word seems ""LYCHT"" (Old English for ""light"").  

But to ensure we use only valid modern English words, perhaps ""LYCHT"" is too obscure. Instead, let's check if any other combination exists.  

Wait – what about ""LYMPH"" lacks T, so invalid.  

Given the constraints, the only remaining possibility is that the word is ""LYCHT"".  

However, to prioritize standard words, let me re-examine:  

If we place T in position 5 (since position 2 is still possible but requires more letters), the structure must be:  
L _ _ _ T  

With letters from remaining pool (C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,W,Y,B,V).  

Possible words:
- LYCHT (valid in some dictionaries)  
- LEMPT – but E is out  
- LYFTS – S out  

Thus, ""LYCHT"" is the only remaining candidate.  

But to use a more standard word, let me check if I missed any.  

Actually, ""LYCHT"" is listed as a variant spelling in some sources, but to be safer, let's consider that the word might use T in position 2:

Structure: L T _ _ _  

Letters allowed in positions 3-5: C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,W,Y,B,V  

Possible word: L T C H Y → ""LTCHY"" – not valid.  

No valid common words fit L T _ _ _ with remaining letters.  

Thus, the only feasible word is ""LYCHT"".  

Final check:  
- L in position 1 (only remaining option)  
- T in position 5 (only remaining option)  
- Uses Y, C, H (all still allowed)  

Therefore, the correct next guess is ""LYCHT"".

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,light,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of likely letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

E(x) – E is NOT in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, T  
- Letters not in the word: S, A, E  

We need a 5-letter word that contains L and T but avoids S, A, E.  
Also:
- L cannot be in position 2  
- T cannot be in position 4  

To maximize new information, I should include a fresh set of common consonants and vowels. Good candidates are I, O, U, R, N, C, H, etc.

Let me choose a word that:
1. Contains L and T  
2. Excludes S, A, E  
3. Places L and T in new positions  
4. Adds fresh common letters (I, R, O, N)  

A word meeting these is ""TRIOL"" – but ""triol"" is uncommon.  
""TRILO"" isn't valid.  
""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L – letters not ruled out yet, and moves T to position 3 and L to position 5 (both new positions). It also uses common letters U, N, I.

""UNTIL"" is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

3. Places T and L in still-allowed positions  

Remaining usable letters (common ones): C, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, R, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words that fit:
- Example 1: ""CLOTH"" – contains T but not L.  
- Example 2: ""MOLTY"" – contains M, O, L, T, Y – all letters still possible.  
- Example 3: ""TROLL"" – contains T, R, O, L, L – valid and meets all constraints.

""TROLL"" places T in position 1 (allowed), L in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed), and introduces new common letters R and O. It also doubles the L, which may help confirm how many L’s are in the word.

That means:
- The word starts with L, ends with HT, and the middle letter is **not** Y or C.

Known pattern so far: L _ H T

Letters ruled out: S, A, E, U, N, I, R, O, Y, C  
Letters still allowed: D, F, G, K, M, P, W, V, B (plus any others not yet used)

We need a 5-letter word of the form L _ H T where the blank is one of the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- LIGHT – but I is already ruled out.  
- LYCHT – already tried.  
- LGHT? – invalid (no vowel).  
- LDHT? – invalid.  
- LFHT? – invalid.  
- LMHT? – invalid.  
- LWHT? – invalid.  

Wait, let me list valid English 5-letter words matching L _ H T:
- LIGHT – I is out.  
- LOATH – O is out.  
- LEANT – E and N are out.  
- LYCHT – already used.  

The only common word that fits L _ H T with allowed letters is **LIGHT**, but I is eliminated.  

Looking deeper:  
- LUGHT – not valid.  
- LQHT? – invalid.  

The only remaining valid word matching L _ H T with allowed letters is **LIGHT**, but I is out. This suggests I may have missed a word.  

But ""LIGHT"" is invalid due to I.  

Rechecking: The pattern is L _ H T, and the middle letter must be from remaining consonants D,F,G,K,M,P,W,V,B.  

Possible valid word: **LUMPH** – but U and M are out (U from UNTIL, M not yet confirmed but let's check).  

Actually, let me think of ""L G H T"" with a valid consonant: **LGHT?** – invalid.  

Realizing that the only valid 5-letter word fitting L _ H T with allowed letters is **LIGHT**, but I is ruled out. This suggests the word must be **LIGHT** despite I being ruled out, which is impossible.  

Rechecking constraints:  
From Guess 2 (UNTIL), I was (-) – meaning I is in the word but not position 4. Wait, no:  

UNTIL feedback: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(-)  
This means:  
- I is in the word but not position 4.  

So I **is** in the word, just not in position 4.  

This changes things: I is allowed, just not in position 4.  

Thus, the pattern is L _ H T, and the middle letter can be I (since position 2 is allowed for I).  

Therefore, the word must be **LIGHT**.  

Let's verify:  
- L in position 1 (✓)  
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is in the word but not position 4)  
- G (new letter)  
- H in position 4 (✓)  
- T in position 5 (✓)  

This fits all feedback perfectly.
