For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that has commonly used vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good first guesses often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

Some popular strong opening words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N). This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From Guess 1 (CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)) we learn:
- The letters C, R, N, and E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- The letter A IS in the word, but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the secret word:
- contains A somewhere, but not in slot 3
- does NOT contain C, R, N, or E

Next, we want a word that
1. reuses the confirmed letter A (but not in position 3),
2. introduces new common letters not yet eliminated,
3. keeps everything else fresh (no C, R, N, E).

A good second-guess pool would include words like:
- SPOIL / SPOIL → S, P, O, I, L
- ADIOS → but A is in position 1 (allowed), and we get S, D, I, O
- PLAID → P, L, A, I, D (A in 3rd slot again, forbidden)
- SALTY → S, A, L, T, Y (A in 2nd slot, good)

I’ll pick SALTY because:
- A is in position 2, satisfying the “not slot 3” constraint.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Letters not in the word at all:  
C, R, N, E, L, Y, B, I (from all feedback “x”)

Letters that ARE in the word and their fixed positions:  
- A is in position 2  
- T is in position 4  

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- S (because it received feedback “-” in both slot 1 and slot 5, so it must be in either slot 3)

So the current pattern is:  
_ A S T _   (since S must occupy slot 3, as 1 and 5 are ruled out)

Remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 5 must come from the unused pool:  
D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a common English word that fits _ A S T _.

Quick scan:  
FAST – position 1 = F, position 5 = nothing (but it’s only 4 letters)  
HASTE – H _ A S T E, fits _ A S T _ only if we insert H at 1 and E at 5 – but E is already ruled out.  
PASTE – E ruled out  
MAST – too short  
WASTE – E ruled out  
VAST – too short  
GAST – G, but “gast” is uncommon  
MASTY – Y is ruled out  
F A S T _ : FASTs, FASTy – neither valid 5-letter word  
D A S T _ : DASTy – invalid  
G A S T _ : GASTs – invalid  
H A S T _ : HASTE – E invalid  
M A S T _ : MASTs – invalid  
P A S T _ : PASTE – E invalid  
V A S T _ : VASTs – invalid  
J A S T _ : JASPs – invalid  

Wait, the only regular English word that fits _ A S T _ with the remaining letters seems to be  
F A S T _ – but FAST is 4 letters.  
Actually, the pattern is 1-2-3-4-5, with 2=A and 4=T and 3=S, so the word must be * * A S T * – that’s not right; pattern is 1-2-3-4-5, so positions are:  
1 2 3 4 5  
? A ? T ?

And we discovered S must be in position 3.  
So the pattern is:  
? A S T ?

Now we need letters for positions 1 and 5 from the unused list (D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Quick search of common 5-letter words matching “?AST?” gives:

- HASTE – E ruled out  
- PASTE – E ruled out  
- WASTE – E ruled out  
- FASTS – plural of fast, uncommon but valid, uses S twice (invalid, S already placed)  
- VASTS – same issue  
- DASTY – not a word  
- MASTS – S already used in 3, duplicate S disallowed  
- GASTS – same double-S issue  
- OASTS – O, A, S, T, S – double S  
- PASTS – same  

We are running short.  But there is one common word that fits:  

G A S T ? – but we need a letter for position 5.  Let’s try:

G A S T ? – G A S T O (GASTO – not a word).  

Wait, let’s look at letter set: unused consonants D F G H J K M P Q U V W X Z.

Scanning dictionary quietly, the only everyday word that matches ? A S T ? is:

MAST? – but M A S T needs a fifth letter.  MASTs – plural, but S already used.  

Another candidate: P A S T ? – PASTE (E ruled out), PASTY (Y ruled out).  

Actually, there is one:  

V A S T ? – VAST? – 4 letters.

I just realized I overlooked a simple valid word: PASTA.  Let me check constraints:

P A S T A – positions: 1=P, 2=A, 3=S, 4=T, 5=A  

- A is allowed to appear again?  The feedback never said A appears only once, merely that A is in position 2.  Repetition of A is possible.  
- Letters: P and A are both allowed so far.  
- A is already placed in position 2, but the second A would be in position 5 – we have no information against that.  

So PASTA is valid.  Let me confirm:  
P – not ruled out  
A – allowed and already placed  
S – must be in 3, so fine  
T – placed in 4  
A – allowed again.

Therefore, the best next guess is PASTA.
