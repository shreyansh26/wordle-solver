Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English alphabet (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L)
2. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain
3. Is a common 5-letter word to avoid wasting guesses

Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples include ""STARE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

""STARE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English

From the feedback on STARE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, T, A, R are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. It does NOT contain S, T, A, or R.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4). Since we’ve eliminated S, T, A, and R, we should choose letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Does not use S, T, A, or R.
- Uses 4 other distinct common letters to maximize information.

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

What we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 is ✓ in both guesses).  
- It contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3 (since O was marked ✓ in position 3 in PHONE, but that would imply it is in the correct position, yet we know from the rules that ✓ means correct position. Wait, this is ambiguous. Actually, the feedback for PHONE was P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So O is in position 3.  
- It does NOT contain S, T, A, R, P, H, or N.  
- So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining letters not tested: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to choose a word that fits _ _ O _ E, uses only letters not eliminated so far, and is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:  
- M O V E (but O is in position 2, not 3)  
- C O V E (O in position 2)  
- C O I N E (invalid)  
- M O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- C O M E (but needs 5 letters)  
- B O U N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- L O V E (invalid, needs 5 letters)  
- D O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- G O U G E (invalid, G is allowed but check positions)  

Actually, _ _ O _ E is the pattern we need. Let’s list possible words:  
- B O U C E (invalid, not a word)  
- C O U P E (invalid, P is eliminated)  
- C O I F E (invalid)  
- D O U C E (invalid)  
- G O U G E (but G not tested, and U and G are allowed; G O U G E is a 5-letter word)  
- B O U G E (invalid, not a word)  
- B O I L E (invalid, L is allowed but I not tested)  
- F O U N D (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- F O U N E (invalid)  
- C O U L E (invalid)  
- C O I N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  

""GOUGE"" fits the required pattern: G _ _ _ E, with O in position 3 and E in position 5. It doesn’t use any eliminated letters (S, T, A, R, P, H, N) and introduces G and U to test new letters.

But wait, let’s re-examine the pattern. The known positions are:
- Position 3: O (from PHONE’s O(✓))  
- Position 5: E (from both guesses)  

So the word is: _ _ O _ E.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. Let me list valid options:
- BOOKE (invalid)  
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COUPE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- DOGIE (invalid, G not eliminated but I not tested)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  
- DOVIE (invalid)  
- GOUGE (valid word: G O U G E) – uses G and U, fits _ _ O _ E.  

But ""GOUGE"" has O in position 2, not 3. Wait, no: GOUGE is G O U G E, so positions are:
G (1), O (2), U (3), G (4), E (5). But position 3 must be O, so GOUGE is invalid because O is in position 2.

Ah, I misread. The feedback for PHONE was O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In PHONE, O is in position 3, so O must be in position 3 in the secret word. So the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOOGE (invalid)  
- BOOZE (invalid, Z is allowed but uncommon)  
- COOLE (invalid)  
- COOKE (invalid)  
- DOOLE (invalid)  
- DOOM E (invalid)  
- FOOD E (invalid)  
- G OO E (invalid)  
- HO O K E (invalid, H eliminated)  
- LOOKE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- RO O K E (invalid, R eliminated)  
- S OO T E (invalid, S eliminated)  
- W OO D E (invalid)  

Actually, the only common word I can think of is ""BOOZE"" but B, O, O, Z, E. But O is in position 3, so B _ O _ E.  
- B O _ _ E: No, the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words:
- BROKE (but R is eliminated)  
- CLOKE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (O in position 3, fits _ _ O _ E) – D O G I E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
- G O U G E: O in position 2.  
- D O U C E: O in position 2.  

I realize now that very few standard English words fit _ _ O _ E. Let me search mentally:
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COOZE (invalid)  
- DOOZE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- POOZE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- WOOSH (invalid)  
- GLOOP (invalid)  

This is harder than expected. Let me re-examine possible words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOGLE (invalid)  
- FOULE (invalid, U in position 3 but O in position 2)  
- MOULE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (invalid)  
- VOULE (invalid)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  

Wait, ""VOICE"" is V O I C E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
""COUCH"" is 5 letters but ends in H, not E.  

""BOOZE"" is the closest: B O O Z E, but O is in position 2.  

Upon reflection, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and the secret word must have O in position 3. Valid words:
- BROKE (R eliminated)  
- CHOKE (H and K not tested, but H is eliminated)  
- SPOKE (S and P eliminated)  
- PLOKE (invalid)  

""CHOKE"" uses C, H, O, K, E. But H is eliminated (from PHONE: H(x)), so invalid.  
""CLOKE"" is invalid.  
""GLOBE"" is G L O B E, so O in position 3, E in position 5. This fits: _ _ O _ E. Letters: G, L, O, B, E. G, L, B are new and not eliminated (only S, T, A, R, P, H, N are out).  

""GLOBE"" is a valid word fitting the pattern.

<guess>GLOBE</guess>

Actually, the only common word I can think of is ""BOOZE"" but B, O, O, Z, E. But O is in position 3, so B _ O _ E.  
- B O _ _ E: No, the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words:
- BROKE (but R is eliminated)  
- CLOKE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (O in position 3, fits _ _ O _ E) – D O G I E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
- G O U G E: O in position 2.  
- D O U C E: O in position 2.  

I realize now that very few standard English words fit _ _ O _ E. Let me search mentally:
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COOZE (invalid)  
- DOOZE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- POOZE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- WOOSH (invalid)  
- GLOOP (invalid)  

This is harder than expected. Let me re-examine possible words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOGLE (invalid)  
- FOULE (invalid, U in position 3 but O in position 2)  
- MOULE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (invalid)  
- VOULE (invalid)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  

Wait, ""VOICE"" is V O I C E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
""COUCH"" is 5 letters but ends in H, not E.  

""BOOZE"" is the closest: B O O Z E, but O is in position 2.  

Upon reflection, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and the secret word must have O in position 3. Valid words:
- BROKE (R eliminated)  
- CHOKE (H and K not tested, but H is eliminated)  
- SPOKE (S and P eliminated)  
- PLOKE (invalid)  

""CHOKE"" uses C, H, O, K, E. But H is eliminated (from PHONE: H(x)), so invalid.  
""CLOKE"" is invalid.  
""GLOBE"" is G L O B E, so O in position 3, E in position 5. This fits: _ _ O _ E. Letters: G, L, O, B, E. G, L, B are new and not eliminated (only S, T, A, R, P, H, N are out).  

""GLOBE"" is a valid word fitting the pattern.

<guess>GLOBE</guess>Based on the feedback, the word ends in E and has O in the third position, while excluding S, T, A, R, P, H, and N. A valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ _ O _ E is:",Guess 3: GLOBE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,EVOKE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English alphabet (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L)
2. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain
3. Is a common 5-letter word to avoid wasting guesses

Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples include ""STARE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

""STARE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English
- T is very common
- A is a common vowel
- R is common
- E is the most common letter in English

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, T, A, R are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. It does NOT contain S, T, A, or R.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4). Since we’ve eliminated S, T, A, and R, we should choose letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Does not use S, T, A, or R.
- Uses 4 other distinct common letters to maximize information.

Possible choices: ""MOUSE"", ""CHIDE"", ""FLUME"", ""GUIDE"", ""PHONE"", etc.

""PHONE"" is good because:
- P, H, O, N haven’t been tested yet.
- Common letters and a real word.
- Uses O (vowel) and N (common consonant), giving us more info.

<guess>PHONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

What we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 is ✓ in both guesses).  
- It contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3 (since O was marked ✓ in position 3 in PHONE, but that would imply it is in the correct position, yet we know from the rules that ✓ means correct position. Wait, this is ambiguous. Actually, the feedback for PHONE was P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So O is in position 3.  
- It does NOT contain S, T, A, R, P, H, or N.  
- So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining letters not tested: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to choose a word that fits _ _ O _ E, uses only letters not eliminated so far, and is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:  
- M O V E (but O is in position 2, not 3)  
- C O V E (O in position 2)  
- C O I N E (invalid)  
- M O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- C O M E (but needs 5 letters)  
- B O U N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- L O V E (invalid, needs 5 letters)  
- D O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- G O U G E (invalid, G is allowed but check positions)  

Actually, _ _ O _ E is the pattern we need. Let’s list possible words:  
- B O U C E (invalid, not a word)  
- C O U P E (invalid, P is eliminated)  
- C O I F E (invalid)  
- D O U C E (invalid)  
- G O U G E (but G not tested, and U and G are allowed; G O U G E is a 5-letter word)  
- B O U G E (invalid, not a word)  
- B O I L E (invalid, L is allowed but I not tested)  
- F O U N D (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- F O U N E (invalid)  
- C O U L E (invalid)  
- C O I N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  

""GOUGE"" fits the required pattern: G _ _ _ E, with O in position 3 and E in position 5. It doesn’t use any eliminated letters (S, T, A, R, P, H, N) and introduces G and U to test new letters.

But wait, let’s re-examine the pattern. The known positions are:
- Position 3: O (from PHONE’s O(✓))  
- Position 5: E (from both guesses)  

So the word is: _ _ O _ E.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. Let me list valid options:
- BOOKE (invalid)  
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COUPE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- DOGIE (invalid, G not eliminated but I not tested)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  
- DOVIE (invalid)  
- GOUGE (valid word: G O U G E) – uses G and U, fits _ _ O _ E.  

But ""GOUGE"" has O in position 2, not 3. Wait, no: GOUGE is G O U G E, so positions are:
G (1), O (2), U (3), G (4), E (5). But position 3 must be O, so GOUGE is invalid because O is in position 2.

Ah, I misread. The feedback for PHONE was O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In PHONE, O is in position 3, so O must be in position 3 in the secret word. So the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOOGE (invalid)  
- BOOZE (invalid, Z is allowed but uncommon)  
- COOLE (invalid)  
- COOKE (invalid)  
- DOOLE (invalid)  
- DOOM E (invalid)  
- FOOD E (invalid)  
- G OO E (invalid)  
- HO O K E (invalid, H eliminated)  
- LOOKE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- RO O K E (invalid, R eliminated)  
- S OO T E (invalid, S eliminated)  
- W OO D E (invalid)  

Actually, the only common word I can think of is ""BOOZE"" but B, O, O, Z, E. But O is in position 3, so B _ O _ E.  
- B O _ _ E: No, the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words:
- BROKE (but R is eliminated)  
- CLOKE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (O in position 3, fits _ _ O _ E) – D O G I E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
- G O U G E: O in position 2.  
- D O U C E: O in position 2.

Wait, ""VOICE"" is V O I C E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
""COUCH"" is 5 letters but ends in H, not E.  

""BOOZE"" is the closest: B O O Z E, but O is in position 2.  

Upon reflection, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and the secret word must have O in position 3. Valid words:
- BROKE (R eliminated)  
- CHOKE (H and K not tested, but H is eliminated)  
- SPOKE (S and P eliminated)  
- PLOKE (invalid)  

""CHOKE"" uses C, H, O, K, E. But H is eliminated (from PHONE: H(x)), so invalid.  
""CLOKE"" is invalid.  
""GLOBE"" is G L O B E, so O in position 3, E in position 5. This fits: _ _ O _ E. Letters: G, L, O, B, E. G, L, B are new and not eliminated (only S, T, A, R, P, H, N are out).

From all feedback so far:

1. The word ends in E (position 5 = ✓).
2. The word contains O and it MUST be in position 3 (from Guess 2 PHONE: O(✓)).
   Therefore the pattern is fixed: _ _ O _ E.
3. Letters already eliminated:
   – From STARE: S, T, A, R
   – From PHONE: P, H, N
   – From GLOBE: G, L, B

So any remaining candidate must:
- Fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E
- Use only letters not in {S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B}

Still-allowed letters (common ones): C, D, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting _ _ O _ E with these constraints.
Brainstorming:

- D O U C E – invalid (C is allowed, but not a word)
- F O U N T – invalid (ends in T)
- M O U S E – invalid (contains S)
- C O U C E – invalid
- V O I C E – invalid (O not in position 3)
- D O G I E – invalid (G is eliminated)
- C H O K E – invalid (H eliminated)
- J O K E – too short
- M O I S T – wrong ending
- F O I L E – invalid
- C O U P E – invalid (P eliminated)
- M O U L E – valid word: M O U L E → positions: M(1) O(2) U(3) L(4) E(5) – but O is not in position 3 here.
- D O U C E – invalid
- K N O T S – wrong ending
- D O I L E – invalid
- C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)
- C O I F E – invalid
- C O U D E – invalid
- M O U S E – invalid (S)
- V I O L E – V I O L E → O in position 3, E in position 5, and V, I, O, L, E. L is eliminated (from GLOBE), so invalid.
- W O O D E – invalid
- C O O Z E – invalid (Z)
- D O O Z E – invalid
- C O M E T – wrong ending
- C O V E R – wrong ending
- C O M B E – invalid (B eliminated)
- C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)
- C O U L E – invalid
- C O W E R – wrong ending
- C O R E Y – wrong ending

Actually, the word “VIOLE” contains V, I, O, L, E – but L is eliminated.  
The word “MOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “DOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “JOULE” contains J, O, U, L, E – L is eliminated.  
The word “COUPE” contains P – eliminated.  
The word “CHOKE” contains H – eliminated.  
The word “CLOVE” contains L – eliminated.  
The word “CHORE” contains H and R – eliminated.  
The word “CROME” – invalid.  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ O _ E using only still-allowed letters is:

C O M E T – but ends in T (invalid).  
The correct word that fits is “MOVIE” – but O is not in position 3.  

Wait – “MOVIE” is M-O-V-I-E → O is in position 2, not 3.  

Realizing that very few words fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E without using eliminated letters. One valid word I can think of is:

C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)  
C O R D E – R eliminated  
C O R S E – R and S eliminated  
C O M P E – P eliminated  
C O M B E – B eliminated

<guess>COZIE</guess>",COZIE,"From all feedback so far:

1. The word ends in E (position 5 = ✓).
2. The word contains O and it MUST be in position 3 (from Guess 2 PHONE: O(✓)).
   Therefore the pattern is fixed: _ _ O _ E.
3. Letters already eliminated:
   – From STARE: S, T, A, R
   – From PHONE: P, H, N
   – From GLOBE: G, L, B

So any remaining candidate must:
- Fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E
- Use only letters not in {S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B}

Still-allowed letters (common ones): C, D, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting _ _ O _ E with these constraints.
Brainstorming:

- D O U C E – invalid (C is allowed, but not a word)
- F O U N T – invalid (ends in T)
- M O U S E – invalid (contains S)
- C O U C E – invalid
- V O I C E – invalid (O not in position 3)
- D O G I E – invalid (G is eliminated)
- C H O K E – invalid (H eliminated)
- J O K E – too short
- M O I S T – wrong ending
- F O I L E – invalid
- C O U P E – invalid (P eliminated)

Actually, the word “VIOLE” contains V, I, O, L, E – but L is eliminated.  
The word “MOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “DOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “JOULE” contains J, O, U, L, E – L is eliminated.  
The word “COUPE” contains P – eliminated.  
The word “CHOKE” contains H – eliminated.  
The word “CLOVE” contains L – eliminated.  
The word “CHORE” contains H and R – eliminated.  
The word “CROME” – invalid.  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ O _ E using only still-allowed letters is:

C O M E T – but ends in T (invalid).  
The correct word that fits is “MOVIE” – but O is not in position 3.  

Wait – “MOVIE” is M-O-V-I-E → O is in position 2, not 3.  

Realizing that very few words fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E without using eliminated letters. One valid word I can think of is:

C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)  
C O R D E – R eliminated  
C O R S E – R and S eliminated

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English alphabet (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L)
2. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain
3. Is a common 5-letter word to avoid wasting guesses

Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples include ""STARE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

""STARE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English
- T is very common
- A is a common vowel
- R is common
- E is the most common letter in English

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, T, A, R are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. It does NOT contain S, T, A, or R.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4). Since we’ve eliminated S, T, A, and R, we should choose letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Does not use S, T, A, or R.
- Uses 4 other distinct common letters to maximize information.

Possible choices: ""MOUSE"", ""CHIDE"", ""FLUME"", ""GUIDE"", ""PHONE"", etc.

""PHONE"" is good because:
- P, H, O, N haven’t been tested yet.
- Common letters and a real word.
- Uses O (vowel) and N (common consonant), giving us more info.

<guess>PHONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

What we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 is ✓ in both guesses).  
- It contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3 (since O was marked ✓ in position 3 in PHONE, but that would imply it is in the correct position, yet we know from the rules that ✓ means correct position. Wait, this is ambiguous. Actually, the feedback for PHONE was P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So O is in position 3.  
- It does NOT contain S, T, A, R, P, H, or N.  
- So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining letters not tested: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to choose a word that fits _ _ O _ E, uses only letters not eliminated so far, and is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:  
- M O V E (but O is in position 2, not 3)  
- C O V E (O in position 2)  
- C O I N E (invalid)  
- M O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- C O M E (but needs 5 letters)  
- B O U N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- L O V E (invalid, needs 5 letters)  
- D O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- G O U G E (invalid, G is allowed but check positions)  

Actually, _ _ O _ E is the pattern we need. Let’s list possible words:  
- B O U C E (invalid, not a word)  
- C O U P E (invalid, P is eliminated)  
- C O I F E (invalid)  
- D O U C E (invalid)  
- G O U G E (but G not tested, and U and G are allowed; G O U G E is a 5-letter word)  
- B O U G E (invalid, not a word)  
- B O I L E (invalid, L is allowed but I not tested)  
- F O U N D (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- F O U N E (invalid)  
- C O U L E (invalid)  
- C O I N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  

""GOUGE"" fits the required pattern: G _ _ _ E, with O in position 3 and E in position 5. It doesn’t use any eliminated letters (S, T, A, R, P, H, N) and introduces G and U to test new letters.

But wait, let’s re-examine the pattern. The known positions are:
- Position 3: O (from PHONE’s O(✓))  
- Position 5: E (from both guesses)  

So the word is: _ _ O _ E.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. Let me list valid options:
- BOOKE (invalid)  
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COUPE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- DOGIE (invalid, G not eliminated but I not tested)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  
- DOVIE (invalid)  
- GOUGE (valid word: G O U G E) – uses G and U, fits _ _ O _ E.  

But ""GOUGE"" has O in position 2, not 3. Wait, no: GOUGE is G O U G E, so positions are:
G (1), O (2), U (3), G (4), E (5). But position 3 must be O, so GOUGE is invalid because O is in position 2.

Ah, I misread. The feedback for PHONE was O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In PHONE, O is in position 3, so O must be in position 3 in the secret word. So the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOOGE (invalid)  
- BOOZE (invalid, Z is allowed but uncommon)  
- COOLE (invalid)  
- COOKE (invalid)  
- DOOLE (invalid)  
- DOOM E (invalid)  
- FOOD E (invalid)  
- G OO E (invalid)  
- HO O K E (invalid, H eliminated)  
- LOOKE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- RO O K E (invalid, R eliminated)  
- S OO T E (invalid, S eliminated)  
- W OO D E (invalid)  

Actually, the only common word I can think of is ""BOOZE"" but B, O, O, Z, E. But O is in position 3, so B _ O _ E.  
- B O _ _ E: No, the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words:
- BROKE (but R is eliminated)  
- CLOKE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (O in position 3, fits _ _ O _ E) – D O G I E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
- G O U G E: O in position 2.  
- D O U C E: O in position 2.  

I realize now that very few standard English words fit _ _ O _ E. Let me search mentally:
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COOZE (invalid)  
- DOOZE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- POOZE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- WOOSH (invalid)  
- GLOOP (invalid)  

This is harder than expected. Let me re-examine possible words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOGLE (invalid)  
- FOULE (invalid, U in position 3 but O in position 2)  
- MOULE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (invalid)  
- VOULE (invalid)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  

Wait, ""VOICE"" is V O I C E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
""COUCH"" is 5 letters but ends in H, not E.  

""BOOZE"" is the closest: B O O Z E, but O is in position 2.  

Upon reflection, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and the secret word must have O in position 3. Valid words:
- BROKE (R eliminated)  
- CHOKE (H and K not tested, but H is eliminated)  
- SPOKE (S and P eliminated)  
- PLOKE (invalid)  

""CHOKE"" uses C, H, O, K, E. But H is eliminated (from PHONE: H(x)), so invalid.  
""CLOKE"" is invalid.  
""GLOBE"" is G L O B E, so O in position 3, E in position 5. This fits: _ _ O _ E. Letters: G, L, O, B, E. G, L, B are new and not eliminated (only S, T, A, R, P, H, N are out).  

""GLOBE"" is a valid word fitting the pattern.

<guess>GLOBE</guess>Based on the feedback, the word ends in E and has O in the third position, while excluding S, T, A, R, P, H, and N. A valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ _ O _ E is:

3. Letters already eliminated:
   – From STARE: S, T, A, R
   – From PHONE: P, H, N
   – From GLOBE: G, L, B

So any remaining candidate must:
- Fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E
- Use only letters not in {S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B}

Still-allowed letters (common ones): C, D, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting _ _ O _ E with these constraints.

Actually, the word “VIOLE” contains V, I, O, L, E – but L is eliminated.  
The word “MOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “DOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “JOULE” contains J, O, U, L, E – L is eliminated.

The word “CHOKE” contains H – eliminated.  
The word “CLOVE” contains L – eliminated.  
The word “CHORE” contains H and R – eliminated.  
The word “CROME” – invalid.  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ O _ E using only still-allowed letters is:

C O M E T – but ends in T (invalid).  
The correct word that fits is “MOVIE” – but O is not in position 3.  

Wait – “MOVIE” is M-O-V-I-E → O is in position 2, not 3.  

Realizing that very few words fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E without using eliminated letters. One valid word I can think of is:

C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)  
C O R D E – R eliminated  
C O R S E – R and S eliminated

C O M B E – B eliminated  
C O N G E – N, G eliminated  
C O M M E – invalid  
C O N N E – invalid  
C O M M E – invalid

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E is fixed in position 5)
2. Letters CONFIRMED to exist:
   - O (from PHONE: O(✓) in position 3, but COZIE shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3)
   - Therefore O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Letters ELIMINATED so far:

4. Still-available letters (excluding duplicates and the eliminated set):

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O somewhere NOT in position 3

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,EVOKE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in the English alphabet (like vowels A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L)
2. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain
3. Is a common 5-letter word to avoid wasting guesses

Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Examples include ""STARE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

""STARE"" is particularly good because:
- S is very common in English
- T is very common
- A is a common vowel
- R is common
- E is the most common letter in English

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, T, A, R are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. It does NOT contain S, T, A, or R.
3. We still have 4 unknown positions (1-4). Since we’ve eliminated S, T, A, and R, we should choose letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good remaining common letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has E in position 5.
- Does not use S, T, A, or R.
- Uses 4 other distinct common letters to maximize information.

Possible choices: ""MOUSE"", ""CHIDE"", ""FLUME"", ""GUIDE"", ""PHONE"", etc.

""PHONE"" is good because:
- P, H, O, N haven’t been tested yet.
- Common letters and a real word.
- Uses O (vowel) and N (common consonant), giving us more info.

<guess>PHONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two pieces of feedback:

Guess 1: STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: PHONE → P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)

What we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5 is ✓ in both guesses).  
- It contains the letter O, but NOT in position 3 (since O was marked ✓ in position 3 in PHONE, but that would imply it is in the correct position, yet we know from the rules that ✓ means correct position. Wait, this is ambiguous. Actually, the feedback for PHONE was P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). So O is in position 3.  
- It does NOT contain S, T, A, R, P, H, or N.  
- So the word is of the form: _ _ O _ E.

Remaining letters not tested: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to choose a word that fits _ _ O _ E, uses only letters not eliminated so far, and is a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:  
- M O V E (but O is in position 2, not 3)  
- C O V E (O in position 2)  
- C O I N E (invalid)  
- M O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- C O M E (but needs 5 letters)  
- B O U N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- L O V E (invalid, needs 5 letters)  
- D O U S E (invalid, S is eliminated)  
- G O U G E (invalid, G is allowed but check positions)  

Actually, _ _ O _ E is the pattern we need. Let’s list possible words:  
- B O U C E (invalid, not a word)  
- C O U P E (invalid, P is eliminated)  
- C O I F E (invalid)  
- D O U C E (invalid)  
- G O U G E (but G not tested, and U and G are allowed; G O U G E is a 5-letter word)  
- B O U G E (invalid, not a word)  
- B O I L E (invalid, L is allowed but I not tested)  
- F O U N D (invalid, N is eliminated)  
- F O U N E (invalid)  
- C O U L E (invalid)  
- C O I N E (invalid, N is eliminated)  

""GOUGE"" fits the required pattern: G _ _ _ E, with O in position 3 and E in position 5. It doesn’t use any eliminated letters (S, T, A, R, P, H, N) and introduces G and U to test new letters.

But wait, let’s re-examine the pattern. The known positions are:
- Position 3: O (from PHONE’s O(✓))  
- Position 5: E (from both guesses)  

So the word is: _ _ O _ E.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. Let me list valid options:
- BOOKE (invalid)  
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COUPE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- DOGIE (invalid, G not eliminated but I not tested)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  
- DOVIE (invalid)  
- GOUGE (valid word: G O U G E) – uses G and U, fits _ _ O _ E.  

But ""GOUGE"" has O in position 2, not 3. Wait, no: GOUGE is G O U G E, so positions are:
G (1), O (2), U (3), G (4), E (5). But position 3 must be O, so GOUGE is invalid because O is in position 2.

Ah, I misread. The feedback for PHONE was O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. In PHONE, O is in position 3, so O must be in position 3 in the secret word. So the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOOGE (invalid)  
- BOOZE (invalid, Z is allowed but uncommon)  
- COOLE (invalid)  
- COOKE (invalid)  
- DOOLE (invalid)  
- DOOM E (invalid)  
- FOOD E (invalid)  
- G OO E (invalid)  
- HO O K E (invalid, H eliminated)  
- LOOKE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- RO O K E (invalid, R eliminated)  
- S OO T E (invalid, S eliminated)  
- W OO D E (invalid)  

Actually, the only common word I can think of is ""BOOZE"" but B, O, O, Z, E. But O is in position 3, so B _ O _ E.  
- B O _ _ E: No, the pattern is _ _ O _ E.

Valid words:
- BROKE (but R is eliminated)  
- CLOKE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (O in position 3, fits _ _ O _ E) – D O G I E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
- G O U G E: O in position 2.  
- D O U C E: O in position 2.  

I realize now that very few standard English words fit _ _ O _ E. Let me search mentally:
- BOUGE (invalid)  
- COOZE (invalid)  
- DOOZE (invalid)  
- MOOKE (invalid)  
- POOZE (invalid, P eliminated)  
- WOOSH (invalid)  
- GLOOP (invalid)  

This is harder than expected. Let me re-examine possible words fitting _ _ O _ E:
- BOGLE (invalid)  
- FOULE (invalid, U in position 3 but O in position 2)  
- MOULE (invalid)  
- DOGIE (invalid)  
- VOULE (invalid)  
- DOUCE (invalid)  

Wait, ""VOICE"" is V O I C E: O is in position 2, not 3.  
""COUCH"" is 5 letters but ends in H, not E.  

""BOOZE"" is the closest: B O O Z E, but O is in position 2.  

Upon reflection, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, and the secret word must have O in position 3. Valid words:
- BROKE (R eliminated)  
- CHOKE (H and K not tested, but H is eliminated)  
- SPOKE (S and P eliminated)  
- PLOKE (invalid)  

""CHOKE"" uses C, H, O, K, E. But H is eliminated (from PHONE: H(x)), so invalid.  
""CLOKE"" is invalid.  
""GLOBE"" is G L O B E, so O in position 3, E in position 5. This fits: _ _ O _ E. Letters: G, L, O, B, E. G, L, B are new and not eliminated (only S, T, A, R, P, H, N are out).  

""GLOBE"" is a valid word fitting the pattern.

<guess>GLOBE</guess>Based on the feedback, the word ends in E and has O in the third position, while excluding S, T, A, R, P, H, and N. A valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ _ O _ E is:

<guess>GLOBE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PHONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GLOBE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

1. The word ends in E (position 5 = ✓).
2. The word contains O and it MUST be in position 3 (from Guess 2 PHONE: O(✓)).
   Therefore the pattern is fixed: _ _ O _ E.
3. Letters already eliminated:
   – From STARE: S, T, A, R
   – From PHONE: P, H, N
   – From GLOBE: G, L, B

So any remaining candidate must:
- Fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E
- Use only letters not in {S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B}

Still-allowed letters (common ones): C, D, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting _ _ O _ E with these constraints.
Brainstorming:

- D O U C E – invalid (C is allowed, but not a word)
- F O U N T – invalid (ends in T)
- M O U S E – invalid (contains S)
- C O U C E – invalid
- V O I C E – invalid (O not in position 3)
- D O G I E – invalid (G is eliminated)
- C H O K E – invalid (H eliminated)
- J O K E – too short
- M O I S T – wrong ending
- F O I L E – invalid
- C O U P E – invalid (P eliminated)
- M O U L E – valid word: M O U L E → positions: M(1) O(2) U(3) L(4) E(5) – but O is not in position 3 here.
- D O U C E – invalid
- K N O T S – wrong ending
- D O I L E – invalid
- C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)
- C O I F E – invalid
- C O U D E – invalid
- M O U S E – invalid (S)
- V I O L E – V I O L E → O in position 3, E in position 5, and V, I, O, L, E. L is eliminated (from GLOBE), so invalid.
- W O O D E – invalid
- C O O Z E – invalid (Z)
- D O O Z E – invalid
- C O M E T – wrong ending
- C O V E R – wrong ending
- C O M B E – invalid (B eliminated)
- C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)
- C O U L E – invalid
- C O W E R – wrong ending
- C O R E Y – wrong ending

Actually, the word “VIOLE” contains V, I, O, L, E – but L is eliminated.  
The word “MOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “DOUSE” contains S – eliminated.  
The word “JOULE” contains J, O, U, L, E – L is eliminated.  
The word “COUPE” contains P – eliminated.  
The word “CHOKE” contains H – eliminated.  
The word “CLOVE” contains L – eliminated.  
The word “CHORE” contains H and R – eliminated.  
The word “CROME” – invalid.  

After checking, the only valid English word that fits _ _ O _ E using only still-allowed letters is:

C O M E T – but ends in T (invalid).  
The correct word that fits is “MOVIE” – but O is not in position 3.  

Wait – “MOVIE” is M-O-V-I-E → O is in position 2, not 3.  

Realizing that very few words fit the exact pattern _ _ O _ E without using eliminated letters. One valid word I can think of is:

C O I N E – invalid (N eliminated)  
C O R D E – R eliminated  
C O R S E – R and S eliminated  
C O M P E – P eliminated  
C O M B E – B eliminated  
C O N G E – N, G eliminated  
C O M M E – invalid  
C O N N E – invalid  
C O M M E – invalid  

I’m left with one valid option I can confirm:  
“COVEE” – non-standard.  
“COZIE” – valid, uses C, O, Z, I, E. None of these letters are eliminated.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Breaking down the feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E is fixed in position 5)
2. Letters CONFIRMED to exist:
   - O (from PHONE: O(✓) in position 3, but COZIE shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but NOT in position 3)
   - Therefore O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
3. Letters ELIMINATED so far:
   S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B, C, Z, I
4. Still-available letters (excluding duplicates and the eliminated set):
   D, F, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains O somewhere NOT in position 3
- Uses only the still-available letters

Valid English words fitting these constraints:
- DOUZE (invalid, U and Z; Z eliminated)
- FOVE? (invalid)
- JOKER (invalid, K not tested but R eliminated)
- MOVED (invalid, D not eliminated but ends in D)
- WOVEN (invalid, N eliminated)
- WOOZE (invalid, Z eliminated)
- DOZER (invalid, Z and R eliminated)
- DOUSE (invalid, S eliminated)
- FOYER (invalid, R eliminated)
- MOVER (invalid, R eliminated)
- MOWER (invalid, W not eliminated, R eliminated)
- DOJER (invalid)
- DOZER (invalid)
- DOPEY (invalid, P eliminated)
- DOXIE (invalid, I eliminated)
- DOGIE (invalid, G eliminated)
- DOZIE (invalid, Z and I eliminated)

After checking, the only remaining valid word that fits is ""DOYEN"" but it's 5 letters and ends in N (eliminated).

Wait, let me re-examine. The pattern is _ _ _ _ E, O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, and no eliminated letters. The remaining letters are: D, F, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y.

Valid words:
- FOYER - invalid (R eliminated)
- MOXIE - invalid (I and X allowed, but I is eliminated)
- DOUYA - invalid
- DOUVE - invalid (V allowed, but not a word)
- DOUAR - invalid (R eliminated)
- FOUET - invalid (T eliminated)
- MOUES - invalid (S eliminated)
- MOULD - invalid (L eliminated)
- MOVED - invalid (D allowed, V allowed, but ends in D)
- MOWED - invalid (W allowed, D allowed, but ends in D)
- MOWER - invalid (R eliminated)
- JOWED - invalid (J allowed, W allowed, D allowed, but ends in D)
- JOWEY - invalid (Y allowed, but not a word)
- JOKED - invalid (K allowed, D allowed, but ends in D)
- JOKER - invalid (R eliminated)
- JOKEY - valid word: J, O, K, E, Y. J and K haven't been tested, O is allowed in position 2, Y allowed, E in position 5.

Thus, ""JOKEY"" is the only remaining valid candidate that fits all constraints.

Let’s extract every constraint from all feedback so far.

1. Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
   (E is fixed in position 5, confirmed by every guess.)

2. Letters confirmed present:
   - O – must be in the word, but:
     • PHONE had O(✓) in position 3 – but COZIE and JOKEY both have O(-), i.e. O is present but **not** in position 3.  
       Therefore O **must** be in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. Letters **eliminated** (x in any position):
   S, T, A, R, P, H, N, G, L, B, C, Z, I, J, K, Y

   Remaining available alphabet letters (never yet guessed):
   D, F, M, Q, U, V, W, X

4. We need a 5-letter English word that:
   - ends with E
   - contains O in position 1, 2, or 4
   - uses only letters from {D, F, M, Q, U, V, W, X} plus O and the final E.

Let’s list possible slot placements for O:

   Case 1 – O in position 1:  
        O _ _ _ E → candidate word must be O + 3 letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X} + E.  
        Valid English word: O U F E – invalid (4 letters).  
        O F U D E – invalid (no dictionary word).  
        O V E R – invalid (R eliminated).  
        None found.

   Case 2 – O in position 2:  
        _ O _ _ E → 1st and 4th letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X}.  
        Possibilities:  
        - FOUDE – invalid  
        - V O U C E – C eliminated  
        - D O U V E – valid dictionary word “DOUVE” (a nautical term) – but very obscure.  
        - M O U V E – invalid  
        - F O U D E – invalid  

        Closest real word is “DOUVE”, but it's uncommon.  
        Another is “DOUCE” but C is eliminated.

   Case 3 – O in position 4:  
        _ _ _ O E → 1st, 2nd, 3rd letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X}.  
        Check:  
        - D U M O E – invalid  
        - F U M O E – invalid  
        - V U M O E – invalid  
        - W U M O E – invalid  
        - D U V O E – invalid  

        Only real English word that fits is “FORGE” but G and R are eliminated, and O is in position 2. No standard word appears.

Reviewing again, the **only** remaining valid English word that meets all constraints is:

   “DUMVE” – invalid  
   “VOMUE” – invalid  
   “FOUVE” – invalid  

After exhaustive checking, **no common English word** satisfies the exact pattern and letter restrictions. However, one obscure but valid word is “DOUVE”.

Given the strict constraints, “DOUVE” is the only possible candidate left.

The constraints leave only one obscure but valid word:

3. Letters **eliminated** (x in any position):

        O _ _ _ E → candidate word must be O + 3 letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X} + E.  
        Valid English word: O U F E – invalid (4 letters).  
        O F U D E – invalid (no dictionary word).  
        O V E R – invalid (R eliminated).  
        None found.

   Case 2 – O in position 2:  
        _ O _ _ E → 1st and 4th letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X}.  
        Possibilities:  
        - FOUDE – invalid  
        - V O U C E – C eliminated  
        - D O U V E – valid dictionary word “DOUVE” (a nautical term) – but very obscure.  
        - M O U V E – invalid  
        - F O U D E – invalid  

        Closest real word is “DOUVE”, but it's uncommon.  
        Another is “DOUCE” but C is eliminated.

   Case 3 – O in position 4:  
        _ _ _ O E → 1st, 2nd, 3rd letters from {D,F,M,Q,U,V,W,X}.  
        Check:  
        - D U M O E – invalid  
        - F U M O E – invalid  
        - V U M O E – invalid  
        - W U M O E – invalid  
        - D U V O E – invalid  

        Only real English word that fits is “FORGE” but G and R are eliminated, and O is in position 2. No standard word appears.

Reviewing again, the **only** remaining valid English word that meets all constraints is:

   “DUMVE” – invalid  
   “VOMUE” – invalid  
   “FOUVE” – invalid  

After exhaustive checking, **no common English word** satisfies the exact pattern and letter restrictions. However, one obscure but valid word is “DOUVE”.

Given the strict constraints, “DOUVE” is the only possible candidate left.The constraints leave only one obscure but valid word:",Guess 6: DOUVE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) U(x) V(-) E(✓),FAIL
