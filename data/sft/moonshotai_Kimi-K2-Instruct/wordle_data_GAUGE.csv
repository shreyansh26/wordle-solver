For the first guess, I want to choose a word that's likely to reveal as much information as possible about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a common 5-letter word with frequently used letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Not repeat any letters (to maximize information gain)
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

From the first guess (SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)):
- E is correct and in the 5th position.
- A appears in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- S, L, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. A is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Cannot use S, L, T.
4. Need to test new consonants and find vowel positions.

Good next choice uses common remaining consonants (R, N, C, H, etc.) while placing A in one of the possible spots and avoiding S/L/T. A word like CRANE would test C, R, N in new positions plus moves A to spot 2 (though we know A can't be 2), so that's bad.

Better: RACON (but O and N not tested yet), or RANCE (but C and N). Actually, simplest is to keep A in spot 1 or 3 and introduce R, N, C, H.

Let's use RANCH: R and N and C and H are all new consonants; A is in spot 1 (valid since A can be 1st); ends in E? No, so can't be.

Instead, let's test A in spot 3 and use two new consonants plus a new vowel: CRANE won't work. Let's try BRAVE:
- B: new

So current constraints:  
1. Word ends with E.  
2. A appears exactly once and only in positions 1, 3.  
3. Eliminated letters: S, L, T, B, R, V.  

Remaining common letters to test: C, D, N, G, H, M, P, Y, plus vowels I, O, U (since we know A and E are used).  

To maximize information, I want to test two new common consonants and see where A fits. A good candidate is MANDY:
- M: new  
- A in position 2? But we know A can’t be in 2. So MANDY is invalid.  

Next: CANDY:  
- C: new  
- A in position 2? Again invalid.  

I need A in position 1 or 3. Let’s try A in 1:  
APPLE: A, P, P, L, E. L is eliminated, so no.  

ANCHOR: too long.  

Let’s try PIANO: but ends in O, not E.  

Best simple word: CAGED.  
- C, G, D are new.  
- A in position 2? No, violates constraint.  

Next: CHAIN: ends in N.  

Let’s try A in position 3:  
P A C E R – but R is eliminated.  

DANCE: ends in E, A in 3.  
- D: new  
- N: new  
- C: new  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 5 (fixed)  

DANCE respects all constraints and tests three new consonants.

From the three guesses we now have:

2. BRAVE → B(x) R(x) A(-) V(x) E(✓)
3. DANCE → D(x) A(✓) N(x) C(x) E(✓)

Key facts extracted:
- The word ends in E (position 5 confirmed twice).
- A is now confirmed to be in position 2 (from DANCE feedback: A(✓)).
- Letters already eliminated: S, L, T, B, R, V, D, N, C.
- Still need positions 1, 3, 4 (letters not yet placed).

Available letters (common 5-letter consonants + vowels not yet used):
- Consonants left: F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y, Z
- Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are placed)

We need:
- Position 1: any remaining consonant or vowel (except eliminated ones)
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: any remaining letter
- Position 4: any remaining letter
- Position 5: E (fixed)

A good strategy: pick a word that tests as many new letters as possible while fitting A in position 2 and E in position 5. Let’s look for common words:

Possible candidates:
- F A I R E → but ""FAIRE"" is an old spelling, might not be valid.
- M A I Z E → ""MAIZE"" is valid (corn), but Z is less common.
- P A I N E → ""PAINE"" is a surname, less common.
- G A M E S → but S is eliminated.
- H A I K E → not a word.
- G A I N E → not valid.

""MAIZE"" is the best common word fitting the constraints and testing new letters: M, A, I, Z, E. But M was not eliminated yet? Wait, eliminated letters: S, L, T, B, R, V, D, N, C. M is still available.

Let me double-check: eliminated from all feedback are S, L, T, B, R, V, D, N, C. So M is still allowed.

Thus, ""MAIZE"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""PAKIE"" – not a word.
""W A I V E"" – V is eliminated.
""G A I N E"" – N is eliminated.
""K A I S E"" – S is eliminated.

""MAIZE"" seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The best strategy is to use a common 5-letter word with frequently used letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters
2. Not repeat any letters (to maximize information gain)
3. Be a valid 5-letter word

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

Current constraints after four guesses:

1. Pattern: _ A _ _ E  (A at 2, E at 5 are confirmed ✓)
2. Eliminated letters so far:
   - From SLATE: S, L, T
   - From BRAVE: B, R, V
   - From DANCE: D, N, C
   - From MAIZE: M, I, Z

   So totally gone: S, L, T, B, R, V, D, N, C, M, I, Z

3. Available letters (not used yet):
   - Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y
   - Vowels: O, U (A and E already placed; I eliminated)

4. Need the two missing letters for positions 1 and 3.

5. Prefer common words. Looking for 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ E and use only remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
   - F A K E ? – needs 4th letter.
   - H A K E ? – same.
   - G A M E ? – M is eliminated.
   - P A G E ? – G, E are ok, but needs 4th letter.
   - G A P E ? – gap is 3 letters, but we need 5-letter word.

Let’s try common words:
   - H A P P Y – Y is available, but P is available, pattern _ A _ _ E.
   - H A V E ? – V eliminated.
   - K A P E ? – needs 4th letter.
   - J A C K E – C is eliminated.
   - F A C E ? – C eliminated.
   - P A U S E – S eliminated.
   - F A U C E – C eliminated.
   - G A U G E – G is available, U is available, pattern G A U G E – but needs to check if G is used twice? G is available, so ""GAUGE"" is valid.
   - H A U L E – not a word.
   - P A U L E – not a common 5-letter word.

""GAUGE"" is a valid word, uses only remaining letters, and fits the pattern.

Check letters:
   - G: available
   - A: confirmed at 2
   - U: available
   - G: available (repetition allowed since G not eliminated)
   - E: confirmed at 5

Thus, ""GAUGE"" is the best next guess.
