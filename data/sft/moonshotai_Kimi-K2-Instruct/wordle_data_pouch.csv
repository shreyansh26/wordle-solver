- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The most common letters in English words are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, and L. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many different letters as possible.

One popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and helps narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it also uses five highly common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for this first guess since it tests slightly different letters compared to ""SLATE"" and gives good coverage.

This way, no matter what the feedback is, I'll have useful information to narrow down the possible words significantly for my next guesses.

Feedback on “arose”:

- O (-) – is in the word, but not in position 3.

Known facts:
1. The word contains an “O” somewhere other than the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are completely absent.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good letters to test next from the remaining common set: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y.
I’ll pick a word that:
- includes the known “O”,
- avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E,
- places the “O” in a new position,
- introduces several new, high-frequency letters.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T
- Letters known to be in the word (in the correct positions):
  – P in position 1 (✓)
  – O in position 2 (✓)

So the secret word looks like: P O _ _ _

Remaining common letters to test (excluding the ones already ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

We need three more letters to fill positions 3-5. I’ll choose a word that:
1. Keeps P and O in positions 1 and 2.
2. Uses letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

“POUND” seems like a good candidate:
- P and O are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- U, N, D: N was ruled out (x), so skip N.

“POUCH”:
- P, O confirmed.
- U, C, H: none have been ruled out yet.

“POWER”:
- E is ruled out.

“POLYP”:
- But P is already used and we only need one P.

“PODGY”:
- D, G, Y: none ruled out yet.

I’ll go with “PODGY” as it introduces three new, fairly common letters.

But wait, “PODGY” uses G and Y which are less common. Let me pick a word with more common remaining letters.

How about “POUCH”:
- P (✓), O (✓), U (new), C (new), H (new)

Yes, this seems better.
