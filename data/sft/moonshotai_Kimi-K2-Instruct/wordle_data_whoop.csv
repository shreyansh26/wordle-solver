For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to start with a word that has:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), and all letters are unique.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means every remaining candidate must exclude R, A, I, S, and E entirely.

A good second-guess word should:
1. Contain none of the eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E).
2. Pack in other common consonants and vowels (like O, U, T, N, L, C, H, etc.) to maximize information gain.
3. Ideally include both remaining vowels (O, U) plus frequent consonants (T, N, L).

A strong option that meets these criteria is “COUNT”:
- Letters: C, O, U, N, T

- Uses both remaining high-frequency vowels (O, U) and three fresh consonants (C, N, T).

So far:
- Letters ruled out entirely: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T
- Letter known to be in the word but in the wrong spot: O (it appeared in COUNT but was marked “-”, so it is somewhere in the word but not in position 2).

Remaining unused vowels: O (already known to be present), plus Y if we consider it as a vowel-sometimes letter.
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (since we know O is in the word somewhere).
2. Contains none of the already-eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T).
3. Avoids putting O in the second position.

A quick scan of common patterns: words with O in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 and using only the still-allowed consonants.

Good candidates:
- DOUGH → but G and H are still allowed, and D is allowed; however, the word contains U, which is eliminated.
- BOOTH → O is in position 2 (disallowed), plus H is allowed, but again U is eliminated.
- BLOOM → L, M allowed; but O is in position 2 (disallowed).
- GLOOM → same issue with O in position 2.
- DOWDY → W and Y allowed, but we’re not sure about double letters yet; also, D is allowed.
- HOBBY → H, B, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- JOLLY → J, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- MOODY → M, D, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- POLYP → P, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- WOOZY → W, Z, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).

Most of these have O in position 2, which we must avoid. Let’s look for words with O in other positions.

Looking for words like:
- BLOWY → B, L, W, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- DOWDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- FOGGY → F, G, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- HOPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- KOOKY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- LOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- MOMMY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- POPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- BOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).

This is a bit tricky. Let’s try words with O in position 1:
- ODDLY → D, L, Y allowed; no eliminated letters.
- OFFLY → but OFFLY is not a valid word.
- OMBRE → contains R and E (eliminated).
- OPENS → contains E and N (eliminated).
- OXBOW → contains X, B, W; but W is allowed; OXBOW is a valid word, but we might prefer something simpler.

Another angle: words with O in position 3 or 4.
- BHOOT → but H is allowed, but this is not a common word.
- BROOD → R is eliminated.
- DROOL → R and L, but R is eliminated.
- FLOOD → F, L, D allowed; O in position 3.
- GLOOM → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- KNOCK → K allowed, but C is eliminated.
- MOLDO → D allowed, but again not a common word.
- MOLDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- PLODD → D allowed, but O in position 2 (disallowed).
- SLOSH → S is eliminated.
- SLOTH → S and T eliminated.
- WHOOP → W, H, P allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- WOOZY → O in position 2 (disallowed).

Best valid candidate so far: FLOOD
- Letters: F, L, O, O, D

- Letters ruled out entirely: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T
- Letter known to be in the word but in the wrong spot: O (it appeared in COUNT but was marked “-”, so it is somewhere in the word but not in position 2).

Remaining unused vowels: O (already known to be present), plus Y if we consider it as a vowel-sometimes letter.
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (since we know O is in the word somewhere).
2. Contains none of the already-eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T).
3. Avoids putting O in the second position.

A quick scan of common patterns: words with O in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 and using only the still-allowed consonants.

Good candidates:
- DOUGH → but G and H are still allowed, and D is allowed; however, the word contains U, which is eliminated.
- BOOTH → O is in position 2 (disallowed), plus H is allowed, but again U is eliminated.
- BLOOM → L, M allowed; but O is in position 2 (disallowed).
- GLOOM → same issue with O in position 2.
- DOWDY → W and Y allowed, but we’re not sure about double letters yet; also, D is allowed.
- HOBBY → H, B, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- JOLLY → J, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- MOODY → M, D, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- POLYP → P, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- WOOZY → W, Z, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).

Most of these have O in position 2, which we must avoid. Let’s look for words with O in other positions.

Looking for words like:
- BLOWY → B, L, W, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- DOWDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- FOGGY → F, G, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- HOPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- KOOKY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- LOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- MOMMY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- POPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- BOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).

This is a bit tricky. Let’s try words with O in position 1:
- ODDLY → D, L, Y allowed; no eliminated letters.
- OFFLY → but OFFLY is not a valid word.
- OMBRE → contains R and E (eliminated).
- OPENS → contains E and N (eliminated).
- OXBOW → contains X, B, W; but W is allowed; OXBOW is a valid word, but we might prefer something simpler.

Another angle: words with O in position 3 or 4.
- BHOOT → but H is allowed, but this is not a common word.
- BROOD → R is eliminated.
- DROOL → R and L, but R is eliminated.
- FLOOD → F, L, D allowed; O in position 3.
- GLOOM → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- KNOCK → K allowed, but C is eliminated.
- MOLDO → D allowed, but again not a common word.
- MOLDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).
- PLODD → D allowed, but O in position 2 (disallowed).
- SLOSH → S is eliminated.
- SLOTH → S and T eliminated.
- WHOOP → W, H, P allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).
- WOOZY → O in position 2 (disallowed).

Best valid candidate so far: FLOOD
- Letters: F, L, O, O, D
- Uses only allowed letters (F, L, D, O; no R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T)
- O appears in positions 3 and 4, so at least one O is not in position 2
- Common word

Another candidate: BHOOT is not valid. GHOUL has U (eliminated).

FLOOD seems the best fit.

From the new feedback:

- FLOOD ⇒ F(x) L(x) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)

This tells us:
1. Both O’s are in the correct positions: O must be in positions 3 and 4.
2. Letters F, L, D are not in the word at all.
3. Therefore the secret word has the fixed letters _ _ O O _.

Still-allowed letters (none have been eliminated yet except the ones we already ruled out: R,A,I,S,E,C,U,N,T,F,L,D).

Eligible pool of remaining consonants: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Eligible remaining vowels: none left except the two O’s we already placed.

So we need a 5-letter word of the pattern:

Common real words matching that pattern:

A common strategy is to start with a word that has:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeating letters

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), and all letters are unique.

A good second-guess word should:
1. Contain none of the eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E).
2. Pack in other common consonants and vowels (like O, U, T, N, L, C, H, etc.) to maximize information gain.
3. Ideally include both remaining vowels (O, U) plus frequent consonants (T, N, L).

A strong option that meets these criteria is “COUNT”:
- Letters: C, O, U, N, T
- None of R, A, I, S, E appear.
- Uses both remaining high-frequency vowels (O, U) and three fresh consonants (C, N, T).

Ideally include both remaining vowels (O, U) plus frequent consonants (T, N, L).\n\nA strong option that meets these criteria is “COUNT”:\n- Letters: C, O, U, N, T\n- None of R, A, I, S, E appear.\n- Uses both remaining high-frequency vowels (O, U) and three fresh consonants (C, N, T).\n\nSo I’ll guess COUNT.\n\n<guess>COUNT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far:\n- Letters ruled out entirely: R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T\n- Letter known to be in the word but in the wrong spot: O (it appeared in COUNT but was marked “-”, so it is somewhere in the word but not in position 2).\n\nRemaining unused vowels: O (already known to be present), plus Y if we consider it as a vowel-sometimes letter.\nRemaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains O (since we know O is in the word somewhere).\n2. Contains none of the already-eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T).\n3. Avoids putting O in the second position.\n\nA quick scan of common patterns: words with O in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 and using only the still-allowed consonants.\n\nGood candidates:\n- DOUGH → but G and H are still allowed, and D is allowed; however, the word contains U, which is eliminated.\n- BOOTH → O is in position 2 (disallowed), plus H is allowed, but again U is eliminated.\n- BLOOM → L, M allowed; but O is in position 2 (disallowed).\n- GLOOM → same issue with O in position 2.\n- DOWDY → W and Y allowed, but we’re not sure about double letters yet; also, D is allowed.\n- HOBBY → H, B, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- JOLLY → J, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- MOODY → M, D, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- POLYP → P, L, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- WOOZY → W, Z, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n\nMost of these have O in position 2, which we must avoid. Let’s look for words with O in other positions.\n\nLooking for words like:\n- BLOWY → B, L, W, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- DOWDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- FOGGY → F, G, Y allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- HOPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- KOOKY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- LOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- MOMMY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- POPPY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- BOBBY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let’s try words with O in position 1:\n- ODDLY → D, L, Y allowed; no eliminated letters.\n- OFFLY → but OFFLY is not a valid word.\n- OMBRE → contains R and E (eliminated).\n- OPENS → contains E and N (eliminated).\n- OXBOW → contains X, B, W; but W is allowed; OXBOW is a valid word, but we might prefer something simpler.\n\nAnother angle: words with O in position 3 or 4.\n- BHOOT → but H is allowed, but this is not a common word.\n- BROOD → R is eliminated.\n- DROOL → R and L, but R is eliminated.\n- FLOOD → F, L, D allowed; O in position 3.\n- GLOOM → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- KNOCK → K allowed, but C is eliminated.\n- MOLDO → D allowed, but again not a common word.\n- MOLDY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- PLODD → D allowed, but O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- SLOSH → S is eliminated.\n- SLOTH → S and T eliminated.\n- WHOOP → W, H, P allowed; O in position 2 (disallowed).\n- WOOZY → O in position 2 (disallowed).\n\nBest valid candidate so far: FLOOD\n- Letters: F, L, O, O, D\n- Uses only allowed letters (F, L, D, O; no R, A, I, S, E, C, U, N, T)\n- O appears in positions 3 and 4, so at least one O is not in position 2\n- Common word\n\nAnother candidate: BHOOT is not valid. GHOUL has U (eliminated).\n\nFLOOD seems the best fit.\n\n<guess>FLOOD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLOOD -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback:\n\n- FLOOD ⇒ F(x) L(x) O(✓) O(✓) D(x)\n\nThis tells us:\n1.

Let’s update what we now know.

1. Pattern locked so far: _ _ O O _
   – from FLOOD feedback: O is in positions 3 and 4.

2. Letters tried and their results:
   - H: appears in HOOKY as first letter but marked “-”, so H is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - K: marked “x”, so K is not in the word at all.
   - Y: marked “x”, so Y is not in the word at all.

3. Already eliminated letters (from all feedback):  
   R, A, I, S, E (from RAISE)  
   C, U, N, T (from COUNT)  
   F, L, D (from FLOOD)  
   K, Y (from HOOKY)

4. Still-possible consonants for the remaining slots (positions 1, 2, 5) and for the possible H:
   B, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z   (plus the known H must appear somewhere)

5. H cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (those are O) and cannot be in position 1 (from HOOKY feedback).  
   So H must appear in position 2 or 5.

6. We need a common 5-letter word fitting:
   - Positions 3 & 4 = O, O
   - Uses only allowed letters
   - Contains an H in position 2 or 5.

Look at valid words:
- If H is in position 2: pattern becomes [B/G/J/M/P/Q/V/W/X/Z] H O O [B/G/J/M/P/Q/V/W/X/Z]
  Example: BHOOT → but H in position 2, last letter T (eliminated) – invalid.
  Next: WHOOP → P allowed, but P in position 5. Check letters: W, H, O, O, P – all allowed so far. This looks valid.

- If H is in position 5: pattern [ ] [ ] O O H
  Example: BOOHM – not a word.
  GOOCH – C eliminated.
  MOOCH – C eliminated.
  POOCH – C eliminated.
  SMOOH – S eliminated.
  The only real common word that fits with H in position 5 is BOOCH (C eliminated), so that path is blocked.

Thus WHOOP is left as the only common word that fits all constraints.

Check: W H O O P
- No eliminated letters.
- H in position 2 (allowed by feedback).
- Matches _ _ O O _.

Therefore, the next best guess is WHOOP.
