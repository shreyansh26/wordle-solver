For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Common strong first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and is a valid word.

   - The word contains the letter E but NOT in the 5th position.
   - The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

3. Good next step: choose a word that contains E in a different position and uses other common letters that have not been eliminated. Common letters still in play include R, N, O, I, C, U, Y, etc.

From all feedback:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, D.  
Letters we now know are in the word: O (position 2) and E (position 4).  
Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from ROBED).  

So far:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = E
- R must appear in positions 3 or 5 (since 1 is excluded for R and 2,4 are taken).
- We still need two more letters, avoiding the 8 already ruled out.

Common remaining letters: F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word pattern: _ O _ E _  or  _ O _ E R (since R could be last).

Candidate patterns:
- _ O R E _  (but R can’t be in position 3 if we try _ O R E _)
- _ O _ E R (R at 5)

Looking at the second pattern: _ O _ E R
We need a letter for position 1 and 3 from the still-allowed pool.

Good letters: F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible choices:
- P O K E R  (P, K not yet excluded)
- H O U E R  (but HOUER isn’t a valid English word)
- G O F E R  (G, F not excluded yet)
- P O K E R is valid and uses P (pos 1) and K (pos 3), both still allowed.

So ""POKER"" fits all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

Common strong first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and is a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>1. From the feedback on SLATE:
   - S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (marked x).
   - E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

2. We now know:
   - The word contains the letter E but NOT in the 5th position.
   - The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

3. Good next step: choose a word that contains E in a different position and uses other common letters that have not been eliminated. Common letters still in play include R, N, O, I, C, U, Y, etc.

4. A strong second guess that follows this strategy is ""CRONE"" (C, R, O, N, E). This uses:
   - E in the 5th position (testing if it belongs here, since previous E was in 5th but wrong position)
   - New common letters C, R, O, N that weren't eliminated

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses and their feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   - S, L, A, T are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. CRONE → C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)  
   - C, N are NOT in the word.  
   - R, O, E are in the word but all in wrong positions.  

Known facts so far:
- Letters in word: E, R, O  
- Letters NOT in word: S, L, A, T, C, N  
- E is NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SLATE and CRONE).  
- R is NOT in position 2 (from CRONE).  
- O is NOT in position 3 (from CRONE).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, R, O.  
- Uses none of the excluded letters.  
- Places each of E, R, O in new positions that haven’t been ruled out.

Looking at remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “ROBED”:
- Contains R, O, E.  
- B and D are common and not eliminated.  
- Positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5).  
- These positions haven’t been ruled out for any of R, O, E.

Thus, “ROBED” is a strong next guess.
