- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good distribution of common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to test as many frequently occurring letters as possible in meaningful positions. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R. A good starting word should contain several of these. 

""AROSE"" is often cited as an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (very common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 highly probable letters in reasonable positions to test their placement in the secret word.

Now we have:

Pattern: C R O _ _  (positions 1-3 are locked)
Letters already ruled out: A, S, E, G, I, N, F, T

Remaining eligible letters for the last two spots (positions 4 and 5) among the unused alphabet:
B D H J K L M P Q U V W X Y Z

We need a real 5-letter word that starts with CRO and ends with two of those letters.

Quick scan of possibilities:
- CROCK – but K is allowed, and C is repeated (allowed).  
- CROWD – but D is allowed, W is allowed.  
- CROME – E is out.  
- CROAK – A is out.  
- CROCK and CROWD are the most common English words left.

Between them, CROCK repeats C (which we already know is in the word), so while it’s valid, it tests fewer new letters.  
CROWD introduces W and D, both untested, giving more information.

Hence, CROWD is the better guess.
