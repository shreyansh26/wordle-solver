For the first guess, it's strategic to pick a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, N, T  
   (all shown as “x” at least once).

2. Letters we’ve seen but in the wrong spot:
   - O appeared in position 3 as ✓ in the first guess, but in the second guess it came back as “-”, i.e., still in the word but not in position 3.  
     Therefore O is definitely in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. I also showed up as “-”, so I is in the word somewhere, but not in position 3.

4. Current certainty about placement:
   - We have no letters locked into any specific position yet, but we know:
     - O must appear somewhere other than position 3.
     - I must appear somewhere other than position 3.

5. We need a word that:
   - Contains O and I.
   - Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
   - Has neither O nor I in position 3 (since both were “-” last time).
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at remaining common letters that are still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- Letters: D, O, U, G, H — none of them are on the forbidden list.
- O is present but not in position 3, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- I is not in the word, so this might not be optimal.

Another candidate: “COULD” – but L and D are allowed, C and U and L are allowed, but we need I.

Wait, DOUGH misses I.

We need to include both O and I.

Let’s try “COULD” without I — no good.

Let me list letters we can safely use:
Allowable consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Allowable vowels: I, O, U (O and I must both appear).

Let’s look for a word that uses O and I, avoids A, R, S, E, P, N, T, and keeps O and I out of position 3.

A valid word under these constraints is “CLOUD” but again misses I.

“COULD” is similar.

“GUILD” uses I, but G, U, I, L, D — only I is required, but O is missing.

“FOUL” is 4 letters.

“FOUL” + one more letter — let me actually just scan for a 5-letter word with O and I, avoiding the forbidden letters.

“DIOXY” is not common.

“COILY” – uses C, O, I, L, Y — all allowed letters.

- C: allowed
- O: allowed, not in position 3 (in position 2 here) ✅

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

We now know:
- Letters to avoid: A, R, S, E
- Letter to keep in position 3: O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.

Common consonants that are still allowed: D, T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.
Common vowels still allowed: I, U (O is already used).

A simple choice is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still allowed letters.
- O sits in the correct third position.

“POINT” fits the constraints: no forbidden letters and O in position 3.

1. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, N, T  
   (all shown as “x” at least once).

2. Letters we’ve seen but in the wrong spot:
   - O appeared in position 3 as ✓ in the first guess, but in the second guess it came back as “-”, i.e., still in the word but not in position 3.  
     Therefore O is definitely in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. I also showed up as “-”, so I is in the word somewhere, but not in position 3.

4. Current certainty about placement:
   - We have no letters locked into any specific position yet, but we know:
     - O must appear somewhere other than position 3.
     - I must appear somewhere other than position 3.

5. We need a word that:
   - Contains O and I.
   - Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
   - Has neither O nor I in position 3 (since both were “-” last time).
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at remaining common letters that are still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- Letters: D, O, U, G, H — none of them are on the forbidden list.
- O is present but not in position 3, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- I is not in the word, so this might not be optimal.

Another candidate: “COULD” – but L and D are allowed, C and U and L are allowed, but we need I.

Wait, DOUGH misses I.

We need to include both O and I.

Let’s try “COULD” without I — no good.

Let me list letters we can safely use:
Allowable consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Allowable vowels: I, O, U (O and I must both appear).

Let’s look for a word that uses O and I, avoids A, R, S, E, P, N, T, and keeps O and I out of position 3.

A valid word under these constraints is “CLOUD” but again misses I.

“COULD” is similar.

“GUILD” uses I, but G, U, I, L, D — only I is required, but O is missing.

“FOUL” is 4 letters.

“FOUL” + one more letter — let me actually just scan for a 5-letter word with O and I, avoiding the forbidden letters.

“DIOXY” is not common.

“COILY” – uses C, O, I, L, Y — all allowed letters.

- C: allowed
- O: allowed, not in position 3 (in position 2 here) ✅
- I: allowed, not in position 3 (position 3 is L here) ✅
- L and Y: both allowed.

“COILY” meets every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all “x” → none of those four letters appear anywhere in the target word.
- O is “✓” → the letter O is in position 3 of the secret word ( _ _ O _ _ ).

We now know:
- Letters to avoid: A, R, S, E
- Letter to keep in position 3: O

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.

Common consonants that are still allowed: D, T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.
Common vowels still allowed: I, U (O is already used).

A simple choice is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still allowed letters.
- O sits in the correct third position.

“POINT” fits the constraints: no forbidden letters and O in position 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, N, T  
   (all shown as “x” at least once).

2. Letters we’ve seen but in the wrong spot:
   - O appeared in position 3 as ✓ in the first guess, but in the second guess it came back as “-”, i.e., still in the word but not in position 3.  
     Therefore O is definitely in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. I also showed up as “-”, so I is in the word somewhere, but not in position 3.

4. Current certainty about placement:
   - We have no letters locked into any specific position yet, but we know:
     - O must appear somewhere other than position 3.
     - I must appear somewhere other than position 3.

5. We need a word that:
   - Contains O and I.
   - Does NOT contain any of A, R, S, E, P, N, T.
   - Has neither O nor I in position 3 (since both were “-” last time).
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at remaining common letters that are still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- Letters: D, O, U, G, H — none of them are on the forbidden list.
- O is present but not in position 3, satisfying the “-” feedback.
- I is not in the word, so this might not be optimal.

Another candidate: “COULD” – but L and D are allowed, C and U and L are allowed, but we need I.

Wait, DOUGH misses I.

We need to include both O and I.

Let’s try “COULD” without I — no good.

Let me list letters we can safely use:
Allowable consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Allowable vowels: I, O, U (O and I must both appear).

Let’s look for a word that uses O and I, avoids A, R, S, E, P, N, T, and keeps O and I out of position 3.

A valid word under these constraints is “CLOUD” but again misses I.

“COULD” is similar.

“GUILD” uses I, but G, U, I, L, D — only I is required, but O is missing.

“FOUL” is 4 letters.

“FOUL” + one more letter — let me actually just scan for a 5-letter word with O and I, avoiding the forbidden letters.

“DIOXY” is not common.

“COILY” – uses C, O, I, L, Y — all allowed letters.

- C: allowed
- O: allowed, not in position 3 (in position 2 here) ✅
- I: allowed, not in position 3 (position 3 is L here) ✅
- L and Y: both allowed.

“COILY” meets every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

2. Letters confirmed to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown  
   - O (first shown ✓ in position 3, then twice “-”)  
   - I (shown “-” twice)

   So the word definitely contains O and I, but neither O nor I is in position 3.

3. Remaining vowels still allowed  
   U is the only extra vowel we have not eliminated yet.

4. Still-available common consonants  
   D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, (and less frequent ones like B, J, Q, X, Z).

5. Positional constraints  
   - Position 3 may not be O or I.  
   - No other positional information yet.

6. Building a word  
   We need a 5-letter word that:
   - uses O and I (each not in position 3)  
   - avoids every forbidden letter  
   - preferably uses still-common letters to maximize information.

   Trying a word with O and I plus the safe remaining vowel U and common consonants:

   - If we place I in position 2 and O in position 4, we get: _ I _ O _

   Quickly scanning the dictionary for patterns like ? I ? O ?:  
   “FIORD” – but D is allowed and F, I, O, R, D; but R is forbidden.  
   “MIAOU” – has A (forbidden).  
   “WIMPY” – Y is forbidden.  
   “VIGOR” – R is forbidden.  
   “IDIOM” – D is allowed, M is allowed, but O is in position 4 and I appears twice (which is possible, but let’s look for single I).

   A clean candidate: “HUMID”  
   - H, U, M, I, D  
   - Contains I and O (oops – it has U, I, D, H, M but **no O**).  
   Reject.

   Another: “MODUS” – contains S (forbidden).  
   “AUDIO” – forbidden A and O in position 5 (which is allowed, but A is forbidden).  
   “ODIUM” – O in position 1, I in position 3 – but position 3 for I was “-” so I is NOT allowed there. Reject.

   Re-evaluate: we need O and I both present, neither at position 3.

   Safe consonants: D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W plus U.

   Try “FOGOU” – has F, O, G, O, U – no I.  
   Try “GOURD” – has G, O, U, R, D – R forbidden.  
   Try “KUDOS” – S forbidden.  
   Try “VODUM” – rare spelling.

   Realize we need a word that contains **both** O and I while avoiding all forbidden letters and avoiding O or I in position 3.

   A valid pattern: O in position 1, I in position 2, and common consonants:  
   O I _ _ _

   Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, U.

   “OIDUM” – too obscure.  
   “OIMIC” – C forbidden.  
   “OIMEL” – L forbidden.

   Another pattern: I in position 1, O in position 2: I O _ _ _

   “IODIC” – C forbidden.  
   “IODUM” – obscure.

   Pattern: O in position 2, I in position 4: _ O _ I _

   “DOING” – G allowed, N forbidden.  
   “FOILS” – S, L forbidden.  
   “GOING” – G allowed, N forbidden.  
   “HOICK” – C, K allowed but C forbidden.  
   “JOHIM” – J allowed, H, I, M allowed – but J not common and HIM sequence not yielding standard word.  
   “MOGUL” – L forbidden.  
   “WOMBY” – Y forbidden.

   Pattern: O in position 1, I in position 4: O _ _ I _

   “OUGHT” – T, H allowed but T forbidden.  
   “OUTDO” – T forbidden.  
   “OVIUM” – rare word but M, U allowed.

   “OVIUM” (plural of ovum) is a valid 5-letter English word containing O and I, avoids every forbidden letter, and neither O nor I is in position 3.  
   Letters: O (1), V, I (4), U, M – all permissible.

   Therefore, a sensible next guess is OVIUM.
