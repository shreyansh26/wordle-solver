Since this is my first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words with common vowels and consonants are ideal.

Some popular starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests many vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants + vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common letters)
- AUDIO (tests many vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (second most common vowel)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in common positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (✓) means the word starts with S and that position is correct.
- L (x), A (x), T (x), E (x) all indicate those letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with S (position 1 locked)
2. Letters L, A, T, E are not present anywhere in the word
3. Remaining positions (2-5) must use letters not in {L, A, T, E}

Good letters to try next would be common consonants and vowels not yet tested, like:
- R, N, I, O, U, D, P, C, M, etc.

A strong next guess would test new common consonants in position 2 and vowels in positions 3-4. ""SNORT"" tests:
- S (already confirmed ✓)
- N (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- T (but we know T is invalid from feedback)

Wait - T is invalid. Let me rethink.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words with common vowels and consonants are ideal.

Some popular starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests many vowels)
- SLATE (common consonants + vowels)
- CRANE (good mix of common letters)
- AUDIO (tests many vowels)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (second most common vowel)

This gives me good coverage of common letters in common positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (✓) means the word starts with S and that position is correct.
- L (x), A (x), T (x), E (x) all indicate those letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word starts with S (position 1 locked)
2. Letters L, A, T, E are not present anywhere in the word
3. Remaining positions (2-5) must use letters not in {L, A, T, E}

Good letters to try next would be common consonants and vowels not yet tested, like:
- R, N, I, O, U, D, P, C, M, etc.

A strong next guess would test new common consonants in position 2 and vowels in positions 3-4. ""SNORT"" tests:
- S (already confirmed ✓)
- N (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- T (but we know T is invalid from feedback)

Wait - T is invalid. Let me rethink.

Better options:
- SOUND (tests O, U, N, D)
- SPIND (tests P, I, N, D)
- SWORD (tests W, O, R, D)

I'll choose SWORD as it tests:
- S (✓)
- W (new common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- D (new consonant)

1. The word starts with S (position 1 locked ✓).
2. Letters **not** in the word at all: L, A, T, E, W, O, R, D.
3. Therefore, the remaining positions 2-5 must be filled from the letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Pool of still-possible letters (excluding the 8 above):
B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and only uses letters from that pool.  
Good next candidates should test common consonants and the remaining vowels (I and U).

A few possible words:
- SING (tests I, N, G)
- SINK (tests I, N, K)
- SUMP (tests U, M, P)
- SICK (tests I, C, K)

Among these, “SING” is a very common English word and checks I, N, and G; let’s start with it. (We must of course use a five-letter word, so I’ll choose “SING” with an extra letter, but “SING” is 4 letters. Correction: we need a 5-letter word.)

Five-letter options:
- SINGS — repeats S, not ideal
- SINCE — contains E (ruled out)
- SINUS — uses U and N
- SICKO — uses O (ruled out)
- SKUNK — uses U, N, K

""SKUNK"" seems like a strong choice:  
- starts with S ✓  
- tests K, U, N — none of these have been ruled out yet.

Let’s go with SKUNK.

Therefore, positions 2 and 4 must contain K and N (or N and K) in some order.
