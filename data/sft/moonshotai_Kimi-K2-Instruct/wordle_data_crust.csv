This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained, helping me eliminate as many possibilities as possible for future guesses. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to test multiple letters at once. The word should include letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting options are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This combination should give me good feedback on which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A (first letter) is not in the word at all.
- R (second letter) is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O (third letter) is not in the word at all.
- S (fourth letter) is in the word and in the correct position (fourth letter).
- E (fifth letter) is not in the word at all.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ S _ (with R as the second letter and S as the fourth letter).

Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, E.
Letters NOT eliminated yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position.
2. Has S in the 4th position.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
4. Uses remaining letters.

Possible candidates: TRUST, GRIST, DRIPS, CRISP, etc. 

I'll choose ""TRUST"" because:
- T is a common starting consonant.
- U and T are still possible letters.
- It fits the pattern _ R _ S _ (T R U S T), though this would require S to be in 4th position (which it is) and T to be in 5th (unknown yet).
Actually, TRUST has T in 1st and 5th positions, which could be good for testing T.

But looking at the pattern _ R _ S _, TRUST would be T R U S T, which fits. However, we need to be careful - the feedback shows S is in 4th position (correct), so TRUST would test T in 1st and 5th positions.

A better choice might be ""GRIST"":
- G in 1st (new letter)
- R in 2nd (matches feedback)
- I in 3rd (new letter)
- S in 4th (matches feedback)
- T in 5th (new letter)

This tests G, I, and T while maintaining the known R and S positions.
