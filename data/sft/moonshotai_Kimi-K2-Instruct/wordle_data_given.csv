Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy is to start with a guess that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of getting some positive feedback to work with.

We just learned that:

- A, R, O, and S are not in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the final position (marked –).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- Does contain E, but not in the 5th spot.

To maximize information in the next guess, we should:
1. Try new consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (common ones: T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
2. Place E in a different position (positions 1-4).
3. Add a couple of fresh vowels that weren’t used (I, U) to see if they’re present.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “UNTIE”:
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (new consonants).
- Puts E in the 4th position, checking a new spot.
- All letters are still possible based on current constraints.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): E, N, I  
Positions still unknown for E, N, I.

Since all three of E, N, I must appear somewhere in the final word, we need a 5-letter word that
- contains E, N, I exactly once each,
- does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T,
- and puts these known letters in new positions so we can pin down their correct spots.

Consonants still legal: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still legal: E (already known), I (already known), plus any others not yet ruled out.

We’ll pick a word that uses E, N, I plus two fresh consonants that have never been tried before, preferably common ones.  
Candidate letters: (C, D, H, L, M, P, etc.)

A good choice is “CHINE”:
- Letters: C, H, I, N, E  
- Uses the three known letters I, N, E in new positions.  
- Introduces two new consonants C and H.  
- None of the banned letters appear.

This maximizes information by testing new positions for the known letters and adding two fresh consonants.

Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H

Positions of E, N, I are still unknown (each has been marked “-” in every spot tried so far).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly E, N, I (no repeats) and two new consonants.
- Does NOT use any of the eliminated letters.
- Keeps E, N, I in positions we haven’t tested before.

Fresh consonants not yet tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that places E in the first slot (never tested yet), N in the third, I in the fifth, and fills the remaining two slots with new consonants.  
A good, common word that fits: “BEGIN”.

Check:
- B, E, G, I, N → all letters are legal.
- Uses E (1st), N (3rd), I (5th) in positions we haven’t tested for them yet.
- Consonants B and G are fresh.

Therefore, “BEGIN” is the optimal next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to start with a guess that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of getting some positive feedback to work with.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We just learned that:

- A, R, O, and S are not in the word at all (all marked x).
- E is in the word but not in the final position (marked –).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- Does contain E, but not in the 5th spot.

To maximize information in the next guess, we should:
1. Try new consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet (common ones: T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
2. Place E in a different position (positions 1-4).
3. Add a couple of fresh vowels that weren’t used (I, U) to see if they’re present.

A balanced word that meets these criteria is “UNTIE”:
- Uses U and I (new vowels).
- Uses N and T (new consonants).
- Puts E in the 4th position, checking a new spot.
- All letters are still possible based on current constraints.

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): E, N, I  
Positions still unknown for E, N, I.

Since all three of E, N, I must appear somewhere in the final word, we need a 5-letter word that
- contains E, N, I exactly once each,
- does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T,
- and puts these known letters in new positions so we can pin down their correct spots.

Consonants still legal: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still legal: E (already known), I (already known), plus any others not yet ruled out.

We’ll pick a word that uses E, N, I plus two fresh consonants that have never been tried before, preferably common ones.  
Candidate letters: (C, D, H, L, M, P, etc.)

A good choice is “CHINE”:
- Letters: C, H, I, N, E  
- Uses the three known letters I, N, E in new positions.  
- Introduces two new consonants C and H.  
- None of the banned letters appear.

This maximizes information by testing new positions for the known letters and adding two fresh consonants.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H, B, F

2. Letters that ARE definitely in the word:  
   E, G, I, N (with N in position 5).

3. Positional restrictions so far:
   - E has appeared as (-) in positions 2 (from BEGIN) and 2 (from FEIGN)  
   - G has appeared as (-) in positions 3 (BEGIN) and 4 (FEIGN)  
   - I has appeared as (-) in positions 4 (BEGIN) and 3 (FEIGN)

   So:
   - E is not in position 2  
   - G is not in position 3 or 4  
   - I is not in position 3 or 4

   N is locked at position 5.

4. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with N (position 5)  
   - Contains E, G, I exactly once each  
   - Contains one additional consonant that hasn’t been used yet (and isn’t in the banned list)

   Valid remaining consonants: D, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. Let’s place E, G, I in the only remaining positions that haven’t been ruled out:
   - E cannot be in position 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4
   - G cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → so G must be in position 1 or 2
   - I cannot be in positions 3 or 4 → so I must be in position 1 or 2

   The word ends with N. We need to fit E, G, I plus one additional consonant into positions 1-4, ensuring each letter is used once.

6. Let’s try placing G in position 1. Then I must be in position 2, and E must be in position 3 or 4. However:
   - Position 3 is still open for E, but G is already in 1 and I in 2. We need a consonant in the remaining slot.  
   - Let’s test G I E _ N → but we need a 5-letter word. We need one consonant in position 4.

   Possible word: G I E _ N → G I E D N → ""GIEDN"" is not a valid English word.  
   Next: G I E K N → ""GIEKN"" – invalid.  
   G I E L N → ""GIELN"" – invalid.  
   G I E M N → ""GIEMN"" – invalid.

   Let’s try another arrangement: G in position 2, I in position 1, E in position 3 or 4.

   - I _ G _ N → I E G _ N → ""IEG_N"" needs a consonant.  
   Possible word: ""IEGKN"" – invalid.

   Let’s try E in position 1, G in position 2, I in position 3 or 4 – but I is restricted from positions 3 and 4, so this won’t work.

   Let’s try E in position 1, I in position 2, G in position 2 (but G can’t be in 3 or 4, so G would have to be in position 2).  
   Then we have E I G _ N → but this repeats no letters and needs a consonant in position 4.  
   Possible word: ""EIGKN"" – invalid.

   Let’s try E in position 1, I in position 2, G in position 3 – but G is restricted from 3.

   Let’s try E in position 4, G in position 1, I in position 2:  
   G I _ E N → needs a consonant in position 3.  
   Possible word: ""G I V E N"" → ""GIVEN"" – this is a valid English word!

   Let’s check constraints for ""GIVEN"":
   - Letters: G, I, V, E, N  
   - Ends with N (position 5)  
   - Contains E, G, I, N  
   - V is a new consonant not yet used or banned  
   - No banned letters are used.

   Positions:
   - E is in position 4 (never tested for E before)  
   - G is in position 1 (never tested for G before)  
   - I is in position 2 (never tested for I before)  
   - V is new.

   This satisfies all constraints and is the only logical valid word left.
