For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they include frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers all five major vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
1. O is the 3rd letter (_ _ O _ _).
2. S is somewhere in the word, but not in position 4.
3. No A, R, or E appear in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no A, R, E).

Good remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

Possible words:
- FOIST (but I is allowed, T is good, but F isn't confirmed yet)
- BOAST (but A is excluded)
- MOIST (M, O, I, S, T)
- DOUBT (but O is 3rd, U could fit, but S must appear)

""MOIST"" fits all constraints:
- O is in position 3.
- S appears in position 4 (but previous feedback says S is not in position 4 - so this is invalid).

Re-evaluate: S cannot be in position 4, so must be 1, 2, or 5.
Possible words:
- SPOIL (S, P, O, I, L) - O is correct, S is position 1 (allowed), no A/R/E.
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) - O is correct, S is position 1 (allowed), no A/R/E.

Between these, ""STONY"" uses diverse letters (S, T, O, N, Y) and positions S in 1st place (valid), O in 3rd (correct), and no ruled-out letters.

From all feedback so far:

1. O is in position 3 (✓ every time).
2. S is in position 1 (✓ every time).
3. N is in position 5 (✓ this time).
4. Letters ruled out: A, R, E, T, Y, H, W.

Current known pattern:
S _ O _ N

We need:
- Letters 2 and 4 must be among remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, L, M, P, U, etc.

Looking for valid English words that fit S _ O _ N:
- SCORN – R is out
- SPOON – P and O in positions 2 and 4
- SMOON – invalid word
- SWOON – W is out
- SLONG – invalid
- SCONE – E is out
- SPONG – invalid
- SCONN – invalid
- SLOIN – I could work
- SFOUN – invalid
- SCOIN – I could work

Valid words:
- SPOON – fits pattern S P O O N, but O is already confirmed in position 3, so position 4 would have to be O. Is ""SPOON"" valid? Yes, it's a real word.

Check constraints:
- S(✓), P (new), O(✓), O (new position), N(✓)
- No ruled-out letters.

""SPOON"" is the only common word fitting S _ O _ N without using any ruled-out letters.
