moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,POUTY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes the information gained. This means choosing a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many English words. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible, without repeating any letters. One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for detecting letters in the secret word.

None of the letters R, A, I, S, E appear in the secret word at all. That eliminates a huge swath of common letters, so we need to pivot entirely to the other side of the alphabet.

Next-most-common unused letters include T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc. We need to form a fresh 5-letter word using only letters that haven’t been ruled out yet. A strong choice is “UNTIL” – it uses T, N, L (all still possible) plus U and I (but I was already ruled out), so let’s try another candidate: “CLOUD” – uses C, L, O, U, D; none of these were guessed before. Another good option is “MOUNT” – uses M, O, U, N, T. All these letters are still viable.

I’ll go with “MOUNT” since it covers five high-frequency letters not yet eliminated.

Current knowledge:

1. Letters not in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, N
2. Letters confirmed in the word: O (correct position 2) and U (correct position 3)
3. Letter T is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ O U _ _ (positions 1, 4, 5 open) and T must appear in 1 or 4.

Good starting consonants left: T, B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y
Good vowels still allowed: O and U are already used; E, A, I are out, so we only have Y left for vowel-like, but mostly consonants.

We need to pick a word that:
- Uses T somewhere in 1 or 4
- Has O in position 2
- Has U in position 3
- Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E, M, N)

Possible options:
- T O U C H (but C and H are viable, positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, C in 4, H in 5) – but this has T in 1 which satisfies T must be in word but not in 5.
- B O U L T (but L and T positions: O in 2, U in 3, T must be in 1 or 4. Here T is in 5 which we know is wrong)
- P O U T Y – T is in 4 which is allowed (since T can't be in 5, 4 is fine). This uses P, O, U, T, Y – none eliminated.

POUTY seems good: P in 1, O in 2 (confirmed ✓), U in 3 (confirmed ✓), T in 4 (allowed since T is in word but not in 5), Y in 5.
