For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common letter)
This helps identify which of these frequently used letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N are NOT in the word (×).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' as the second letter.
- 'E' as the fifth letter.
- No C, R, or N.

A good next guess should test new common letters while fitting the pattern. ""PLATE"" is a strong candidate because:
- P, L, T are common letters we haven't tested yet.
- It fits the _ A _ _ E pattern: P L A T E. However, this would place A in position 3, but we know A is in position 2. So this is wrong.

Let me think of a word that fits _ A _ _ E:
Possible words: BARGE (but has R), GAMER (but has R), LADLE, HASTE, VALUE, etc.

""LADLE"" fits:
- L, D, L are new letters to test.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. From CRANE:  
   A is in the word and is in position 2.  
   E is in the word and is in position 5.  
   C, R, N are absent.

2. From HASTE:  
   A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since it received “-”, not “✓”).  
   This contradicts the first feedback, so let’s read carefully:

   - HASTE: H(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   Interpretation:  
   – H, S, T are not in the word.  
   – E is confirmed in position 5.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because the feedback for A was “-”, meaning correct letter, wrong position).

But wait! CRANE already told us A is in position 2 (✓).  
The new feedback says A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
This is a contradiction—no single word can have A both in position 2 and not in position 2.

I must have misread one of the feedback lines. Rechecking:

- CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓) → A is in position 2, E in position 5.  
- HASTE: H(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2, E in position 5.

The contradiction implies the feedback lines were presented together, not sequentially. So we must treat the feedback as cumulative:

- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from HASTE’s A(-)).  
- E is in the word and in position 5 (from both CRANE and HASTE).  
- C, R, N, H, S, T are absent.

Therefore the word has the form: _ _ _ _ E with:
- A somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
- No C, R, N, H, S, T.

Letters still allowed: A, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any remaining vowels.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Ends with E.  
- Contains A in 1st, 3rd, or 4th position.  
- No C, R, N, H, S, T.

Possible quick candidates:
- ADORE (but R absent) → invalid.  
- ALONE (but N absent) → invalid.  
- AGAVE (but V and G ok) → A G A V E. Check letters: A, G, V, E allowed. No forbidden letters. A appears 1st and 3rd, E 5th.

- VALUE (but L and V ok; U allowed) → V A L U E. A 2nd, invalid.  
- AWAKE (W, K allowed) → A W A K E. A 1st and 3rd.

Best fit among these is AGAVE or AWAKE.  
Between them, AGAVE has G and V, AWAKE has W and K. All letters are new and permissible.

   This contradicts the first feedback, so let’s read carefully:

   - HASTE: H(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   Interpretation:  
   – H, S, T are not in the word.  
   – E is confirmed in position 5.  
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because the feedback for A was “-”, meaning correct letter, wrong position).

But wait! CRANE already told us A is in position 2 (✓).  
The new feedback says A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
This is a contradiction—no single word can have A both in position 2 and not in position 2.

I must have misread one of the feedback lines. Rechecking:

- CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓) → A is in position 2, E in position 5.  
- HASTE: H(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2, E in position 5.

The contradiction implies the feedback lines were presented together, not sequentially. So we must treat the feedback as cumulative:

- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from HASTE’s A(-)).  
- E is in the word and in position 5 (from both CRANE and HASTE).  
- C, R, N, H, S, T are absent.

Therefore the word has the form: _ _ _ _ E with:
- A somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
- No C, R, N, H, S, T.

Letters still allowed: A, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any remaining vowels.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Ends with E.  
- Contains A in 1st, 3rd, or 4th position.  
- No C, R, N, H, S, T.

Possible quick candidates:
- ADORE (but R absent) → invalid.  
- ALONE (but N absent) → invalid.  
- AGAVE (but V and G ok) → A G A V E. Check letters: A, G, V, E allowed. No forbidden letters. A appears 1st and 3rd, E 5th.  
- AMAZE (but Z allowed) → A M A Z E. A 1st and 3rd.  
- GABLE (but L, B ok; G allowed) → G A B L E. A 2nd, but we know A not in 2nd. Invalid.  
- VALUE (but L and V ok; U allowed) → V A L U E. A 2nd, invalid.  
- AWAKE (W, K allowed) → A W A K E. A 1st and 3rd.

Best fit among these is AGAVE or AWAKE.  
Between them, AGAVE has G and V, AWAKE has W and K. All letters are new and permissible.

Let’s pick AWAKE because W and K are both medium-frequency letters we haven’t tested.

Word: AWAKE  
Pattern: A _ A _ E (A in 1st and 3rd, E in 5th).  
Forbidden letters avoided.

Let’s merge the information from all three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
   - A is in position 2.  
   - E is in position 5.  
   - C, R, N are out.

2. HASTE → H(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   - H, S, T are out.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because it got “-”, meaning correct letter but wrong spot).  
   - E is in position 5 (confirms CRANE).

3. AWAKE → A(-) W(x) A(✓) K(✓) E(✓)  
   - W is out.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because it got “-”).  
   - A is in position 3 (✓).  
   - K is in the word but we don’t know the position yet (✓ only for “letter is in the word somewhere”).  
   - E is in position 5 (consistent).

Reconciling A’s positions:
- CRANE said A is in position 2 (✓).  
- HASTE said A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- AWAKE shows A is in position 3 (✓).  

This is impossible unless the feedback is cumulative and CRANE’s A(✓) was only relative to its own position, not absolute. Therefore the strict cumulative rules are:
- A is in the word, exact position unknown (-).  
- E is in position 5.  
- Letters removed: C, R, N, H, S, T, W.  
- K is in the word somewhere.

Pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E  
Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 4.  
K must appear somewhere in 1-4.

Valid letters remaining (excluding the forbidden ones): A, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing A (not in position 2), containing K, and excluding all forbidden letters.

Some candidates:
- FAKED (but D allowed, K in position 3, A in 1) → F A K E D → ends D, not E. Invalid.  
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) → A in 3, K in 4, ends E. Forbidden letters: none. This looks perfect.  
- GRAKE is invalid (R out).  
- KNAVE invalid (N out).  
- PAKKE is not a word.  
- SPIKE has S and I but S is out.  
- JAKED ends D.  
- MAIZE has Z and I but Z allowed, but ends E → M A I Z E. A in 2 is forbidden.  
- VAKED ends D.  
- YAKED ends D.

Best valid word: FLAKE.

Check:
- F L A K E  
- Contains A (position 3), K (position 4), E (position 5).  
- No forbidden letters.  
- A is not in position 2.
