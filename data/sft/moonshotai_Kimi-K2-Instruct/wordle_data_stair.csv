2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

From the feedback:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 3  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, I, S (each somewhere else than their original spot) and one more unknown letter that is not E.

Positions affected:
- A cannot be 1st  
- R cannot be 2nd  
- I cannot be 3rd  
- S cannot be 4th  

I need a word that fits these constraints while recycling the confirmed letters in new positions and introducing one fresh consonant. A good candidate is “RAINS”:
- R moves to position 1 (allowed, since R only couldn’t be 2nd)  
- A moves to position 2 (allowed, since A only couldn’t be 1st)  
- I moves to position 3 (forbidden, because I cannot stay in position 3) — oops, conflict.

Let’s try “SIRRA” (invalid, two R’s). Instead, “RAILS”:
- R in 1st (allowed)  
- A in 2nd (allowed)  
- I in 3rd (still forbidden) — still conflict.

Next candidate: “CRISP” introduces C and P; but only uses one of the confirmed letters (S).  
Better: “RAINS” had the conflict; shift A to 3rd: “RISAN” (not a word).  
Try “SARIN”:
- S in 1st (allowed)  
- A in 2nd (allowed)  
- R in 3rd (allowed)  
- I in 4th (allowed)  
- N is new (okay, E already excluded)

This satisfies all constraints.

Now we have two pieces of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(-) I(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, I, S each appear somewhere in the word, but not in the positions they occupied in ARISE.  
   – E is absent.

2. SARIN → S(✓) A(-) R(-) I(✓) N(x)  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – I is confirmed in position 4.  
   – A and R appear in the word but NOT in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   – N is absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ _ I _  
- Remaining letters in the word must include A and R somewhere.  
- Positions already ruled out for A and R:
  – A cannot be 1 (from ARISE) nor 2 (from SARIN).  
  – R cannot be 2 (from ARISE) nor 3 (from SARIN).  
- Letters already shown to be absent: E, N.  
- We still need one more distinct letter (unknown so far).

Possible positions:
Slot 3: cannot be R (ruled out above).  
Slot 2: cannot be R (from ARISE) nor A (from SARIN).  
Slot 5: open to any valid letter, but must avoid E, N.

Let’s list the remaining three slots (2, 3, 5) and fill them with A and R plus one new letter while respecting the position rules.

A must go in slot 3 or 5.  
R must go in slot 2 or 5 (but slot 2 is disallowed for R because R cannot be 2nd).  
Therefore R must go in slot 5, and A must go in slot 3.

So the skeleton is: S _ A I R  

That gives the word “SAIAR” (invalid), or “SAHIR” (valid word).  
But “SAHIR” uses H, which hasn’t been tested yet.  
However, in English 5-letter words, “SAHIR” is uncommon; let’s look for a more standard word.

Alternative: R must be in slot 5 → S _ _ I R.  
A must then be in slot 3 → S _ A I R → yields “SAIR_” which isn’t a word.

Wait: slot 2 is free except it can’t be A or R. New letter possibilities: common consonants like C, L, M, P, T, etc.

Try placing R in slot 3 instead? No, R is forbidden in slot 3.  
Therefore R must indeed be in slot 5.

Hence the word must be of the form S ? A I R.  
The only common English 5-letter word fitting that is “SAVIR”? Not common.

Actually, “SABIR” exists (a variant spelling).  
But let me double-check the constraints:

Pattern: S _ _ I _  
A must be in position 3 (because it cannot be 1, 2).  
R must be in position 5 (because it cannot be 2, 3, 4).  
So the word is “S A R I R” – invalid double R.

Wait, only one R is allowed?

Hold on, we already have S, A, R, I in the word (from both feedbacks). That’s four letters. The fifth letter must be new and distinct. So the word really is S ? A I R with the fifth letter being a single new consonant in position 2.

So the structure is S [new] A I R.  
We need a valid 5-letter word of form S _ A I R.  
The common word is “STAIR”.

Check constraints:
- S is 1st (✓ confirmed)  
- T is new, allowed  
- A is 3rd (allowed, since A can’t be 1 or 2)  
- I is 4th (✓ confirmed)  
- R is 5th (allowed, since R can’t be 2 or 3)

No conflicts. Let’s go with “STAIR”.
