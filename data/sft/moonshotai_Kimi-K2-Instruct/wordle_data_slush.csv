For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, helping narrow down future guesses.

From the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L is correct in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. The second letter is L.
3. Letters A, T, E are excluded from the entire word.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SL-"", does not contain A, T, or E, and has three remaining letters to fill. Possible letters to consider are other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants not yet ruled out.

Some candidate words:
- SLICK (uses I, C, K – none are excluded)
- SLOSH (uses O, S, H – none are excluded)
- SLUMP (uses U, M, P – none are excluded)
- SLING (uses I, N, G – none are excluded)

""SLICK"" seems like a strong candidate because it uses common letters (C, K) and the vowel I, which hasn't been tested yet.

What we know so far:
- Word must start with “SL” (positions 1 and 2 locked in).
- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, T, E, I, C, K.
- Remaining vowels that could still appear: O, U.
- Common consonants that have not yet been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with “SL” and using only letters from the remaining pool, especially focusing on the next three positions.

Some possibilities:
- S L O B ? — “SLOB?” Not a real word.
- S L O P ? — “SLOPY” is too long. “SLOPS” has S, which is already used in the first position and is allowed elsewhere, but we have only one S so far and don’t know if the word has a second S.
- S L U M P — “SLUMP” fits: S, L, U, M, P. All letters are allowed (A, T, E, I, C, K are excluded; U, M, P are okay).
- S L O G S — “SLOGS” has S repeated; allowed but less informative.
- S L O N G — “SLONG” isn’t a standard word.
- S L U R P — “SLURP” fits: S, L, U, R, P. All letters are allowed.

Between “SLUMP” and “SLURP,” both are valid, but “SLUMP” uses M, which hasn’t been tested yet, giving broader coverage. Let’s go with “SLUMP.”

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common starting words include options like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, helping narrow down future guesses.

- S is correct in position 1.

2. The second letter is L.
3. Letters A, T, E are excluded from the entire word.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SL-"", does not contain A, T, or E, and has three remaining letters to fill. Possible letters to consider are other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants not yet ruled out.

- SLOSH (uses O, S, H – none are excluded)
- SLUMP (uses U, M, P – none are excluded)

- S L O G S — “SLOGS” has S repeated; allowed but less informative.
- S L O N G — “SLONG” isn’t a standard word.
- S L U R P — “SLURP” fits: S, L, U, R, P. All letters are allowed.
