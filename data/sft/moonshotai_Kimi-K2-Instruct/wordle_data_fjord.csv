For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to reveal as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and C are among the most common. 

A common first guess word is ""SLATE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback for SLATE (S, L, A, T, E are all marked “x”), we know:

- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.
- That eliminates a large set of words containing any of those letters.
- We now want a 5-letter word that avoids S L A T E entirely and contains other common consonants and vowels to reveal new information.

Good next candidates use high-frequency letters not yet tested, such as R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

A balanced word that covers new vowels (O, U) and common consonants (R, N, I) is “ROUND”. It introduces five fresh letters and fits the constraints.

Other close options could be “CHORD”, “BRISK”, “MOUNT”, but each contains at least one letter we already ruled out (T or E). ROUND is safe.

2. U and N are not in the word at all.
3. D is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).

Possible common letters left to explore: C, I, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

- Must include R and O in positions 1-4 but not at their previous spots (R not 1st, O not 2nd)
- Avoid all banned letters (S, L, A, T, E, U, N)

A good choice is “CROWD”:
- Ends in D.
- Has R and O.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was not allowed in position 1).
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since it was not allowed in position 2).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,fjord,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to reveal as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, and C are among the most common. 

A common first guess word is ""SLATE"" because it contains several high-frequency letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback for SLATE (S, L, A, T, E are all marked “x”), we know:

- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.
- That eliminates a large set of words containing any of those letters.
- We now want a 5-letter word that avoids S L A T E entirely and contains other common consonants and vowels to reveal new information.

Good next candidates use high-frequency letters not yet tested, such as R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

A balanced word that covers new vowels (O, U) and common consonants (R, N, I) is “ROUND”. It introduces five fresh letters and fits the constraints.

Other close options could be “CHORD”, “BRISK”, “MOUNT”, but each contains at least one letter we already ruled out (T or E). ROUND is safe.

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Now we know:

1. R and O are in the word but not in their current positions (R ≠ pos 1, O ≠ pos 2).
2. U and N are not in the word at all.
3. D is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).

So the secret word ends with D and contains R and O somewhere else. We need a 5-letter word ending in D, with no S, L, A, T, E, U, N, but including R and O in other positions.

Candidate endings with D: _ _ _ _ D

Possible common letters left to explore: C, I, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

Let’s build a word:
- Position 5: D (fixed)
- Must include R and O in positions 1-4 but not at their previous spots (R not 1st, O not 2nd)
- Avoid all banned letters (S, L, A, T, E, U, N)

A good choice is “CROWD”:
- Ends in D.
- Has R and O.
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since it was not allowed in position 1).
- O is in position 3 (allowed, since it was not allowed in position 2).
- No banned letters.

Thus, CROWD is a valid next guess.
