For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information gain
3. Covers different common vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency data, the most common letters in English are: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B.

A good first word should contain some of these high-frequency letters. Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE
- STARE
- SOARE
- RAISE
- CRANE

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 of the top 5 most common letters (E, A, O) and 2 other common consonants (R, S), with no repeating letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

1. Contains an A (but not as the first letter)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TAILS → T(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x) S(x)
   – A is in the correct position (position 2).
   – T, I, L, S are not in the word.

3. MANGY → M(x) A(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   – Y is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).
   – M, G are not in the word.

So far we have:
- Pos 2 = A
- Pos 3 = N
- Y exists somewhere (positions 1 or 4)
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, K, P, U, W, Y (plus any we haven’t tried)
- Letters eliminated: E, G, I, L, M, O, R, S, T

Given that Y must be in position 1 or 4, and we need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- If Y is in position 1: Y A N _ _
- If Y is in position 4: _ A N Y _

Looking at common 5-letter words matching these patterns, and using remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, K, P, U, W):

Potential candidates:
- Y A N _ _ : YANKS, YANGS (but G is eliminated), so perhaps YANKS (but K is allowed)
- _ A N Y _ : BANYA, HANNY (but H and N already placed), CANDY (but D and C are allowed), FANNY (but F and N are allowed), etc.

Let’s check CANDY:
- C A N D Y
- C not yet tested (ok)
- D not yet tested (ok)
- Y in position 5 (was in wrong position in MANGY, now correct)
- All letters are allowed.

This seems like a strong candidate.
