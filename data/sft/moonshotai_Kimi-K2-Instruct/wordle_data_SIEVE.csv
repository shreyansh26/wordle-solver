Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make an optimal starting guess. A good first word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters (Q, X, Z)
4. Maximize the chance of revealing correct letters

Common good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because:
- It covers 3 very common vowels (A, E) and consonants (R, N)
- C is also relatively common
- It has no repeating letters

From the first guess CRANE, only the letter E was correct (in the right position), while all other letters (C, R, A, N) are not in the word at all.

This tells us:
- The last letter must be E.
- The first four letters can be anything except C, R, A, N.

Now we need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at common consonants and remaining vowels:
- Good letters to try next: S, T, L, D, M, B, F, G, H, I, O, U.
- We already know E is in the 5th position.

Possible candidates:
- STILE (S, T, I, L, E) – ends with E, avoids C/R/A/N.
- UTILE (U, T, I, L, E) – same idea.
- SPIKE (S, P, I, K, E) – introduces new consonants.

""STILE"" is a good balance of common letters and avoids all the ruled-out letters. It tests S, T, I, L, and confirms E is in the correct spot.

- No T, L, C, R, A, N

Available letters to place (excluding forbidden ones):
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y)
- Vowels: I, O, U (plus the already-placed E)

Good candidate placements:
- If I is in position 2: S I _ _ E
  Need 3rd and 4th letters from remaining common letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y) and they must form a valid word.
  Possible: S I D E _ – but we need 5 letters, so SIDED? (no, ends with D). SIDEK? Not a word. SIDEY? Not a word. SIGHE? Not a word. SIMPE? Not a word. SIPED? Valid word (past tense of ""sipe""), but let's see better.

- If I is in position 4: S _ _ I E
  Need 2nd and 3rd letters from remaining common letters. Examples:
  S P I K E – but K is rare, and we’ve used I in position 4.
  S W I V E – ""swive"" is archaic for ""to copulate"", probably too obscure.
  S H I V E – ""shive"" is a real word (thin slice), but let's see if there's a more common one.
  S P I N E – but N is excluded (from CRANE feedback)
  S M I T E – but T is excluded
  S P I R E – but R is excluded
  S P I L E – but L is excluded
  S P I K E – K is ok, but is it common enough?
  S P I K E – let's check: S P I K E → ""spike"" is a valid, common word.

""SPIKE"" fits all constraints:
- Starts with S (confirmed)
- Ends with E (confirmed)
- Contains I in position 4 (different from position 3 in STILE)
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, N, T, L)
- Common word

Let's go with SPIKE.

Consolidating all feedback:

1. Word shape: S _ _ _ E
2. Letter exclusions from all guesses so far:
   - C, R, A, N, T, L, P, K are NOT in the word.
3. Letter inclusions and positions:
   - I is definitely in the word (from I(-) in both STILE and SPIKE) but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
   - Therefore I must be in position 2.
   - That fixes the word pattern: S I _ _ E

We now need two middle consonants, chosen from:
B, D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already ruled-out letters).

Looking for common, valid 5-letter English words:
- SIDED → ends with E? No, ends D. Invalid.
- SIMIE → not a word.
- SIEVE → has V and E, fits pattern.
- SINCE → N is excluded.
- SIREE → has R, excluded.
- SITHE → T is excluded.
- SIDGE → not a word.
- SIGHE → not standard.
- SIEVE is the only plausible common word left.

Check SIEVE:
- S(✓) I(?) E E(✓) – positions: S I _ V E
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Common word meaning a strainer or to filter.

Therefore, next logical guess is SIEVE.
