2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will help me gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This way, I'll maximize the chances of hitting letters that are in the secret word.

Looking at common letters in 5-letter words, some good options include:
- A, E, I (common vowels)
- R, S, T, L, N (common consonants)

The word ""AROSE"" contains:
- A (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives me 5 distinct letters that are all very common in English words, which should provide good information for subsequent guesses.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word (each marked with x).  
That means we need a completely different set of letters.

Common 5-letter words that avoid A, R, O, S, E and still use other frequent consonants and vowels include:
- “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y)
- “MIGHT” (M, I, G, H, T)
- “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L)
- “LIGHT” (L, I, G, H, T)

Among these, “UNITY” uses four unique vowel/consonant letters (U, N, I, T, Y) that are still fairly common.  
I’ll go with “UNITY” to test a new batch of letters.

From the two guesses so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are all NOT in the word at all (x).  
- U is in the word but not in position 1.  
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).

So the secret word has:
- I in the 3rd position.
- U somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 3 is already taken by I).
- No A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y anywhere.

We still need letters that haven’t been eliminated. Frequent remaining consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W.  
Vowels left: only U (since A, O, E are out) plus possibly the semi-vowel Y (but Y is out).

To maximize information, choose a word that uses a fresh set of common consonants along with the known I and U.

A good candidate is “BUILD”:
- B, L, D are new consonants.
- U is in the word (and not in position 1).
- I is in position 3 (matches requirement).

Check for any conflicts: letters in BUILD are B, U, I, L, D. None are in the already-eliminated list (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y). So this is valid.

This will help us place U and test B, L, D.
