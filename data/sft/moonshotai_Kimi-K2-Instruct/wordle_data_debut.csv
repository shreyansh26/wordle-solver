For a first guess in Wordle, it's typically a good strategy to choose a word that has common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct (either in position or wrong position) and gives good information to narrow down future guesses. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - common letters)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E - common letters)
- ADIEU (many vowels but some less common letters)

Among these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it covers very common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). The letter 'S' is especially valuable as it's the most common ending letter in 5-letter words.

Let's go with SLATE as our first guess since it gives us good coverage of common letters.

Guess 2: METRO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) T(-) R(x) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

- M is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd, so it must be 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.

Current constraints:
1. Word must have E as its second letter.
2. Word must contain T, but T is NOT in position 3.
3. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, M, R, O.

Letters left to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ E _ _ _ (E is fixed in 2nd position), and must include T somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).

Possible T positions:
- T _ E _ _
- _ E _ _ T
- _ E _ T _

Exploring valid words:
- T E _ _ _: TE___ (e.g., TENTS, but N and S are out; TEBIT - not valid)
- _ E _ _ T: _E__T (e.g., DEBIT - B and I are valid, but need to check others)
- _ E _ T _: _E_T_ (e.g., P E T T Y - Y is valid, but T is already in position 3 which is invalid from feedback)

Let's check DEBIT:
- D E B I T
- Contains T (position 5) and E (position 2) correctly.
- Does not contain S, L, A, M, R, O.
- Valid word.

Another candidate: VERT? No, R is out. NEXT? N, X, T - but E is not in 2nd.

Best seems DEBIT.

This maximizes the chance of getting some letters correct (either in position or wrong position) and gives good information to narrow down future guesses. Some good starting words include:\n\n- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - common letters)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E - common letters)\n- ADIEU (many vowels but some less common letters)\n\nAmong these, SLATE is often considered one of the best starting words because it covers very common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E).

From the latest feedback (DEBIT):

D(✓) → D is correct and in position 1  
E(✓) → E is correct and in position 2  
B(✓) → B is correct and in position 3  
I(x) → I is not in the word  
T(✓) → T is correct and in position 5  

So the word must be: D E B _ T

Letters still unknown: only position 4.  
Permitted letters (not ruled out yet): everything except S, L, A, M, R, O, I.

Common valid letters left: C, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter English word that matches D E B _ T.

Quick scan:
- DEBUT (U is allowed → word is DEBUT)
- DEBIT (invalid, I is out)
- DEBYT (Y is allowed → but DEBYT is not a valid English word)
Only DEBUT remains as a common valid word.

Let’s confirm:
DEBUT:
D(1) ✓

B(3) ✓  
U(4) (allowed)  
T(5) ✓  

No conflicts, and DEBUT is a recognized word.
