For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE."" These words use a mix of frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - strong consonants and vowels
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - good mix
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- All three most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- This combination can provide good information about which vowels and consonants are in the word

Let's interpret the new feedback from STAIN:

S(✓) – S is in the word **and** correctly placed at position 1.  
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT at position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT at position 3.  
I(x) – I is **not** in the word.  
N(x) – N is **not** in the word.  

Summary of constraints so far:
1. First letter is S.
2. Remaining letters do NOT include R, O, E, I, N.
3. Letters definitely included: S (fixed at 1) and A (somewhere), plus T (somewhere, but not 2).
4. Allowed vowels now: A and U (since O, E, I are out).
5. Allowed consonants: any not yet ruled out (exclude R, N). Typical frequent ones: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

Since A must appear and cannot be at 3, possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.
T must appear and cannot be at 2, so possible positions: 3, 4, or 5, but must respect A placement.

We need to fit A and T plus three other consonants that are allowed. Let's brainstorm a few candidates:

- S A _ _ _ : second letter A → need T and two more consonants. Possible: S A L T _ → but needs 5 letters; SALTS? No, S already used.  
- S _ A _ _ : third letter A → T cannot be 2, so T could be 4 or 5. Candidate: S C A T _ → SCATT (invalid). S P A T _ → SPAT H? Let's think: S _ A _ _ with T somewhere.  
- S _ _ A _ : fourth letter A → T could be 2,3,5 but not 2 (T is not at 2). So T at 3 or 5.  
  Example: S C T A _ → SCTA_ (need one more). S C T A L → SCTAL (invalid).  
  Or S _ _ A T → T at 5 (valid, since T not at 2). Example: S C U A T (but U is allowed vowel).  

Another angle: words starting with S, containing A and T, no R,O,E,I,N. Consider ""S C U A T"" – SCUAT (invalid). ""S C A T _"" – SCATS (but S is already used).  

Wait, let's try ""SALTY"" – but Y is sometimes vowel, and we have no info on Y yet. Also, Y is not ruled out, but A must be somewhere. SALTY has A at 2, L at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.  

Check constraints:
- S at 1 ✓
- A somewhere ✓ (at 2)
- T somewhere ✓ (at 4, not at 2 ✓)
- No R,O,E,I,N ✓
- All letters valid.

Another candidate: ""SATYR"" – but R is ruled out.
""SAUCY"" – has C, U, Y. But no T, so invalid (T must be in word).
""SCANT"" – N is ruled out.
""SLATE"" – E is ruled out.
""STAMP"" – P is ok, but T is at 2, which is disallowed (T cannot be at 2).

""SALTY"" seems to satisfy all constraints so far.
