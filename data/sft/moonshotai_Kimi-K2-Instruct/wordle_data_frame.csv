- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can provide maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “crane”:
- C(x) – the letter C is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- N(x) – the letter N is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So the pattern we have is: _ R A _ E

We need a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and does not contain C or N.  
Looking for common 5-letter words with this pattern, one strong candidate is “GRAPE”:
- G – possible; not eliminated.
- R(✓) – already confirmed in 2nd position.
- A(✓) – confirmed in 3rd position.
- P – possible; not eliminated.
- E(✓) – confirmed in 5th position.

“GRAPE” also introduces the letter G and P, which are common and not yet tested.

So far we know the target has the pattern _ R A _ E and cannot contain C, N, G, or P.

Valid letters left for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, T, V, W, Y … and any others not yet excluded.

We still need to test a few more consonants and see if we can lock in the first and fourth slots.  
A good candidate should:
1. Fit _ R A _ E.
2. Introduce new consonants that are common and haven’t been tried.
3. Avoid the forbidden letters C, N, G, P.

Possible words fitting this pattern:
- BRAVE  (but V is position 4 and A is already position 3) – no conflict, let’s see.
- DRATE – but T would be position 4 and we don’t have info yet.
- FRAME – M and F untested.
- BRACE – contains C, which is forbidden.
- TRADE – D untested.

Let’s pick a word that places two new consonants in the first and fourth positions, both still common: F and M.

Word: FRAME  
Check positions:
1. F – new, allowed
2. R – ✓
3. A – ✓
4. M – new, allowed
5. E – ✓
