For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to gather the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, O, E (3 of the 5 vowels)
- Common consonants: R, S (both highly frequent in English)

This covers 5 unique letters without repeats, maximizing the chance of hitting some correct letters or positions early on.

From the two guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, O, E are all absent.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. suist → S(-) U(✓) I(x) S(-) T(x)
   – S is still not in position 1 or 4 (so S must be in 2, 3, or 5).
   – U is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
   – I and T are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: S (one occurrence), U (and U is in position 2).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, I, T.
- Remaining common letters we haven’t used yet: D, F, G, H, L, N, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place U in position 2 (already fixed).
- Place S in one of positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Use only letters not yet eliminated.

A word that satisfies this and covers several remaining common consonants is “DUSKS”:
- Position 2: U (matches requirement).
- S appears in positions 3 and 5, confirming S presence and testing both remaining valid positions.
- D and K are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

However, “DUSKS” uses S twice; since we only know one S exists, we might prefer a word with a single S. Let me pick “DUSTY” → but T has already been ruled out. Another candidate: “LUMPS” but P hasn’t been ruled out yet. Actually let’s try “LUSTY” – but T and Y haven’t been ruled out. Actually T is already ruled out.

A better candidate is “FUSSY”: F, U, S, S, Y – but again double S.

Single-S candidate: “FUSKY” – but K and Y unknown.

Let’s pick a word that keeps U in position 2, has one S, and uses only untested letters: “GUSHY” – but S is in position 3 and H,Y untested. That seems acceptable.

But the simplest word fitting all constraints and using common letters is “BUSKY” – B, U, S, K, Y. However “BUSKY” is not a common word.

Let’s pick a common word: “HUSKY” – H, U, S, K, Y. This keeps U in position 2, has S in position 3, and introduces H, K, Y which are new.

   – A, R, O, E are out.

   – Position 5 is Y, but since Y got ✓ that means Y is in position 5 and correct.

So the partial word is _ U S K Y with position 1 still unknown.

Letters already ruled out: A, E, H, I, O, R, T, (and we know Y is at 5).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,MUSKY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, O, E (3 of the 5 vowels)
- Common consonants: R, S (both highly frequent in English)

This covers 5 unique letters without repeats, maximizing the chance of hitting some correct letters or positions early on.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from “arose” tells us:

• A(x) – A is not in the word.  
• R(x) – R is not in the word.  
• O(x) – O is not in the word.  
• S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th; it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).  
• E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the still-available letters include S, and we have eliminated A, R, O, E.  
A good next guess should:

1. Keep the S (but move it to a new position).  
2. Introduce other highly common consonants and vowels we have not yet tested (like I, U, N, T, L, etc.).

The word “SUITS” fits these criteria:
- Contains S in the 1st position (different from its previous 4th).  
- Introduces U, I, T (all common and not yet tested).  
- 5 distinct letters, giving maximum new information.

Let’s use “SUITS”.

<guess>suist</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: suist -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, O, E are all absent.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. suist → S(-) U(✓) I(x) S(-) T(x)
   – S is still not in position 1 or 4 (so S must be in 2, 3, or 5).
   – U is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
   – I and T are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: S (one occurrence), U (and U is in position 2).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, E, I, T.
- Remaining common letters we haven’t used yet: D, F, G, H, L, N, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place U in position 2 (already fixed).
- Place S in one of positions 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Use only letters not yet eliminated.

A word that satisfies this and covers several remaining common consonants is “DUSKS”:
- Position 2: U (matches requirement).
- S appears in positions 3 and 5, confirming S presence and testing both remaining valid positions.
- D and K are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

However, “DUSKS” uses S twice; since we only know one S exists, we might prefer a word with a single S. Let me pick “DUSTY” → but T has already been ruled out. Another candidate: “LUMPS” but P hasn’t been ruled out yet. Actually let’s try “LUSTY” – but T and Y haven’t been ruled out. Actually T is already ruled out.

A better candidate is “FUSSY”: F, U, S, S, Y – but again double S.

Single-S candidate: “FUSKY” – but K and Y unknown.

Let’s pick a word that keeps U in position 2, has one S, and uses only untested letters: “GUSHY” – but S is in position 3 and H,Y untested. That seems acceptable.

But the simplest word fitting all constraints and using common letters is “BUSKY” – B, U, S, K, Y. However “BUSKY” is not a common word.

Let’s pick a common word: “HUSKY” – H, U, S, K, Y. This keeps U in position 2, has S in position 3, and introduces H, K, Y which are new.

I’ll go with “HUSKY”.
