For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or identify many possibilities. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequently used letters in English words, which can provide valuable information regardless of the feedback.

From the feedback:

- C(x), R(x), N(x), E(x) → none of C, R, N, E are in the word at all.
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.

So the word:
- contains the letter A somewhere other than position 2.
- does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Uses the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2).
2. Avoids C, R, N, E.
3. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels.

Good unused frequent consonants: S, T, L, M, D, B, G, H…  
Good unused vowels: I, O, U (A already confirmed).

A balanced word meeting these criteria is “STOAL” (S, T, O, A, L), but “STOAL” is not valid.  
A valid, high-information word avoiding C,R,N,E while placing A elsewhere is “ADIOS” (A is 1st, uses S, D, I, O).

But “ADIOS” uses O and I, and we still want to cover other consonants.  
Another valid word: “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) – A is 3rd, avoids C,R,N,E.

Summary of everything we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, N, E, P, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are unknown: A, L, I  
   - A is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from PLAID)  
   - L is not in position 2 (from PLAID)  
   - I is not in position 4 (from PLAID)

3. So the hidden word is a permutation of A, L, I plus two new letters, none of which can be C, R, N, E, P, D.

4. Common remaining consonants we might try: S, T, G, B, H, M, Y, K, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (A and I already confirmed).

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that contains A, L, I, and two of the still-allowed extra letters, while respecting the position bans mentioned above.

6. Candidate words to test:
   - ""STAIL"" → invalid (not a recognized word).
   - ""VALID"" → uses D, already excluded.
   - ""LAIRS"" → uses R, excluded.
   - ""VIALS"" → uses S, looks valid and uses V, S as new letters.

""VIALS"":

  – L is in position 4 (not position 2; allowed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or identify many possibilities. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequently used letters in English words, which can provide valuable information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- C(x), R(x), N(x), E(x) → none of C, R, N, E are in the word at all.
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.

So the word:
- contains the letter A somewhere other than position 2.
- does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Uses the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2).
2. Avoids C, R, N, E.
3. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels.

Good unused frequent consonants: S, T, L, M, D, B, G, H…  
Good unused vowels: I, O, U (A already confirmed).

A balanced word meeting these criteria is “STOAL” (S, T, O, A, L), but “STOAL” is not valid.  
A valid, high-information word avoiding C,R,N,E while placing A elsewhere is “ADIOS” (A is 1st, uses S, D, I, O).

But “ADIOS” uses O and I, and we still want to cover other consonants.  
Another valid word: “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) – A is 3rd, avoids C,R,N,E.

Let’s go with “PLAID”.

   - L is not in position 2 (from PLAID)  
   - I is not in position 4 (from PLAID)

3. So the hidden word is a permutation of A, L, I plus two new letters, none of which can be C, R, N, E, P, D.

4. Common remaining consonants we might try: S, T, G, B, H, M, Y, K, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (A and I already confirmed).

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that contains A, L, I, and two of the still-allowed extra letters, while respecting the position bans mentioned above.

6. Candidate words to test:
   - ""STAIL"" → invalid (not a recognized word).
   - ""VALID"" → uses D, already excluded.
   - ""LAIRS"" → uses R, excluded.
   - ""VIALS"" → uses S, looks valid and uses V, S as new letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that have been ruled out entirely:  
C, R, N, E, P, D, S, T

Letters confirmed present and already placed:  
V (pos 1 ✓), I (pos 2 ✓), L (pos 4 ✓)

Letters confirmed present but whose position is still unknown:  
A (cannot be in 3 or 5 because of previous feedback)

Therefore A must be in position 3, because:
- It can’t be in 2 (CRANE feedback),  
- It can’t be in 3 (PLAID feedback),  
- It can’t be in 4 (already L there),  
- It can’t be in 5 (VITAL feedback says A is in the word but not in 5).

But PLAID said A is NOT in position 3, so A cannot be in 3 either.  
This contradiction means A cannot fit anywhere, yet we know it must be in the word.  
Hence our only resolution is that A must be in position 5, and the earlier “A(-)” in VITAL simply means “A is in the word but not in 5” was mis-read.  
Re-examining VITAL feedback: the fourth letter feedback was L(-) not L(✓), so L is indeed in the word but not necessarily at position 4.  
But VIALS gave L(✓) at position 4. So L is fixed at 4.  
A must therefore be in position 5, and the VITAL feedback “A(-)” simply tells us A is not in 5. This is impossible unless we re-interpret:  
Actually in VITAL the feedback is:  
V(✓) I(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)  
So:  
- V at 1 ✓  
- I at 2 ✓  
- T not in word  
- A in word but NOT at 5  
- L in word but NOT at 5

Since L is already confirmed at 4 by VIALS, the only possible structure is:  
V I _ L A

And the slot at position 3 must be a letter that has not been ruled out and forms a valid word.

Allowed letters not yet used or eliminated (from alphabet minus C,R,N,E,P,D,S,T):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels O, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form V I ? L A.

Common such word: “VIGLA” (not valid), “VINAL” (N eliminated), “VIRGA” (R eliminated), “VILLA” (double L allowed and fits).  
“VILLA” uses V,I,L,L,A.  
Check constraints:  
- V at 1 ✓  
- I at 2 ✓  
- L at 4 ✓  
- A at 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not at 3)  
- Second L at 3 is new letter and allowed.

Therefore “VILLA” satisfies every constraint.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or identify many possibilities. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers a good spread of frequently used letters in English words, which can provide valuable information regardless of the feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- C(x), R(x), N(x), E(x) → none of C, R, N, E are in the word at all.
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.

So the word:
- contains the letter A somewhere other than position 2.
- does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Uses the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2).
2. Avoids C, R, N, E.
3. Uses a fresh set of common consonants and vowels.

Good unused frequent consonants: S, T, L, M, D, B, G, H…  
Good unused vowels: I, O, U (A already confirmed).

A balanced word meeting these criteria is “STOAL” (S, T, O, A, L), but “STOAL” is not valid.  
A valid, high-information word avoiding C,R,N,E while placing A elsewhere is “ADIOS” (A is 1st, uses S, D, I, O).

But “ADIOS” uses O and I, and we still want to cover other consonants.  
Another valid word: “PLAID” (P, L, A, I, D) – A is 3rd, avoids C,R,N,E.

Let’s go with “PLAID”.

<guess>PLAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of everything we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, N, E, P, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are unknown: A, L, I  
   - A is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from PLAID)  
   - L is not in position 2 (from PLAID)  
   - I is not in position 4 (from PLAID)

3. So the hidden word is a permutation of A, L, I plus two new letters, none of which can be C, R, N, E, P, D.

4. Common remaining consonants we might try: S, T, G, B, H, M, Y, K, etc.  
   Common remaining vowels: O, U (A and I already confirmed).

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that contains A, L, I, and two of the still-allowed extra letters, while respecting the position bans mentioned above.

6. Candidate words to test:
   - ""STAIL"" → invalid (not a recognized word).
   - ""VALID"" → uses D, already excluded.
   - ""LAIRS"" → uses R, excluded.
   - ""VIALS"" → uses S, looks valid and uses V, S as new letters.

""VIALS"":
- Letters: V, I, A, L, S — only new letters are V and S.  
- Position checks:
  – A is in position 3 (allowed so far).
  – L is in position 4 (not position 2; allowed).
  – I is in position 2 (not position 4; allowed).

""VIALS"" looks like a good, valid third guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's update what we now know:

Letters confirmed present:
- V (position 1 ✓)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- L (position 4 ✓)

Letters confirmed absent:
C, R, N, E, P, D, S, A

Letter A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we have:
V I _ L _

We now need to find the missing letters in positions 3 and 5.
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z
We also know A must appear somewhere, and the only remaining spot is position 5, but A is marked as NOT in position 3 and we haven't ruled out position 5 for it yet. However, we have S(x) in position 5, but no info on A in position 5.

Looking at the pattern V I _ L _, and knowing we must use A somewhere (but not position 3), the only possible positions for A are 5. So possible word structure: V I _ L A.

Common 5-letter words fitting V I _ L A:
- VILLA - but has two L's, and we already have L in position 4
- VIOLA - uses O in position 3, A in position 5
- VIGLA - not a valid word
- VIKLA - not valid
- VINAL - uses A in position 5, but N is eliminated
- VITAL - uses T in position 3, A in position 5

""VITAL"" seems like a strong candidate:
- V(✓) position 1
- I(✓) position 2
- T new letter
- L(✓) position 4
- A must be in position 5 (only remaining spot)

This fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
Guess 3: VIALS -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) A(-) L(✓) S(x)
Guess 4: VITAL -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that have been ruled out entirely:  
C, R, N, E, P, D, S, T

Letters confirmed present and already placed:  
V (pos 1 ✓), I (pos 2 ✓), L (pos 4 ✓)

Letters confirmed present but whose position is still unknown:  
A (cannot be in 3 or 5 because of previous feedback)

Therefore A must be in position 3, because:
- It can’t be in 2 (CRANE feedback),  
- It can’t be in 3 (PLAID feedback),  
- It can’t be in 4 (already L there),  
- It can’t be in 5 (VITAL feedback says A is in the word but not in 5).

But PLAID said A is NOT in position 3, so A cannot be in 3 either.  
This contradiction means A cannot fit anywhere, yet we know it must be in the word.  
Hence our only resolution is that A must be in position 5, and the earlier “A(-)” in VITAL simply means “A is in the word but not in 5” was mis-read.  
Re-examining VITAL feedback: the fourth letter feedback was L(-) not L(✓), so L is indeed in the word but not necessarily at position 4.  
But VIALS gave L(✓) at position 4. So L is fixed at 4.  
A must therefore be in position 5, and the VITAL feedback “A(-)” simply tells us A is not in 5. This is impossible unless we re-interpret:  
Actually in VITAL the feedback is:  
V(✓) I(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)  
So:  
- V at 1 ✓  
- I at 2 ✓  
- T not in word  
- A in word but NOT at 5  
- L in word but NOT at 5

Since L is already confirmed at 4 by VIALS, the only possible structure is:  
V I _ L A

And the slot at position 3 must be a letter that has not been ruled out and forms a valid word.

Allowed letters not yet used or eliminated (from alphabet minus C,R,N,E,P,D,S,T):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus vowels O, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form V I ? L A.

Common such word: “VIGLA” (not valid), “VINAL” (N eliminated), “VIRGA” (R eliminated), “VILLA” (double L allowed and fits).  
“VILLA” uses V,I,L,L,A.  
Check constraints:  
- V at 1 ✓  
- I at 2 ✓  
- L at 4 ✓  
- A at 5 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said A not at 3)  
- Second L at 3 is new letter and allowed.

Therefore “VILLA” satisfies every constraint.
