For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good starting word should contain several of these common letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include: AROSE, RAISE, SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This should help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) have been eliminated.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters, so I need a completely different set.

Remaining common letters that have not been ruled out include: T, L, N, C, D, I, U, M, P, B, H, G, K, Y, F, W, V, Z.

- Letters confirmed to be in the word but wrong position: N, I

- I (known in word)

From the feedback so far:

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, K

Letters confirmed to be present but whose exact positions are unknown (-):  
N, I, C, H

So the secret word must contain all four of N, I, C, H, and it must be 5 letters long.  
The only 5-letter word that uses exactly these four letters plus one additional letter (that hasn’t been ruled out) is “NICHE”.

Letters in NICHE:
- N (confirmed present)
- I (confirmed present)
- C (confirmed present)
- H (confirmed present)
- E (already ruled out)

Wait! E was already ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE -> E(x)), so NICHE cannot be the word.

Let me rethink: the word must contain N, I, C, H and one more letter not yet ruled out.  
Looking at the remaining unused, non-eliminated letters: D, M, P, B, G, Y, F, W, V, Z, plus repeats allowed.

The only valid 5-letter English word using four of {N,I,C,H} plus one new letter is “CHIN_”. The only remaining valid letter not yet ruled out is D, M, P, B, G, etc. Let me check “CHIMP”:

- C, H, I, M, P — all letters are still possible, and it uses C, H, I, N is missing. No, N is required.

Wait, the word must contain N, I, C, H. The only possible word is “INCH_” or “CHIN_”.

The only valid 5-letter word with N, I, C, H plus one more letter not yet ruled out is “CHINO” or “NICHE”, but O and E are already ruled out.

Actually, “CHIMP” doesn’t use N. Let me check “PINCH”:

- P, I, N, C, H — all required letters are present, and P is still allowed (not yet ruled out).  

Yes! PINCH contains P (new), plus confirmed I, N, C, H. This is the only remaining valid option that fits all constraints.

Eliminated letters (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, K

Letters confirmed to be present but whose exact positions are unknown (-):  
N, I, C, H

So the secret word must contain all four of N, I, C, H, and it must be 5 letters long.  
The only 5-letter word that uses exactly these four letters plus one additional letter (that hasn’t been ruled out) is “NICHE”.

Letters in NICHE:
- N (confirmed present)
- I (confirmed present)
- C (confirmed present)
- H (confirmed present)
- E (already ruled out)

Wait! E was already ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE -> E(x)), so NICHE cannot be the word.

Let me rethink: the word must contain N, I, C, H and one more letter not yet ruled out.  
Looking at the remaining unused, non-eliminated letters: D, M, P, B, G, Y, F, W, V, Z, plus repeats allowed.

The only valid 5-letter English word using four of {N,I,C,H} plus one new letter is “CHIN_”. The only remaining valid letter not yet ruled out is D, M, P, B, G, etc. Let me check “CHIMP”:

- C, H, I, M, P — all letters are still possible, and it uses C, H, I, N is missing. No, N is required.

Wait, the word must contain N, I, C, H. The only possible word is “INCH_” or “CHIN_”.

The only valid 5-letter word with N, I, C, H plus one more letter not yet ruled out is “CHINO” or “NICHE”, but O and E are already ruled out.

Actually, “CHIMP” doesn’t use N. Let me check “PINCH”:

- P, I, N, C, H — all required letters are present, and P is still allowed (not yet ruled out).  

Yes! PINCH contains P (new), plus confirmed I, N, C, H. This is the only remaining valid option that fits all constraints.",Guess 4: PINCH -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
