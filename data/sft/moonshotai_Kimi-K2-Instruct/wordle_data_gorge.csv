For the first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information about the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are popular choices because they contain common vowels and consonants.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify or eliminate many possible letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (x) – A is not in the word.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word:
- ends with E
- contains R (not in position 2) and O (not in position 3)
- does NOT contain A or S

Since S is out, many consonant combinations shrink.  
Common words ending in E that contain both R and O are things like:
- TROVE (but O is 2nd here, and we know O is not in position 3; this still allows O in 2nd)
- GROVE
- BROKE
- PROVE

I’ll pick “TROVE” next because it re-uses R and O in different positions and adds T and V, high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s summarize the information we have:

1. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, S, T, V.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word: E (must be last), R and O (both are somewhere, but not yet placed).

Known pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E  
with R and O somewhere in the first four positions.

What we still don’t know: the remaining two consonants (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 excluding the positions already tested).

In Guess 2 (TROVE) we placed:
- T (x) – not in word
- R in position 2 (feedback -) – so R is NOT in position 2
- O in position 3 (feedback -) – so O is NOT in position 3
- V (x) – not in word
- E (✓) – already known to be last.

So now we know:
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4
- O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

To quickly test plausible combinations, we should pick a word that places R and O in new positions and introduces two fresh consonants not yet eliminated.

Candidate words:
- ROGER – but G not tested yet, positions: R1, O2, G3; but O cannot be in 3 and R cannot be in 2, so this is okay for R and O here.
- CORER – C not tested yet, positions: C1, O2, R3; R can be in 3, O can be in 2 – good.
- HORDE – H and D not tested, positions: H1, O2, R3 – good.
- BORNE – B and N not tested, positions: B1, O2, R3 – good.

I’ll choose BORNE because B and N are high-frequency untested consonants, and it places O in 2 and R in 3 (both positions not yet ruled out).

Usable vowels left: I, U (since E and O are already placed).

Common letters fitting pattern _ O R _ E:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information about the secret word. A common strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are popular choices because they contain common vowels and consonants.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify or eliminate many possible letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A (x) – A is not in the word.
- R (-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O (-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S (x) – S is not in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word:
- ends with E
- contains R (not in position 2) and O (not in position 3)
- does NOT contain A or S

Since S is out, many consonant combinations shrink.  
Common words ending in E that contain both R and O are things like:
- TROVE (but O is 2nd here, and we know O is not in position 3; this still allows O in 2nd)
- GROVE
- BROKE
- PROVE

I’ll pick “TROVE” next because it re-uses R and O in different positions and adds T and V, high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

<guess>TROVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TROVE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize the information we have:

1. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, S, T, V.
2. Letters confirmed IN the word: E (must be last), R and O (both are somewhere, but not yet placed).

Known pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E  
with R and O somewhere in the first four positions.

What we still don’t know: the remaining two consonants (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 excluding the positions already tested).

In Guess 2 (TROVE) we placed:
- T (x) – not in word
- R in position 2 (feedback -) – so R is NOT in position 2
- O in position 3 (feedback -) – so O is NOT in position 3
- V (x) – not in word
- E (✓) – already known to be last.

So now we know:
- R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4
- O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4

To quickly test plausible combinations, we should pick a word that places R and O in new positions and introduces two fresh consonants not yet eliminated.

Candidate words:
- ROGER – but G not tested yet, positions: R1, O2, G3; but O cannot be in 3 and R cannot be in 2, so this is okay for R and O here.
- CORER – C not tested yet, positions: C1, O2, R3; R can be in 3, O can be in 2 – good.
- HORDE – H and D not tested, positions: H1, O2, R3 – good.
- BORNE – B and N not tested, positions: B1, O2, R3 – good.

I’ll choose BORNE because B and N are high-frequency untested consonants, and it places O in 2 and R in 3 (both positions not yet ruled out).

So the pattern is fixed: _ O R _ E

All letters eliminated so far: A, B, N, S, T, V.

Usable consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Usable vowels left: I, U (since E and O are already placed).

Common letters fitting pattern _ O R _ E:

- D   gives: DOR_E → DORSE? Not valid.  
- F   gives: FORCE (F, O, R, C, E) – all letters still allowed and valid word.  
- G   gives: GORGE – but G in 4th spot repeats G. Possible, but we’ll test non-repeating letters first.
