For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word ends in E and has R and O somewhere, but not where they were guessed.
- No A or S anywhere.
- Still need to place R and O plus discover three other letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E fixed in the 5th slot.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses:

Guess 1: A R O S E → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: O R I E L → O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)

From both sets together:

- E is definitely in the word and is in the 5th position (last letter).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1, 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 1. Possible positions: 2, 4.  
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, I, L.  
- We still have no information about T, N, C, D, etc.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- contains both R and O (each only once) in places that haven’t been ruled out
- avoids the letters A, S, I, L

Try placing R in position 4 and O in position 2:
- _ O _ R E

Fill the remaining slots with common untested letters: T and N.
That gives T O N R E → TONRE (invalid). Let’s swap letters to find a valid word.

A valid word that fits _ O _ R E is “TOWER”.

Check:
- T, W, E are untested; E is already confirmed at 5.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- R is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

So “TOWER” is a good next guess.

Summary of everything we know after three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in slot 5.  
   - R is somewhere in the word but NOT in 2,3,5.  
   - O is somewhere but NOT in 3,1,5.  
   - A, S are out.

2. ORIEL → O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)  
   - Confirms O not in 1,3,5; R not in 2,3,5; I, L are out.

3. TOWER → T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(-) R(-)  
   - O is now confirmed to be in slot 2.  
   - R still not in 5 (already known) and in this guess R was in 5, so nothing new on R position, but R is still somewhere besides 2,3,5. The only possible slots remaining for R are 1 or 4.  
   - E is in slot 5.  
   - T, W are out.

So far we have:

- Positions: 2 = O, 5 = E.  
- R must be in slot 1 or 4.  
- We still need two more distinct letters (slots 1/3 or 3/4) from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We also don’t know anything about slots 1 or 3 or 4 except the constraints above.

Let’s try R in slot 1: R O _ _ E.  
We need two more distinct letters for slots 3 and 4.  
Let’s pick common consonants that haven’t been used yet: N and D.  
That gives R O N D E → ""RONDE"" is uncommon.  

Instead let’s use N and G: R O N G E → ""R O N G E"" is ""Ronge"" which is not a valid English word.  

Swap to R in slot 4: _ O _ R E.  
This leaves slots 1 and 3.  
We need two distinct letters, not yet used.  
Common choices: C and N → C O N R E → ""CONRE"" not valid.  
B and N → B O N R E → ""BONRE"" no.  
B and K → B O K R E → ""BOKRE"" no.  
C and K → C O K E R → ""COKER"" valid.  

""COKER"" fits:
- C, K unused letters  
- O in 2 (confirmed)  
- R in 4 (allowed)  
- E in 5 (confirmed)  
- No forbidden letters.  

So ""COKER"" is a good candidate.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,gorge,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we know:
- Word ends in E and has R and O somewhere, but not where they were guessed.
- No A or S anywhere.
- Still need to place R and O plus discover three other letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E fixed in the 5th slot.
2. Move R and O to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ _ E  
Try a word with O in position 1, R in position 3, and new common consonants: ORBEL, ORIEL, or ORDER.  
“ORIEL” is a valid word that places O in position 1 and R in position 3 while adding I and L. This tests three fresh letters (I, L) and rearranges O and R.

Guess 1: A R O S E → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: O R I E L → O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)

From both sets together:

- E is definitely in the word and is in the 5th position (last letter).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1, 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 1. Possible positions: 2, 4.  
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, I, L.  
- We still have no information about T, N, C, D, etc.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- contains both R and O (each only once) in places that haven’t been ruled out
- avoids the letters A, S, I, L

Try placing R in position 4 and O in position 2:
- _ O _ R E

Fill the remaining slots with common untested letters: T and N.
That gives T O N R E → TONRE (invalid). Let’s swap letters to find a valid word.

A valid word that fits _ O _ R E is “TOWER”.

Check:
- T, W, E are untested; E is already confirmed at 5.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- R is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

So “TOWER” is a good next guess.

  Therefore R must be in position 1:  
  Pattern so far: R O _ _ E
- Letters eliminated so far: A, S, I, L, T, W, C, K
- Still unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, Y

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE."" I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So we know:
- Word ends in E and has R and O somewhere, but not where they were guessed.
- No A or S anywhere.
- Still need to place R and O plus discover three other letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep E fixed in the 5th slot.
2. Move R and O to new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ _ E  
Try a word with O in position 1, R in position 3, and new common consonants: ORBEL, ORIEL, or ORDER.  
“ORIEL” is a valid word that places O in position 1 and R in position 3 while adding I and L. This tests three fresh letters (I, L) and rearranges O and R.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses:

Guess 1: A R O S E → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: O R I E L → O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)

From both sets together:

- E is definitely in the word and is in the 5th position (last letter).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1, 4.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 1. Possible positions: 2, 4.  
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, I, L.  
- We still have no information about T, N, C, D, etc.

We need a word that:
- ends with E
- contains both R and O (each only once) in places that haven’t been ruled out
- avoids the letters A, S, I, L

Try placing R in position 4 and O in position 2:
- _ O _ R E

Fill the remaining slots with common untested letters: T and N.
That gives T O N R E → TONRE (invalid). Let’s swap letters to find a valid word.

A valid word that fits _ O _ R E is “TOWER”.

Check:
- T, W, E are untested; E is already confirmed at 5.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- R is in position 4 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

So “TOWER” is a good next guess.

Guess 2: ORIEL -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)
Guess 3: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of everything we know after three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in slot 5.  
   - R is somewhere in the word but NOT in 2,3,5.  
   - O is somewhere but NOT in 3,1,5.  
   - A, S are out.

2. ORIEL → O(-) R(-) I(x) E(-) L(x)  
   - Confirms O not in 1,3,5; R not in 2,3,5; I, L are out.

3. TOWER → T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(-) R(-)  
   - O is now confirmed to be in slot 2.  
   - R still not in 5 (already known) and in this guess R was in 5, so nothing new on R position, but R is still somewhere besides 2,3,5. The only possible slots remaining for R are 1 or 4.  
   - E is in slot 5.  
   - T, W are out.

So far we have:

- Positions: 2 = O, 5 = E.  
- R must be in slot 1 or 4.  
- We still need two more distinct letters (slots 1/3 or 3/4) from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We also don’t know anything about slots 1 or 3 or 4 except the constraints above.

Let’s try R in slot 1: R O _ _ E.  
We need two more distinct letters for slots 3 and 4.  
Let’s pick common consonants that haven’t been used yet: N and D.  
That gives R O N D E → ""RONDE"" is uncommon.  

Instead let’s use N and G: R O N G E → ""R O N G E"" is ""Ronge"" which is not a valid English word.  

Swap to R in slot 4: _ O _ R E.  
This leaves slots 1 and 3.  
We need two distinct letters, not yet used.  
Common choices: C and N → C O N R E → ""CONRE"" not valid.  
B and N → B O N R E → ""BONRE"" no.  
B and K → B O K R E → ""BOKRE"" no.  
C and K → C O K E R → ""COKER"" valid.  

""COKER"" fits:
- C, K unused letters  
- O in 2 (confirmed)  
- R in 4 (allowed)  
- E in 5 (confirmed)  
- No forbidden letters.  

So ""COKER"" is a good candidate.

Guess 3: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(-) R(-)
Guess 4: COKER -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) K(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Consolidating all feedback:

- Position 2 = O (from TOWER & COKER)
- Position 5 = E (from AROSE)
- R must appear once; it cannot be in 2,3,5 (from AROSE, ORIEL, TOWER, COKER) and was just tried in 4 (COKER), so it failed there.  
  Therefore R must be in position 1:  
  Pattern so far: R O _ _ E
- Letters eliminated so far: A, S, I, L, T, W, C, K
- Still unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, Y

We need two different letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Let’s pick common, high-frequency letters that haven’t been excluded and form a valid word.

Try position-3 = N, position-4 = D → R O N D E, but “RONDE” isn’t common.  
Try position-3 = N, position-4 = G → R O N G E (invalid).  
Try position-3 = B, position-4 = N → R O B N E (invalid).  
Try position-3 = M, position-4 = B → R O M B E? Doesn’t exist.  
Try position-3 = M, position-4 = N → R O M N E (invalid).  
Try position-3 = U, position-4 = N → R O U N E? No.  
Try position-3 = D, position-4 = M → R O D M E? No.  
Try position-3 = N, position-4 = E is already 5.  
Try position-3 = P, position-4 = N → R O P N E (invalid).  
Try position-3 = N, position-4 = D again; “RONDE” is a rare variant spelling but may not be accepted.

Instead, swap: position-3 = D, position-4 = N → R O D N E (invalid).

Wait—let’s list actual words ending “_ _ _ N E” that start R O and avoid all excluded letters.

R O _ _ E with unused consonants B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, Y.

Possible:  
- R O G U E – “rogue” is valid, uses G and U which have not been tested.  
- R O M P E – no.  
- R O B E E – no.  
- R O D E O – but ends in O, not E.  
- R O P E D – ends in D.  
- R O U G E – “rouge” ends in E, uses R O U G E.  
  Letters: R(1), O(2), U(3), G(4), E(5). All letters except R,O,E are new and not eliminated.

Check constraints:
- R is in 1 (allowed).  
- O is in 2 (confirmed).  
- U, G have never been used and not eliminated.  
- Matches pattern _ O _ _ E.

“ROUGE” is a valid English word (cosmetic term).
