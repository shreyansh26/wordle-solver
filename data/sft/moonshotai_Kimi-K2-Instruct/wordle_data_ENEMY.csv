This is the first guess, so I have no prior feedback to guide me. My goal is to make an initial guess that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help identify or eliminate many possibilities.

Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. I want to choose a word that incorporates several of these without repeating letters.

Looking at options:
- ""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters
- ""AROSE"" is another good option
- ""STARE"" is also strong

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels and two very common consonants, giving good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
R, A, I, S, U, T

Letters that ARE in the word:  
N  (in the correct position 2)

Letters whose presence is still unknown:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

From UNMET we additionally learned:
- M is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the secret word looks like:  
_ N _ _ _  
and must include both M and E somewhere outside the positions already ruled out.

Positions ruled out for each:
M ≠ 3  
E ≠ 5 (from RAISE) and E ≠ 4 (from UNMET)  
So M can be in 1, 4, or 5  
E can be in 1, 2, or 3  (but 2 is already N, so 1 or 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has N in position 2  
- contains both M and E in allowable positions  
- avoids all excluded letters (R, A, I, S, U, T)

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible word shapes:
- E N M _ _   (E in 1, M in 3) → but M cannot be in 3, so invalid
- _ N E M _   (E in 3, M in 4)
- _ N _ M E   (E in 5) → invalid, E can’t be in 5
- E N _ _ M   (E in 1, M in 5)
- _ N E _ M   (E in 3, M in 5)

Two promising patterns:
1. _ N E M _  → needs letters in 1 and 5
2. _ N _ M E  → invalid (E can’t be in 5)
3. E N _ _ M  → needs letters in 3 and 4

So the valid templates are:
- _ N E M _ or E N _ _ M

Let’s try to construct words:

For _ N E M _:
- B N E M _ → BNEMB, BNEMC… no valid English 5-letter word
- C N E M _ → CNEM_ no
- D N E M _ → DNEM_ no
- H N E M _ → HNEM_ no
- L N E M _ → LNEM_ no
- O N E M _ → ONEM_ no
- W N E M _ → WNEM_ no
- Y N E M _ → YNEM_ no

Looks like no common words fit _ N E M _.

For E N _ _ M:
- E N D O M → “ENDOM” (not a word)
- E N D Y M → no
- E N L Y M → no
- E N O L M → no
- E N V Y M → no
- E N D Y M → no
- E N C O M → “ENCOM” – also not a word
- E N J O M → no
- E N D O M → no
- E N B O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N J O M → no
- E N F O M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N L O M → no

Hmm, none immediately apparent. Let’s reconsider.

Maybe M in position 1, N in 2, and E somewhere allowed.

Pattern: M N E _ _  (E in 3) – valid  
or M N _ E _ (E in 4) – invalid  
or M N _ _ E (E in 5) – invalid  

So only M N E _ _ works.

Valid English 5-letter words starting MN:
- M N E M O → MNEMO (not a word)
- M N E M E → no
- M N E W S → no
- M N E S S → no
- M N E X T → no
- M N E X T → no
- M N E W S → no

None. Let’s try M in position 5:

_ N _ _ M  
with E in 1 or 3:

E N _ _ M (E in 1) – need letters 3 and 4  
- E N D O M → “ENDOM” – no
- E N J O M → no
- E N G O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N C O M → no
- E N P O M → no
- E N B O M → no
- E N B A M → no (A excluded)
- E N B I M → no (I excluded)
- E N B U M → no (U excluded)
- E N B Y M → no
- E N C O M → no
- E N C E M → no
- E N C L M → no
- E N C Y M → no
- E N D O M → no
- E N D Y M → no
- E N F O M → no
- E N F Y M → no
- E N G O M → no
- E N G Y M → no
- E N J O M → no
- E N J Y M → no
- E N K O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N L Y M → no
- E N P O M → no
- E N P Y M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N V Y M → no
- E N W O M → no
- E N Y O M → no
- E N Z O M → no

None found. Next possibility: E in 3, M in 5:

_ N E _ M  
Need letters 1 and 4.

Common valid words:
- B N E L M → no
- C N E L M → no
- D N E L M → no
- F N E L M → no
- G N E L M → no
- H N E L M → no
- J N E L M → no
- K N E L M → no
- L N E L M → no
- M N E L M → no
- O N E L M → no
- P N E L M → no
- Q N E L M → no
- V N E L M → no
- W N E L M → no
- X N E L M → no
- Y N E L M → no
- Z N E L M → no

None.

Next pattern: M in 4, E in 1 or 3:

E N _ M _ (E in 1, M in 4) – need 3 and 5  
- E N D M O → “ENDMO” – no
- E N J M O → no
- E N L M O → no
- E N V M O → no
- E N C M O → no
- E N B M O → no
- E N P M O → no
- E N Y M O → no
- E N Z M O → no

None.

_ N E M _ (E in 3, M in 4) – need 1 and 5  
- B N E M O → “BNEMO” – no
- C N E M O → “CNEMO” – no
- D N E M O → “DNEMO” – no
- H N E M O → “HNEMO” – no
- L N E M O → “LNEMO” – no
- O N E M O → “ONEMO” – no
- P N E M O → “PNEMO” – no
- V N E M O → “VNEMO” – no
- W N E M O → “WNEMO” – no
- Y N E M O → “YNEMO” – no

None.

Next: M in 1, N in 2, E in 3:

M N E _ _ – need 4 and 5  
- M N E M O → “MNEMO” – no
- M N E L O → “MNELO” – no
- M N E Y O → “MNEYO” – no
- M N E G O → “MNEGO” – no
- M N E P O → “MNEPO” – no
- M N E C O → “MNECO” – no
- M N E B O → “MNEBO” – no
- M N E D O → “MNEDO” – no
- M N E F O → “MNEFO” – no
- M N E H O → “MNEHO” – no
- M N E J O → “MNEJO” – no
- M N E K O → “MNEKO” – no
- M N E V O → “MNEVO” – no
- M N E W O → “MNEW O” – no
- M N E X O → “MNEXO” – no
- M N E Z O → “MNEZO” – no

No valid 5-letter word.

At this point I realize I may need to broaden the letters considered for 1 and 5. Let me try:

_ N E M _ (E in 3, M in 4) – need 1 and 5  
Example: “KNEME” – no, K, N, E, M, E – not a word  
“DNEME” – no  
“GNEME” – no  

“ONEME” – no  
“PNEMA” – no (A excluded)  
“YNEME” – no  

“BNEMA” – no  
“CNEMA” – no  

Wait, “GNOME” – let me check: G, N, O, M, E  
- G – allowed  
- N – fixed in 2 ✓  
- O – allowed  
- M – allowed, position 4 (not ruled out)  
- E – allowed, position 5 (but E was ""-"" in 5 from RAISE, so invalid)

So “GNOME” is invalid because E can’t be in 5.

Next: “ENEMY” – E, N, E, M, Y  
- E in 1 ✓  
- N in 2 ✓  
- E in 3 ✓ (allowed)  
- M in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- Y in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
- Letters: E, N, E, M, Y – none of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, U, T)  
- This is an actual word.

“ENEMY” fits all constraints:
- N in position 2 ✓  
- Contains E and M ✓  
- E not in 4 or 5 ✓ (E is in 1,3)  
- M not in 3 ✓ (M is in 4)  
- No R, A, I, S, U, T ✓

Therefore, the best next guess is ENEMY.

Letters that ARE in the word:  
N  (in the correct position 2)

Letters whose presence is still unknown:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

From UNMET we additionally learned:
- M is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the secret word looks like:  
_ N _ _ _  
and must include both M and E somewhere outside the positions already ruled out.

Positions ruled out for each:
M ≠ 3  
E ≠ 5 (from RAISE) and E ≠ 4 (from UNMET)  
So M can be in 1, 4, or 5  
E can be in 1, 2, or 3  (but 2 is already N, so 1 or 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- has N in position 2  
- contains both M and E in allowable positions  
- avoids all excluded letters (R, A, I, S, U, T)

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible word shapes:
- E N M _ _   (E in 1, M in 3) → but M cannot be in 3, so invalid
- _ N E M _   (E in 3, M in 4)
- _ N _ M E   (E in 5) → invalid, E can’t be in 5
- E N _ _ M   (E in 1, M in 5)
- _ N E _ M   (E in 3, M in 5)

Two promising patterns:
1. _ N E M _  → needs letters in 1 and 5
2. _ N _ M E  → invalid (E can’t be in 5)
3. E N _ _ M  → needs letters in 3 and 4

So the valid templates are:
- _ N E M _ or E N _ _ M

Let’s try to construct words:

For _ N E M _:
- B N E M _ → BNEMB, BNEMC… no valid English 5-letter word
- C N E M _ → CNEM_ no
- D N E M _ → DNEM_ no
- H N E M _ → HNEM_ no
- L N E M _ → LNEM_ no
- O N E M _ → ONEM_ no
- W N E M _ → WNEM_ no
- Y N E M _ → YNEM_ no

Looks like no common words fit _ N E M _.

For E N _ _ M:
- E N D O M → “ENDOM” (not a word)
- E N D Y M → no
- E N L Y M → no
- E N O L M → no
- E N V Y M → no
- E N D Y M → no
- E N C O M → “ENCOM” – also not a word
- E N J O M → no
- E N D O M → no
- E N B O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N J O M → no
- E N F O M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N L O M → no

Hmm, none immediately apparent. Let’s reconsider.

Maybe M in position 1, N in 2, and E somewhere allowed.

Pattern: M N E _ _  (E in 3) – valid  
or M N _ E _ (E in 4) – invalid  
or M N _ _ E (E in 5) – invalid  

So only M N E _ _ works.

Valid English 5-letter words starting MN:
- M N E M O → MNEMO (not a word)
- M N E M E → no
- M N E W S → no
- M N E S S → no
- M N E X T → no
- M N E X T → no
- M N E W S → no

None. Let’s try M in position 5:

_ N _ _ M  
with E in 1 or 3:

E N _ _ M (E in 1) – need letters 3 and 4  
- E N D O M → “ENDOM” – no
- E N J O M → no
- E N G O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N C O M → no
- E N P O M → no
- E N B O M → no
- E N B A M → no (A excluded)
- E N B I M → no (I excluded)
- E N B U M → no (U excluded)
- E N B Y M → no
- E N C O M → no
- E N C E M → no
- E N C L M → no
- E N C Y M → no
- E N D O M → no
- E N D Y M → no
- E N F O M → no
- E N F Y M → no
- E N G O M → no
- E N G Y M → no
- E N J O M → no
- E N J Y M → no
- E N K O M → no
- E N L O M → no
- E N L Y M → no
- E N P O M → no
- E N P Y M → no
- E N V O M → no
- E N V Y M → no
- E N W O M → no
- E N Y O M → no
- E N Z O M → no

None found. Next possibility: E in 3, M in 5:

_ N E _ M  
Need letters 1 and 4.

Common valid words:
- B N E L M → no
- C N E L M → no
- D N E L M → no
- F N E L M → no
- G N E L M → no
- H N E L M → no
- J N E L M → no
- K N E L M → no
- L N E L M → no
- M N E L M → no
- O N E L M → no
- P N E L M → no
- Q N E L M → no
- V N E L M → no
- W N E L M → no
- X N E L M → no
- Y N E L M → no
- Z N E L M → no

None.

Next pattern: M in 4, E in 1 or 3:

E N _ M _ (E in 1, M in 4) – need 3 and 5  
- E N D M O → “ENDMO” – no
- E N J M O → no
- E N L M O → no
- E N V M O → no
- E N C M O → no
- E N B M O → no
- E N P M O → no
- E N Y M O → no
- E N Z M O → no

None.

_ N E M _ (E in 3, M in 4) – need 1 and 5  
- B N E M O → “BNEMO” – no
- C N E M O → “CNEMO” – no
- D N E M O → “DNEMO” – no
- H N E M O → “HNEMO” – no
- L N E M O → “LNEMO” – no
- O N E M O → “ONEMO” – no
- P N E M O → “PNEMO” – no
- V N E M O → “VNEMO” – no
- W N E M O → “WNEMO” – no
- Y N E M O → “YNEMO” – no

None.

Next: M in 1, N in 2, E in 3:

M N E _ _ – need 4 and 5  
- M N E M O → “MNEMO” – no
- M N E L O → “MNELO” – no
- M N E Y O → “MNEYO” – no
- M N E G O → “MNEGO” – no
- M N E P O → “MNEPO” – no
- M N E C O → “MNECO” – no
- M N E B O → “MNEBO” – no
- M N E D O → “MNEDO” – no
- M N E F O → “MNEFO” – no
- M N E H O → “MNEHO” – no
- M N E J O → “MNEJO” – no
- M N E K O → “MNEKO” – no
- M N E V O → “MNEVO” – no
- M N E W O → “MNEW O” – no
- M N E X O → “MNEXO” – no
- M N E Z O → “MNEZO” – no

No valid 5-letter word.

At this point I realize I may need to broaden the letters considered for 1 and 5. Let me try:

_ N E M _ (E in 3, M in 4) – need 1 and 5  
Example: “KNEME” – no, K, N, E, M, E – not a word  
“DNEME” – no  
“GNEME” – no  

“ONEME” – no  
“PNEMA” – no (A excluded)  
“YNEME” – no  

“BNEMA” – no  
“CNEMA” – no  

Wait, “GNOME” – let me check: G, N, O, M, E  
- G – allowed  
- N – fixed in 2 ✓  
- O – allowed  
- M – allowed, position 4 (not ruled out)  
- E – allowed, position 5 (but E was ""-"" in 5 from RAISE, so invalid)

So “GNOME” is invalid because E can’t be in 5.

Next: “ENEMY” – E, N, E, M, Y  
- E in 1 ✓  
- N in 2 ✓  
- E in 3 ✓ (allowed)  
- M in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- Y in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
- Letters: E, N, E, M, Y – none of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, U, T)  
- This is an actual word.

“ENEMY” fits all constraints:
- N in position 2 ✓  
- Contains E and M ✓  
- E not in 4 or 5 ✓ (E is in 1,3)  
- M not in 3 ✓ (M is in 4)  
- No R, A, I, S, U, T ✓

Therefore, the best next guess is ENEMY.",Guess 3: ENEMY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) E(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
