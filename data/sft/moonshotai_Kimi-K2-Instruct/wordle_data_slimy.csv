For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. Choosing a word with common vowels and consonants helps eliminate many possibilities quickly. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong opening guess because it contains:

- C: common consonant
- R: common consonant, also starts many clusters
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: most common ending vowel

This combination provides good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are NOT in the word.  
That means we can safely eliminate every word containing any of those five letters.  
So we need a new 5-letter word composed entirely of letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.  
To keep maximizing information, we still want common consonants and a mix of vowels that remain available.  
The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).  
Strong consonants that are not yet ruled out include S, T, L, D, M, P, H, K, etc.

A balanced word that uses three of those remaining vowels/consonants is “SLOTH”:

- S – common consonant
- L – common consonant
- O – common vowel
- T – common consonant
- H – common consonant

None of these letters overlap with the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, E}.

From the two guesses we already have:

- CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  ⇒ the secret word contains **none** of C, R, A, N, E.

- SLOTH → S(✓) L(✓) O(x) T(x) H(x)  
  ⇒ S and L are **in the word and in the correct positions** (1st and 2nd letters respectively).  
  ⇒ O, T, H are **not in the word at all**.

So far we know:

1. Word must start with S L _ _ _
2. The remaining three slots can only use letters **not** in {C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H}.
3. The still-allowed letters (from the rest of the alphabet) that are fairly common are:  
   B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Begins with SL.
- Uses only the allowed letters in positions 3-5.
- Is a valid English 5-letter word.

Possible valid words that fit are:  
- SLIMY  
- SLUMP  
- SLUNG  
- SLINK  
- SLUFF  
- SLUDG (not a word)  
- SLUMS  

Among these, “SLIMY” uses several common remaining letters (I, M, Y) and might give us maximal information.
