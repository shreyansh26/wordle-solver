- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good vowel coverage to maximize information gain. I'll pick a word with frequent consonants like S, T, R, N and common vowels like E and A. A good choice is ""STARE"" because:
- S is very common in English words
- T, R are also highly frequent
- A and E cover the two most common vowels
- The combination gives good positional coverage across different letters

From the feedback:
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- R is correct in position 4 (✓)
- S, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the target word has the pattern: _ _ A R _ with no S, T, or E.  
Next I need a word that:
1. Has A in position 3 and R in position 4.
2. Does not contain S, T, or E.
3. Uses common consonants to test for other positions.

Good consonants to test next are L, N, D, C, M.  
A word that fits _ _ A R _ and avoids S/T/E is “CHARM”:  
- C tests position 1, H position 2, M position 5.  
- None of the letters S, T, E are present.  
- A and R are already confirmed in positions 3 and 4.

So “CHARM” is a strong second guess.
