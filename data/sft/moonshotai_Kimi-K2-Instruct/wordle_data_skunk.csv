For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather good information about the secret word. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English. Some popular choices include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) 
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage of consonants and vowels. This should provide useful feedback about which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

So far we know:
- The letter N is in the word and in the 5th position.
- Letters C, R, A, E are NOT in the word at all.

We need a word that:
1. Ends with N.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
3. Contains only other letters.

Good remaining consonants to try: S, T, L, D, G, B, M, P, F, H, K, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let’s pick a word that ends with N and uses some of these new letters.  
A strong second-guess candidate is ""STOON"" (S, T, O, O, N), but ""STOON"" isn't a common valid word.  
Another option is ""STING"" (but it doesn’t end with N).  
Valid option: ""POINT"" – but it has an E which is disallowed.  
Valid option: ""STING"" – but N isn’t in the 5th spot.  
Valid option: ""SOUND"" – ends with D, not N.  

Let me look for a word ending with N, no C, R, A, E.  
Valid candidates:  
- STINK (but K isn’t confirmed yet)  
- STONE (has E)  
- BOUND (ends with D)  
- SPAWN (has A)  

Wait, let me think of ""STUNG"" – but N isn’t last.  
Valid word ending with N: ""STUNN"" – no, invalid.  
""STOUN"" – invalid.  
""STONN"" – invalid.  

Let me list 5-letter words ending with N that don’t contain C, R, A, E:  
- STING (N not last)  
- STINK (N not last)  
- STUNK (N not last)  
- BISON (has O, S, I, N – and N is last!)  
- PISTON (too long)

A strong second-guess candidate is ""STOON"" (S, T, O, O, N), but ""STOON"" isn't a common valid word.  
Another option is ""STING"" (but it doesn’t end with N).  
Valid option: ""POINT"" – but it has an E which is disallowed.  
Valid option: ""STING"" – but N isn’t in the 5th spot.  
Valid option: ""SOUND"" – ends with D, not N.  

Let me look for a word ending with N, no C, R, A, E.  
Valid candidates:  
- STINK (but K isn’t confirmed yet)  
- STONE (has E)  
- BOUND (ends with D)  
- SPAWN (has A)  

Wait, let me think of ""STUNG"" – but N isn’t last.  
Valid word ending with N: ""STUNN"" – no, invalid.  
""STOUN"" – invalid.  
""STONN"" – invalid.  

Let me list 5-letter words ending with N that don’t contain C, R, A, E:  
- STING (N not last)  
- STINK (N not last)  
- STUNK (N not last)  
- BISON (has O, S, I, N – and N is last!)  
- PISTON (too long)  
- STAIN (has A)  
- STONE (has E)  

""BISON"" fits: ends with N, no C, R, A, E. Letters: B, I, S, O, N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: BISON -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(x) S(-) O(x) N(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
   – N is in the word and in the 5th position.
   – C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. BISON → B(x) I(x) S(-) O(x) N(-)
   – N appears again, but this time it is marked “-” (wrong position) because it’s in the 4th spot of BISON while we already know it must be in the 5th spot.  
   – S is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – but position 5 is already taken by N).

Letters still allowed: any letters except C, R, A, E, B, I, O.  
So far we have:  
  – Pattern: _ _ _ _ N  
  – Must contain S somewhere in positions 1-4.  
  – May also contain any of the remaining letters D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word ending in N, containing S, and avoiding the banned letters.

Candidate words:
- STUNG (N already at 5, S at 1) – but U and G are okay  
- SWUNG – same issue with U and G  
- STUNK – same  
- STUNS – S at 1 and 4, but we only know one S is required  
- STUNN – invalid  
- STINT – contains I (banned)  
- STENT – contains E (banned)  
- SHUNT – contains U and H, both allowed, ends in N, contains S  
- SLUNG – contains L, U, G, ends in N, contains S  
- SWINE – contains I and E (banned)  

Among these, “SHUNT” is a valid English word:
 – ends with N ✔
 – contains S (at position 1) and it’s allowed to be there ✔
 – all letters (S, H, U, N, T) avoid the banned list ✔
 – no repeated letters ✔

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From all feedback so far:

- Position 5 is definitely N.
- Position 1 is definitely S.
- Position 3 is definitely U.
- Known pattern: S _ U _ N

Forbidden letters now:  
C, R, A, E, B, I, O, T, H, L, G

So positions 2 and 4 must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants:  
D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any others not yet ruled out).

We need a real English 5-letter word matching S _ U _ N.

Scanning the remaining possibilities:

- S D U _ N → SDU?N – no dictionary word.  
- S F U _ N → SFU?N – no dictionary word.  
- S M U _ N → SMU?N – SMURN, SMUDN, etc. – none valid.  
- S P U _ N → SPURN – but R is banned.  
- S K U _ N → SKU?N – SKUNK is a valid word: S K U N K.  
  – Check against bans: K not banned, N is fixed at 5, K placed at 4.  
  – Word is SKUNK.

SKUNK fits every constraint.
