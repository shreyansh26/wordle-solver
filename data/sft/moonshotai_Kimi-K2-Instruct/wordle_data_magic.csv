For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- STARE

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters
- Three vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Common consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in many English words

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(-) – letter C appears somewhere in the word, but not first.
- R(x) – letter R never appears in the word.
- A(-) – letter A appears somewhere in the word, but not third.
- N(x) – letter N never appears in the word.
- E(x) – letter E never appears in the word.

Takeaways:
1. Eliminate R, N, E from future guesses.
2. C and A are somewhere in the word (positions unknown).
3. The word contains neither R, N, nor E, so vowels left are A, I, O, U (A is already confirmed).
4. Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y plus C.

I need a word that:
- Uses C in a new position (not first).
- Uses A in a new position (not third).
- Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible new word: “CHALK”
- C is now in position 2 (was in position 1 before).
- A is now in position 3 (was in position 3 before – oops, that’s the same spot!).

Better choice: “COAST”
- C in position 1 again – no good, needs to move.
- S, T haven’t been ruled out.

Next candidate: “SCAMP”
- C in position 2.
- A in position 3 again – same problem.

Another candidate: “CLOUD”
- C in position 1 – still first letter, same problem.

Candidate: “CABIN” – but N is ruled out.

Candidate: “CABOB” – uses C, A; C in position 1 again.

Wait: I need C not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Let’s list positions:
- C can be 2-5
- A can be 1,2,4,5

Try “SPACK” – but K is fine, but P hasn’t been ruled out either.

“CLOAK”:
- C in 1 – no.
“CABLE” – E ruled out.
“CACAO” – E ruled out, but C twice might waste info.

“CATCH” – E ruled out, C twice.

“CABIN” – N ruled out.

“CAVIL” – V and L okay, but C in position 1.

Better to avoid C in position 1 entirely. Let’s think of words without C first to place A somewhere.

“A” must appear somewhere, so let’s find a word with A not in position 3, and no R, N, E.

New word: “BAHUT” – too obscure.

“FAINT” – no N.
“FAULT” – no E, R, N.
“GAUDY” – no C, but C has to appear.

We need to include C somewhere not position 1 and A somewhere not position 3.

“CLOAK” – C in 1, no.
“COBIA” – C in 1, no.
“SCARF” – R ruled out.
“SCALD” – R ruled out, but A in 3 again.

“SCAMP” – N ruled out, but A in 3.

“SCUBA” – A in 5 (good), C in 2 (good), and uses U, B, S which are allowed.

Let’s check “SCUBA”:
- S, C, U, B, A.
- C in position 2 (was in 1, now in 2 – ✓)
- A in position 5 (was in 3, now in 5 – ✓)
- No E, R, N – ✓
- Introduces S, U, B – new letters.

Common letters not yet used: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, T, V, W, Y.

We need a word that:  
1. Contains C and A.  
2. Places C only in positions 3, 4 or 5.  
3. Places A only in positions 1, 2 or 4.  
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:  
- C in 3: DACIA (invalid, uses I, but C in 3 good; A in 2 and 4) – but A twice might be wasteful.  
- C in 4: FACET (invalid, E) – skip.  
- C in 5: CAPIA (invalid, uses I, but A in 2 and 4) – again A twice.  
- C in 3: CACTI – double C not helpful, I allowed.  
- C in 3: MACAW – W allowed, A in 2 and 4.  
- C in 4: LACED – E invalid.  
- C in 5: PICOT – O, I, T allowed; A missing.  
- C in 3: MACHO – A in 2, C in 3, H, M, O allowed.

""MACHO"" fits all constraints:
- C in position 3 (valid from CRANE and SCUBA)  
- A in position 2 (valid from SCUBA not 5, CRANE not 3)  
- Uses M, H, O which are new letters and still allowed

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- STARE

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters
- Three vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Common consonants (C, R, N) that frequently appear in many English words

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(-) – letter C appears somewhere in the word, but not first.
- R(x) – letter R never appears in the word.
- A(-) – letter A appears somewhere in the word, but not third.
- N(x) – letter N never appears in the word.
- E(x) – letter E never appears in the word.

Takeaways:
1. Eliminate R, N, E from future guesses.
2. C and A are somewhere in the word (positions unknown).
3. The word contains neither R, N, nor E, so vowels left are A, I, O, U (A is already confirmed).
4. Common consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y plus C.

I need a word that:
- Uses C in a new position (not first).
- Uses A in a new position (not third).
- Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible new word: “CHALK”
- C is now in position 2 (was in position 1 before).
- A is now in position 3 (was in position 3 before – oops, that’s the same spot!).

Better choice: “COAST”
- C in position 1 again – no good, needs to move.
- S, T haven’t been ruled out.

Next candidate: “SCAMP”
- C in position 2.
- A in position 3 again – same problem.

Another candidate: “CLOUD”
- C in position 1 – still first letter, same problem.

Candidate: “CABIN” – but N is ruled out.

Candidate: “CABOB” – uses C, A; C in position 1 again.

Wait: I need C not in position 1 and A not in position 3.

Let’s list positions:
- C can be 2-5
- A can be 1,2,4,5

Try “SPACK” – but K is fine, but P hasn’t been ruled out either.

“CLOAK”:
- C in 1 – no.
“CABLE” – E ruled out.
“CACAO” – E ruled out, but C twice might waste info.

“CATCH” – E ruled out, C twice.

“CABIN” – N ruled out.

“CAVIL” – V and L okay, but C in position 1.

Better to avoid C in position 1 entirely. Let’s think of words without C first to place A somewhere.

“A” must appear somewhere, so let’s find a word with A not in position 3, and no R, N, E.

New word: “BAHUT” – too obscure.

“FAINT” – no N.
“FAULT” – no E, R, N.
“GAUDY” – no C, but C has to appear.

We need to include C somewhere not position 1 and A somewhere not position 3.

“CLOAK” – C in 1, no.
“COBIA” – C in 1, no.
“SCARF” – R ruled out.
“SCALD” – R ruled out, but A in 3 again.

“SCAMP” – N ruled out, but A in 3.

“SCUBA” – A in 5 (good), C in 2 (good), and uses U, B, S which are allowed.

Let’s check “SCUBA”:
- S, C, U, B, A.
- C in position 2 (was in 1, now in 2 – ✓)
- A in position 5 (was in 3, now in 5 – ✓)
- No E, R, N – ✓
- Introduces S, U, B – new letters.

This seems optimal.

Positions learned so far:

- A is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from CRANE: not 1; from SCUBA: not 2; from MACHO: not 3).  
  So C must be in position 4 or 5.

Remaining letters that are still possible (not yet eliminated):  
D, F, G, I, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with M
- Has A in position 2
- Has C in position 4 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters from the list above
- Has two more letters from the allowed set

Let’s list possible patterns:
Pattern 1: M A _ C _
Pattern 2: M A _ _ C

Fill the blanks from allowed letters.

Pattern 1: M A _ C _  
Third letter: choose from D, F, G, I, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y  
Fifth letter: same set, can be same or different (but no duplicates unless word has them)

Pattern 2: M A _ _ C  
Third and fourth letters from allowed set.

Let’s find actual words:

From pattern 1 (M A _ C _):
- MAGIC: C is in 4, G allowed – but H is eliminated, so G is okay.  
- MAKIC: not a valid word.  
- MALIC: not a word.  
- MAPIC: not a word.  
- MAVIC: not a word.  
So MAGIC seems valid.

From pattern 2 (M A _ _ C):
- MALIC: not a word.  
- MATIC: not a word.  
- MAFIC: not a word.  
- MADIC: not a word.  

""MAGIC"" is the only valid word I can find that fits the constraints:
- M A _ I C  
- Uses M, A, C in correct positions  
- Uses G and I which are still allowed  

Check if any letters conflict:

- No R, N, E, S, U, B, H, O used.
