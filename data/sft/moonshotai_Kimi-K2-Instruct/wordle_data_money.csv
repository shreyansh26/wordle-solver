For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me maximum information about potential vowels and consonants in the secret word. Common letters in English include A, E, S, T, R, O, L, N, etc. 

After considering various options, I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
2. These letters appear frequently in many 5-letter words
3. It has no repeating letters, which helps maximize information gain
4. The arrangement of letters is common and could match many possible word patterns

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback for AROSE:
- A(x): A is NOT in the word.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: A, R, S.
2. Letters confirmed in the word: O and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
3. The word must contain both O and E, but neither is in the 3rd or 5th position.
4. We need to test new consonants and vowel positions.

Possible approach: Try a word that places O and E in new positions while introducing new common consonants. Since R and S are out, we need other common consonants like T, N, L, etc.

Consider ""TONEY"":
- T: New consonant, common.
- O: Place it in position 2 (was in 3, now moved).
- N: New consonant.
- E: Move to position 4 (was in 5, now moved).
- Y: New letter, could be vowel or consonant.

This covers new positions for O and E and introduces T, N, Y.
