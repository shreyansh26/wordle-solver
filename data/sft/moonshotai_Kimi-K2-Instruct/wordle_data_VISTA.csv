Since this is the first guess, I don't have any feedback to work with. The best strategy for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting some useful feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word should contain as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - which are all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us the best chance of getting some positive feedback (either ✓ or -) to guide our next guesses.

Other good options could be ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it uses 5 of the top 7 most common letters.

Let’s parse the feedback we received for AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but not in first position.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word at all.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in fourth position.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
Letters to keep using: A and S (but not where they were)  
Letters to eliminate: R, O, E  
Positions to avoid for A: 1  
Positions to avoid for S: 4  

We want a new word that:
1. Contains both A and S,
2. Does not contain R, O, or E,
3. Puts A somewhere other than position 1,
4. Puts S somewhere other than position 4.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit those rules, one good candidate is “STASH”:
- Has both S and A,
- S is in position 1 (allowed),
- A is in position 3 (allowed),
- Contains T, H (both still possible),
- Does not contain any of R, O, E.

Other options like “SALTY” would fail because Y isn’t common in the word list, and “SANDY” fails similarly. “STASH” seems solid.

Guess 2 – STASH

What we have learned so far:

Letters that are in the word (but positions still unknown):  
A, S, T   (because each of them received “-” at least once)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:  
R, O, E, H   (received “x”)

Additional positional constraints:

- A can’t be in positions 1 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STASH).  
- S can’t be in positions 1 (from STASH) or 4 (from AROSE).  
- T can’t be in position 2 (from STASH).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, and T exactly once each (since “-” means correct letter, wrong spot, and we have no duplicates indicated).
2. Uses none of the eliminated letters R, O, E, H.
3. Respects the positional bans above for A, S, T.

Let’s map valid positions for each required letter (1-indexed):

A: positions 2, 4, 5  
S: positions 2, 3, 5  
T: positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but must also avoid duplicates)

We need to place A, S, T plus two other distinct consonants that are not on the banned list (no R, O, E, H). Available consonants include B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y (but we’ll only pick two).

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies:

- T in 1  
- A in 2  
- (other letters)  
- S in 5  

That gives T A _ _ S. The two missing letters must be unused so far and not in the banned set. A well-known word fitting this pattern is TAXIS, but X and I haven’t been tested yet and are not banned.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, T – yes.  
- No R, O, E, H – yes.  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- T is in position 1 (allowed).

So TAXIS looks valid and maximizes new letter coverage.

A: positions 2, 4, 5  
S: positions 2, 3, 5  
T: positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but must also avoid duplicates)

We need to place A, S, T plus two other distinct consonants that are not on the banned list (no R, O, E, H). Available consonants include B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y (but we’ll only pick two).

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies:

- T in 1  
- A in 2  
- (other letters)  
- S in 5  

That gives T A _ _ S. The two missing letters must be unused so far and not in the banned set. A well-known word fitting this pattern is TAXIS, but X and I haven’t been tested yet and are not banned.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, S, T – yes.  
- No R, O, E, H – yes.  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- T is in position 1 (allowed).

So TAXIS looks valid and maximizes new letter coverage.

Let’s first collect all the information we have after the three guesses.

Eliminated letters (x feedback):
- R, O, E, H, X

Letters we know ARE in the word (- feedback at least once):
- A, S, T, I

We now know the word is made up of some arrangement of A, S, T, I plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters and we already have four distinct letters that must appear).  
The fifth letter must be one not yet ruled out. From the alphabet, skipping R, O, E, H, X, the remaining common consonants include B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Next, note the positional bans:

- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from AROSE and STASH/TAXIS).
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STASH and TAXIS).
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from STASH and TAXIS).
- I cannot be in position 4 (from TAXIS).

So the allowed positions are:

A: 2, 4, 5  
S: 2, 3  
T: 3, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We have to fit A, S, T, I exactly once each and add one more letter (a new consonant).  
Let’s scan for a valid 5-letter word that uses A, S, T, I plus one new consonant, and respects all positional bans.

A promising pattern is:  
I in position 1, S in position 2, T in position 3, A in position 4, and the new consonant in position 5.

That gives: I S T A _  
The only common letter that fits in the last spot and hasn’t been ruled out is M (forming ISTAM – but that isn’t a word).  
L instead: I S T A L – not a word.  
N: I S T A N – yes, “ISTAN” isn’t valid.  
Wait, let’s reverse the attempt.

Let’s try: T in 5, A in 4, I in 3, S in 2, and new letter in 1:  
_ S I A T – “VSIAT” – no.  
“D” in 1: “DSIAT” – no.  
“P” in 1: “PSIAT” – no.  
“W” in 1: “WSIAT” – no.

How about T in 3, A in 2, I in 1, S in 5:  
I A T _ S – “IATBS” – no.  
“IATCS” – no.

Another arrangement:  
A in 2, S in 3, T in 5, I in 1:  
I A S _ T – “IAS_T” – “IASNT” isn’t a word.

Let’s try:  
I in 5, A in 4, S in 3, T in 2 – “_ T S A I” – “B T S A I” – no.

But “PASTI” is not correct; we need real English words.

Let’s try a concrete word search among common 5-letter words that contain the four known letters plus one new consonant and respect the positional bans.

A valid word that fits is “WAIST”:
- Letters: W, A, I, S, T – all allowed.  
- Positions:
  – W (new letter) in 1 – allowed.  
  – A in 2 – allowed (banned only from 1,3).  
  – I in 3 – allowed (banned only from 4).  
  – S in 4 – but S is banned from 4 (because TAXIS showed S(-) in 5, so S cannot be 4).  
Hence WAIST fails.

Try “WAITS”:
- A in 2 – allowed.  
- I in 3 – allowed.  
- T in 4 – allowed (T banned only from 1,2).  
- S in 5 – allowed (S banned only from 1,4,5).  
Oh, S is banned from 5 (TAXIS showed S(-) in 5). So WAITS fails.

Try “WISTA” – not a word.

Try “PATIO” – contains O (eliminated).

“VISTA” – contains V and T, I, S, A.  
Check positions:  
V (new) – ok.  
I in 2 – ok (banned from 4).  
S in 3 – ok.  
T in 4 – ok.  
A in 5 – ok.  
And VISTA is a real word.

So we have:
V I S T A  
- Contains required letters A, S, T, I.  
- Adds V (new consonant).  
- Positions:  
  – V (1): ok (not banned).  
  – I (2): ok.  
  – S (3): ok.  
  – T (4): ok.  
  – A (5): ok (banned only from 1,3).

This word satisfies all constraints.
