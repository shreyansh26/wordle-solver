For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good starting word should:
1. Use common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a common word that is likely to appear in the word list.

Popular starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are good because they contain frequently used letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers all the main vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

1. Letters we KNOW are in the word: A (position 2 is correct), O (somewhere else), N (somewhere else).
2. Letters eliminated so far: R, S, E, D, I, T.
3. Vowels still possible: none left—A and O are the only two left.  
   (U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, so we should be open to it, but we already have A and O.)

So the secret word has five letters, contains A (fixed at position 2), O and N elsewhere, and never uses R, S, E, D, I, T.

Slots: _ A _ _ _

Remaining consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but most of these are uncommon).

We need to place O and N in the remaining four positions (1, 3, 4, 5), while introducing new, still-available consonants.

Possible simple words:  
- COBAN (but B and C fresh; N is used)  
- FOAMY (but O in 2, A in 2 – clashes)  
- GONAD (A already in 2, N and O good)  
- HONDA (ruled out D and A is in 2)  
- MANOR (R ruled out)  
- PONCA (C fresh)  
- VAMON (M fresh)  
- YACON (Y fresh)  

Among these, “MANOR” and “GONAD” seem most English-like, but “MANOR” uses R (eliminated) and “GONAD” uses D (eliminated). “COBAN” is a bit obscure.  

Let’s choose “NOVAH” or “CONGA” – but “CONGA” uses N, O, A correctly with fresh C and G.

Wait: check positions:

A is fixed at position 2.

Try “NOVAK”: uses N, O, V, A, K – all new letters except A (already fixed). But K is often acceptable.

However, to keep to *common* words, let’s try “CANON” – but it repeats N.  
“COBNA” is not a word.  
“PANDA” uses D (eliminated).

Another good one: “FOCAL” – but L hasn’t been tested yet.

From the three guesses we have:

1. A R O S E → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3  
   – R, S, E are out

2. D A I N T → D(x) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)  
   – A is correctly at position 2  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4  
   – D, I, T are out

3. B A N J O → B(x) A(✓) N(-) J(x) O(-)  
   – confirms A at position 2  
   – N is in the word but not in position 3  
   – O is in the word but not in position 5  
   – B, J are out

So far:
- Positions: 1 _ A _ _ _ (fixed)
- Letters known to be present: A (pos 2), O, N
- Letters known to be absent: R, S, E, D, I, T, B, J, plus any other consonants used above.

Remaining consonant possibilities (frequent ones not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must place O and N in the three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) without using any eliminated letters.

Also:
- O cannot be in 3 or 5 → only 1 or 4  
- N cannot be in 3 or 4 → only 1 or 5  

We need two consonants from the fresh pool to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s try to build candidate words:

Case 1: O in position 1, N in position 5  
   O A _ _ N  – need two consonants for 3 & 4.  
   Possible: O A K C N – not a word.  
   More common: O A M C N – not a word.  
   Common consonants: C, K, L, M, P, V, etc.  
   O A K _ N → OAKEN – but O is in 1, A in 2, K in 3, E ruled out.  
   Scratch that.

Case 2: N in position 1, O in position 4  
   N A _ O _  
   Need consonants for 3 and 5.  
   N A C O N – invalid (N repeated, already used in 1).  
   N A C O M – “NACOM” not a common word.  
   N A H O C – not a word.  
   N A P O C – not a word.  
   N A V O C – not a word.  
   N A C O Y – not a word.  
   N A G O N – “NAGON” not common.  
   N A C O L – “NACOL” not common.  
   N A C O N – again.  
   N A C O G – nothing.

Case 3: N in position 1, O in position 4, and restrict to common English words:
   N A C O N – no.

Try a fresh set of consonants that are still allowed: C, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, etc.

Let’s try putting O in position 4 and N in position 5.

Then word pattern: _ A _ O N  
   – position 1 and 3 need consonants.  
   – N is in 5 (new spot – allowed).  
   – O is in 4 (new spot – allowed).

We need two consonants at 1 and 3, both still allowed.

Common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, etc.

Try:
   C A G O N – “CAGON” not valid.  
   F A C O N – not a word.  
   G A C O N – “GACON” not valid.  
   H A C O N – “HACON” no.  
   K A C O N – no.  
   L A C O N – “LACON” (archaic) maybe.  
   M A C O N – “MACON” (a city name) – allowed in word lists.  
   P A C O N – no.  
   V A C O N – no.  
   Y A C O N – no.

So “MACON” is the most plausible common 5-letter word left.

We test “MACON”:
- M (new) – allowed  
- A (correct at 2) – ok  
- C (new) – allowed  
- O (new position 4) – allowed per feedback  
- N (new position 5) – allowed

No conflicts with any feedback.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,WAGON,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good starting word should:
1. Use common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a common word that is likely to appear in the word list.

Popular starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are good because they contain frequently used letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers all the main vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:

- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

Letters remaining to test: consonants like T, L, N, M, P, C, D and vowels I, U (since A and O are confirmed present).

We know the word contains A and O and that A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places A and O in new positions to test their correct spots.
- Uses fresh, common consonants and the remaining vowel I.
- Avoids the eliminated letters R, S, E.

A good candidate is “DAINT”:
- D: new consonant
- A: in position 2 (new spot for A)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant

This should give us useful info about where A and O belong and whether I, N, T are in the word.

3. Vowels still possible: none left—A and O are the only two left.  
   (U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, so we should be open to it, but we already have A and O.)

So the secret word has five letters, contains A (fixed at position 2), O and N elsewhere, and never uses R, S, E, D, I, T.

Slots: _ A _ _ _

Remaining consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but most of these are uncommon).

We need to place O and N in the remaining four positions (1, 3, 4, 5), while introducing new, still-available consonants.

Possible simple words:  
- COBAN (but B and C fresh; N is used)  
- FOAMY (but O in 2, A in 2 – clashes)  
- GONAD (A already in 2, N and O good)  
- HONDA (ruled out D and A is in 2)  
- MANOR (R ruled out)  
- PONCA (C fresh)  
- VAMON (M fresh)  
- YACON (Y fresh)  

Among these, “MANOR” and “GONAD” seem most English-like, but “MANOR” uses R (eliminated) and “GONAD” uses D (eliminated). “COBAN” is a bit obscure.  

Let’s choose “NOVAH” or “CONGA” – but “CONGA” uses N, O, A correctly with fresh C and G.

Wait: check positions:

A is fixed at position 2.

Try “NOVAK”: uses N, O, V, A, K – all new letters except A (already fixed). But K is often acceptable.

However, to keep to *common* words, let’s try “CANON” – but it repeats N.  
“COBNA” is not a word.  
“PANDA” uses D (eliminated).

Another good one: “FOCAL” – but L hasn’t been tested yet.

Wait, let’s list positions:

Word structure with A fixed at 2: _ A _ _ _

Letters to place: O, N plus two fresh consonants.

Test “BANJO”:
- B (new)
- A (fixed at 2 – ok)
- N (in 3 – new spot)
- J (new)
- O (in 5 – new spot)

This only uses new letters B, J and places N and O in fresh positions.

Let’s choose “BANJO”.

Remaining consonant possibilities (frequent ones not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Also:
- O cannot be in 3 or 5 → only 1 or 4

   – N is in 5 (new spot – allowed).  
   – O is in 4 (new spot – allowed).

We need two consonants at 1 and 3, both still allowed.

Common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, etc.

From feedback so far:

- Position 2 = A (fixed).
- The word contains O (now correctly placed at position 4), N (correctly placed at position 5).
- Eliminated consonants: R, S, E, D, I, T, B, J, M, C.

So the pattern is: _ A _ O N  
We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen only from unused consonants: F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good starting word should:
1. Use common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Be a common word that is likely to appear in the word list.

Popular starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are good because they contain frequently used letters. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers all the main vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (AROSE) we learned:

- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

Letters remaining to test: consonants like T, L, N, M, P, C, D and vowels I, U (since A and O are confirmed present).

We know the word contains A and O and that A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places A and O in new positions to test their correct spots.
- Uses fresh, common consonants and the remaining vowel I.
- Avoids the eliminated letters R, S, E.

A good candidate is “DAINT”:
- D: new consonant
- A: in position 2 (new spot for A)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant

This should give us useful info about where A and O belong and whether I, N, T are in the word.

<guess>DAINT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

2. Letters eliminated so far: R, S, E, D, I, T.
3. Vowels still possible: none left—A and O are the only two left.  
   (U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, so we should be open to it, but we already have A and O.)

So the secret word has five letters, contains A (fixed at position 2), O and N elsewhere, and never uses R, S, E, D, I, T.

Slots: _ A _ _ _

Remaining consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but most of these are uncommon).

We need to place O and N in the remaining four positions (1, 3, 4, 5), while introducing new, still-available consonants.

Possible simple words:  
- COBAN (but B and C fresh; N is used)  
- FOAMY (but O in 2, A in 2 – clashes)  
- GONAD (A already in 2, N and O good)  
- HONDA (ruled out D and A is in 2)  
- MANOR (R ruled out)  
- PONCA (C fresh)  
- VAMON (M fresh)  
- YACON (Y fresh)  

Among these, “MANOR” and “GONAD” seem most English-like, but “MANOR” uses R (eliminated) and “GONAD” uses D (eliminated). “COBAN” is a bit obscure.  

Let’s choose “NOVAH” or “CONGA” – but “CONGA” uses N, O, A correctly with fresh C and G.

Wait: check positions:

A is fixed at position 2.

Try “NOVAK”: uses N, O, V, A, K – all new letters except A (already fixed). But K is often acceptable.

However, to keep to *common* words, let’s try “CANON” – but it repeats N.  
“COBNA” is not a word.  
“PANDA” uses D (eliminated).

Another good one: “FOCAL” – but L hasn’t been tested yet.

Wait, let’s list positions:

Word structure with A fixed at 2: _ A _ _ _

Letters to place: O, N plus two fresh consonants.

Test “BANJO”:
- B (new)
- A (fixed at 2 – ok)
- N (in 3 – new spot)
- J (new)
- O (in 5 – new spot)

This only uses new letters B, J and places N and O in fresh positions.

Let’s choose “BANJO”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we have:

1. A R O S E → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

2. D A I N T → D(x) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)

3. B A N J O → B(x) A(✓) N(-) J(x) O(-)  
   – confirms A at position 2  
   – N is in the word but not in position 3  
   – O is in the word but not in position 5  
   – B, J are out

So far:
- Positions: 1 _ A _ _ _ (fixed)
- Letters known to be present: A (pos 2), O, N
- Letters known to be absent: R, S, E, D, I, T, B, J, plus any other consonants used above.

Remaining consonant possibilities (frequent ones not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We must place O and N in the three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) without using any eliminated letters.

Also:
- O cannot be in 3 or 5 → only 1 or 4  
- N cannot be in 3 or 4 → only 1 or 5  

We need two consonants from the fresh pool to fill the remaining two slots.

Let’s try to build candidate words:

Case 1: O in position 1, N in position 5  
   O A _ _ N  – need two consonants for 3 & 4.  
   Possible: O A K C N – not a word.  
   More common: O A M C N – not a word.  
   Common consonants: C, K, L, M, P, V, etc.  
   O A K _ N → OAKEN – but O is in 1, A in 2, K in 3, E ruled out.  
   Scratch that.

Case 2: N in position 1, O in position 4  
   N A _ O _  
   Need consonants for 3 and 5.  
   N A C O N – invalid (N repeated, already used in 1).  
   N A C O M – “NACOM” not a common word.  
   N A H O C – not a word.  
   N A P O C – not a word.  
   N A V O C – not a word.  
   N A C O Y – not a word.  
   N A G O N – “NAGON” not common.  
   N A C O L – “NACOL” not common.  
   N A C O N – again.  
   N A C O G – nothing.

Case 3: N in position 1, O in position 4, and restrict to common English words:
   N A C O N – no.

Try a fresh set of consonants that are still allowed: C, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, etc.

Let’s try putting O in position 4 and N in position 5.

Then word pattern: _ A _ O N  
   – position 1 and 3 need consonants.  
   – N is in 5 (new spot – allowed).  
   – O is in 4 (new spot – allowed).

We need two consonants at 1 and 3, both still allowed.

Common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, etc.

Try:
   C A G O N – “CAGON” not valid.  
   F A C O N – not a word.  
   G A C O N – “GACON” not valid.  
   H A C O N – “HACON” no.  
   K A C O N – no.  
   L A C O N – “LACON” (archaic) maybe.  
   M A C O N – “MACON” (a city name) – allowed in word lists.  
   P A C O N – no.  
   V A C O N – no.  
   Y A C O N – no.

So “MACON” is the most plausible common 5-letter word left.

We test “MACON”:
- M (new) – allowed  
- A (correct at 2) – ok  
- C (new) – allowed  
- O (new position 4) – allowed per feedback  
- N (new position 5) – allowed

No conflicts with any feedback.

Therefore, next guess: MACON

Summary of what we now know:

- Pattern: _ A _ O N (positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed)
- Letters still needed for positions 1 and 3.
- Consonants already eliminated: R, S, E, D, I, T, B, J, M, C, H, L.
- Remaining consonants that are common: F, G, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word fitting the pattern _ A _ O N using only still-allowed letters.

Quick scan:
F: F A _ O N → FAGON, FASON … none standard.
G: G A _ O N → GAGON, GAYON … only GAYON is pronounceable but not a common word.
K: K A _ O N → KAGON, KAYON … again not common.
P: P A _ O N → PAGON, PAYON … PAGON is not standard, PAYON is not a word.
V: V A _ O N → VAGON (variant spelling of “wagon” in some languages but not English).
W: W A _ O N → WAGON is a perfectly common English word and uses only still-allowed consonants.

Check letters:
W (not yet eliminated), A, G (not yet eliminated), O, N — all allowed.

So the only remaining common word is WAGON.
