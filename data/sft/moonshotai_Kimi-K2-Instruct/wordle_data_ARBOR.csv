For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help quickly narrow down possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. I'll try ""ADIEU"" since it uses four vowels (A, I, E, U) and a common consonant (D), which can provide good information about what vowels might be in the word. However, looking at the game rules, it mentions the feedback system but doesn't specify the actual secret word, so this is just an initial exploratory guess to gather information.

From the feedback on ADIEU we know:
- A is in the correct first position.
- D, I, E, U are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ _ and none of the letters D, I, E, U appear anywhere in it.

Next we need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (O and Y) in the remaining four positions. A good second word should use as many new (and common) letters as possible while keeping the A fixed.

Letters not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that uses A plus a spread of these letters. “ARSON” is a nice choice because:
- It keeps A in the first spot.
- It introduces R, S, O, N, which are all very common.

This should give us maximal information about which of the remaining letters are present and where they might sit.
