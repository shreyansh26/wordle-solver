- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should:

1. Use common letters (vowels and common consonants) to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word
2. Avoid rare letters like Q, X, Z to make the most of the guess
3. Be a common 5-letter word so it's likely to be valid

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Good candidate words would be:
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E - all very common)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so the word contains an S but not in position 4.
