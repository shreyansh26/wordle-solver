2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Starting with Wordle, the optimal first word maximizes information gain by using common vowels and consonants. Classic openers include:

- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- AUDIO: covers A, U, D, I, O (heavy on vowels)

I'll choose **SLATE** as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T), plus L. This gives broad coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the word contains L, A, T, E in some permutation, but NOT in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively. That means:
- L cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3
- T cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5
- S is ruled out entirely

We need a word that uses all four letters L,A,T,E plus one more letter (must be a consonant since we already have 4 vowels/consonants here).

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters: LATER, ALTER, TALER, ALERT, etc.

- LATER: L in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (allowed), E in 4 (but E cannot be in 4 - wait the feedback said E is not in position 5, position 4 is allowed)
Wait, let me re-read the feedback: E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1-4.

LATER has:
- L in 1 (allowed - wasn't restricted by feedback)
- A in 2 (allowed - wasn't restricted by feedback) 
- T in 3 (allowed - wasn't restricted by feedback)
- E in 4 (allowed - only restricted from position 5)
- R new letter

This seems valid and will test new positions for these letters.
