For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and will help me gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at the most common letters in English words, a strong first guess would be ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) 
- All letters are distinct to maximize information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

We have two guesses of feedback now.

Guess 1: A R I S E → A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
- A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5.
- I and S are not in the word.

Guess 2: R E A C T → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(-)
- R, E, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3.
- C and T are not in the word.

Collecting constraints:
- Letters to include exactly once each: A, R, E
- Letters to avoid: I, S, C, T
- Possible remaining letters for the two unknown slots: common ones are N, L, D, G, B, M, H, etc.
- Required positions:
  – A cannot be 1 or 3 → must be 2, 4, or 5
  – R cannot be 1 or 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5
  – E cannot be 2 or 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try building a word that satisfies these rules.

We need two new letters that are frequent and haven’t been used: N and D are good candidates.

A promising pattern: place the known letters in allowed spots and fill the rest with N and D.

Try: N  A  D  E  R
- A is in slot 2 (allowed)
- R is in slot 5 (allowed)
- E is in slot 4 (allowed)
- N and D are new and allowed.

Word: NADER (though NADER is a proper noun, but let’s check if it’s accepted as an English word. Actually, NADER is valid in Scrabble.)

But a more common word is ALERT. Let’s check ALERT:
- A in 1? No, A cannot be in 1 → invalid.

Another candidate: E A R N D → invalid because it has 5 letters and we need to fit A, R, E.

Alternative: G R A N E
- R in 2? No, R cannot be in 2 → invalid.

Let’s systematically find a valid 5-letter word fitting constraints.

Valid positions:
A: 2,4,5
R: 3,4,5
E: 1,3,4

Try placing E in 1, A in 2, R in 3:
E A R _ _
Need two letters from allowed set (not I,S,C,T), e.g., N,D → E A R N D → invalid (6 letters).

Try E A _ R _
E A N R D → invalid length.

Try E _ A _ R
E N A D R → ENADR not a word.

Try A in 4:
_ _ _ A _
Possible: G R E A T → T is forbidden.

Try D A N E R → D,A,N,E,R → let’s check word validity: DANER is not a standard word.

Try B R E A D → A is allowed in 4, E in 3, R in 2 → but R cannot be in 2.

Try B A N E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 → valid positions and B,N allowed.
Word: B A N E R → BANER not valid.

Try H A N D E → A in 2, N in 3, D in 4, E in 5, H in 1 → HANDE not valid.

Try W A R D E → A in 2, R in 3 → but R cannot be in 3? Wait, R can be in 3,4,5. So R in 3 is allowed.
Word: W A R D E → WARDE not valid.

Actually, R can be in 3 (from constraints), A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).
Try W A R D E → not valid.

Valid word: B A R E D → B,A,R,E,D.
Check positions:
B (new), A (2 allowed), R (3 allowed), E (4 allowed), D (new).
This fits all constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: B A R E D

Try B A N E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 → valid positions and B,N allowed.
Word: B A N E R → BANER not valid.

Try H A N D E → A in 2, N in 3, D in 4, E in 5, H in 1 → HANDE not valid.

Try W A R D E → A in 2, R in 3 → but R cannot be in 3? Wait, R can be in 3,4,5. So R in 3 is allowed.

Actually, R can be in 3 (from constraints), A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).
Try W A R D E → not valid.

Valid word: B A R E D → B,A,R,E,D.

- Possible remaining letters for the two unknown slots: common ones are N, L, D, G, B, M, H, etc.
- Required positions:
  – A cannot be 1 or 3 → must be 2, 4, or 5
  – R cannot be 1 or 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5
  – E cannot be 2 or 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try building a word that satisfies these rules.

We need two new letters that are frequent and haven’t been used: N and D are good candidates.

A promising pattern: place the known letters in allowed spots and fill the rest with N and D.

Try: N  A  D  E  R
- A is in slot 2 (allowed)
- R is in slot 5 (allowed)
- E is in slot 4 (allowed)
- N and D are new and allowed.

Word: NADER (though NADER is a proper noun, but let’s check if it’s accepted as an English word. Actually, NADER is valid in Scrabble.)

But a more common word is ALERT. Let’s check ALERT:
- A in 1? No, A cannot be in 1 → invalid.

Another candidate: E A R N D → invalid because it has 5 letters and we need to fit A, R, E.

Alternative: G R A N E
- R in 2? No, R cannot be in 2 → invalid.

Let’s systematically find a valid 5-letter word fitting constraints.

Valid positions:
A: 2,4,5
R: 3,4,5
E: 1,3,4

Try placing E in 1, A in 2, R in 3:
E A R _ _
Need two letters from allowed set (not I,S,C,T), e.g., N,D → E A R N D → invalid (6 letters).

Try E A _ R _
E A N R D → invalid length.

Try E _ A _ R
E N A D R → ENADR not a word.

Try A in 4:
_ _ _ A _
Possible: G R E A T → T is forbidden.

Try D A N E R → D,A,N,E,R → let’s check word validity: DANER is not a standard word.

Try B R E A D → A is allowed in 4, E in 3, R in 2 → but R cannot be in 2.

Try B A N E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 → valid positions and B,N allowed.
Word: B A N E R → BANER not valid.

Try H A N D E → A in 2, N in 3, D in 4, E in 5, H in 1 → HANDE not valid.

Try W A R D E → A in 2, R in 3 → but R cannot be in 3? Wait, R can be in 3,4,5. So R in 3 is allowed.
Word: W A R D E → WARDE not valid.

Actually, R can be in 3 (from constraints), A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).
Try W A R D E → not valid.

Valid word: B A R E D → B,A,R,E,D.
Check positions:
B (new), A (2 allowed), R (3 allowed), E (4 allowed), D (new).
This fits all constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: B A R E D

From the new feedback on BARED:
- B(x)  → B is not in the word.

- R(-)  → R is in the word but is NOT in position 3.

- Exact positions: A is fixed at position 2, E is fixed at position 4.
- Letters to include: A(2), E(4), R (somewhere not 3).
- Letters to exclude: I, S, C, T, B, D.

The word looks like: _ A _ E _ with the remaining letters drawn from the unused common consonants.  
Possible letters left: N, L, G, H, M, F, K, Y, etc.

R must appear exactly once, and it cannot be in position 3, so it can go in positions 1 or 5.

Let’s try:
- R _ A _ E → R A _ E _ → but A must be in position 2 → forms R A N E L? No, we need 5 letters: R A _ E _ → R A N E _ → but E must be in position 4 → R A N E _ → need 5th letter.
Wait, the pattern is _ A _ E _ (positions 1,3,5 blank).

R can be in 1 or 5.

Option 1: R A _ E _
We need a consonant for position 3 that hasn’t been used yet. Good candidates: N, G, L, M, H, K.
Try R A N E _ → need 5th letter, but E is already in 4 → word must be 5 letters → R A N E _ → only 4 letters so far. Wait, _ A _ E _ is 5 positions.

Let’s list the 5-letter template: 1-A-3-E-5.

We need positions 1, 3, 5 to be filled, with R in either 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters from unused consonants.

Case 1: R in 1 → R A _ E _

Try R A N E L → valid word? RANEL not valid.
Try R A G E N → RAGEN not valid.
Try R A N E G → RANEG not valid.
Try R A L E N → RALEN not valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at the most common letters in English words, a strong first guess would be ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S) 
- All letters are distinct to maximize information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

2. Letters to avoid: I, S
3. Letters to include (but place differently): A, R, E
4. Since A, R, E must move, they can’t stay in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
5. We also need two new consonants; common ones not used yet are T, N, L, O, etc.
6. Good candidates that reuse the known letters: REACT, TREAD, CRATE, EARTH, ALERT, EARLY, AUGER…  
   - REACT keeps A, R, E and adds C, T (both very common).
   - It moves A to position 3, R to 1, E to 2 (none retain their old positions).
   - C and T haven’t been tested yet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We have two guesses of feedback now.

Guess 1: A R I S E → A(-) R(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
- A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5.
- I and S are not in the word.

Guess 2: R E A C T → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(-)
- R, E, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3.
- C and T are not in the word.

Collecting constraints:
- Letters to include exactly once each: A, R, E
- Letters to avoid: I, S, C, T
- Possible remaining letters for the two unknown slots: common ones are N, L, D, G, B, M, H, etc.
- Required positions:
  – A cannot be 1 or 3 → must be 2, 4, or 5
  – R cannot be 1 or 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5
  – E cannot be 2 or 5 → must be 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try building a word that satisfies these rules.

We need two new letters that are frequent and haven’t been used: N and D are good candidates.

A promising pattern: place the known letters in allowed spots and fill the rest with N and D.

Try: N  A  D  E  R
- A is in slot 2 (allowed)
- R is in slot 5 (allowed)
- E is in slot 4 (allowed)
- N and D are new and allowed.

Word: NADER (though NADER is a proper noun, but let’s check if it’s accepted as an English word. Actually, NADER is valid in Scrabble.)

But a more common word is ALERT. Let’s check ALERT:
- A in 1? No, A cannot be in 1 → invalid.

Another candidate: E A R N D → invalid because it has 5 letters and we need to fit A, R, E.

Alternative: G R A N E
- R in 2? No, R cannot be in 2 → invalid.

Let’s systematically find a valid 5-letter word fitting constraints.

Valid positions:
A: 2,4,5
R: 3,4,5
E: 1,3,4

Try placing E in 1, A in 2, R in 3:
E A R _ _
Need two letters from allowed set (not I,S,C,T), e.g., N,D → E A R N D → invalid (6 letters).

Try E A _ R _
E A N R D → invalid length.

Try E _ A _ R
E N A D R → ENADR not a word.

Try A in 4:
_ _ _ A _
Possible: G R E A T → T is forbidden.

Try D A N E R → D,A,N,E,R → let’s check word validity: DANER is not a standard word.

Try B R E A D → A is allowed in 4, E in 3, R in 2 → but R cannot be in 2.

Try B A N E R → A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 → valid positions and B,N allowed.
Word: B A N E R → BANER not valid.

Try H A N D E → A in 2, N in 3, D in 4, E in 5, H in 1 → HANDE not valid.

Try W A R D E → A in 2, R in 3 → but R cannot be in 3? Wait, R can be in 3,4,5. So R in 3 is allowed.
Word: W A R D E → WARDE not valid.

Actually, R can be in 3 (from constraints), A in 2 (allowed), E in 5 (allowed).
Try W A R D E → not valid.

Valid word: B A R E D → B,A,R,E,D.
Check positions:
B (new), A (2 allowed), R (3 allowed), E (4 allowed), D (new).
This fits all constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: B A R E D

- B(x)  → B is not in the word.
- A(✓)  → A is in the word and is now in the correct position (position 2).
- R(-)  → R is in the word but is NOT in position 3.
- E(✓)  → E is in the word and is in the correct position (position 4).
- D(x)  → D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Exact positions: A is fixed at position 2, E is fixed at position 4.
- Letters to include: A(2), E(4), R (somewhere not 3).
- Letters to exclude: I, S, C, T, B, D.

The word looks like: _ A _ E _ with the remaining letters drawn from the unused common consonants.  
Possible letters left: N, L, G, H, M, F, K, Y, etc.

R must appear exactly once, and it cannot be in position 3, so it can go in positions 1 or 5.

Let’s try:
- R _ A _ E → R A _ E _ → but A must be in position 2 → forms R A N E L? No, we need 5 letters: R A _ E _ → R A N E _ → but E must be in position 4 → R A N E _ → need 5th letter.
Wait, the pattern is _ A _ E _ (positions 1,3,5 blank).

R can be in 1 or 5.

Option 1: R A _ E _
We need a consonant for position 3 that hasn’t been used yet. Good candidates: N, G, L, M, H, K.
Try R A N E _ → need 5th letter, but E is already in 4 → word must be 5 letters → R A N E _ → only 4 letters so far. Wait, _ A _ E _ is 5 positions.

Let’s list the 5-letter template: 1-A-3-E-5.

We need positions 1, 3, 5 to be filled, with R in either 1 or 5, and the remaining two letters from unused consonants.

Case 1: R in 1 → R A _ E _
Need a letter for position 3 from {N,G,L,M,H,K} and position 5 from the same set, ensuring word validity.

Try R A N E L → valid word? RANEL not valid.
Try R A G E N → RAGEN not valid.
Try R A N E G → RANEG not valid.
Try R A L E N → RALEN not valid.

Case 2: R in 5 → _ A _ E R
We need positions 1 and 3 filled from unused consonants.

Try M A N E R → valid word? MANER not standard.
Try G A M E R → GAMER is valid!
Check constraints:
- G (new), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5).
- R is allowed in 5 (not previously excluded).
- All letters used are allowed (no I,S,C,T,B,D).
- A and E are in correct positions.

This fits perfectly.

We only need to find the missing letter for position 3, and we know it can't be any of the letters already excluded: I, S, C, T, B, D, G, M, K.

Remaining, commonly used consonants that haven't been ruled out include: F, H, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
