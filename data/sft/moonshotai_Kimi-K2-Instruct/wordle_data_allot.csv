- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information about what letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good mix of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback:

- S (x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L (✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A (-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T (-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E (x) – E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word has:
- L as the 2nd letter.
- Contains both A and T somewhere, but NOT in their current positions (positions 3 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain S or E.

Let’s use this information to pick a word that:
- Has L as the 2nd letter.
- Uses A and T in new positions (A not in 3rd, T not in 4th).
- Avoids S and E.

A good candidate is ""PLANT"":
- L is 2nd letter (matches ✓).
- A is now in 4th position (originally 3rd, so new position is allowed).
- T is now in 5th position (originally 4th, so new position is allowed).
- Avoids S and E entirely.

From both rounds:

Known facts
- 2nd letter is L (✓ in both guesses).
- Word contains A (present but not yet in correct spot).
- Word contains T (now correctly placed in 5th position).
- Word does NOT contain S, E, P, N.

Positions so far:
- 2: L
- 5: T
- 1,3,4: unknown, but
  – A is somewhere in the word, and may not be in 3rd or 4th (because it was (-) in those positions).
  – Therefore A must be in 1st position.

Thus the pattern is:
A L _ _ T

We need a 5-letter word that starts with AL and ends with T.
Immediately “ALERT” pops to mind, but E is forbidden (E was x in first guess).
