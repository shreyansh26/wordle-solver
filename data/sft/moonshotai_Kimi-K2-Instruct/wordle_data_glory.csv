For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information gained. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""CRANE."" These words cover common letters and help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering some of the most frequent letters in English words. This should give good initial information about the secret word.

- L is in the word and in the **correct** position (position 2).
- S, A, T, E are **not** in the word at all.

So the word so far looks like: _ L _ _ _

We need a five-letter word with L in the second position, and none of S, A, T, E. Good letters to include next are common remaining ones like R, N, O, I, U, D, G, etc.

Current state:

- L is fixed in position 2: _ L _ _ _
- Letters not in the word at all: S, A, T, E, F, I, N
- Letter G is in the word but NOT in position 5 (since it got “-” feedback there)

So the pattern is: _ L _ _ _  
Known absent letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N  
G must appear somewhere among positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2, and we already know it’s not 5).

Remaining frequent consonants: B, C, D, K, M, P, R, U, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U, Y (since A, E, I are out)

Let’s build a word:
- Try O in position 1 (common vowel left)  
- L fixed in position 2  
- Try G in position 3 or 4  
- Fill remaining with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate: G L O W _ – but W hasn’t been tested yet and G in 1 conflicts with G needing to go elsewhere.  
Better: O L D G _ – but G can’t be in 5. So O L D G_ won’t work.

Try: G L O O D – has double O, but O and D are both available.

Wait, we only have one G in the word (no duplicates confirmed). Let’s go with:

C L O U D – uses O, U, D, C, and keeps L in place.  
All letters are still “live” except the banned set, and G must appear somewhere but hasn’t been placed yet.

But we need a word that contains G. Let’s try:

P L U G S – but S is banned.  
B L O G S – again S banned.  
P L U G _ – needs a 5th letter; P L U G S invalid.  
G L O O M – G in 1, but we don’t know if G is in 1 and we need to test if it’s in 3 or 4.  

Best test: put G in 3 or 4 with remaining available letters.  
Let’s try C L O G _ – but we need a 5th letter and C,L,O,G are fine so far.

Actually, “B L O W N” – no, N banned.  
“R O L L Y” – but L already in 2 and we don’t know about duplicates.  

Let’s just use “G L O W _” but W is untested and we need a 5th letter.  

After scanning, the best 5-letter word fitting constraints: G L O W N – but N banned.  
Next: G L O W D – invalid.  

Better approach: put G in 4: _ L _ G _  
Need 1st and 5th letters from remaining: B, C, D, K, M, O, R, U, Y.

Candidate: C L O G Y  
Letters: C, L, O, G, Y – all not yet excluded, and positions 1,3,4,5 are open except L in 2.

So: C L O G Y satisfies:
- L in position 2 ✓  
- G is in word and placed in position 4 (not 5) ✓  
- All other letters not yet ruled out ✓  

Therefore: C L O G Y

Current deductions:

- Pattern so far: _ L O _ Y   (L, O, Y are in their exact spots)
- Letters known **not** in the word: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, C
- Letter G is in the word but **not** in position 4 (it got “-” there) and **not** in position 5 (from Guess 2).  
  Therefore G must be in position 1 or 3.

- Position 1 candidates: only letters not ruled out yet and that allow a valid word.  
  Allowed letters (not yet excluded and not placed): B, D, G, H, K, M, P, R, U, W, etc.

- Position 3 only allows G (since G must be somewhere and positions 2,4,5 are fixed).

So the only possible placement of G is at position 3:

_ L G O Y   – but position 3 is actually the fourth letter slot, so it would be _ L O G Y – but this conflicts with G not allowed in position 4.

Wait:

The pattern is:

1 _  
2 L (fixed)  
3 O (fixed)  
4 _  
5 Y (fixed)

So G must be in position 1 or position 4.

We know G got “-” in position 4 in CLOGY, so G cannot be in 4.  
Hence G must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be G L O _ Y.

The only common English word matching G L O _ Y is:

G L O W Y – but that’s not a valid word.

Wait, let's check:

G L O B Y – uncommon  
G L O C Y – invalid (C excluded)  
G L O D Y – uncommon  
G L O K Y – invalid  
G L O M Y – invalid (M not excluded, but not a word)  
G L O P Y – not a word  
G L O R Y – yes! “GLORY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus the only possible word left is GLORY.
