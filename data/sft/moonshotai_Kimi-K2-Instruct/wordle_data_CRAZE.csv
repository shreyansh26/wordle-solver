Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good combination would be:
- A or E (most common vowels)
- R or S or T (very common consonants)
- Another consonant that's common

A word like ""AROSE"" would be ideal because it contains:
- A, O, E (the three most common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This tests five unique, high-frequency letters.

Other good options might be ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""SLATE"", but ""AROSE"" seems optimal.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- R in position 2.
- Both A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- No O or S.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 1, so it could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A and E somewhere else.
3. Does not contain O or S.
4. Uses new letters to gain more information (since we haven't tested many consonants yet).

Good candidates would be words like:
- CRAVE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5, but E can't be in 5) - invalid
- GRADE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5) - invalid for same reason

4. We have not yet tested many other common consonants such as N, T, L, C, M, etc.

So far we have:
- _ R _ _ _
- Letters still possible: A, E, plus any other unused consonants
- A can only be in positions 3 or 5
- E can only be in positions 1 or 4 (but not 3 or 5)

Let’s explore possibilities:

Case 1: A is in position 3
   Then E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - E in 1: E R A _ _
   - E in 4: _ R A E _

Case 2: A is in position 5
   Then E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - E in 1: E R _ _ A
   - E in 4: _ R _ E A

Testing one of these patterns with new consonants will maximize information.
A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C and N are new consonants.
- N is in position 4 (E is in position 4). This fits pattern _ R A E _.
- C is in position 1 (consonant not yet tested).
- A is in position 3.
- E is in position 4.

Let me check:
- Pattern: C R A N E
- R is correct in position 2 (matches feedback).
- A must be in position 3 or 5 (here 3).
- E must be in position 1 or 4 (here 4).
- No B, D, O, S.

This seems valid.

1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good combination would be:
- A or E (most common vowels)
- R or S or T (very common consonants)
- Another consonant that's common

A word like ""AROSE"" would be ideal because it contains:
- A, O, E (the three most common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This tests five unique, high-frequency letters.

Other good options might be ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""SLATE"", but ""AROSE"" seems optimal.

- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- R in position 2.
- Both A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- No O or S.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 1, so it could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A and E somewhere else.
3. Does not contain O or S.
4. Uses new letters to gain more information (since we haven't tested many consonants yet).

Good candidates would be words like:
- CRAVE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5, but E can't be in 5) - invalid
- GRADE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5) - invalid for same reason

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,CRAZE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no feedback yet, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters in the English language
2. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Include vowels since most 5-letter words have at least one

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good combination would be:
- A or E (most common vowels)
- R or S or T (very common consonants)
- Another consonant that's common

A word like ""AROSE"" would be ideal because it contains:
- A, O, E (the three most common vowels)
- R, S (two very common consonants)
This tests five unique, high-frequency letters.

Other good options might be ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""SLATE"", but ""AROSE"" seems optimal.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- O and S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- R in position 2.
- Both A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- No O or S.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 1, so it could be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5, so it could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A and E somewhere else.
3. Does not contain O or S.
4. Uses new letters to gain more information (since we haven't tested many consonants yet).

Good candidates would be words like:
- CRAVE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5, but E can't be in 5) - invalid
- GRADE (R in 2, A in 3, E in 5) - invalid for same reason
- BREAD (R in 2, E in 3, A in 4) - valid
- DREAD (R in 2, E in 3, A in 4) - valid
- CREAM (R in 2, E in 3, A in 4) - valid

""BREAD"" seems like a good choice as it tests new consonants (B, D) while placing A and E in possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BREAD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(-) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we know:

1. R is fixed in position 2.
2. The word contains A and E, but their positions are still unknown.
   - A is not in position 1 or 4.
   - E is not in position 5 or 3 (from Guess 2 feedback).
3. The letters B, D, O, S are ruled out.
4. We have not yet tested many other common consonants such as N, T, L, C, M, etc.

So far we have:
- _ R _ _ _
- Letters still possible: A, E, plus any other unused consonants
- A can only be in positions 3 or 5
- E can only be in positions 1 or 4 (but not 3 or 5)

Let’s explore possibilities:

Case 1: A is in position 3
   Then E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - E in 1: E R A _ _
   - E in 4: _ R A E _

Case 2: A is in position 5
   Then E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - E in 1: E R _ _ A
   - E in 4: _ R _ E A

Testing one of these patterns with new consonants will maximize information.
A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C and N are new consonants.
- N is in position 4 (E is in position 4). This fits pattern _ R A E _.
- C is in position 1 (consonant not yet tested).
- A is in position 3.
- E is in position 4.

Let me check:
- Pattern: C R A N E
- R is correct in position 2 (matches feedback).
- A must be in position 3 or 5 (here 3).
- E must be in position 1 or 4 (here 4).
- No B, D, O, S.

This seems valid.

Guess 2: BREAD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(-) A(-) D(x)
Guess 3: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:

2. BREAD → B(x) R(✓) E(-) A(-) D(x)
3. CRANE → C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

From this we know:
- Pattern so far: C R A _ E
- All five letters have been confirmed: C, R, A, E, plus a fifth letter.
- The fifth letter is in position 4 (since positions 1-3-5 are C-R-E respectively).
- Previously rejected letters: B, D, N, O, S
- Still free letters for position 4 include common choices: T, L, M, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for a valid English word matching C R A _ E:
- CRATE – uses T
- CRAVE – uses V
- CRAZE – uses Z
- CRAME – archaic, not common
- CRAGE – not a word
- CRAPE – valid
- CRALE – not a word
- CRAKE – a type of bird, valid

Among these, “CRATE” is the most common and tests a new consonant ‘T’ in position 4.
