For my first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Based on letter frequency analysis in English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would use several of these.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

From the feedback:
- A(✓) in position 3: the secret word definitely has A as its third letter.
- E(✓) in position 5: the fifth letter is E.
- S(x), L(x), T(x): S, L, T are **not** in the word at all.

We know the pattern: _ _ A _ E  
Letters to avoid: S, L, T

I want to test new consonants and vowels while respecting these constraints. Good letters to try: R, N, C, D, H, M, B, P, G, I, O, U.

A word fitting the pattern and introducing fresh letters is “CRANE”, but we already learned T is out and C is untested. However, C is allowed (not in rejected list). Also “CRANE” has R and N, which are common and untested. But “CRANE” would place C first – let’s try it.

But wait, let’s test more new letters. Another option: “BRAIN” – but A is already fixed in position 3. So “BRANE” is invalid (A is third). 

A valid option: “FRAME” – fits _ _ A _ E pattern, introduces F, R, M which are all new. 

Another option: “GRAPE” – but P is new and E is already confirmed. G, R, P are new.

Let me pick “CRANE” as it tests C, R, N while keeping A and E in correct positions.

Wait, CRANE pattern: C R A N E – A and E are correct positions, but we want to test new letters in 1,2,4. CRANE actually has N in position 4, which is unused yet. So it’s good.

However, I also need to test vowels possibly in positions 1,2,4. Let me think of “GRAPE” or “CRANE”.

Actually, ""CRANE"" has C, R, N – all new. So CRANE is a good guess.

But since we already have E fixed, let me pick “CHAIR” – but that breaks the _ _ A _ E pattern. 

I need a word that is _ _ A _ E with no S, L, T.

Possible words: BRACE, CRANE, FRAME, GRADE, GRACE, CRATE (but T is out), CRANE seems best.

I’ll go with CRANE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Based on letter frequency analysis in English words, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word would use several of these.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A(✓) in position 3: the secret word definitely has A as its third letter.
- E(✓) in position 5: the fifth letter is E.
- S(x), L(x), T(x): S, L, T are **not** in the word at all.

We know the pattern: _ _ A _ E  
Letters to avoid: S, L, T

I want to test new consonants and vowels while respecting these constraints. Good letters to try: R, N, C, D, H, M, B, P, G, I, O, U.

A word fitting the pattern and introducing fresh letters is “CRANE”, but we already learned T is out and C is untested. However, C is allowed (not in rejected list). Also “CRANE” has R and N, which are common and untested. But “CRANE” would place C first – let’s try it.

But wait, let’s test more new letters. Another option: “BRAIN” – but A is already fixed in position 3. So “BRANE” is invalid (A is third). 

A valid option: “FRAME” – fits _ _ A _ E pattern, introduces F, R, M which are all new. 

Another option: “GRAPE” – but P is new and E is already confirmed. G, R, P are new.

Let me pick “CRANE” as it tests C, R, N while keeping A and E in correct positions.

Wait, CRANE pattern: C R A N E – A and E are correct positions, but we want to test new letters in 1,2,4. CRANE actually has N in position 4, which is unused yet. So it’s good.

However, I also need to test vowels possibly in positions 1,2,4. Let me think of “GRAPE” or “CRANE”.

Actually, ""CRANE"" has C, R, N – all new. So CRANE is a good guess.

But since we already have E fixed, let me pick “CHAIR” – but that breaks the _ _ A _ E pattern. 

I need a word that is _ _ A _ E with no S, L, T.

Possible words: BRACE, CRANE, FRAME, GRADE, GRACE, CRATE (but T is out), CRANE seems best.

I’ll go with CRANE.

We know the pattern: _ _ A _ E  
Letters to avoid: S, L, T

I want to test new consonants and vowels while respecting these constraints. Good letters to try: R, N, C, D, H, M, B, P, G, I, O, U.

A word fitting the pattern and introducing fresh letters is “CRANE”, but we already learned T is out and C is untested. However, C is allowed (not in rejected list). Also “CRANE” has R and N, which are common and untested. But “CRANE” would place C first – let’s try it.

But wait, let’s test more new letters. Another option: “BRAIN” – but A is already fixed in position 3. So “BRANE” is invalid (A is third). 

A valid option: “FRAME” – fits _ _ A _ E pattern, introduces F, R, M which are all new. 

Another option: “GRAPE” – but P is new and E is already confirmed. G, R, P are new.

Let me pick “CRANE” as it tests C, R, N while keeping A and E in correct positions.

Wait, CRANE pattern: C R A N E – A and E are correct positions, but we want to test new letters in 1,2,4. CRANE actually has N in position 4, which is unused yet. So it’s good.

However, I also need to test vowels possibly in positions 1,2,4. Let me think of “GRAPE” or “CRANE”.

Actually, ""CRANE"" has C, R, N – all new. So CRANE is a good guess.

But since we already have E fixed, let me pick “CHAIR” – but that breaks the _ _ A _ E pattern. 

I need a word that is _ _ A _ E with no S, L, T.

Possible words: BRACE, CRANE, FRAME, GRADE, GRACE, CRATE (but T is out), CRANE seems best.

I’ll go with CRANE.

- Pattern: C R A _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, N
- Letters definitely in the word: C, R, A, E
- Position 4 is open; must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Letters already known to be in the word: C, R, A, E  
Letters ruled out: S, L, T, N

We need a 5-letter word that starts with C R A _ E and uses a letter other than S, L, T, N for the fourth position.

Possible letters for position 4 (avoiding S,L,T,N): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common English words fitting ""CRA_E"":
- CRANE (but N is ruled out)
- CRATE (T is ruled out)
- CRAZE (Z is possible)
- CRAPE (P is possible)
- CRAVE (V is possible)

""CRAVE"" fits perfectly:
- C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), V(new), E(✓)
- V hasn't been tested yet, and no feedback rules it out.

Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is a strong next guess.

We still need the 4th letter (position 4).  
Available letters not yet ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y, Z, etc.  

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit “CRA_E” and use any of these letters:
- CRABE → not a valid word  
- CRAKE → a valid word (a type of bird)  
- CRAME → not valid  
- CRAPE → P is allowed, but “crape” is less common (variant of crepe)  
- CRAME → invalid  
- CRAZE → Z is allowed, but we skipped it because it’s less common  
- CRAME → invalid  

The best valid, common word fitting the pattern is CRAKE.  
It keeps C, R, A, E in place and introduces K, which hasn’t been tested.  

Therefore, CRAKE is the next logical guess.

With each guess we have confirmed four exact letters:

C R A _ E

and we have eliminated the following letters from position 4:
S, L, T, N, V, K, P.

That leaves only one unused consonant that is common in English 5-letter words ending “RA_E”: the letter “M”.

The word “CRAME” does not appear in standard dictionaries, but “CRAM” plus silent-E is listed as a rare/variant spelling in some sources. However, checking the Scrabble/Oxford list, the only legitimate word that fits C R A _ E and uses a letter not yet tried is:
