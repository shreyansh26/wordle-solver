For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage across common letters in English 5-letter words, which should provide helpful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains T and E, but T is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
We also know the letters S, L, A are absent.

I want a new guess that:
1. Uses T and E in different positions (T not 4, E not 5).
2. Avoids S, L, A.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels.

Possibilities: T and E could sit in many places. Let’s pick a word like “TREND”:
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T was in position 4 and now is in position 1).
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E was in position 5 and now is in position 3).
- R, N, D are common letters not yet ruled out.

Current information from the two guesses:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)

   - Letters in the word but wrong positions: T (not in position 4), E (not in position 5)

2. TREND → T(✓) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is in correct position 1
   - R is in the word but wrong position (position 2)
   - E is in the word but wrong position (position 3)
   - Letters not in the word: N, D

So far we know:
- Word format: T _ _ _ _
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, E
- Letters that cannot appear: S, L, A, N, D
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4
Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)

Let's think of possible words:
- T _ E _ _ : E in position 2
- T _ _ E _ : E in position 4
- T _ _ _ E : invalid (already know E can't be in 5)

Looking for common words starting with T, containing R and E:
- TE_ _ _ : but E would be in position 2 (allowed)
- T_R_E : possible with E in 4
- T_ _ER : possible with E in 4, R in 5

- ""TOWER"" - has O, W, E in 4, R in 5 - but we haven't tested O or W
