This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help narrow down the possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

Letters in use / ruled out so far:
- Definitely in: S (pos. 1), E (pos. 4)
- Definitely out: C, R, A, N, T, O
- In the word but not in the positions tested so far: L and E (E already fixed at pos. 4, so we only need to place L correctly)
- P is NOT in the word (from Guess 3)

Current pattern: S _ _ E _

Constraints:
- L must appear somewhere except position 2 (from Guess 2) and position 4 (but that’s already E)
- We still need three more distinct letters, none of which are any of the banned ones above.

Good letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y etc.

We need L in either position 3 or 5. Let’s try putting L in position 3:

S _ L E _

Now we just need two new letters for positions 2 and 5. Choosing common, untested consonants:

Position 2: H or M
Position 5: B or D

Let’s pick “SMILED” – but that’s 6 letters. 5-letter word: SMILE

Check:
S ✓ (pos 1)
M (new)
I (new)
L in pos 3
E ✓ (pos 4)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes:

- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

5. E(-) – E is in the word but not in the last position.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, or N.
- The word DOES contain E, but not as the last letter.

Good letters to try next are other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out: S, T, L, O, U, etc. A strong second guess that uses new letters while respecting the above constraints is “STOLE”:
- S (new)
- T (new)
- O (new)
- L (new)
- E (known to be in the word; now placed in position 4 instead of 5).

This combination gives us as much new information as possible while keeping the E in a new spot.

Current known facts:

1. Position 1: S (✓) – fixed.
2. Position 4: E (✓) – fixed.
3. Position 3: I (✓) – fixed.
4. Letters not in the word so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, P, M.
5. Letter L is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 according to past feedback, which is impossible because there are only 5 positions. Re-examining:
   - Guess 2: L(-) – L not in position 4
   - Guess 3: L(-) – L not in position 2
   - Guess 4: L(-) – L not in position 5
   - This leaves positions 1 and 3. Position 1 is S, position 3 is I. This suggests L cannot be in any position, which contradicts the feedback that L is in the word. Therefore, I must have misread Guess 3's feedback.

Re-examining Guess 3: SLEEP
Feedback: S(✓) L(-) E(-) E(✓) P(-)
This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 2
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (since the second E is marked (-) for position 3)
- First E is position 4 (✓), so E is in position 4
- P is in the word but not in position 5

Wait, the feedback shows:
- Third letter E(-) means E is not in position 3
- Fourth letter E(✓) means E is in position 4
- Fifth letter P(-) means P is in the word but not position 5

Similarly, Guess 4 shows:
- Second letter M(x) – M not in word
- Third letter I(✓) – I in position 3
- Fifth letter E(-) – E not in position 5 (but we already know E is in position 4)
- L(-) means L is in the word but not position 5 (from Guess 4)

So L must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is I, so L must be in position 2.

However, from Guess 2: STOLE -> L(-) which says L is not in position 4
From Guess 3: SLEEP -> L(-) which says L is not in position 2
From Guess 4: SMILE -> L(-) which says L is not in position 5

This leaves only positions 1 (S) and 3 (I) for L, which are already taken. This seems impossible unless L is not in the word, but the feedback says L is in the word.

Looking back carefully: In Guess 4, the feedback is S(✓) M(x) I(✓) L(-) E(-)
This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So L can be in positions 2 or 3 or 5, but:
- From Guess 2: L not in 4
- From Guess 3: L not in 2
- From Guess 4: L not in 4

Therefore L must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is I (from Guess 4), so L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: S _ I E L

We need a letter for position 2 that is not in the banned list and fits common English words. Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y etc.

Common 5-letter words following S _ I E L:
- SPIEL (but P is banned)
- SKIEL (not common)
- SWIEL (not a word)
- SHIEL (valid word, means a shelter)

Let's check SHIEL:
S ✓
H (new, not banned)

4. Letters not in the word so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, P, M.
5. Letter L is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 according to past feedback, which is impossible because there are only 5 positions. Re-examining:
   - Guess 2: L(-) – L not in position 4
   - Guess 3: L(-) – L not in position 2
   - Guess 4: L(-) – L not in position 5
   - This leaves positions 1 and 3. Position 1 is S, position 3 is I. This suggests L cannot be in any position, which contradicts the feedback that L is in the word. Therefore, I must have misread Guess 3's feedback.

Re-examining Guess 3: SLEEP
Feedback: S(✓) L(-) E(-) E(✓) P(-)
This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 2
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (since the second E is marked (-) for position 3)
- First E is position 4 (✓), so E is in position 4
- P is in the word but not in position 5

Wait, the feedback shows:
- Third letter E(-) means E is not in position 3
- Fourth letter E(✓) means E is in position 4
- Fifth letter P(-) means P is in the word but not position 5

Similarly, Guess 4 shows:
- Second letter M(x) – M not in word
- Third letter I(✓) – I in position 3
- Fifth letter E(-) – E not in position 5 (but we already know E is in position 4)
- L(-) means L is in the word but not position 5 (from Guess 4)

So L must be in position 2 or 3. But position 3 is I, so L must be in position 2.

However, from Guess 2: STOLE -> L(-) which says L is not in position 4
From Guess 3: SLEEP -> L(-) which says L is not in position 2
From Guess 4: SMILE -> L(-) which says L is not in position 5

This leaves only positions 1 (S) and 3 (I) for L, which are already taken. This seems impossible unless L is not in the word, but the feedback says L is in the word.

Looking back carefully: In Guess 4, the feedback is S(✓) M(x) I(✓) L(-) E(-)
This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So L can be in positions 2 or 3 or 5, but:
- From Guess 2: L not in 4
- From Guess 3: L not in 2
- From Guess 4: L not in 4

Therefore L must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is I (from Guess 4), so L must be in position 5.

Thus the pattern is: S _ I E L

We need a letter for position 2 that is not in the banned list and fits common English words. Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y etc.

Common 5-letter words following S _ I E L:
- SPIEL (but P is banned)
- SKIEL (not common)
- SWIEL (not a word)
- SHIEL (valid word, means a shelter)

Let's check SHIEL:
S ✓
H (new, not banned)
I ✓
E ✓
L ✓

This seems valid.The pattern now is S _ I E L, with position 2 needing a letter that's not in our banned list (C, R, A, N, T, O, P, M). The word ""SHIEL"" fits perfectly.

- Position 2: H(x) – H is NOT in the word
- Position 3: I ✓ (fixed)
- Position 4: E ✓ (fixed)
- Position 5: L ✓ (fixed)

So we still need a single letter for position 2 that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already banned or used:
Banned from earlier: C, R, A, N, T, O, P, M, H
Used in pattern: S, I, E, L

Available consonants for position 2: B, D, F, G, K, U, V, W, Y

Common English words fitting S _ I E L:
- SPIEL – P banned
- SKIEL – not a standard word
- SWIEL – not a word
- SGIEL – not a word
- SUIEL – not a word
- SVIEL – not a word
- SBIEL – not a word
- SDIEL – not a word
- SFIEL – not a word
- S G I E L – → “SGIEL” invalid
Wait, the only real word left is “SKIEL” or “SKILL” but that doesn’t fit.

Actually, the only valid common word is “SPIEL” but P is banned. Next possibility is “SWIEL” – not valid.

Looking again, the correct word must be “SKILL” but that doesn’t fit. Realizing the pattern S _ I E L only has one valid word left: “SPIEL” but P is banned.

Rechecking: The word must be S _ I E L with position 2 not being any of banned letters. The only remaining valid English 5-letter word is “SIKEL” – but that’s not common. Actually, the only valid word is “SPIEL” but P is banned.

Realizing my mistake: The pattern is S _ I E L with position 2 not being H. The correct word must be “SPIEL” but P is banned. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is “SWIEL” which doesn’t exist.

Realizing the correct word must be “SPIEL” but P is banned, this suggests an inconsistency. Re-examining banned letters: P is banned from Guess 3 feedback (P(-) meaning P is in word but not pos 5). So P is in word but not pos 5. Therefore P can be in pos 2.

Thus “SPIEL” is possible.

But from Guess 3: SLEEP -> P(-) means P is in word but not pos 5. So P can be in pos 2. Therefore “SPIEL” fits all constraints.

Thus the correct word is “SPIEL”.
