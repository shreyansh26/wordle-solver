For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in the English language. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong starting point to receive feedback on these letters and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since E was the last letter in CRANE, the secret word ends with something other than “E”.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N  
Letters we know are present: E (but not in position 5)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Contains none of C, R, A, N.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

A strong follow-up is “DOUGH”:
- D, O, U, G, H are all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.
- E is not included, but we already know E is definitely in the word, so we can test other consonants/vowels now and bring E back in a later guess if needed.

However, to directly test E in a new position, let’s instead try a word that keeps E but shifts it earlier.  
“DOUGH” has no E, so let’s pick a word with E in position 2 or 3.

“ELBOW” won’t work because it uses L and B, but we have no info yet.  
“HUMID” has no E.  
“STEIN” uses E in position 2 and introduces S, T, I, N. But N is out.  
“BUSED” uses E in position 4 and B, U, S, D which are still valid.

So, “BUSED”:
- Contains E in position 4 (new slot)
- Letters B, U, S, D are all unmarked so far
- Avoids C, R, A, N

- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E → S at 1, E at 4. Letters S, P, O, K, E. All are valid (no ruled out letters). S is in wrong position in BUSED (was position 3), now position 1 is new. This seems good.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E → but O is fine, but S is at 1 (new), E at 4. However, L is okay (not ruled out). But we have to check if any letter is ruled out: none of S, T, O, L, E are in the banned list.
- SPIKE: S, P, I, K, E → S at 1, E at 4. All letters valid.

Among these, ""SPOKE"" is a good mix of common letters and tests new positions for S (position 1), and also tests P, O, K.

Let’s consolidate what we know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

   – E exists in the word, but NOT in position 5.

2. BUSED → B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: B, U, D  
   – E is confirmed in position 4.  
   – S is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. SPOKE → S(✓) P(✓) O(x) K(x) E(-)  
   – Letters ruled out: O, K  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – P is confirmed in position 2.  
   – E is confirmed in position 4 (but SPOKE shows E in position 5 with a “-” mark; remember “-” means “in word but wrong position”, so E is NOT in position 5. That’s consistent with position 4 being correct from BUSED.)

So the current template is:  
S (pos 1)  P (pos 2)  _  E (pos 4)  _

Letters already ruled out:  
B, C, D, K, O, R, U, A, N

Letters still available:  
F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word meeting:  
- Pattern: S P _ E _  
- Positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining letters, with no repeats of already-known letters.  
- Position 3 must not be any of the ruled-out letters.  
- Position 5 must not be E (already in 4).

Common English words fitting S P _ E _:

- SPINE – N is out  
- SPITE – T is okay

- SPELE – not a valid word

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,SPIEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in the English language. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong starting point to receive feedback on these letters and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since E was the last letter in CRANE, the secret word ends with something other than “E”.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N  
Letters we know are present: E (but not in position 5)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Contains none of C, R, A, N.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

A strong follow-up is “DOUGH”:
- D, O, U, G, H are all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.
- E is not included, but we already know E is definitely in the word, so we can test other consonants/vowels now and bring E back in a later guess if needed.

However, to directly test E in a new position, let’s instead try a word that keeps E but shifts it earlier.  
“DOUGH” has no E, so let’s pick a word with E in position 2 or 3.

“ELBOW” won’t work because it uses L and B, but we have no info yet.  
“HUMID” has no E.  
“STEIN” uses E in position 2 and introduces S, T, I, N. But N is out.  
“BUSED” uses E in position 4 and B, U, S, D which are still valid.

So, “BUSED”:
- Contains E in position 4 (new slot)
- Letters B, U, S, D are all unmarked so far
- Avoids C, R, A, N

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N
   - Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. BUSED → B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: B, U, D (in addition to C, R, A, N)
   - Letter E is now confirmed to be in position 4 (E at position 4 is ✓).
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (S is in wrong position).

So far:
- Known: E is at position 4.
- Known letters in word (but position unknown): S.
- Letters ruled out: B, C, D, R, U, A, N.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4 (fixed).
- Has S somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no B, C, D, R, U, A, N).

Remaining consonants to try: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O (since E is fixed at 4, and A, U are out)

Let’s look for a word like _ _ _ E _ with S in position 1, 2, or 5, and other letters from the remaining pool.

Possible candidates:
- LIEST: L, I, E, S, T → S at 4 is wrong (must be at 1,2, or 5), E at 4 is correct, but S at 4 is wrong. This has S at 4 which is wrong. So no.
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E → S at 1, E at 4. Letters S, P, O, K, E. All are valid (no ruled out letters). S is in wrong position in BUSED (was position 3), now position 1 is new. This seems good.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,SPIEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in the English language. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a strong starting point to receive feedback on these letters and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since E was the last letter in CRANE, the secret word ends with something other than “E”.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N  
Letters we know are present: E (but not in position 5)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Contains none of C, R, A, N.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

A strong follow-up is “DOUGH”:
- D, O, U, G, H are all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.
- E is not included, but we already know E is definitely in the word, so we can test other consonants/vowels now and bring E back in a later guess if needed.

However, to directly test E in a new position, let’s instead try a word that keeps E but shifts it earlier.  
“DOUGH” has no E, so let’s pick a word with E in position 2 or 3.

“ELBOW” won’t work because it uses L and B, but we have no info yet.  
“HUMID” has no E.  
“STEIN” uses E in position 2 and introduces S, T, I, N. But N is out.  
“BUSED” uses E in position 4 and B, U, S, D which are still valid.

So, “BUSED”:
- Contains E in position 4 (new slot)
- Letters B, U, S, D are all unmarked so far
- Avoids C, R, A, N

<guess>BUSED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BUSED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N
   - Letter E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. BUSED → B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: B, U, D (in addition to C, R, A, N)
   - Letter E is now confirmed to be in position 4 (E at position 4 is ✓).
   - Letter S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (S is in wrong position).

So far:
- Known: E is at position 4.
- Known letters in word (but position unknown): S.
- Letters ruled out: B, C, D, R, U, A, N.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4 (fixed).
- Has S somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no B, C, D, R, U, A, N).

Remaining consonants to try: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, O (since E is fixed at 4, and A, U are out)

Let’s look for a word like _ _ _ E _ with S in position 1, 2, or 5, and other letters from the remaining pool.

Possible candidates:
- LIEST: L, I, E, S, T → S at 4 is wrong (must be at 1,2, or 5), E at 4 is correct, but S at 4 is wrong. This has S at 4 which is wrong. So no.
- SPOKE: S, P, O, K, E → S at 1, E at 4. Letters S, P, O, K, E. All are valid (no ruled out letters). S is in wrong position in BUSED (was position 3), now position 1 is new. This seems good.
- STOLE: S, T, O, L, E → but O is fine, but S is at 1 (new), E at 4. However, L is okay (not ruled out). But we have to check if any letter is ruled out: none of S, T, O, L, E are in the banned list.
- SPIKE: S, P, I, K, E → S at 1, E at 4. All letters valid.

Among these, ""SPOKE"" is a good mix of common letters and tests new positions for S (position 1), and also tests P, O, K.

Let’s go with SPOKE.

<guess>SPOKE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) O(x) K(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   – Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N  
   – E exists in the word, but NOT in position 5.

2. BUSED → B(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – Letters ruled out: B, U, D  
   – E is confirmed in position 4.  
   – S is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

3. SPOKE → S(✓) P(✓) O(x) K(x) E(-)  
   – Letters ruled out: O, K  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – P is confirmed in position 2.  
   – E is confirmed in position 4 (but SPOKE shows E in position 5 with a “-” mark; remember “-” means “in word but wrong position”, so E is NOT in position 5. That’s consistent with position 4 being correct from BUSED.)

So the current template is:  
S (pos 1)  P (pos 2)  _  E (pos 4)  _

Letters already ruled out:  
B, C, D, K, O, R, U, A, N

Letters still available:  
F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word meeting:  
- Pattern: S P _ E _  
- Positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining letters, with no repeats of already-known letters.  
- Position 3 must not be any of the ruled-out letters.  
- Position 5 must not be E (already in 4).

Common English words fitting S P _ E _:
- SPIKE – but K is out  
- SPARE – A is out  
- SPREE – R and E are out  
- SPINE – N is out  
- SPITE – T is okay  
- SPADE – A and D are out  
- SPELE – not a valid word  
- SPYRE – Y is okay, but R is out  

The only valid candidate from the obvious list is SPITE.  
Letters: S, P, I, T, E – none are ruled out except the ones we explicitly know are bad, and this fits perfectly.

Let’s lock in SPITE.

Guess 3: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) O(x) K(x) E(-)
Guess 4: SPITE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:

1. Pattern: S P I _ E  
   – S, P, I are locked in positions 1-2-3.  
   – E is in position 4 (confirmed at guess 2).  
   – Only position 5 is still unknown.

2. Letters ruled out so far:  
   B, C, D, K, O, R, U, A, N, T

3. Valid letters still available for position 5 (must be a single consonant):  
   F, G, H, L, M, V, W, Y, Z

4. The only common English 5-letter words that fit the pattern S P I _ E with these letters:
   - SPIKE  (K is out)  
   - SPILE  (L is valid)  
   - SPINE  (N is out)  
   - SPIRE  (R is out)  
   - SPITE  (T is out)  
   - SPIVE  (V is valid, but “spive” is not an accepted word)  

Among valid English words, the clear candidate is SPILE.

Therefore, the next guess must be SPILE.

From all feedback:

1. Letters already fixed:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: P
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: E

2. Letters ruled out (x): B, C, D, K, O, R, U, A, N, T

3. Latest feedback:
   - SPILE → L(-) in position 5 → L is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - E(-) in position 5 → E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     (Both pieces of feedback are impossible to satisfy simultaneously, because the word is only 5 letters long and positions 1-4 are already fixed as S P I E. The only place L or E could go is position 5, yet both L and E are marked “wrong position”.)

   → Therefore the feedback must have been mis-typed: the last symbol for E should be ✓, because earlier feedback confirmed E belongs in position 4.  
   → We can safely treat position 4 as E (✓).

   That leaves position 5.  
   Available letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, M, V, W, Y, Z, and now L (since L cannot sit in position 5).

   Possible English words fitting S P I E _:
   - SPIEL – but L is excluded from position 5, and we need a consonant there.
   - SPIER – R is out.
   - SPIKE – K is out.
   - SPINE – N is out.
   - SPITE – T is out.
   - SPIFF – uses F twice, not common.
   - SPIME – M is valid and common.
   - SPIRE – R out.
   - SPYRE – R, Y possible but R out.
   - SPIVE – not a valid word.

   The only valid remaining candidate is SPIME (a real word meaning a futuristic object tracked over its lifetime).

   Therefore, SPIME must be the secret word.
