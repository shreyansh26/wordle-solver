For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""AUDIO"" is often recommended, but since I don't have any feedback yet, I'll choose a word that has a good mix of common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains the three most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word at all.
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are not anywhere in the word.
3. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Ends with E (we already know this).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S.
- Contains A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Uses other common letters to gain more information.

A good option is “LATE”, but that’s only 4 letters. A 5-letter word that fits is “PLATE” (but P is less common). Instead, “CABLE” is good because:
- Ends with E.
- Uses A (but not in position 1).
- Uses C, B, L, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids R, O, S.

From the feedback so far:

- E is confirmed in position 5.
- A is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (from CABLE feedback).
- B, C, R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).

Possible structure: _ _ A _ E or _ _ _ A E, but since A can’t be in position 4 (from CABLE, A was in position 2 and got ✓ there), wait no - actually A was in position 2 in CABLE and got ✓, meaning A is in position 2 is correct. Wait let me re-examine:

Previous feedback:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 1
- CABLE: A(✓) means A IS in position 2

So A is definitely in position 2.

Current known:
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: E
- L exists somewhere but not position 4
- No B, C, R, O, S

Letters left to test: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions: 1, 3, 4 (with 4 not being L)

Let’s construct a word with:
- A in 2
- E in 5
- L in 1 or 3

MAPLE:

- L: position 4 - but feedback said L is not in position 4 (from CABLE where L was in 4 and got -)
So L cannot be in 4, but in MAPLE it would be in 4 - invalid.

From the combined feedback we now know with certainty:

Position 1: L (✓ in LATHE)  
Position 2: A (✓ in CABLE and LATHE)  
Position 3: T (✓ in LATHE)  
Position 4: must be a letter that is not H (x in LATHE) and not L (L was only in position 4 of CABLE but marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 4 – yet L is already fixed in position 1, so position 4 is simply a new letter).  
Position 5: E (✓ from first guess)

Forbidden letters that have shown up as “x” or “-” so far: R, O, S, C, B, H.

So the word must be:

L A T _ E

with the blank being any letter not already ruled out (i.e., not R, O, S, C, B, H). Also we have not yet seen D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z appear at all, so any of those are possible.

Scanning common 5-letter words fitting “L A T _ E”:

- LATED – but D is unused, and the word is valid
- LATEX – X is unused
- LATKE – K is unused
- LATTE – T is already used twice and the word ends in TE, unlikely to repeat T
- LATHE – we already tried this
- LATER – R is out
- LATEE – invalid
- LATEN – N is unused

Among these, LATEN is a real word (meaning “to become late”) and only introduces the new letter N in the fourth position. That seems like the safest choice.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word at all.
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are not anywhere in the word.
3. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Ends with E (we already know this).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S.
- Contains A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Uses other common letters to gain more information.

A good option is “LATE”, but that’s only 4 letters. A 5-letter word that fits is “PLATE” (but P is less common). Instead, “CABLE” is good because:
- Ends with E.
- Uses A (but not in position 1).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- A is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (from CABLE feedback).
- B, C, R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).

Possible structure: _ _ A _ E or _ _ _ A E, but since A can’t be in position 4 (from CABLE, A was in position 2 and got ✓ there), wait no - actually A was in position 2 in CABLE and got ✓, meaning A is in position 2 is correct. Wait let me re-examine:

Previous feedback:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 1
- CABLE: A(✓) means A IS in position 2

So A is definitely in position 2.

Current known:
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: E
- L exists somewhere but not position 4
- No B, C, R, O, S

Letters left to test: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions: 1, 3, 4 (with 4 not being L)

Let’s construct a word with:
- A in 2
- E in 5
- L in 1 or 3
- Common remaining letters

Good candidate: TABLE - but B is out
MADLE - no, M and D are okay but word might not be valid
HALVE - H, L, V are okay
DANCE - N, C - but C is out
FABLE - B is out
MAPLE - P is okay, but let's check if valid: MAPLE is valid

MAPLE:
- M: new letter
- A: position 2 ✓
- P: new
- L: position 4 - but feedback said L is not in position 4 (from CABLE where L was in 4 and got -)
So L cannot be in 4, but in MAPLE it would be in 4 - invalid.

Next try: LATHE
- L in 1: okay
- A in 2: okay
- T, H, E: okay
But we don't know about T or H yet. This tests T and H.

Another: LADEN
- L in 1
- A in 2
- D, E, N
But E is fixed at 5, so position 4 N, position 3 D
Valid word: LADEN

But let me think of simpler: DALE_ - needs 5 letters ending with E
DALES - S is out
VALET - T at end, but E must be at end
WALER - R is out

Best seems LATHE or LADEN. Let’s go with LATHE as it gives more info.

From the latest feedback (LATEN):

- Position 4 returned “E(-)” – the letter E is in the word but NOT in position 4. We already knew E is in position 5, so this simply reconfirms E is in position 5 and nowhere else (which we already knew).

- Position 4 also got “N(x)” – the letter N is NOT in the word at all.

So the word must be:

L A T _ E

with the fourth character being any letter that is NOT in the list of previously eliminated letters:

Eliminated so far: R, O, S, C, B, H, N  
Also, E is already fixed at position 5, and T is fixed at position 3.

Scanning the remaining alphabet, any letter not in the eliminated set is possible in position 4. Common choices include D, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- LATED – D has not been eliminated, and LATED is a valid word (“belated” past tense).  
- LATKE – K is fine, but LATKE is a proper noun (Yiddish potato pancake). Generally not in standard wordlists.  
- LATEX – X is fine, but LATHE already showed H was out; LATEX is valid.  
- LATHE – already tried, H is out.  
- LATEN – just tried, N is out.

Between LATED and LATEX, LATED is the more common choice.

Therefore, the next logical guess is LATED.

<guess>LATED</guess>",LATED,"From the latest feedback (LATEN):

- Position 4 returned “E(-)” – the letter E is in the word but NOT in position 4. We already knew E is in position 5, so this simply reconfirms E is in position 5 and nowhere else (which we already knew).

- Position 4 also got “N(x)” – the letter N is NOT in the word at all.

So the word must be:

L A T _ E

with the fourth character being any letter that is NOT in the list of previously eliminated letters:

Eliminated so far: R, O, S, C, B, H, N  
Also, E is already fixed at position 5, and T is fixed at position 3.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,latte,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""AUDIO"" is often recommended, but since I don't have any feedback yet, I'll choose a word that has a good mix of common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains the three most common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word at all.
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters R, O, S are not anywhere in the word.
3. The letter A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Ends with E (we already know this).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S.
- Contains A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Uses other common letters to gain more information.

A good option is “LATE”, but that’s only 4 letters. A 5-letter word that fits is “PLATE” (but P is less common). Instead, “CABLE” is good because:
- Ends with E.
- Uses A (but not in position 1).
- Uses C, B, L, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids R, O, S.

Let’s go with CABLE.

<guess>CABLE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CABLE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- E is confirmed in position 5.
- A is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (from CABLE feedback).
- B, C, R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).

Possible structure: _ _ A _ E or _ _ _ A E, but since A can’t be in position 4 (from CABLE, A was in position 2 and got ✓ there), wait no - actually A was in position 2 in CABLE and got ✓, meaning A is in position 2 is correct. Wait let me re-examine:

Previous feedback:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but NOT position 1
- CABLE: A(✓) means A IS in position 2

So A is definitely in position 2.

Current known:
- Position 2: A
- Position 5: E
- L exists somewhere but not position 4
- No B, C, R, O, S

Letters left to test: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions: 1, 3, 4 (with 4 not being L)

Let’s construct a word with:
- A in 2
- E in 5
- L in 1 or 3
- Common remaining letters

Good candidate: TABLE - but B is out
MADLE - no, M and D are okay but word might not be valid
HALVE - H, L, V are okay
DANCE - N, C - but C is out
FABLE - B is out
MAPLE - P is okay, but let's check if valid: MAPLE is valid

MAPLE:
- M: new letter
- A: position 2 ✓
- P: new
- L: position 4 - but feedback said L is not in position 4 (from CABLE where L was in 4 and got -)
So L cannot be in 4, but in MAPLE it would be in 4 - invalid.

Next try: LATHE
- L in 1: okay
- A in 2: okay
- T, H, E: okay
But we don't know about T or H yet. This tests T and H.

Another: LADEN
- L in 1
- A in 2
- D, E, N
But E is fixed at 5, so position 4 N, position 3 D
Valid word: LADEN

But let me think of simpler: DALE_ - needs 5 letters ending with E
DALES - S is out
VALET - T at end, but E must be at end
WALER - R is out

Best seems LATHE or LADEN. Let’s go with LATHE as it gives more info.

LATHE:
- L in 1
- A in 2 ✓
- T, H, E
- E in 5 ✓
This fits all constraints.

<guess>LATHE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CABLE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: LATHE -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the combined feedback we now know with certainty:

Position 1: L (✓ in LATHE)  
Position 2: A (✓ in CABLE and LATHE)  
Position 3: T (✓ in LATHE)  
Position 4: must be a letter that is not H (x in LATHE) and not L (L was only in position 4 of CABLE but marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 4 – yet L is already fixed in position 1, so position 4 is simply a new letter).  
Position 5: E (✓ from first guess)

Forbidden letters that have shown up as “x” or “-” so far: R, O, S, C, B, H.

So the word must be:

L A T _ E

with the blank being any letter not already ruled out (i.e., not R, O, S, C, B, H). Also we have not yet seen D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z appear at all, so any of those are possible.

Scanning common 5-letter words fitting “L A T _ E”:

- LATED – but D is unused, and the word is valid
- LATEX – X is unused
- LATKE – K is unused
- LATTE – T is already used twice and the word ends in TE, unlikely to repeat T
- LATHE – we already tried this
- LATER – R is out
- LATEE – invalid
- LATEN – N is unused

Among these, LATEN is a real word (meaning “to become late”) and only introduces the new letter N in the fourth position. That seems like the safest choice.

So the next guess is:

LATEN

Also, E is already fixed at position 5, and T is fixed at position 3.

Looking for real 5-letter words that fit L A T _ E:

- LATED – D has not been eliminated, and LATED is a valid word (“belated” past tense).

- LATHE – already tried, H is out.  
- LATEN – just tried, N is out.

Between LATED and LATEX, LATED is the more common choice.

Therefore, the next logical guess is LATED.
