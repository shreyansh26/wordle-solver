- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common English letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""SLATE"" are good starting choices because they include frequently used vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it has three vowels and two common consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in the first position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct third position (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓)

So the pattern so far: _ _ I _ E  
Letters known to be present: R (somewhere not position 1), I, E  
Letters ruled out: A, S

Good next guesses should test the placement of R and a few new common consonants. A word like “TRIBE” would:
- keep I and E locked,
- try R in position 2,
- bring in new consonants T and B to gather more info.

We now know the pattern: _ R I _ E  
Letters known to be present: R (correctly in spot 2), I (correctly in spot 3), E (correctly in spot 5)  
Letters ruled out so far: A, S, T  
Letters still unknown: B is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels left to test: O, U (I and E already placed)

The missing spots are positions 1 and 4.  
- Position 1: can be any consonant except S, T, R (R is already used).  
- Position 4: must be B (since B is in the word but excluded from position 4 in TRIBE, yet position 4 is the only spot left for it once positions 2,3,5 are locked).

Wait— that seems impossible: position 4 can’t be B (feedback said B is in word but NOT in position 4). So B must occupy position 1, because positions 2,3,5 are fixed (R,I,E).  
So the word looks like: B R I _ E, with the blank at position 4.  
Letters left to test for position 4 must be consonants that haven’t been ruled out by prior guesses. From the letters that have appeared in guesses so far, the unused common consonants include C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

A very common English word that fits B R I _ E is “BRIDE” (testing D in position 4).  
D has not been tried yet and is a frequent consonant, so this is a strong next guess.
