- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are ETAOIN SHRDLU, so I'll aim to include as many of these as possible in a valid 5-letter word. ""STARE"" is an excellent choice because it contains S, T, A, R, E - five of the most frequent letters. This will give me good feedback on these common letters regardless of the actual secret word.

From the two rounds so far we have:

Excluded letters: S, T, R, O, C  
Confirmed letters (but positions still unknown): A, E, N  
Known placement: N is in position 5.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ N  
and it must use A, E once each (they cannot be in positions 3 or 4 respectively, because those spots already gave “-” feedback).

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(but remember A, E, N are already required).

We want a valid 5-letter word ending in N that contains both A and E, with A not in spot 3 and E not in spot 4.

Candidate words that fit:
- ANGEL (A in 1, E in 3 → E would be in 3, which is allowed)
- ALIEN (A in 1, E in 3 → same)
- AXION (only has A, lacks E)
- PAEAN (E in 3, A in 2 → both placements allowed)
- BEGAN (E in 2, A in 4 → A in 4 is allowed because previous feedback only ruled out A in 3)
- GLEAN (E in 4, A in 2 → E in 4 would repeat the same feedback spot that earlier gave “-”, so avoid)
- PANED (E in 4 → same issue)

The simplest safe choice is BEGAN:

Let's consolidate what we now know.

Excluded letters: S, T, R, O, C, B, G
Confirmed letters/positions: N in position 5 (✓)
Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don't know: A, E
Additional constraints:
- A is **not** in position 3 (from STARE)
- E is **not** in position 3 (from OCEAN) and **not** in position 2 (from BEGAN)
- A is **not** in position 4 (from BEGAN)

So the word looks like _ _ _ _ N and must contain both A and E somewhere among the first four letters, with:
- A not in 3 or 4 → A must be in 1 or 2
- E not in 2 or 3 → E must be in 1 or 4

Remaining available letters (not yet ruled out): A, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in N that contains A and E in positions 1 or 2 (A) and 1 or 4 (E) without repeating any of the excluded letters.

Let's test possible placements:

Case 1: A in 1, E in 4 → A _ _ E N
Possible words: A _ _ E N
Looking for valid words: ""ALIEN"" – excluded I? No, I is allowed. But L is allowed, so ALIEN fits.
""ALIEN"" uses A(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), N(5).

Check constraints:
- A in 1 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- N in 5 (correct)
- Letters: A, L, I, E, N – none are in the excluded list (S, T, R, O, C, B, G)

""ALIEN"" is a valid candidate.

Case 2: E in 1, A in 2 → E A _ _ N
Possible word: ""EATIN"" – not valid English
""EAGAN"" – not valid
""EARIN"" – invalid
No good options here.

Thus, ALIEN is the best next guess.

<guess>ALIEN</guess>",ALIEN,"Let's consolidate what we now know.

Excluded letters: S, T, R, O, C, B, G
Confirmed letters/positions: N in position 5 (✓)
Letters that are in the word but whose positions we still don't know: A, E
Additional constraints:
- A is **not** in position 3 (from STARE)
- E is **not** in position 3 (from OCEAN) and **not** in position 2 (from BEGAN)
- A is **not** in position 4 (from BEGAN)

So the word looks like _ _ _ _ N and must contain both A and E somewhere among the first four letters, with:
- A not in 3 or 4 → A must be in 1 or 2
- E not in 2 or 3 → E must be in 1 or 4
