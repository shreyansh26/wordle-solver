For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters in English that appear in many 5-letter words. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Looking at English letter frequency in 5-letter words, the most common letters are:
- Vowels: E, A, O, I
- Consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A strong opening word contains a mix of these letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A, O, E (top 3 vowels)
- R, S (top 3 consonants)
This gives us information about 5 very common letters right away, which will help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

Another good option is ""RAISE"" - similar letters but rearranged. Between these, I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it tests more distinct letter positions while maintaining the same letter frequency advantages.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- A, O, E (top 3 vowels)\n- R, S (top 3 consonants)\nThis gives us information about 5 very common letters right away, which will help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.\n\nAnother good option is ""RAISE"" - similar letters but rearranged.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Word structure so far: B E _ _ _
2. Absent letters: A, R, O, S, N, C, H, F, I, T
3. The remaining pool of usable letters (excluding already tested ones):
   D, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit B E _ _ _ and use only the remaining letters.

Some possible candidates:
- BEDIM – D and M are still allowed, but we don’t know if I is allowed (I was marked x in BEFIT).
- BEGUM – G and U are allowed, but M is allowed (not yet tested), but BEGUM is uncommon.
- BEVEL – V and L are allowed, but we already know E is in position 2 and VEL seems plausible.
- BEVEL: B E V E L – but this repeats E, which is allowed since we only know E is in position 2, not whether it appears elsewhere.
- BEVEL seems acceptable and tests V and L.

Another option:
- BEVEL: B(✓) E(✓) V(new) E(new position) L(new).

But we need to test new positions. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, and V and L are new letters not yet tested, BEVEL is a strong candidate.

BEVEL also tests E in position 4, which would give more info about E's presence elsewhere if it’s marked again.

Thus, BEVEL is the next logical guess.
