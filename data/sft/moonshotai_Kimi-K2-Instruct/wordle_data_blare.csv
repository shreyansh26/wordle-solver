For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and has a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ A _ _ _.
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ A _ _ E.

We know:
1. The word ends in E and has A in the second position: _ A _ _ E
2. It contains R, but not in position 2 (since R was marked ""-"" in position 2 of CRANE).
3. Letters C and N are eliminated.

A few possible word patterns fitting _ A _ _ E with R somewhere:
- R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form:
- R A _ _ E (but R can't be in position 2, which is already A)

Common words fitting _ A _ _ E with R:
- BARGE (R in position 3)

- CARVE (but ends with E, R in position 3, but C is eliminated)
- PARSE (but ends with E, R in position 3)

Most promising: LARGE or BARGE. Both fit _ A _ _ E and include R in position 3. Between these, LARGE is more common and includes L, which is another high-frequency letter not yet tested.

From the new feedback on LARGE:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  (but we already knew A was in position 2 from CRANE; now we see A is NOT in position 2 – this is a contradiction unless the feedback for A in LARGE is meant to override the earlier feedback. Assuming the feedback is consistent, it implies A is NOT in position 2 after all, which would invalidate the earlier ✓ for A in position 2. This seems unlikely, so I'll interpret the LARGE feedback as: A is in the word but not in position 2, meaning position 2 is NOT A – but this conflicts with CRANE. More likely, the ""-"" for A in LARGE means A is in the word but not in position 2, so position 2 is not A, which would mean the earlier CRANE feedback's ✓ for A was actually indicating A is in position 3, 4, or 5. However, CRANE's feedback said A(✓), which usually means correct position. This is ambiguous.

Re-reading the feedback rules: in CRANE, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3). In LARGE, A(-) means A is in the word but wrong position. This is impossible because A was already marked as being in the correct position in CRANE (position 3). Therefore, the only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for LARGE is relative to LARGE's positions, and the CRANE feedback still holds: A is in position 3, E is in position 5, R is somewhere (but not position 2), L is in the word but wrong position, G is not in the word.

So revised constraints:
1. Word form: _ _ A _ E (from CRANE: A in 3, E in 5)
2. Contains R, but not in position 2 (from CRANE)
3. Contains L, but not in position 1 (from LARGE)
4. No C, N, G (from CRANE and LARGE)

Possible positions for R: 1, 4 (cannot be 2,3,5)
Possible positions for L: 2,3,4,5 (but 3 is A, 5 is E) so 2 or 4

Let's explore:
Case 1: R in position 1
Word: R _ A _ E  
L must be in position 2 or 4
- If L in 2: R L A _ E → RLAXE? Not a word. RLACE? No C. RLADE? RLAME? RLARE? RLATE? RLAVE? RLADE is not a word, RLAME not common, RLARE not a word, RLATE not a word, RLAVE not a word.
- If L in 4: R _ A L E → Possible: R A A L E (invalid, A repeated), R B A L E (B), R D A L E (D), R F A L E (F), R H A L E (H), R M A L E (MALE), R P A L E (PALE), R S A L E (SALE), R T A L E (TALE), R W A L E (WALE)
From these, common words: MALE, PALE, SALE, TALE, WALE

Case 2: R in position 4
Word: _ _ A R E  
L must be in position 2 (since position 4 is R)
So: _ L A R E
Possible letters for position 1: Not C, N, G, and must form a word. Common: B, D, F, H, M, P, S, T, W
Words: BLARE, CLARE (C excluded), FLARE, SLARE? Not common, TLARE? No.
So: BLARE, FLARE

Between these options, good candidates: MALE, PALE, SALE, TALE, WALE, BLARE, FLARE
We need to pick one that introduces new letters to narrow down. FLARE introduces F (new), BLARE introduces B (new), others reuse letters we may already know.

Let's pick FLARE to test F and confirm R placement.

But wait, in FLARE:
- F is new
- L is in position 2 (but LARGE said L is in wrong position, and in LARGE L was position 1, so position 2 is allowed)
- A is position 3 (matches CRANE)
- R is position 4 (matches being in word but not position 2)
- E is position 5 (matches)

So FLARE fits all constraints. However, we should check if any letters are repeated or contradicted: F, L, A, R, E – all allowed, no C/N/G.

Final choice: FLARE

But let me double-check another good candidate: BLARE
B is new, L in position 2 (allowed), A in 3, R in 4, E in 5. Also valid.

Between FLARE and BLARE, both are good. I'll choose BLARE because B is slightly more common than F for narrowing down possibilities.
