For the first guess, we want to choose a word that helps us quickly identify common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. Good starting words often include:

- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeated letters to maximize information

Popular strategic choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct

This gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but E is not the last letter.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
3. The word must contain 5 unique letters (none of A,R,O,S).

To pick a good second guess we want:
- To keep the letter E in a different position (since it’s in the word but not last).
- To avoid A, R, O, S entirely.
- To test new common consonants (since R and S are out) such as T, N, L, D.
- To test remaining vowels (I, U).

A strong choice is “UNTIE” because:
- It places E in position 4 (different from last guess’s position 5).
- It introduces three new vowels/consonants: U, N, T, I.
- It avoids all excluded letters (A, R, O, S).

Let’s go with that.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Extracting facts:

Letters known NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, U, N, I

Letters known to be in the word (but positions unknown yet):
E, T

The word contains E and T somewhere, and none of A,R,O,S,U,N,I.

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet minus the ruled-out ones) that are common in 5-letter words:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need:
- One more vowel (only Y is left among vowels, but sometimes it acts as a consonant)
- Three more consonants

We now need to place E and T in different positions from their previous guesses:
- In UNTIE, T was in position 3 and E was in position 5 → neither T(3) nor E(5) are correct.

A good next guess should:
1. Include both T and E in new positions.
2. Avoid all ruled-out letters.
3. Choose 3 new letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try “ETHYL”:
- Contains E and T.
- Uses new letters H, Y, L.
- E is in position 1 (new position).
- T is in position 2 (new position).
- All letters are from the allowed set.

But wait, I need to double-check if Y is acceptable as a vowel here. Since we’ve ruled out A,E,I,O,U, and Y is sometimes used as a vowel substitute, it should be allowed.

However, let’s verify:
- ETHYL: E, T, H, Y, L – none are in the banned list (A,R,O,S,U,N,I).

So this seems like a valid and informative next guess.

Alternative could be “WELTY” but W is less common than H, and L,Y,T,E are needed.

I’ll go with ETHYL.

Good starting words often include:\n\n- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)\n- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)\n- No repeated letters to maximize information\n\nPopular strategic choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". \n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- All letters are distinct\n\nThis gives us good coverage to identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).\n- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).\n\nSo we now know:\n1.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(-)  
3. ETHYL → E(✓) T(-) H(x) Y(-) L(x)  

Extracting facts:

Letters known NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, L  

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown except one):  
- E is in the word and in position 1 (✓)  
- T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ETHYL and UNTIE)  
- Y is in the word but not in position 4 (from ETHYL)  

So far we have:  
E _ _ _ _  
T somewhere in positions 3,4,5  
Y somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5 (but position 1 is already E)  

We need two more letters that are NOT in {A,R,O,S,U,N,I,H,L}.  
Remaining common unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We want to test common consonants and place T and Y in new positions.  

Let’s try to place T in position 3 and Y in position 5, and test two new common consonants.  

A good candidate is EJECT:  
- E(✓) position 1  
- J, C are new and common  
- We place T in position 3 (valid, since T was only ruled out from positions 2 and 3 in previous guesses)  
- However, from ETHYL, T was in position 2 (✗), and from UNTIE, T was in position 3 (✗). Wait, ETHYL had T in position 2 (✗), and UNTIE had T in position 3 (✗). So T can be in positions 4 or 5 now.  

So we need to place T in 4 or 5. Let’s try EJECT:  
E(✓) J(x) E(x) C(x) T(-) – but E is already in position 1 (✓), so we can’t reuse E in position 3.  

Better choice: EBTYX – but B,T,Y,X are possible, but this may not be a valid word.  

Alternative: ETYMA – but A is out.  

Another: EXEPT – but P is fine, but E is repeated.  

Let me pick a valid word with E in 1, T and Y elsewhere, plus two new consonants.  

How about EJECT? No, E is repeated and J,C,T,E are positions.  

Wait, let me list valid words with E _ _ _ _, containing T and Y, and no banned letters.  

Possible structure: E _ T _ Y or E _ _ T Y or E T _ _ Y etc.  

A valid word: EMPTY – but M,P,T,Y, and M,P are new, but L is banned (L is banned).  

Wait, L is banned (from ETHYL).  

Another: EFTYS – but not a word.  

Another: ETYMA – A is banned.  

Another: EWT Y – no.  

Let me think differently: we know E is in position 1. T and Y must be in the word, and no banned letters.  

Let me pick a word like EBTYX – but not valid.  

Actually, let’s try EJECT – but J is new, E is already in 1, C,T are new, but E is repeated.  

Instead, let’s try EJECT is invalid (E repeated).  

Next: EDIFY – but I is banned.  

Next: EBONY – O is banned.  

Next: EMBRY – R is banned.  

Next: ENVOY – N is banned.  

Next: EPOXY – O is banned.  

Next: ETYMA – A is banned.  

Hmm, let me list possible letters: allowed are B,C,D,F,G,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z plus E,T,Y  

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with E, containing T and Y, with remaining letters from allowed set.  

A valid word: EMPTY  
- E(✓) M P T Y  
- M and P are new and allowed.  

Check banned letters: A,R,O,S,U,N,I,H,L – none of these are in EMPTY.  

T is in position 4 (new position, since T was in 2 and 3 before)  
Y is in position 5 (new, was in 4 before)  

So EMPTY is valid and informative.
