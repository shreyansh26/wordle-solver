Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use common letters in positions where they frequently appear in English 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc.

A strong opening word would be one that:
1. Uses common letters
2. Has different letters (no repeats)
3. Has letters in positions where they commonly appear

One such word is ""AROSE"" which uses five common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good information about the presence and position of these common letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions we still need to confirm: A, S, E
- We still don’t know about the other 21 letters.

1. Keep the known letters A, S, E.
2. Avoid R and O entirely.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

- Introduces T and L, two very common letters not yet tested
- Contains no R or O

Feedback summary so far:
- Letters in the word and their current positions:
  – S is in the word and already placed correctly at position 1.
  – E is in the word and already placed correctly at position 3.
  – A is in the word and already placed correctly at position 4.
- Letters known to be absent (x in both guesses): R, O, T, L.
- Thus the secret word has the fixed pattern:
  S _ E A _
We still need to determine positions 2 and 5.

Letters we haven’t tested yet that are common: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in position 3 and A in position 4
3. Introduces two new consonants in positions 2 and 5
4. Does not reuse any ruled-out letters (R, O, T, L).

A good candidate is “SHEAR”:
- S at 1, E at 3, A at 4
- H and R for positions 2 and 5.  
But R is already known to be absent → can’t use R.
Next candidate: “SPEAK” – but T is already out and K is new, yet the second letter P is fine, and K is new at 5, but A repeats in 4 which we already know. We need unique letters in positions 2 and 5.

Another candidate: “SEAMY” – position 2 is E, but E is already at 3 → duplicate E, but we’re allowed duplicates in guesses as long as the guess is a valid word. However, we don’t know yet if the word has duplicate letters, so to maximize info, let’s prefer distinct letters.

Let’s pick “SHADE”:
- S ✓, H new, A ✓, D new, E ✓.  
Positions: S H E A D. All letters except the known ones are fresh. This fits the fixed pattern S _ E A _ and introduces H and D.

But position 5 already has E placed at 3, so “SHADE” would place E at 5 which conflicts with E needing to be at 3. Actually, no conflict: the feedback told us E is in position 3 already, so “SHADE” has E at 3 and D at 5 → perfectly fits S _ E A _.

Feedback recap:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – A, S, E are in the word, but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   – R, O are not in the word.

2. STEAL → S(✓) T(x) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   – S is now fixed at position 1.
   – E is fixed at position 3.
   – A is fixed at position 4.
   – T, L are out.

3. SHADE → S(✓) H(x) A(-) D(x) E(-)
   – S still ✓ at 1, E still ✓ at 3.
   – A appears at 4 ✓, so the “A(-)” at position 3 in this guess is irrelevant (it’s already confirmed at 4 and can’t appear again).
   – H and D are now known to be absent.

So far we know the word is:
S _ E A _
with positions 2 and 5 still unknown, and the following letters already ruled out: R, O, T, L, H, D.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: C, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ E A _ and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- SMEAR – but R is out.
- SPEAK – K is new and allowed.
- SNEAK – N and K are new.
- SPEAR – R out.
- SPEAK vs SNEAK: both introduce two new letters.

Between SPEAK and SNEAK, “SPEAK” seems slightly more common and worth testing first.

However, let’s double-check: P has not been used yet; K hasn’t either. Both are acceptable. “SPEAK” uses P at 2 and K at 5, fitting the pattern S P E A K.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “SPEAK”.
