For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L.

A good starting word would have:
1. Multiple vowels to test their presence
2. Common consonants
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) to test vowel presence
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid English word

This should give good coverage for narrowing down possible secret words.

From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in the 1st position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word must contain A (but not at position 1).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). A good next guess should:
1. Include A (but not in slot 1).
2. Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Probe new common consonants (T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.) and the vowels I, U.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (TAINT):  
- T is in the word AND in the correct position 1.  
- A is in the word AND in the correct position 2.  
- I, N are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
1. T _ _ _ _ (position 1 is T)  
2. T A _ _ _ (position 2 is A)  
3. No I, N, R, O, S, E anywhere.  
4. So far we have T and A locked, need three more letters that are not I, N, R, O, S, E.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already used, and we know E, I, O are out).

A good next word should:
- Keep T in position 1 and A in position 2.  
- Try new common consonants and possibly U.  
- Avoid any of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates: TABBY, TACKS, TADPOLE (too long), TAFLY, etc. But we need a 5-letter word.

Let's try ""TABBY"" – it has T and A fixed in positions 1 and 2, uses B (common), Y (vowel-like), and another B. But we don't know about B or Y yet.

Another candidate: ""TAFFY"" – uses F and Y.

But ""TAFFY"" might be better because F and Y are common enough.

Wait, but we want to test more distinct letters. Let's try ""TALCK"" – but that's not a word. ""TALCS"" uses S which is out.

""TALKS"" uses S which is out. ""TAMMY"" – uses M and Y. ""TAUNT"" uses U and N (but N is out).

""TAUTS"" – uses S which is out.

""TAJMA"" – not a word.

""TACIT"" – uses I and T (I is out, T is already known).

""TACKY"" – uses C, K, Y.

This seems good: T A C K Y – but we don't know about C, K, Y yet.

Another option: ""TAJIK"" – uses J and K, but J is less common.

""TALCY"" – not a word.

""TACIT"" – uses I and T (I is out, T is already known).

""TACKY"" – uses C, K, Y.

This seems good: T A C K Y – but we don't know about C, K, Y yet.

Another option: ""TAJIK"" – uses J and K, but J is less common.

""TALCY"" – not a word.

""TAKEY"" – uses K, E (E is out).

""TAMMY"" – uses M, Y.

Let's go with ""TACMY"" – but that's not a word.

""TABID"" – not a word.

""TABOR"" – uses O (out).

""TACET"" – uses E (out).

""TACIT"" – uses I (out).

""TACKY"" – uses C, K, Y – this seems valid and tests new letters.

So ""TACKY"" is a valid 5-letter word, fits the constraints (T in 1, A in 2, avoids I, N, R, O, S, E), and tests C, K, Y.

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. T (position 1) is locked – it is correct.
2. A (position 2) is locked – it is correct.
3. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E (from AROSE), I, N (from TAINT), C, K (from TACKY).
   So the discard set = {R, O, S, E, I, N, C, K}.

That leaves us with the pattern: T A _ _ _

We need three more letters from the remaining alphabet:
Vowels: only U is still available (A is used in position 2; E, I, O are disqualified).
Consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- Letter Y appears in TACKY and was marked ✓ in position 5; hence Y is in the word and is in position 5.

So now the pattern is: T A _ _ Y

Only two unknown slots (positions 3 and 4) remain, and they must be chosen from the allowed consonants and possibly the vowel U.

Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, L, M, P, V, W, H, etc.

We want to pick a pair that forms a frequent digraph. Common endings for “TA__Y” include:
- T A L L Y  → TALLY
- T A B L Y  → TABLY (not a word)
- T A B B Y  → TABBY (but B is not yet ruled in/out)

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L.

A good starting word would have:
1. Multiple vowels to test their presence
2. Common consonants
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) to test vowel presence
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)

- It's a valid English word

This should give good coverage for narrowing down possible secret words.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in the 1st position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word must contain A (but not at position 1).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). A good next guess should:
1. Include A (but not in slot 1).
2. Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Probe new common consonants (T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.) and the vowels I, U.

One efficient word that fits these rules and covers several new common letters is:

Possible candidates: TABBY, TACKS, TADPOLE (too long), TAFLY, etc. But we need a 5-letter word.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,tatty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L.

A good starting word would have:
1. Multiple vowels to test their presence
2. Common consonants
3. No repeated letters to maximize coverage

Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) to test vowel presence
- It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid English word

This should give good coverage for narrowing down possible secret words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:  
A(-) – the letter A is in the word but not in the 1st position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – these four letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word must contain A (but not at position 1).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U, Y). A good next guess should:
1. Include A (but not in slot 1).
2. Avoid R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Probe new common consonants (T, N, L, C, M, D, etc.) and the vowels I, U.

One efficient word that fits these rules and covers several new common letters is:

TAINT – it uses T, A, I, N (all common and not yet eliminated) and keeps A away from the first position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE):  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (TAINT):  
- T is in the word AND in the correct position 1.  
- A is in the word AND in the correct position 2.  
- I, N are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
1. T _ _ _ _ (position 1 is T)  
2. T A _ _ _ (position 2 is A)  
3. No I, N, R, O, S, E anywhere.  
4. So far we have T and A locked, need three more letters that are not I, N, R, O, S, E.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already used, and we know E, I, O are out).

A good next word should:
- Keep T in position 1 and A in position 2.  
- Try new common consonants and possibly U.  
- Avoid any of the excluded letters.

Possible candidates: TABBY, TACKS, TADPOLE (too long), TAFLY, etc. But we need a 5-letter word.

Let's try ""TABBY"" – it has T and A fixed in positions 1 and 2, uses B (common), Y (vowel-like), and another B. But we don't know about B or Y yet.

Another candidate: ""TAFFY"" – uses F and Y.

But ""TAFFY"" might be better because F and Y are common enough.

Wait, but we want to test more distinct letters. Let's try ""TALCK"" – but that's not a word. ""TALCS"" uses S which is out.

""TALKS"" uses S which is out. ""TAMMY"" – uses M and Y. ""TAUNT"" uses U and N (but N is out).

""TAUTS"" – uses S which is out.

""TAJMA"" – not a word.

""TACIT"" – uses I and T (I is out, T is already known).

""TACKY"" – uses C, K, Y.

This seems good: T A C K Y – but we don't know about C, K, Y yet.

Another option: ""TAJIK"" – uses J and K, but J is less common.

""TALCY"" – not a word.

""TAKEY"" – uses K, E (E is out).

""TAMMY"" – uses M, Y.

Let's go with ""TACMY"" – but that's not a word.

""TABID"" – not a word.

""TABOR"" – uses O (out).

""TACET"" – uses E (out).

""TACIT"" – uses I (out).

""TACKY"" – uses C, K, Y – this seems valid and tests new letters.

So ""TACKY"" is a valid 5-letter word, fits the constraints (T in 1, A in 2, avoids I, N, R, O, S, E), and tests C, K, Y.

<guess>TACKY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: TACKY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three pieces of feedback:

1. T (position 1) is locked – it is correct.
2. A (position 2) is locked – it is correct.
3. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E (from AROSE), I, N (from TAINT), C, K (from TACKY).
   So the discard set = {R, O, S, E, I, N, C, K}.

That leaves us with the pattern: T A _ _ _

We need three more letters from the remaining alphabet:
Vowels: only U is still available (A is used in position 2; E, I, O are disqualified).
Consonants still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- Letter Y appears in TACKY and was marked ✓ in position 5; hence Y is in the word and is in position 5.

So now the pattern is: T A _ _ Y

Only two unknown slots (positions 3 and 4) remain, and they must be chosen from the allowed consonants and possibly the vowel U.

Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, L, M, P, V, W, H, etc.

We want to pick a pair that forms a frequent digraph. Common endings for “TA__Y” include:
- T A L L Y  → TALLY
- T A B L Y  → TABLY (not a word)
- T A B B Y  → TABBY (but B is not yet ruled in/out)
- T A P P Y  → TAPPY (but P not yet ruled in/out)
- T A G G Y  → TAGGY (but G not yet ruled in/out)

Among these, TALLY is a legitimate, common English word, uses the consonant L (not yet tested), and fits every constraint.

Therefore, T A L L Y is my next guess.

Guess 3: TACKY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: TALLY -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know:
- The pattern is T A _ _ Y with positions 1,2,5 locked.
- Letters that cannot appear anywhere: {R,O,S,E,I,N,C,K,L}.
- Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Remaining vowel: U.

So positions 3 and 4 must be two distinct consonants from the allowed set (no repeats unless the word itself repeats one, which is unlikely).  
We need a common English word that fits T A _ _ Y.

Some possibilities:
- TABBY  – but B not yet confirmed and Y already used correctly in position 5.
- TAMMY  – M is allowed and not yet ruled out.
- TAPPY  – P is allowed.
- TAWNY  – W and N (but N is ruled out).
- TAFFY  – F is allowed.

Of these, TAMMY, TAPPY, TAFFY are valid.  
Let’s pick TAMMY because M is a very common consonant and has not been tested yet. It checks:
- T in 1 ✓  
- A in 2 ✓  
- M (new) in 3  
- M again in 4 (allowed if the word is TAMMY)  
- Y in 5 ✓

We now have the confirmed pattern: T A _ _ Y with positions 1, 2, and 5 locked.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
{R, O, S, E, I, N, C, K, L, M}

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4 (two distinct consonants, because no repeats are allowed in these positions and the word itself doesn't seem to repeat):  
{B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z} plus the vowel U (but a vowel in position 3 or 4 is unlikely given typical English patterns).

Looking at common words with this pattern:  
- T A D G Y → “TADGY” (not a word)  
- T A F F Y → “TAFFY” (valid, uses F)  
- T A B B Y → “TABBY” (valid, uses B)  
- T A P P Y → “TAPPY” (valid, uses P)  
- T A D D Y → “TADDY” (valid, uses D)  
- T A G G Y → “TAGGY” (valid, uses G)  

Among these, “TAFFY” is a very common word and uses F, which hasn't been tested yet. Testing F will give us the most information.

Therefore, the next guess is TAFFY.
