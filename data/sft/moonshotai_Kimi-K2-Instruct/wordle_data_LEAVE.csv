Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting hits. Common starting words for Wordle include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S, O (common consonants)
This gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters early, whether they're in the word or not.

Let’s update the constraints from both guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is the 5th letter.
   - A exists but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S do NOT appear anywhere.

2. PLANE → P(x) L(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - A is now fixed in position 3 (✓).
   - L exists but not in position 2.
   - P and N do NOT appear.
   - E is still 5th (already known).

Current known pattern:
- _ _ A _ E
Letters to include: A (already placed), L (somewhere other than pos 2).
Letters to exclude: P, N, R, O, S.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, T, V, W, Y, Z (but we prefer common ones).

We need a word like: X L A Y E  or  X Y A L E  with L not in position 2.

Candidate words:
- FLAME – has F and M (both allowed). L is in position 2 → violates L(-) (L not in position 2).
- GLADE – has G, L, D. L is in position 2 → violates.
- CLAVE – has C, L, V. L is in position 2 → violates.
- HALVE – H, L, V. L is in position 2 → violates.
- VALUE – V, L. L is in position 2 → violates.
- DELAY – D, E, L, A, Y. This fits: D E L A Y. But E is 5th, so this is DELAY which ends in Y, not E. Wrong.
- GABLE – G, A, B, L, E. L is in position 4 (allowed), A is 3, E is 5. Contains no forbidden letters.

""GABLE"" meets all constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ E → G A B L E (positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E). Wait, A needs to be exactly position 3, so this is wrong pattern. Let me re-express:

Correct pattern must be: _ _ A _ E with L somewhere not position 2. So:
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- L must be in 1, 4, or 5. But 5 is E, so L must be 1 or 4.
- Examples: L _ A _ E or _ _ A L E.

Looking for words:
- L _ A _ E → LEASE (but S is excluded), LAKEE (invalid), LAREE (invalid).
- _ _ A L E → SCALE (S excluded), DIALE (invalid), METAL reversed, but not common.
- CABLE – C, A, B, L, E → positions: C A B L E → but A is 2nd, needs 3rd. Wrong.
- TABLE – T, A, B, L, E → A is 2nd, needs 3rd. Wrong.
- GABLE – G, A, B, L, E → A is 2nd, needs 3rd. Wrong.
- BLAME – B, L, A, M, E → A is 3rd (✓), L is 2nd (but L(-) says L not in 2nd). So invalid.

Rechecking: we need _ _ A _ E with L not in 2nd. So L must be 1st or 4th.

Word fitting _ _ A _ E with L in 4th:
- _ _ A L E → common word: ""D A L E"" is 4 letters. Not matching.
Wait, _ _ A L E needs 5 letters: like ""C H A L E"" invalid, ""B A L L E"" invalid, ""F A C L E"" invalid, ""M A C L E"" invalid. 

Actually, _ _ A L E is hard. Try L in 1st:
- L _ A _ E:
  - L E A P E → invalid (double E).
  - L I A R E → invalid (R excluded).
  - L U A G E → invalid.
  - L Y A K E → invalid.

Re-examining: perhaps ""GLAZE"" – but Z is uncommon. And positions:
G L A Z E → A is 3rd (✓), L is 2nd (forbidden by L(-)). So invalid.

""FLAKE"" – F, L, A, K, E → A is 3rd (✓), L is 2nd (forbidden). Invalid.

""CLAVE"" – C, L, A, V, E → A is 3rd (✓), L is 2nd (forbidden). Invalid.

""BEACH"" – ends in H, not E.

Realizing: maybe ""HEAVE"":
H, E, A, V, E → A is 3rd (✓), E is 5th (✓), but double E and V uncommon. Also L not present, but we know L is in word.

Must include L. So:
_ _ A L E – common word: ""VALVE"" – V, A, L, V, E → A is 2nd, needs 3rd. Wrong.
""HALVE"" – H, A, L, V, E → A is 2nd. Wrong.

Alternative: L in 1st position:
L E A V E – L, E, A, V, E → A is 3rd (✓), L is 1st (allowed), E is 5th (✓), and no excluded letters. This fits.

""LEAVE"":
- Letters: L, E, A, V, E.
- Pattern: L (1), E (2), A (3), V (4), E (5).
- A is 3rd (✓), E is 5th (✓), L is 1st (not 2nd, satisfies L(-)).
