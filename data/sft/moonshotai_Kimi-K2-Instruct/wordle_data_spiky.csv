For a first guess in Wordle, we want a word that maximizes information gain—ideally containing common vowels and consonants to narrow down possibilities quickly. Classic starting words often include combinations of letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

One of the most statistically optimal starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- Avoids repeating any letters to maximize coverage.

Another strong contender is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""SLATE"" is a well-balanced choice that covers many high-frequency letters without overlaps. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1.
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the word must be of the form S _ _ _ _ and cannot contain L, A, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S and using none of L, A, T, E.  
Possible next letters to test: common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates include O, I, U, R, N, M, P, C, D, etc.

A balanced second guess that re-uses the locked-in S and introduces several untested high-frequency letters is “SOUND”:
- Contains S (confirmed correct in position 1).
- Tests new vowels O, U.
- Tests new consonants N, D.
- Avoids all eliminated letters L, A, T, E.

- Begins with S
- Uses none of the eliminated letters
- Uses some of the still-possible letters to gain information.

- Starts with S ✓
- Introduces P, I, C, Y (none of which have been ruled out yet)

2. Eliminated letters so far: L, A, T, E, O, U, N, D, C.
3. Still-possible letters for the 4th position (must not be any of the eliminated ones and must form a valid English word):

   Remaining consonants/letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, V, W, X, Z (among these, we want one that forms a common word).

Trying plausible letters one by one:

- SPIKY → valid word.
- SPIRY → less common.
- SPIMY → not a word.
- SPIRY is borderline, but SPIKY is a common word meaning “having spikes”.

SPIKY satisfies all constraints:
- Starts with SPI.
- Ends with KY.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters.

Hence, the next logical guess is SPIKY.",Guess 4: SPIKY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
