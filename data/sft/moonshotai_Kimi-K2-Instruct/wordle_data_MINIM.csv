Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are often recommended because they contain frequently used letters.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced word with:
- 2 vowels (A, E) which are common
- 3 consonants (C, R, N) which are also common
- No repeating letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all NOT in the word (x)
- N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-)

So we know:
1. The letters C, R, A, E are eliminated.
2. The letter N is present somewhere other than position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains N (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E
- Uses other common letters

Let's think of common consonants and vowels left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate would be ""MOUNT"":
- Contains N (position 3)
- Does not contain C, R, A, E
- Uses common letters M, O, U, N, T

Other possibilities could be ""BONUS"" or ""DONUT"", but ""MOUNT"" seems like a strong choice with common letters.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

Guess 1: CRANE

→ M is correctly placed in position 1  
→ O, U, T are NOT in the word  
→ N is again NOT in position 4, confirming it must be in position 2, 3, or 5  

Current known facts  
1. Word pattern: M _ _ _ _  
2. Must contain N somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5  
3. Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, O, U, T  

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, W, Y  
Remaining common vowels: I  

We are looking for a word that starts with M, uses N in position 2, 3, or 5, and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- M N _ _ _  (but N is not in position 2 from the feedback, because in MOUNT N was in position 4 and marked (-) so it can't be position 2)
Wait, no: N was marked (-) in both positions 4 (CRANE) and 4 (MOUNT), so it can still be in positions 2, 3, or 5. Actually, in MOUNT N was in position 4 and marked (-), so N is confirmed NOT in position 4, but could be in 2, 3, or 5.

Let me think of valid words:
- If N is in position 2: M N _ _ _ → MN??? but few common 5-letter words start MN
- If N is in position 3: M _ N _ _  
  - M I N D Y → MINDY (but Y is allowed)
  - M I N G Y → MINGY
  - M I N K S → MINKS
  - M I N C E → but C is eliminated
- If N is in position 5: M _ _ _ N  
  - M I L K N → but no such word
  - M I D G N → no
  - M I S S N → no
  - M I S I N → no

Best candidates seem to be M I N _ _ words using remaining letters. Let's check:
- M I N K S: uses M, I, N, K, S → all allowed letters
- M I N G Y: uses M, I, N, G, Y → all allowed

""MINES"" would use E, but E is eliminated. ""MINKS"" is a valid word (plural of mink). ""MINGY"" is also valid but less common.

I'll choose MINKS as it seems more common.

But wait, K and S are allowed, and N is in position 3 (which hasn't been ruled out).

Actually, looking again, N was marked (-) in both guesses, which only means it's not in the positions it appeared (position 4 in both cases). So it can be in 2, 3, or 5.

- M I N G Y: uses M, I, N, G, Y → all allowed

""MINES"" would use E, but E is eliminated. ""MINKS"" is a valid word (plural of mink). ""MINGY"" is also valid but less common.

I'll choose MINKS as it seems more common.

But wait, K and S are allowed, and N is in position 3 (which hasn't been ruled out).

Actually, looking again, N was marked (-) in both guesses, which only means it's not in the positions it appeared (position 4 in both cases). So it can be in 2, 3, or 5.

Another good option is MINDS:
- M I N D S: M(✓), I, N, D, S → all allowed letters
- N is in position 3, which is allowed

MINES is invalid (E eliminated). MINTS is invalid (T eliminated).

I think MINDS is a solid choice.

Let me verify:
- M I N D S
- Starts with M (✓ from feedback)
- Contains N in position 3 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters: M, I, N, D, S

Current known facts
- Fixed pattern so far: M I N _ _  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, E, O, U, T, D, S

Remaining consonants we can still use: B, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels we can still use: none left (only I has appeared and is placed)

So the last two letters must both be from the remaining consonants, and they must form a valid 5-letter word starting with MIN.

Possible endings (2 letters from B, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y):
- MIN + KY → MINKY – valid  
- MIN + GF → MINGF – invalid  
- MIN + BH → MINBH – invalid  
- MIN + LF → MINLF – invalid

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced word with:

- No repeating letters, giving maximum coverage

2. The letter N is present somewhere other than position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains N (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E
- Uses other common letters

Let's think of common consonants and vowels left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate would be ""MOUNT"":
- Contains N (position 3)
- Does not contain C, R, A, E
- Uses common letters M, O, U, N, T

Other possibilities could be ""BONUS"" or ""DONUT"", but ""MOUNT"" seems like a strong choice with common letters.

I'll go with MOUNT.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, W, Y  
Remaining common vowels: I  

We are looking for a word that starts with M, uses N in position 2, 3, or 5, and uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- M N _ _ _  (but N is not in position 2 from the feedback, because in MOUNT N was in position 4 and marked (-) so it can't be position 2)
Wait, no: N was marked (-) in both positions 4 (CRANE) and 4 (MOUNT), so it can still be in positions 2, 3, or 5. Actually, in MOUNT N was in position 4 and marked (-), so N is confirmed NOT in position 4, but could be in 2, 3, or 5.

Let me think of valid words:
- If N is in position 2: M N _ _ _ → MN??? but few common 5-letter words start MN
- If N is in position 3: M _ N _ _  
  - M I N D Y → MINDY (but Y is allowed)
  - M I N G Y → MINGY
  - M I N K S → MINKS
  - M I N C E → but C is eliminated
- If N is in position 5: M _ _ _ N  
  - M I L K N → but no such word
  - M I D G N → no
  - M I S S N → no
  - M I S I N → no

Best candidates seem to be M I N _ _ words using remaining letters. Let's check:
- M I N K S: uses M, I, N, K, S → all allowed letters
- M I N G Y: uses M, I, N, G, Y → all allowed

""MINES"" would use E, but E is eliminated. ""MINKS"" is a valid word (plural of mink). ""MINGY"" is also valid but less common.

I'll choose MINKS as it seems more common.

But wait, K and S are allowed, and N is in position 3 (which hasn't been ruled out).

Actually, looking again, N was marked (-) in both guesses, which only means it's not in the positions it appeared (position 4 in both cases). So it can be in 2, 3, or 5.

Another good option is MINDS:

MINES is invalid (E eliminated). MINTS is invalid (T eliminated).

I think MINDS is a solid choice.

Current confirmed positions:  
M I N _ _  

Eliminated letters (across all guesses):  
C, R, A, E, O, U, T, D, S, K, Y  

Remaining consonants that have never appeared:  
B, F, G, H, L, P, V, W  

We need two consonants from this set to complete M I N _ _.  
Possible combinations (only those that make real words):

- MIN + GH → MINGH (invalid)  
- MIN + GL → MINGL (invalid)  
- MIN + BL → MINBL (invalid)  
- MIN + FL → MINFL (invalid)  
- MIN + GL → MINGL (invalid)  
- MIN + HL → MINHL (invalid)  
- MIN + LV → MINLV (invalid)  
- MIN + LW → MINLW (invalid)  
- MIN + PH → MINPH (invalid)  
- MIN + GV → MINGV (invalid)  
- MIN + GW → MINGW (invalid)  

Unfortunately, none of the remaining consonant pairs from the allowed set form a standard English word after MIN.  
The only remaining possibility is that the word ends with a double consonant or uses a letter I may have missed. Rechecking: the only remaining candidate that fits is “M IN GL” but that’s 4 letters.  

However, one valid English word starting with “MIN” using only remaining consonants is:

- MIN + GL → “MINGL” is invalid, but “MINGL” is a typo. The actual word is “MINGLE”, but that is 6 letters.  

Upon closer inspection, the only valid 5-letter word starting with M I N and using the remaining consonants is **MINGL** — which does not exist.  

Therefore, I must have made an error. Let me recheck the remaining consonants and vowels.  
Vowels: we have used I. All other vowels (A, E, O, U) are eliminated. Thus the last two letters must be consonants.  

Realizing the oversight: the only remaining valid 5-letter English word fitting M I N _ _ with only allowed consonants is **MINGY** — but Y was already eliminated.  

Rechecking: Y was eliminated in Guess 4.  

Next possible: **MINCY** – C eliminated.  
**MINFY** – Y eliminated.  
**MINGY** – G and Y: Y eliminated.  

It appears no valid 5-letter word remains. The only possible oversight is **MINIM**, but I and M are already used.  

Upon rechecking the eliminated letters: K and Y were eliminated in Guess 4, so the next consonant set is B, F, G, H, L, P, V, W.  

The correct valid word is **MINIM**, but M is already used in position 1 and 5.  

Realization: The word must be **MINIM**, despite the repeated M, as it is the only remaining valid 5-letter word starting with MIN.  

But the rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless they are eliminated. M is confirmed in position 1 and allowed elsewhere.  

Rechecking: **MINIM** is a valid English word. It fits M I N _ _ and uses only allowed letters (I, M already confirmed).  

Therefore, the next guess is **MINIM**.
