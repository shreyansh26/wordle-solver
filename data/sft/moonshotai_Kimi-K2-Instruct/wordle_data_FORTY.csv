For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains commonly used letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us a high chance of identifying which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E - also covering five common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant mix.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word
- R (-) → in the word but not at position 2
- O (-) → in the word but not at position 3
- S (x) → not in the word
- E (x) → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, S, or E at all.
- Does contain R and O, but R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.

Next rough rules:
1. Include both R and O.
2. Do not place R in position 2 or O in position 3.
3. Exclude A, S, E entirely.
4. Pick two more letters among high-frequency ones that are still allowed (T, N, L, I, etc.).

A word like “FRONT” would re-use O and R while adding F, N, T. However, it would place O in position 3, which is forbidden by the feedback.  
Another candidate: “TROCK” – but C is less common and K is not present.  
Better: “NORTH” – places O in position 2 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed), and adds N, T, H.  
Also good: “COURT” – but C is lower frequency and U is mid-frequency.  
Let’s try “NORTH” since it keeps R and O and introduces N, T, H.

Common words fitting this pattern:

- P O R T ? → ""PORTY"" (valid but rare)
- W O R T ? → ""WORTS"" (invalid, S is ruled out)

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- PORTY
- DORTY  
- WORTY (but WORTS is invalid, WORTY might not exist)

""PORTY"" exists as a slang term for ""portable"" or ""port city"".  
Another option is ""MORTY"" but M is not ruled out, and it's a valid name.

However, a more common word is ""FORTY"" but F is allowed and Y is allowed. We haven't used F or Y yet, and ""FORTY"" fits perfectly.

Check:
- F: not ruled out
- O: confirmed at position 2

- Y: not ruled out

Thus, the most plausible guess is ""FORTY"".
