For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters while avoiding rare ones like Q, X, or Z. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), which should give good feedback about letter positions and presence.

From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
2. It DOES contain R, but not in position 2.
3. It has A in position 3 (fixed).

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

We need words with A in the 3rd position, containing R but not C, N, or E. Possible candidates:
- DRAMA (but has M, which isn't ruled out)
- GRASP (but has P, and S isn't ruled out)
- TRAMP (but has M and P)

Looking for common words fitting this, ""DRAPE"" has E (ruled out), ""GRADE"" has E (ruled out). ""GRAPE"" also has E.

""GRASP"" seems good: G, R, A, S, P. It doesn't use any excluded letters (C, N, E), has R not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, which violates the feedback). Oops, R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink. R must not be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is A, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- RATIO (but has I and O, and T isn't ruled out)
- RAVEN (has E and N, ruled out)
- RADAR (has D, which isn't ruled out)

""RADAR"" is a palindrome, but fits: R _ A _ R (positions 1 and 5). This uses R in positions 1 and 5, neither of which is position 2, satisfying the feedback.

But is RADAR valid? Yes. However, it's very R-heavy, which might not be optimal. Another option is ""MARRY"" - but has E (no) and Y (not ruled out).

""BRAVO"" - has B, R, A, V, O. B isn't ruled out, and R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So BRAVO is invalid.

""DRAFF"" - has D, R, A, F, F. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""FRACK"" - has C and K.

""GRAIL"" - has G, R, A, I, L. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""WRATH"" - has W, R, A, T, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

It appears that many common words with A in position 3 also have R in position 2, which is invalid. After careful consideration, a word like ""MADAM"" fits: M, A, D, A, M. But it has two M's and two A's, which might not be ideal.

Another is ""RADAR"" - R, A, D, A, R. Here R is in positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2, satisfying the feedback. It uses D, which hasn't been ruled out.

""RADAR"" has:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- No C, N, or E
- Common letters D and A

This seems to be the best available given the constraints.
</think>

From the first guess feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word
- A is correctly positioned in the middle (position 3)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5

It appears that many common words with A in position 3 also have R in position 2, which is invalid. After careful consideration, a word like ""MADAM"" fits: M, A, D, A, M. But it has two M's and two A's, which might not be ideal.

Another is ""RADAR"" - R, A, D, A, R. Here R is in positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2, satisfying the feedback. It uses D, which hasn't been ruled out.

""RADAR"" has:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- No C, N, or E
- Common letters D and A

This seems to be the best available given the constraints.From the first guess feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word
- A is correctly positioned in the middle (position 3)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5

Looking for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2, ""RADAR"" fits perfectly:
- R _ A _ R
- No excluded letters (C, N, E)
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)",Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,3,START,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters while avoiding rare ones like Q, X, or Z. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), which should give good feedback about letter positions and presence.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
2. It DOES contain R, but not in position 2.
3. It has A in position 3 (fixed).

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

We need words with A in the 3rd position, containing R but not C, N, or E. Possible candidates:
- DRAMA (but has M, which isn't ruled out)
- GRASP (but has P, and S isn't ruled out)
- TRAMP (but has M and P)

Looking for common words fitting this, ""DRAPE"" has E (ruled out), ""GRADE"" has E (ruled out). ""GRAPE"" also has E.

""GRASP"" seems good: G, R, A, S, P. It doesn't use any excluded letters (C, N, E), has R not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, which violates the feedback). Oops, R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink. R must not be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is A, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- RATIO (but has I and O, and T isn't ruled out)
- RAVEN (has E and N, ruled out)
- RADAR (has D, which isn't ruled out)

""RADAR"" is a palindrome, but fits: R _ A _ R (positions 1 and 5). This uses R in positions 1 and 5, neither of which is position 2, satisfying the feedback.

But is RADAR valid? Yes. However, it's very R-heavy, which might not be optimal. Another option is ""MARRY"" - but has E (no) and Y (not ruled out).

""BRAVO"" - has B, R, A, V, O. B isn't ruled out, and R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So BRAVO is invalid.

""DRAFF"" - has D, R, A, F, F. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""FRACK"" - has C and K.

""GRAIL"" - has G, R, A, I, L. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""PRANK"" - has N and K.

""TRASH"" - has T, R, A, S, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""WRATH"" - has W, R, A, T, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""GRAIN"" - has N.

""GRASP"" - as before, R in position 2.

Hmm, seems R in position 2 is common. Let me search for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2.

""FARAD"" - F, A, R, A, D. R is in position 3, but position 3 is A. So invalid.

""HARAS"" - H, A, R, A, S. R in position 3 - but position 3 is A. Doesn't fit.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- A is locked in position 3.
- C, N, E are absent.
- R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.

Guess 2: RADAR → R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
Extra info:
- R is also NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because every R in RADAR received “-”).
- The only remaining possible position for R is position 2 … but the first guess already told us R is NOT in position 2.
- **Therefore R cannot actually be in the word at all.** The two “-” results together imply R is not in any slot. (This sometimes happens when a letter appears multiple times and the single hidden copy is already “used up” in the feedback.)

So:  
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _  
- Letters known absent: C, N, E, R, D  
- Letters known present: A (only in position 3)

We now need a 5-letter word with A in position 3, and none of C, N, E, R, D. We want fresh consonants to maximize information.

Common consonants still allowed: S, T, L, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate using several new consonants:  
“PLASM” – P, L, A, S, M  
All letters unused so far and none are forbidden.

Another check:  
- P, L, S, M are all allowed.  
- No duplicate letters that might confuse feedback.  
- Uses common consonants.

So I will guess PLASM.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters while avoiding rare ones like Q, X, or Z. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), which should give good feedback about letter positions and presence.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
2. It DOES contain R, but not in position 2.
3. It has A in position 3 (fixed).

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

We need words with A in the 3rd position, containing R but not C, N, or E. Possible candidates:
- DRAMA (but has M, which isn't ruled out)
- GRASP (but has P, and S isn't ruled out)
- TRAMP (but has M and P)

Looking for common words fitting this, ""DRAPE"" has E (ruled out), ""GRADE"" has E (ruled out). ""GRAPE"" also has E.

""GRASP"" seems good: G, R, A, S, P. It doesn't use any excluded letters (C, N, E), has R not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, which violates the feedback). Oops, R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink. R must not be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is A, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- RATIO (but has I and O, and T isn't ruled out)
- RAVEN (has E and N, ruled out)
- RADAR (has D, which isn't ruled out)

""RADAR"" is a palindrome, but fits: R _ A _ R (positions 1 and 5). This uses R in positions 1 and 5, neither of which is position 2, satisfying the feedback.

But is RADAR valid? Yes. However, it's very R-heavy, which might not be optimal. Another option is ""MARRY"" - but has E (no) and Y (not ruled out).

""BRAVO"" - has B, R, A, V, O. B isn't ruled out, and R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So BRAVO is invalid.

""DRAFF"" - has D, R, A, F, F. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""FRACK"" - has C and K.

""GRAIL"" - has G, R, A, I, L. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""PRANK"" - has N and K.

""TRASH"" - has T, R, A, S, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""WRATH"" - has W, R, A, T, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""CRAZY"" - has C and Z.

""GRAIN"" - has N.

""GRASP"" - as before, R in position 2.

Hmm, seems R in position 2 is common. Let me search for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2.

""FARAD"" - F, A, R, A, D. R is in position 3, but position 3 is A. So invalid.

""HARAS"" - H, A, R, A, S. R in position 3 - but position 3 is A. Doesn't fit.

It appears that many common words with A in position 3 also have R in position 2, which is invalid. After careful consideration, a word like ""MADAM"" fits: M, A, D, A, M. But it has two M's and two A's, which might not be ideal.

Another is ""RADAR"" - R, A, D, A, R. Here R is in positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2, satisfying the feedback. It uses D, which hasn't been ruled out.

""RADAR"" has:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- No C, N, or E
- Common letters D and A

This seems to be the best available given the constraints.From the first guess feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word
- A is correctly positioned in the middle (position 3)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5

Looking for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2, ""RADAR"" fits perfectly:
- R _ A _ R
- No excluded letters (C, N, E)
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)

- R is also NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because every R in RADAR received “-”).
- The only remaining possible position for R is position 2 … but the first guess already told us R is NOT in position 2.
- **Therefore R cannot actually be in the word at all.** The two “-” results together imply R is not in any slot. (This sometimes happens when a letter appears multiple times and the single hidden copy is already “used up” in the feedback.)

So:  
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _  
- Letters known absent: C, N, E, R, D  
- Letters known present: A (only in position 3)

We now need a 5-letter word with A in position 3, and none of C, N, E, R, D. We want fresh consonants to maximize information.

Common consonants still allowed: S, T, L, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate using several new consonants:  
“PLASM” – P, L, A, S, M  
All letters unused so far and none are forbidden.

Another check:  
- P, L, S, M are all allowed.  
- No duplicate letters that might confuse feedback.  
- Uses common consonants.

So I will guess PLASM.

Step-by-step consolidation of all feedback:

1. Positional locks
   - 3rd letter is A (from CRANE and PLASM).

2. Letters proven absent
   From CRANE: C, N, E  
   From RADAR: D  
   From PLASM: P, L, M  

   So the word contains none of C, N, E, D, P, L, M.

3. Letters still uncertain
   - S showed “-” in PLASM → S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R showed “-” in both CRANE and RADAR → combined with the earlier deduction, R is actually **not** in the word at all (no valid slot left).
   - Therefore the only remaining candidate for an extra letter (besides A) is S.

4. Possible positions for S
   It cannot be in position 4 (PLASM feedback) and positions 1, 2, 5 are open.

5. Viable vowels/consonants left
   Allowed consonants now: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Allowed vowels: A (already fixed), I, O, U (no restriction placed yet).

6. Building the pattern
   Pattern: _ _ A _ _  
   Must contain S somewhere (1, 2, or 5) and can use other allowed letters.

7. Good next probe
   We want a word that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh consonants/vowels.
   “VASTY” – but Y is rare; let’s avoid rare letters.
   “GASTS” – but double S is possible but not ideal.
   “BAITS” – I is fresh, S at end, T is common.
   “WAIST” – W, I, S, T are all fresh and common.

   “WAIST” uses: W(1) A(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but A must be in 3, so it’s W(1) A(3) I(2) S(4) T(5) → invalid.

   Correct pattern-filler: S must be 1, 2, or 5; I is a new vowel.
   “SAINT” – but N is banned.
   “WAIFS” – F is new, but A is in 2 not 3.
   “FAUST” – F, U, S, T.  A is in 3.  All letters allowed.  Great coverage.

   Check FAUST: F, A, U, S, T – none are banned, S is in 4 (allowed), U is a new vowel.

Therefore FAUST is a strong next probe.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters while avoiding rare ones like Q, X, or Z. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), which should give good feedback about letter positions and presence.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
2. It DOES contain R, but not in position 2.
3. It has A in position 3 (fixed).

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

We need words with A in the 3rd position, containing R but not C, N, or E. Possible candidates:
- DRAMA (but has M, which isn't ruled out)
- GRASP (but has P, and S isn't ruled out)
- TRAMP (but has M and P)

Looking for common words fitting this, ""DRAPE"" has E (ruled out), ""GRADE"" has E (ruled out). ""GRAPE"" also has E.

""GRASP"" seems good: G, R, A, S, P. It doesn't use any excluded letters (C, N, E), has R not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, which violates the feedback). Oops, R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink. R must not be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is A, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- RATIO (but has I and O, and T isn't ruled out)
- RAVEN (has E and N, ruled out)
- RADAR (has D, which isn't ruled out)

""RADAR"" is a palindrome, but fits: R _ A _ R (positions 1 and 5). This uses R in positions 1 and 5, neither of which is position 2, satisfying the feedback.

But is RADAR valid? Yes. However, it's very R-heavy, which might not be optimal. Another option is ""MARRY"" - but has E (no) and Y (not ruled out).

""BRAVO"" - has B, R, A, V, O. B isn't ruled out, and R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So BRAVO is invalid.

It appears that many common words with A in position 3 also have R in position 2, which is invalid. After careful consideration, a word like ""MADAM"" fits: M, A, D, A, M. But it has two M's and two A's, which might not be ideal.

Another is ""RADAR"" - R, A, D, A, R. Here R is in positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2, satisfying the feedback. It uses D, which hasn't been ruled out.

""RADAR"" has:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- No C, N, or E
- Common letters D and A

This seems to be the best available given the constraints.From the first guess feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word
- A is correctly positioned in the middle (position 3)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5

Looking for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2, ""RADAR"" fits perfectly:
- R _ A _ R
- No excluded letters (C, N, E)
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)

<guess>RADAR</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- A is locked in position 3.
- C, N, E are absent.
- R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.

Guess 2: RADAR → R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
Extra info:
- R is also NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because every R in RADAR received “-”).
- The only remaining possible position for R is position 2 … but the first guess already told us R is NOT in position 2.
- **Therefore R cannot actually be in the word at all.** The two “-” results together imply R is not in any slot. (This sometimes happens when a letter appears multiple times and the single hidden copy is already “used up” in the feedback.)

So:  
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _  
- Letters known absent: C, N, E, R, D  
- Letters known present: A (only in position 3)

We now need a 5-letter word with A in position 3, and none of C, N, E, R, D. We want fresh consonants to maximize information.

Common consonants still allowed: S, T, L, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate using several new consonants:  
“PLASM” – P, L, A, S, M  
All letters unused so far and none are forbidden.

Another check:  
- P, L, S, M are all allowed.  
- No duplicate letters that might confuse feedback.  
- Uses common consonants.

So I will guess PLASM.

<guess>PLASM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
Guess 3: PLASM -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) S(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step consolidation of all feedback:

1. Positional locks
   - 3rd letter is A (from CRANE and PLASM).

2. Letters proven absent
   From CRANE: C, N, E  
   From RADAR: D  
   From PLASM: P, L, M  

   So the word contains none of C, N, E, D, P, L, M.

3. Letters still uncertain
   - S showed “-” in PLASM → S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R showed “-” in both CRANE and RADAR → combined with the earlier deduction, R is actually **not** in the word at all (no valid slot left).
   - Therefore the only remaining candidate for an extra letter (besides A) is S.

4. Possible positions for S
   It cannot be in position 4 (PLASM feedback) and positions 1, 2, 5 are open.

5. Viable vowels/consonants left
   Allowed consonants now: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Allowed vowels: A (already fixed), I, O, U (no restriction placed yet).

6. Building the pattern
   Pattern: _ _ A _ _  
   Must contain S somewhere (1, 2, or 5) and can use other allowed letters.

7. Good next probe
   We want a word that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh consonants/vowels.
   “VASTY” – but Y is rare; let’s avoid rare letters.
   “GASTS” – but double S is possible but not ideal.
   “BAITS” – I is fresh, S at end, T is common.
   “WAIST” – W, I, S, T are all fresh and common.

   “WAIST” uses: W(1) A(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but A must be in 3, so it’s W(1) A(3) I(2) S(4) T(5) → invalid.

   Correct pattern-filler: S must be 1, 2, or 5; I is a new vowel.
   “SAINT” – but N is banned.
   “WAIFS” – F is new, but A is in 2 not 3.
   “FAUST” – F, U, S, T.  A is in 3.  All letters allowed.  Great coverage.

   Check FAUST: F, A, U, S, T – none are banned, S is in 4 (allowed), U is a new vowel.

Therefore FAUST is a strong next probe.

Consolidating everything the feedback has taught us.

Positional locks:
- A must be in position 3.

Letters known NOT in the word (x in any position):
C, N, E, D, P, L, M, F, U, R (ruled-out earlier)

Letters whose status:
- S: twice given “-” (PLASM and FAUST).  That means S exists but is NOT in positions 4 or 5.  The only remaining slots are 1 or 2.
- T: given “✓” at position 5 in FAUST, so T is locked at the end.

Current pattern: _ _ A _ T  
with S required somewhere in the first two positions.

Allowed consonants now: B, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels: I, O (A already used)

We need a word that
– has A in 3rd, T in 5th  
– has S in 1st or 2nd  
– uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:
S _ A _ T  or  _ S A _ T

Looking for common words:
- S _ A _ T:  SWATH, SHALT, SLANT (L banned), SPART (P banned) → only SWATH & SHALT possible.
- _ S A _ T:  ASSET (E banned), BSAIT (invalid), GSAIT (invalid), etc. — no common options.

Between SWATH and SHALT:
- SWATH: uses W, H – both still allowed.
- SHALT: uses H, L – but L is banned.  So SHALT is invalid.

Thus the only viable candidate is SWATH.

Check SWATH:
S W A T H
- A is 3rd ✓
- T is 5th ✓
- S in 1st (allowed)
- W and H are fresh, allowed letters.
No banned letters appear.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Popular starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These words cover common letters while avoiding rare ones like Q, X, or Z. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, R, N), which should give good feedback about letter positions and presence.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- N and E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, N, or E.
2. It DOES contain R, but not in position 2.
3. It has A in position 3 (fixed).

Structure so far: _ _ A _ _

We need words with A in the 3rd position, containing R but not C, N, or E. Possible candidates:
- DRAMA (but has M, which isn't ruled out)
- GRASP (but has P, and S isn't ruled out)
- TRAMP (but has M and P)

Looking for common words fitting this, ""DRAPE"" has E (ruled out), ""GRADE"" has E (ruled out). ""GRAPE"" also has E.

""GRASP"" seems good: G, R, A, S, P. It doesn't use any excluded letters (C, N, E), has R not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, which violates the feedback). Oops, R can't be in position 2.

Let me rethink. R must not be in position 2, so R must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is A, so R must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- RATIO (but has I and O, and T isn't ruled out)
- RAVEN (has E and N, ruled out)
- RADAR (has D, which isn't ruled out)

""RADAR"" is a palindrome, but fits: R _ A _ R (positions 1 and 5). This uses R in positions 1 and 5, neither of which is position 2, satisfying the feedback.

But is RADAR valid? Yes. However, it's very R-heavy, which might not be optimal. Another option is ""MARRY"" - but has E (no) and Y (not ruled out).

""BRAVO"" - has B, R, A, V, O. B isn't ruled out, and R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2). So BRAVO is invalid.

""DRAFF"" - has D, R, A, F, F. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""FRACK"" - has C and K.

""GRAIL"" - has G, R, A, I, L. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""PRANK"" - has N and K.

""TRASH"" - has T, R, A, S, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

""WRATH"" - has W, R, A, T, H. R is in position 2 - invalid.

It appears that many common words with A in position 3 also have R in position 2, which is invalid. After careful consideration, a word like ""MADAM"" fits: M, A, D, A, M. But it has two M's and two A's, which might not be ideal.

Another is ""RADAR"" - R, A, D, A, R. Here R is in positions 1 and 5, neither is position 2, satisfying the feedback. It uses D, which hasn't been ruled out.

""RADAR"" has:
- R in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- No C, N, or E
- Common letters D and A

This seems to be the best available given the constraints.From the first guess feedback:
- C, N, E are not in the word
- A is correctly positioned in the middle (position 3)
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- So R must be in positions 1, 4, or 5

Looking for words with A in position 3 and R not in position 2, ""RADAR"" fits perfectly:
- R _ A _ R
- No excluded letters (C, N, E)
- R appears in positions 1 and 5 (not 2)

<guess>RADAR</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
- A is locked in position 3.
- C, N, E are absent.
- R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.

Guess 2: RADAR → R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
Extra info:
- R is also NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because every R in RADAR received “-”).
- The only remaining possible position for R is position 2 … but the first guess already told us R is NOT in position 2.
- **Therefore R cannot actually be in the word at all.** The two “-” results together imply R is not in any slot. (This sometimes happens when a letter appears multiple times and the single hidden copy is already “used up” in the feedback.)

So:  
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _  
- Letters known absent: C, N, E, R, D  
- Letters known present: A (only in position 3)

We now need a 5-letter word with A in position 3, and none of C, N, E, R, D. We want fresh consonants to maximize information.

Common consonants still allowed: S, T, L, M, P, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate using several new consonants:  
“PLASM” – P, L, A, S, M  
All letters unused so far and none are forbidden.

Another check:  
- P, L, S, M are all allowed.  
- No duplicate letters that might confuse feedback.  
- Uses common consonants.

So I will guess PLASM.

<guess>PLASM</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(-) R(-)
Guess 3: PLASM -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(✓) S(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step consolidation of all feedback:

1. Positional locks
   - 3rd letter is A (from CRANE and PLASM).

2. Letters proven absent
   From CRANE: C, N, E  
   From RADAR: D  
   From PLASM: P, L, M  

   So the word contains none of C, N, E, D, P, L, M.

3. Letters still uncertain
   - S showed “-” in PLASM → S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R showed “-” in both CRANE and RADAR → combined with the earlier deduction, R is actually **not** in the word at all (no valid slot left).
   - Therefore the only remaining candidate for an extra letter (besides A) is S.

4. Possible positions for S
   It cannot be in position 4 (PLASM feedback) and positions 1, 2, 5 are open.

5. Viable vowels/consonants left
   Allowed consonants now: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Allowed vowels: A (already fixed), I, O, U (no restriction placed yet).

6. Building the pattern
   Pattern: _ _ A _ _  
   Must contain S somewhere (1, 2, or 5) and can use other allowed letters.

7. Good next probe
   We want a word that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh consonants/vowels.
   “VASTY” – but Y is rare; let’s avoid rare letters.
   “GASTS” – but double S is possible but not ideal.
   “BAITS” – I is fresh, S at end, T is common.
   “WAIST” – W, I, S, T are all fresh and common.

   “WAIST” uses: W(1) A(2) I(3) S(4) T(5) – but A must be in 3, so it’s W(1) A(3) I(2) S(4) T(5) → invalid.

   Correct pattern-filler: S must be 1, 2, or 5; I is a new vowel.
   “SAINT” – but N is banned.
   “WAIFS” – F is new, but A is in 2 not 3.
   “FAUST” – F, U, S, T.  A is in 3.  All letters allowed.  Great coverage.

   Check FAUST: F, A, U, S, T – none are banned, S is in 4 (allowed), U is a new vowel.

Therefore FAUST is a strong next probe.

Positional locks:
- A must be in position 3.

Letters known NOT in the word (x in any position):
C, N, E, D, P, L, M, F, U, R (ruled-out earlier)

Letters whose status:
- S: twice given “-” (PLASM and FAUST).  That means S exists but is NOT in positions 4 or 5.  The only remaining slots are 1 or 2.
- T: given “✓” at position 5 in FAUST, so T is locked at the end.

Current pattern: _ _ A _ T  
with S required somewhere in the first two positions.

Allowed consonants now: B, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels: I, O (A already used)

We need a word that
– has A in 3rd, T in 5th  
– has S in 1st or 2nd  
– uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:
S _ A _ T  or  _ S A _ T

Looking for common words:
- S _ A _ T:  SWATH, SHALT, SLANT (L banned), SPART (P banned) → only SWATH & SHALT possible.
- _ S A _ T:  ASSET (E banned), BSAIT (invalid), GSAIT (invalid), etc. — no common options.

Between SWATH and SHALT:
- SWATH: uses W, H – both still allowed.
- SHALT: uses H, L – but L is banned.  So SHALT is invalid.

Thus the only viable candidate is SWATH.

Check SWATH:
S W A T H
- A is 3rd ✓
- T is 5th ✓
- S in 1st (allowed)
- W and H are fresh, allowed letters.
No banned letters appear.

Step 1 – Lock down the confirmed letters from SWATH  
- Position 1: S (✓)  
- Position 3: A (✓)  
- Position 5: T (✓)  

So the skeleton is: S _ A _ T

Step 2 – Collect all letters already ruled out (x in any slot)  
C, N, E, D, P, L, M, F, U, R, W, H

Step 3 – Determine remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 4  
Allowed consonants: B, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Allowed vowels: I, O (A already used)

Step 4 – Generate all legal 5-letter words fitting S _ A _ T with only allowed letters  
- S B A I T  → SBAIT  (invalid, not a word)  
- S G A I T  → SGAIT  (invalid)  
- S J A I T  → SJAIT  (invalid)  
- S K A I T  → SKAIT  (obsolete variant of “skate”, usually 5 letters)  
- S V A I T  → SVAIT  (invalid)  
- S G A O T  → SGAOT  (invalid)  
- S B A O T  → SBAOT  (invalid)  
- S K A O T  → SKAOT  (invalid)  
- S Y A I T  → SYAIT  (invalid)  
- S Y A O T  → SYAOT  (invalid)  

The only remotely plausible candidate that shows up in standard word lists is  
SKAIT – a variant spelling of “skate” used in Scots/Old English sources.  
All letters (S, K, A, I, T) are currently allowed.

Therefore, the next logical and legal guess is SKAIT.
