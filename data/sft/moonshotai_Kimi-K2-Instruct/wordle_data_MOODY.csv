For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All common vowels: A, E
This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away or ruling out many possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That tells us:

• No S, L, A, T, or E appears anywhere.  
• The word must be built only from the remaining 21 letters.  
• Common high-frequency consonants we have not yet tested include R, N, C, D, P, M, H, K, B, F, G, etc.  
• Among vowels, we still have I, O, U left to try.

A good second guess should cover several new popular letters—especially some of the remaining vowels and consonants—to maximize information per guess.  
The word “ROUND” hits four fresh high-frequency consonants (R, N, D) plus the remaining common vowel O and the still-untested vowel U. This should quickly narrow the candidate set.

(Other strong alternatives like “CHORD” or “PROUD” would also work, but “ROUND” keeps all letters previously ruled out out of play.)

So far we know:

- Letters already ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters known to be in the word (but not yet in the right spots):
  – O is somewhere (position 2 ✓)  
  – D is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word therefore contains at least O and D, and can only be built from the remaining 15 letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and D.

Good next-step word features:
1. Keep O in a new position (not position 2).
2. Include D but not in position 5.
3. Use several as-yet-untested consonants to maximize information.

Candidate pattern: _ O _ _ _  with D not in 5.

A concrete word that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- It places O in position 2 (already known) — we’ll move O to another position next time if needed.
- It has D in position 1 (new spot, allowed).
- It introduces G and H, two high-frequency letters we haven’t tested.
- All letters are from the still-possible set.

Another acceptable alternative could be “DOPING”, but that’s 6 letters. “DOGMY” (with Y) is also okay but less common. “DOUGH” is common and informative.

Therefore, let’s go with DOUGH.

We now have three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
2. ROUND → O is somewhere in the word (✓), D is in the word but not in position 5 (-), and R, U, N are absent.
3. DOUGH → O is still somewhere (✓), D is in the word but not in position 1 (-). U, G, H are absent.

Consolidated knowledge:

- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, G, H  
- Present letters: O (position unknown), D (not pos 1 or 5)  
- Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and D.

Thus the word must contain both O and D, and can only use letters from the available set above.  
The positions for D are 2, 3, or 4 (since D is not in 1 or 5).  
O can be in any position except those we’ve tested so far (positions 2 and 3 in previous guesses), but more importantly we just need to place it somewhere new.

We also want to try consonants that are still possible: C, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s construct a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and D
- Places D in 2, 3, or 4
- Uses new consonants from the remaining set, ideally common ones
- Does not reuse any ruled-out letters

Candidate words:
- VODIC – but “VODIC” isn’t a common English word.
- DOWDY – contains D twice (inefficient) and Y is OK but we only need one D.
- COWDY – uses C and W, but again “COWDY” isn’t common.
- PODIC – not common either.

A better common word is “PODIC” (obsolete variant of PODIATRIC) but still obscure.

Better yet, “DOWDY” is valid but repeats D. “DOPIC” not valid.

Let’s look at “DOCKY” – not a word.

Another clean candidate: “DOXY” (only 4 letters).

We need exactly 5 letters, common English word.

“DOING” – contains G (already ruled out).

“DOWEL” – contains L (ruled out).

“DOWRY” – uses R (ruled out).

“DOJOS” – contains S (ruled out).

“DOCKS” – contains S (ruled out).

“DOOFY” – contains F, O, D, Y – valid word.

That’s a common English word: “DOOFY” (slang for silly). It has:
- D in position 2 (new spot)
- O in position 3 (new spot)
- F and Y untested consonants
All letters are from the allowed set.

Another possibility: “DOILY” – contains I, L (L is ruled out) – invalid.

“DOWDY” – D in position 1 (invalid), D again.

“DOPIC” – invalid.

“DOCKY” – invalid.

Thus “DOOFY” seems the best common English word fitting all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,MOODY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All common vowels: A, E
This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away or ruling out many possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That tells us:

• No S, L, A, T, or E appears anywhere.  
• The word must be built only from the remaining 21 letters.  
• Common high-frequency consonants we have not yet tested include R, N, C, D, P, M, H, K, B, F, G, etc.  
• Among vowels, we still have I, O, U left to try.

A good second guess should cover several new popular letters—especially some of the remaining vowels and consonants—to maximize information per guess.  
The word “ROUND” hits four fresh high-frequency consonants (R, N, D) plus the remaining common vowel O and the still-untested vowel U. This should quickly narrow the candidate set.

(Other strong alternatives like “CHORD” or “PROUD” would also work, but “ROUND” keeps all letters previously ruled out out of play.)

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Letters already ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters known to be in the word (but not yet in the right spots):
  – O is somewhere (position 2 ✓)  
  – D is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word therefore contains at least O and D, and can only be built from the remaining 15 letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and D.

Good next-step word features:
1. Keep O in a new position (not position 2).
2. Include D but not in position 5.
3. Use several as-yet-untested consonants to maximize information.

Candidate pattern: _ O _ _ _  with D not in 5.

A concrete word that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- It places O in position 2 (already known) — we’ll move O to another position next time if needed.
- It has D in position 1 (new spot, allowed).
- It introduces G and H, two high-frequency letters we haven’t tested.
- All letters are from the still-possible set.

Another acceptable alternative could be “DOPING”, but that’s 6 letters. “DOGMY” (with Y) is also okay but less common. “DOUGH” is common and informative.

Therefore, let’s go with DOUGH.

- Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and D.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- Common consonants: S, L, T
- All common vowels: A, E
This gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word right away or ruling out many possibilities.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That tells us:

• No S, L, A, T, or E appears anywhere.  
• The word must be built only from the remaining 21 letters.  
• Common high-frequency consonants we have not yet tested include R, N, C, D, P, M, H, K, B, F, G, etc.  
• Among vowels, we still have I, O, U left to try.

A good second guess should cover several new popular letters—especially some of the remaining vowels and consonants—to maximize information per guess.  
The word “ROUND” hits four fresh high-frequency consonants (R, N, D) plus the remaining common vowel O and the still-untested vowel U. This should quickly narrow the candidate set.

(Other strong alternatives like “CHORD” or “PROUD” would also work, but “ROUND” keeps all letters previously ruled out out of play.)

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:

- Letters already ruled out completely: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N  
- Letters known to be in the word (but not yet in the right spots):
  – O is somewhere (position 2 ✓)  
  – D is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word therefore contains at least O and D, and can only be built from the remaining 15 letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O and D.

Good next-step word features:
1. Keep O in a new position (not position 2).
2. Include D but not in position 5.
3. Use several as-yet-untested consonants to maximize information.

Candidate pattern: _ O _ _ _  with D not in 5.

A concrete word that satisfies these constraints is “DOUGH”:
- It places O in position 2 (already known) — we’ll move O to another position next time if needed.
- It has D in position 1 (new spot, allowed).
- It introduces G and H, two high-frequency letters we haven’t tested.
- All letters are from the still-possible set.

Another acceptable alternative could be “DOPING”, but that’s 6 letters. “DOGMY” (with Y) is also okay but less common. “DOUGH” is common and informative.

Therefore, let’s go with DOUGH.

<guess>DOUGH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(-)
Guess 3: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
2. ROUND → O is somewhere in the word (✓), D is in the word but not in position 5 (-), and R, U, N are absent.
3. DOUGH → O is still somewhere (✓), D is in the word but not in position 1 (-). U, G, H are absent.

Consolidated knowledge:

- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, G, H  
- Present letters: O (position unknown), D (not pos 1 or 5)  
- Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and D.

Thus the word must contain both O and D, and can only use letters from the available set above.  
The positions for D are 2, 3, or 4 (since D is not in 1 or 5).  
O can be in any position except those we’ve tested so far (positions 2 and 3 in previous guesses), but more importantly we just need to place it somewhere new.

We also want to try consonants that are still possible: C, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s construct a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O and D
- Places D in 2, 3, or 4
- Uses new consonants from the remaining set, ideally common ones
- Does not reuse any ruled-out letters

Candidate words:
- VODIC – but “VODIC” isn’t a common English word.
- DOWDY – contains D twice (inefficient) and Y is OK but we only need one D.
- COWDY – uses C and W, but again “COWDY” isn’t common.
- PODIC – not common either.

A better common word is “PODIC” (obsolete variant of PODIATRIC) but still obscure.

Better yet, “DOWDY” is valid but repeats D. “DOPIC” not valid.

Let’s look at “DOCKY” – not a word.

Another clean candidate: “DOXY” (only 4 letters).

We need exactly 5 letters, common English word.

“DOING” – contains G (already ruled out).

“DOWEL” – contains L (ruled out).

“DOWRY” – uses R (ruled out).

“DOJOS” – contains S (ruled out).

“DOCKS” – contains S (ruled out).

“DOOFY” – contains F, O, D, Y – valid word.

That’s a common English word: “DOOFY” (slang for silly). It has:
- D in position 2 (new spot)
- O in position 3 (new spot)
- F and Y untested consonants
All letters are from the allowed set.

Another possibility: “DOILY” – contains I, L (L is ruled out) – invalid.

“DOWDY” – D in position 1 (invalid), D again.

“DOPIC” – invalid.

“DOCKY” – invalid.

Thus “DOOFY” seems the best common English word fitting all constraints.

<guess>DOOFY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(x)
Guess 4: DOOFY -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) O(✓) F(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge (after four guesses):

- Completely eliminated letters:  
  S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, G, H, F  

- Present letters (must appear at least once):  
  D  (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5)  
  O  (must appear)  
  Y  (must appear)

- Possible remaining consonants/vowels:  
  B, C, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus D, O, Y.

Positions that D may occupy: 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, 5).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains D, O, Y exactly once each (because feedback shows only single occurrences).  
2. Places D in position 3 or 4.  
3. Uses no eliminated letters.  
4. Is a valid English word.

Start with D in position 3: pattern _ _ D _ _  
We still need O and Y in the remaining three spots, along with one more allowed consonant.

Candidate patterns:
- O D Y _ _  (but needs a 5th letter)  
- _ O D _ Y  (e.g., C O D D Y – but D repeats)  
- _ _ D O Y  (e.g., M I D O Y – invalid)  

Next try D in position 4: pattern _ _ _ D _  
Place O and Y in the remaining four positions (positions 1,2,3,5).

We can try:
- O _ Y D _  (e.g., O B Y D ? – 5th letter must be available)  
- _ O Y D _  (e.g., C O Y D ? – 5th letter must be available)

Word: C O Y D ? – but we need a 5th letter.

Realize we have only three required letters (D, O, Y) and need two more letters from the remaining set, but we want a common word.

Let’s list actual valid 5-letter words that use D, O, Y without any banned letters:

- BOYDS (invalid 5-letter word)  
- COYED (valid word) – letters C, O, Y, E, D.  
  But E is eliminated (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

- COYDO – not a real word.

- DOYEN – contains E (invalid).

- DOYLY – contains L (invalid).

- IDYOT – not a word.

- DOWDY – contains W and repeated D; but D in position 1 (invalid).

- DOXYD – not a word.

- DOPPY – contains P and Y, but P is allowed. However D in position 1 invalid.

- MOPED – contains E (invalid).

- MODDY – D in position 1 invalid.

- MODUS – contains U (invalid).

- MOPPY – missing D.

- POXED – X allowed, E invalid.

- VODKA – contains K and A (A invalid).

- WODDY – D in position 1 invalid.

- WODGY – G invalid.

- YODEL – has E (invalid).

- YODIC – I allowed, C allowed.  Word YODIC is obscure but valid.

- YODLE – E invalid.

Now check YODIC: letters Y, O, D, I, C.  
- Y in position 1 (new)  
- O in position 2 (new)  
- D in position 3 (allowed)  
- I, C both untested and allowed.  

No banned letters.  It meets all constraints.

Hence, YODIC is a valid 5-letter word to test next.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters ruled out (x):  
S L A T E R U N G H F I C

Letters confirmed present at least once:  
O   (must appear)  
D   (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 – so only position 4 is left!)  
Y   (must appear)

Remaining allowed letters:  
B J K M P Q V W X Z, plus O, D, Y.

So the secret word must be of the form:  
_ _ _ D _   (because D is forced to slot 4)  
and must contain both O and Y exactly once each, plus one more letter from {B J K M P Q V W X Z}.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits:  
- Letter 4 = D  
- Contains O somewhere in 1,2,3, or 5  
- Contains Y somewhere in 1,2,3, or 5 (distinct from O)  
- Fifth letter from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
1. O _ Y D _   → need 2nd and 5th letters; but Y would be 3rd and we still need another consonant.  
2. O _ _ D Y   → e.g., O B J D Y – but no such word.  
3. _ O Y D _   → e.g., B O W D Y – invalid (no word).  
4. _ O _ D Y   → e.g., B O K D Y – invalid.  
5. _ _ O D Y   → e.g., M O K D Y – invalid.  
6. Y O _ D _   → e.g., Y O B D ? – 5th letter must fit.  
7. Y _ O D _   → e.g., Y B O D ? – invalid.  
8. _ Y O D _   → e.g., M Y O D ? – invalid.  
9. Y _ _ D O   → e.g., Y M B D O – invalid.

The only real English word that fits is “MYOID” – but I is eliminated.  
“BOYDY” isn’t a word.  
“PYOID” – again I is out.  
“WOBBY” – no D.  
“VOXED” – X allowed but E out.

Wait – a valid common word: “P O D I A” contains A and I (ruled out).  
Next check “B O X Y D” – not a word.  
“B O D Y” plus one letter – “BOYDS” is plural, not 5-letter.  
“B O D Y X” – not a word.  
“C O D Y” – contains C (ruled out).  

Actually, the only remaining valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ D _ with O and Y and allowed consonants is “BODGY” – but G is ruled out.

“J O D Y” plus another letter – “JODYP” not a word.

Realize pattern _ _ _ D _ with letters only from O, Y, and the remaining set.  
We have only one consonant left to fill the fifth slot.  Let’s list valid words:

- B O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  
- M O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  
- W O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  

Reality check: with the constraints, the only plausible common word left is “P O D Y ?” – but we need 5 letters and P, O, D, Y plus another. There is no standard 5-letter word that fits.

But step back: earlier feedback from DOOFY gave “D(-) O(✓) O(✓) F(x) Y(✓)”, which showed TWO O’s present.  
Therefore the secret word has at least two O’s, plus D and Y.

We must fit TWO O’s, plus one D, plus one Y, plus one more consonant (from remaining set) – total 5 letters.

Pattern with D locked in position 4:  
- O O _ D Y   – 3rd letter needed: must be from B, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
  “BOOKY” – K is allowed, B is allowed.  Word “BOOKY” is valid slang for ‘bookkeeper’ and is a common 5-letter word.

It meets all constraints:
- Letters: B, O, O, K, Y  
  – B, K are still allowed  
  – O appears twice (matches DOOFY feedback)  
  – Y appears once  
  – D is in position 4.

Hence the correct next guess is “BOOKY”.

<guess>BOOKY</guess>",BOOKY,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters ruled out (x):  
S L A T E R U N G H F I C

Letters confirmed present at least once:  
O   (must appear)  
D   (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 – so only position 4 is left!)  
Y   (must appear)

Remaining allowed letters:  
B J K M P Q V W X Z, plus O, D, Y.

So the secret word must be of the form:  
_ _ _ D _   (because D is forced to slot 4)  
and must contain both O and Y exactly once each, plus one more letter from {B J K M P Q V W X Z}.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits:  
- Letter 4 = D  
- Contains O somewhere in 1,2,3, or 5  
- Contains Y somewhere in 1,2,3, or 5 (distinct from O)  
- Fifth letter from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
1. O _ Y D _   → need 2nd and 5th letters; but Y would be 3rd and we still need another consonant.  
2. O _ _ D Y   → e.g., O B J D Y – but no such word.  
3. _ O Y D _   → e.g., B O W D Y – invalid (no word).  
4. _ O _ D Y   → e.g., B O K D Y – invalid.  
5. _ _ O D Y   → e.g., M O K D Y – invalid.  
6. Y O _ D _   → e.g., Y O B D ? – 5th letter must fit.  
7. Y _ O D _   → e.g., Y B O D ? – invalid.  
8. _ Y O D _   → e.g., M Y O D ? – invalid.  
9. Y _ _ D O   → e.g., Y M B D O – invalid.

The only real English word that fits is “MYOID” – but I is eliminated.  
“BOYDY” isn’t a word.  
“PYOID” – again I is out.  
“WOBBY” – no D.  
“VOXED” – X allowed but E out.

Wait – a valid common word: “P O D I A” contains A and I (ruled out).  
Next check “B O X Y D” – not a word.  
“B O D Y” plus one letter – “BOYDS” is plural, not 5-letter.  
“B O D Y X” – not a word.  
“C O D Y” – contains C (ruled out).  

Actually, the only remaining valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ D _ with O and Y and allowed consonants is “BODGY” – but G is ruled out.

“J O D Y” plus another letter – “JODYP” not a word.

Realize pattern _ _ _ D _ with letters only from O, Y, and the remaining set.  
We have only one consonant left to fill the fifth slot.  Let’s list valid words:

- B O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  
- M O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  
- W O D Y ? – no 5th letter.  

Reality check: with the constraints, the only plausible common word left is “P O D Y ?” – but we need 5 letters and P, O, D, Y plus another. There is no standard 5-letter word that fits.

But step back: earlier feedback from DOOFY gave “D(-) O(✓) O(✓) F(x) Y(✓)”, which showed TWO O’s present.  
Therefore the secret word has at least two O’s, plus D and Y.

We must fit TWO O’s, plus one D, plus one Y, plus one more consonant (from remaining set) – total 5 letters.

Pattern with D locked in position 4:  
- O O _ D Y   – 3rd letter needed: must be from B, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
  “BOOKY” – K is allowed, B is allowed.  Word “BOOKY” is valid slang for ‘bookkeeper’ and is a common 5-letter word.

It meets all constraints:
- Letters: B, O, O, K, Y  
  – B, K are still allowed  
  – O appears twice (matches DOOFY feedback)  
  – Y appears once  
  – D is in position 4.

Hence the correct next guess is “BOOKY”.",Guess 6: BOOKY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) O(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL
