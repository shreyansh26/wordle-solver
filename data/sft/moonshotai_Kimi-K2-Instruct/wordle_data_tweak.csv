For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can help me gather information about which letters are likely to be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""STARE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
1. It has common vowels (A, E)
2. It has common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many English words, giving good coverage

From the first guess (SLATE), the feedback was:

- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: – (in the word, but wrong position)
- T: – (in the word, but wrong position)
- E: – (in the word, but wrong position)

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain S or L.
- It DOES contain A, T, and E, but each is in a different position than in SLATE (A was position 3, T was 4, E was 5).

I need to pick a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, and E (since those are confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain S or L (since those were marked x).
3. Rearranges the positions of A, T, and E.

Good candidate letters to add (since we want to test new consonants/vowels): R, N, I, O, U, C, D, H, etc.

I'll choose a word that uses common letters and places A, T, E in new positions. ""TREAD"" comes to mind:
- T is moved from position 4 to 1.
- E is moved from 5 to 3.
- A is moved from 3 to 2.
- R and D are new letters that haven't been tested yet.

Thus, ""TREAD"" seems like a good second guess.
