For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. Some effective starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- AROSE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

These words contain frequently used letters in English. I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's a balanced word with common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowels A and E.

From the first feedback:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N
- Letter E exists in the word but is not in the 5th position.

Common 5-letter words that use the letter E but avoid C, R, A, N include:
- BLOKE – uses B, L, O, K, E (E in 5th, but we know E is not in 5th, so skip)
- STOLE – uses S, T, O, L, E (E in 5th, so skip)
- GLYPH – no E
- MIGHT – no E
- HUMID – uses H, U, M, I, D, but no E
- LODGE – uses L, O, D, G, E (E in 5th, skip)
- BUDGE – B, U, D, G, E (E in 5th, skip)
- TUBED – T, U, B, E, D (E in 4th position, allowed)

TUBED fits:
- T, U, B, D are still allowed.
- E is in the 4th position (different from 5th), satisfying the feedback.

Therefore, I will guess TUBED next.

So far we have:

- Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, U, B, D  
- Letter E is in the word and is in the 4th position (✓ in Guess 2).  
- Letter T is in the word but not in the 1st position (-).  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E in the 4th position.
2. Contains T somewhere except the 1st position.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining available letters (from the standard alphabet minus the banned ones):
F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need candidates with E fixed in spot 4 and T somewhere among spots 2–5.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E _ or _ _ E E _ (but double letters are rarer), etc.

Let’s brainstorm:
- S T E E P → E in 4th, T in 2nd, but has P (allowed).  
- G L E E T → T in 5th, but double E’s may be uncommon.  
- F L E E T → T in 5th, double E’s again.  
- S P E L T → T in 5th, E in 3rd (wrong position).  
- S T E L T → T appears twice, but we have no info on duplicate letters.  
- H E L E T → T in 5th, E in 4th? Wait, E must be 4th, so that’s H E L E T – no, E would be 2nd and 4th.  
- V E T E R → E in 2nd and 4th, but R is banned.  
- P E T E R → same issue.  
- S W E E T → E in 3rd and 4th, T in 5th.  
- S L E E T → E in 3rd and 4th, T in 5th.  

Among these, ""SLEET"" is a common 5-letter word with E in the 4th position and T in the 5th, using no banned letters.
