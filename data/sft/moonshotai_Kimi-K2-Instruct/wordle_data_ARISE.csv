- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the amount of information we can gain. 

Some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words are: A, E, O, I, N, S, T, R, L. 

A good opening word should contain these letters to help us identify which letters might be in the word. Some popular choices include:
- ADIEU (uses 4 vowels)
- AROSE (uses common consonants and vowels)
- SLATE (uses very common letters)
- STARE (similar to SLATE)
- CRANE (another common choice)

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to start with.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (position 1)
- R is in the correct position (position 2)
- S is in the correct position (position 4)
- E is in the correct position (position 5)
- O is not in the word at all

So we know the word is of the form: A R _ S E (with the blank being any letter except O). We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern.

Possible candidates for the 3rd letter (since it can't be O):
Looking at letters that would make valid English words with the pattern A R _ S E:
- B: ARBSE - not a word
- C: ARCSE - not a word
- D: ARDSE - not a word
- G: ARGSE - not a word
- I: ARISE - this is a valid word
- L: ARLSE - not a word
- N: ARNSE - not a word
- P: ARPSE - not a word
- T: ARTSE - not a word
- U: ARUSE - not a word
- V: ARVSE - not a word

""ARISE"" seems to be the most obvious and only valid common word fitting this pattern.
