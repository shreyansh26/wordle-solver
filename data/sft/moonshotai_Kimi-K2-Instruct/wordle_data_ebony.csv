For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm key letters. A good starting word should include frequently used letters to maximize information gained.

Some common letters in 5-letter words include: S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N, L, D.

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as an optimal first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination covers several high-frequency letters in both consonants and vowels, giving us excellent information about which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

From the feedback:

- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So we know the secret word:
1. Contains the letter E (but not at the end).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

- E (known to be in the word, placed in position 2)

- Letters confirmed present (but positions unknown): E, N
- Positions E cannot be: 2, 5
- Positions N cannot be: 5

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and N
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, R, I, G
- Has E not in positions 2 or 5
- Has N not in position 5

Let’s try to place E in position 1 or 3 and N in positions 1-4.

Possible word structure:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- E can be in 1, 3, or 4
- N can be in 1-4

Let’s pick a word like ""ENDED"" – but it has D twice and might not be optimal.
Another option: ""EMBED"" – but it has B and D; let’s check:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- M, B, E, D – but E is already confirmed present, and we don’t have info yet on M, B, D.
However, ""EMBED"" has two Es, which might not give us new info.

Better: ""PHONE"" – but contains H, O, N, P, E:
- P, H, O, N, E
- P, H, O are new letters
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is NOT in position 5) – so invalid.

Next: ""NOBLE"" – but N is in position 1 (allowed), O, B, L, E – but L is excluded.

Next: ""FUMED"" – F, U, M, E, D:
- F, U, M, D are new
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is missing – we need a word with N.

We must include both E and N. Let’s brainstorm:
- ""YOUNG"" – but has O, U, N, G – G is excluded.
- ""BENCH"" – B, E, N, C, H:
   - B, C, H are new
   - E is in position 2 – but we know E is not in position 2 (from REIGN feedback)

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and N
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, R, I, G
- Has E not in positions 2 or 5
- Has N not in position 5

Let’s try to place E in position 1 or 3 and N in positions 1-4.

Possible word structure:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- E can be in 1, 3, or 4
- N can be in 1-4

Let’s pick a word like ""ENDED"" – but it has D twice and might not be optimal.
Another option: ""EMBED"" – but it has B and D; let’s check:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- M, B, E, D – but E is already confirmed present, and we don’t have info yet on M, B, D.
However, ""EMBED"" has two Es, which might not give us new info.

Better: ""PHONE"" – but contains H, O, N, P, E:
- P, H, O, N, E
- P, H, O are new letters
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is NOT in position 5) – so invalid.

Next: ""NOBLE"" – but N is in position 1 (allowed), O, B, L, E – but L is excluded.

Next: ""FUMED"" – F, U, M, E, D:
- F, U, M, D are new
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is missing – we need a word with N.

We must include both E and N. Let’s brainstorm:
- ""YOUNG"" – but has O, U, N, G – G is excluded.
- ""BENCH"" – B, E, N, C, H:
   - B, C, H are new
   - E is in position 2 – but we know E is not in position 2 (from REIGN feedback)
- ""DUNCE"" – D, U, N, C, E:
   - D, U, C are new
   - E is in position 5 – excluded
- ""UNCLE"" – U, N, C, L, E – L is excluded
- ""HONEY"" – H, O, N, E, Y:
   - H, O, Y are new
   - E is in position 4 (allowed)
   - N is in position 3 (allowed)
   - No excluded letters (S,L,A,T,R,I,G not present)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
H, O, N, E, Y
- Contains E and N
- E not in 2 or 5 (it’s in 4)
- N not in 5 (it’s in 3)
- No S, L, A, T, R, I, G
- Uses new letters H, O, Y

Thus, ""HONEY"" is a good next guess.

Summary of known facts:

Letters NOT in the word (11 total):
S L A T R I G H

Letters confirmed IN the word (3 total):
E, N, Y (with Y already locked in position 5).

Forbidden positions:
E ≠ 2,4,5  
N ≠ 3,5  
O ≠ 2 (O must be present but not at position 2)  
Y = 5  

Remaining unused common consonants: C D F K M P U V W B Z  
Remaining unused vowels: E (already required), O (already required), U

So the secret word must:
- Be of the form _ _ _ _ Y  
- Contain E, N, O exactly once each  
- Contain no excluded letters (the 11 listed above)  
- Place E in position 1 or 3 (cannot be 2,4,5)  
- Place N in positions 1,2,4 (cannot be 3,5)  
- Place O in positions 1,3,4 (cannot be 2,5)

Let’s enumerate the remaining possibilities:

Possible positions for E, N, O among 1-4 (last position is Y):

Case A: E at 1  
   Then N and O must occupy two of {2,3,4}.  
   Allowed because N ≠3 and O ≠2.  
   Sub-cases:
   1) E N O _ Y → ENOY_ – but we need 5th letter, and we need one more consonant.  
   2) E O N _ Y → EON_Y – but N is at 3, which is forbidden.  
   3) E _ N O Y → E _ N O Y  
   4) E _ O N Y → E _ O N Y

Case B: E at 3  
   Then N and O must occupy two of {1,2,4}.  
   Allowed.  
   Sub-cases:
   1) N E O _ Y → NEO_Y – but E at 2 is forbidden.  
   2) O N E _ Y – E at 3 is OK.  
   3) N _ E O Y – E at 3 OK.  
   4) O _ E N Y – E at 3 OK.

Let’s look for actual 5-letter words that fit and contain only allowed letters.

From Case A.3: E _ N O Y  
We need to fill blank with a consonant that hasn’t been used/excluded.  
Allowed consonants left: C D F K M P U V W B Z  
We need a word of shape E ? N O Y.  
Looking up, “ENJOY”:
E N J O Y  
- J is not in the excluded set (excluded are S L A T R I G H).  
- Contains E, N, O, Y  
- Letters fit all constraints.

Quick check:
- E at 1 (allowed)  
- N at 2 (allowed)  
- O at 4 (allowed)  
- Y at 5 (locked)  
- No forbidden letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should include frequently used letters to maximize information gained.

Some common letters in 5-letter words include: S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N, L, D.

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as an optimal first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination covers several high-frequency letters in both consonants and vowels, giving us excellent information about which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Let’s choose a word that avoids the eliminated letters, uses E in a new spot, and brings in new common consonants. “REIGN” uses:
- R (high-frequency, not yet tested)
- E (known to be in the word, placed in position 2)

- Has E not in positions 2 or 5
- Has N not in position 5

Possible word structure:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- E can be in 1, 3, or 4
- N can be in 1-4

Let’s pick a word like ""ENDED"" – but it has D twice and might not be optimal.

   3) N _ E O Y – E at 3 OK.  
   4) O _ E N Y – E at 3 OK.

Let’s look for actual 5-letter words that fit and contain only allowed letters.

From Case A.3: E _ N O Y  
We need to fill blank with a consonant that hasn’t been used/excluded.  
Allowed consonants left: C D F K M P U V W B Z  
We need a word of shape E ? N O Y.  
Looking up, “ENJOY”:
E N J O Y  
- J is not in the excluded set (excluded are S L A T R I G H).  
- Contains E, N, O, Y  
- Letters fit all constraints.

Quick check:
- E at 1 (allowed)  
- N at 2 (allowed)  
- O at 4 (allowed)  
- Y at 5 (locked)  
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, “ENJOY” is a valid next guess.

Decoded:
- E is correct in position 1 (✓).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- N is present but NOT in position 2 (-).
- O is present but NOT in position 4 (-).
- J is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word is:
E _ _ _ Y
with the middle three letters drawn from the still-allowed set and must include both N and O exactly once each.

Letters we now know:
- Required: E (pos 1), Y (pos 5), N, O
- Forbidden: S,L,A,T,R,I,G,H,J
- N cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 4

Remaining unused consonants (all single-occurrence): C,D,F,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,B,Z  
Remaining vowels: none usable beyond O.

We need a 5-letter pattern: E ? ? ? Y
with the three middle letters being an arrangement of N, O, plus one more consonant (because we already have two vowels E and O in the word and we need five letters).  
But we already have E and O as vowels, so the remaining three letters must contain N and one more consonant.

Thus the letters to place are N, O, and one more consonant (from the allowed set) in positions 2,3,4.

Let’s look at the possibilities:

Available consonants (excluding forbidden): C,D,F,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,B,Z  
We need to form a word E _ _ _ Y containing N and O.

Possible valid combinations:
- E N O _ Y – but position 4 must be a consonant, not O
- E O N _ Y – same issue
Actually the three letters {N,O,?} must be arranged in positions 2,3,4.

So possible permutations of N, O and one consonant in positions 2-4.

We want common English words.

Let’s list candidate patterns and check:

1) E C N O Y – not a word
2) E C O N Y – ""ECON Y"" – no
3) E N C O Y – no
4) E O C N Y – no
5) E N D O Y – no
6) E N O D Y – ""ENODY"" – no
7) E N O ? Y – need consonant at 4

Real words fitting: E N O ? Y
Looking up: ""ENOKY"" no, ""ENOPY"" no, ""ENOBY"" no.

Alternative: E ? N O Y – but then O would be in position 4, which is forbidden.

Alternative: E ? O N Y – this would place O in position 3 and N in position 4.  
Let’s check consonant at position 2.

We need a consonant at position 2 that:
- Is not forbidden (so not S,L,A,T,R,I,G,H,J)
- Is not N or O (they appear once each)

Possible consonants: C,D,F,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,B,Z

Words of shape E ? O N Y:
- E C O N Y – no
- E D O N Y – no
- E F O N Y – no
- E K O N Y – no
- E M O N Y – ""EMONY"" – no
- E P O N Y – ""EPONY"" – no
- E W O N Y – no
- E B O N Y – ""EBONY"" – YES, real word!

Check constraints:
- E(1) ✓, Y(5) ✓
- N is in position 4 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters: E,B,O,N,Y – none are forbidden (B is allowed)
- No duplicates of N or O.

Therefore ""EBONY"" is a perfect fit.

We can make this as the next (and likely final) guess.
