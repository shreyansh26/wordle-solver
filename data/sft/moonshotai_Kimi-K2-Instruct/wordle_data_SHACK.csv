For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good first guess should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""STARE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it includes:
- S (a very common consonant)
- T (another common consonant)
- A (a common vowel)
- R (a common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel in English)

This combination should help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S is in the word and in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (✓ means it is in the word, but the original feedback says A(✓) which implies it is in position 3—this is contradictory. Re-reading: the feedback format is (✓) for correct position, (-) for wrong position, (x) for not in word. So A(✓) would mean A is in position 3 and correct, but that can't be since position 3 is A in STARE and A is marked ✓, implying A is in the word and in position 3. This seems correct, but then E(x) means E is not in the word, and R(x) means R is not in the word. T(x) means T is not in the word.

Let’s interpret all the feedback so far:

1. STARE → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - A is correct in position 3.
   - T, R, E are not in the word at all.

2. SNAIL → S(✓) N(x) A(✓) I(x) L(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3.
   - Adds N, I, L to the “not in the word” list.

3. SCAMP → S(✓) C(-) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3.
   - Adds M, P to the exclusion list.
   - C is in the word but not in position 2, so it must be either position 4 or 5.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters still allowed (from the alphabet minus removed ones):
  Removed so far: T, R, E, N, I, L, M, P
  Still usable: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- C must appear in either position 4 or 5.

Possible C placements:
- S _ A C _
- S _ A _ C

We need common words that fit these patterns and use only the allowed letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- SACKY – uses Y, but K is allowed, and it fits S A C K Y (but A is fixed at position 3, so this would be S _ A C K – but that’s 5 letters: S _ A C K would be S A C K plus one more letter, which doesn’t fit.  
- S A C K Y is 5 letters but A is third letter, pattern S _ A C K – but that’s S _ A C K, which is 5 letters: S (1), _ (2), A (3), C (4), K (5). That’s 5 letters and fits the pattern. But we have to check if all letters are allowed: S, A, C, K, Y. None of these are on the exclusion list.

So S A C K Y fits, but let me double-check:
- Positions: 1-S, 2-?, 3-A, 4-C, 5-K. But we need 5 letters starting with S, so S A C K Y is indeed 5 letters: S A C K Y. However, in this word, A is in position 2 which contradicts our known A in position 3. So SACKY is invalid.
Wait, the correct pattern is S _ A _ _ (positions 1,3 have S and A fixed).

Let me think of words:
- S B A C K – but B is allowed, C must be in 4 or 5
- S B A C K: positions 1-S, 2-B, 3-A, 4-C, 5-K. All letters (S, B, A, C, K) are allowed. C is in position 4 which satisfies ""C is in the word but not in position 2"". This seems valid.

Is SBACK a real word? No, ""stack"" is but T is excluded. ""slack"" has L which is excluded. ""smack"" has M excluded. ""spack"" – not a word. ""shack"" – H is allowed, but let’s check: S H A C K – positions 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-C, 5-K. All letters allowed (H not excluded), C is in position 4, K is allowed. ""SHACK"" is a valid word.

Similarly:
- S P A C K – P is excluded.
- S O A C K – O is allowed, but ""soack"" isn’t a word.
- S D A C K – ""sdack"" isn’t a word.
Thus, SHACK seems the best candidate.

From the previous feedback we know:

- The word starts with S (position 1) and has A in position 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: T, R, E, N, I, L, M, P.
- The letter C is in the word, but not in position 2; hence it must appear in position 4 or 5.

The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern S _ A _ _ with C in position 4 and using allowed letters is:

So S A C K Y fits, but let me double-check:

- S B A C K: positions 1-S, 2-B, 3-A, 4-C, 5-K. All letters (S, B, A, C, K) are allowed. C is in position 4 which satisfies ""C is in the word but not in position 2"". This seems valid.

Is SBACK a real word? No, ""stack"" is but T is excluded. ""slack"" has L which is excluded. ""smack"" has M excluded. ""spack"" – not a word. ""shack"" – H is allowed, but let’s check: S H A C K – positions 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-C, 5-K. All letters allowed (H not excluded), C is in position 4, K is allowed. ""SHACK"" is a valid word.

Similarly:
- S P A C K – P is excluded.
