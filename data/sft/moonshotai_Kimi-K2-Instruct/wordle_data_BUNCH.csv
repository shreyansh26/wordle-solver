For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The English language has certain letters that appear more frequently (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S). A good first guess should use these common letters in varied positions to test as many possibilities as possible. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common in English.
2. These letters can appear in many possible positions in a 5-letter word.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, giving us maximum information from this single guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters, so we need a completely fresh set of vowels and consonants.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.
- Includes other high-frequency letters (T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, etc.).
- Keeps the vowels and consonants varied to maximize information.

The word “UNITY” fits:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y – none were in AROSE.
- Good spread of vowel/consonant positions.
- Common letters that should quickly narrow things down.

Current elimination summary:

Letters that do NOT appear at all (x in both guesses):
A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y → 8 letters eliminated.

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown yet (marked “-”):
U and N each appeared once somewhere in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

So the secret word contains:
- U and N (somewhere)
- Letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet minus the 8 eliminated letters.

Remaining high-frequency letters to try now:
D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, F, V, J, Q, X, Z

A good third guess should:
1. Include both U and N (to learn their exact spots).
2. Add three fresh common consonants that have not been tried yet.
3. Avoid repeating any known-absent letters.

Candidate: “DUNCK”
- D, C, K are fresh common consonants.
- U and N are reused to pin down their positions.
- Doesn’t use any of the 8 eliminated letters.

However, “DUNCK” is not a valid English word.
Next candidate: “UNCLD” – invalid.
Valid word: “UNCLE” – but E is eliminated.
Valid word: “UNDID” – uses I (eliminated).
Valid word: “UNDUE” – uses E (eliminated).
Valid word: “NUDGE” – uses E (eliminated).
Valid word: “LUNCH” – uses H and L, both still allowed, and contains U and N in new positions.

“LUNCH”:
- Letters: L, U, N, C, H – none of A,R,O,S,E,I,T,Y are present.
- U is now in position 2 (previously 1), N in position 3 (previously 2).
- C, L, H are new consonants.

This should give us good positional info on U and N and test three new consonants.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The English language has certain letters that appear more frequently (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S). A good first guess should use these common letters in varied positions to test as many possibilities as possible. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 5 distinct letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common in English.
2. These letters can appear in many possible positions in a 5-letter word.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, giving us maximum information from this single guess.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, E.
- Includes other high-frequency letters (T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, etc.).
- Keeps the vowels and consonants varied to maximize information.

The word “UNITY” fits:
- Letters: U, N, I, T, Y – none were in AROSE.
- Good spread of vowel/consonant positions.
- Common letters that should quickly narrow things down.

Letters that do NOT appear at all (x in both guesses):

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown yet (marked “-”):
U and N each appeared once somewhere in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed.

So the secret word contains:
- U and N (somewhere)
- Letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet minus the 8 eliminated letters.

Remaining high-frequency letters to try now:
D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, F, V, J, Q, X, Z

A good third guess should:
1. Include both U and N (to learn their exact spots).
2. Add three fresh common consonants that have not been tried yet.
3. Avoid repeating any known-absent letters.

Candidate: “DUNCK”
- D, C, K are fresh common consonants.
- U and N are reused to pin down their positions.
- Doesn’t use any of the 8 eliminated letters.

However, “DUNCK” is not a valid English word.
Next candidate: “UNCLD” – invalid.
Valid word: “UNCLE” – but E is eliminated.
Valid word: “UNDID” – uses I (eliminated).
Valid word: “UNDUE” – uses E (eliminated).
Valid word: “NUDGE” – uses E (eliminated).
Valid word: “LUNCH” – uses H and L, both still allowed, and contains U and N in new positions.

“LUNCH”:
- Letters: L, U, N, C, H – none of A,R,O,S,E,I,T,Y are present.
- U is now in position 2 (previously 1), N in position 3 (previously 2).
- C, L, H are new consonants.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>After four guesses we already know the last four letters are fixed:

Position 2: U  
Position 3: N  
Position 4: C  
Position 5: H  

So the word has the form: ? U N C H.

Letters already eliminated (by appearing as “x” in any feedback) are:
A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y, L, M

That leaves these possible first letters that can still make a valid English word:
B, D, F, G, P, etc.

Checking standard “?UNCH” options:
- BUNCH – B not yet ruled out
- DUNCH – obscure, but D not ruled out
- FUNCH – not a standard word
- GUNCH – not a standard word
- PUNCH – P not ruled out

The common dictionary words left are BUNCH, DUNCH, PUNCH.  
Since DUNCH is rare, we’ll test PUNCH next.

We know the pattern is _UNCH and the letters we have eliminated from the first position so far are:  
A, R, O, S, E, I, T, Y, L, M, P.

Still unused English consonants that can legally start “?UNCH” and have not yet been ruled out:

B, D, F, G, K, V, W, Z.

Real dictionary words among these:

- BUNCH  
- DUNCH (rare but valid)  
- GUNCH (obsolete/dialect)  
- No standard words with F, K, V, W, Z.

The common remaining candidate is BUNCH, so that is the obvious next (and final allowed) guess.
