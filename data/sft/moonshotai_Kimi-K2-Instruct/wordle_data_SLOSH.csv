For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words, allowing us to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Next step is to pick a fresh set of letters that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely.  
Good second-guess options usually include other high-frequency letters (S, T, L, I, O, U, H, D, M, etc.).  
Among those, “SOUTH” is attractive because it uses:  
- S (very common initial letter)

Step 1 – Parse the feedback so far
- CRANE (all letters x) ⇒ C, R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- SOUTH ⇒ S(✓) O(-) U(x) T(x) H(✓)
  - S must be in position 1.
  - H must be in position 5.
  - O is somewhere in the word (but not in position 2).
  - U, T are not present.

Current known pattern  
S _ _ _ H  with an O somewhere in positions 2–4.

Step 2 – Determine possible remaining letters  
Eliminate: C, R, A, N, E, U, T  
Still available (common ones): B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Y, O, etc.

Step 3 – Pick a third guess that
- Starts with S, ends with H.
- Includes O (not in position 2).
- Uses new high-frequency letters to maximize information.

Two candidate structures:
1) S O _ _ H  (possible positions 3-4 for O already used, so O must go in 3 or 4)  
2) S _ O _ H

Let’s test “SPOIL” → S P O I L → but that doesn’t end in H.  
Build valid 5-letter word patterns:
- S _ _ _ H with O in 3rd: S _ O _ H  → “SMOKE” would need K,E which are out.  
- “SLOSH” uses O in 3rd, common letters.  
- “SOILH” is invalid.  
- “SLOSH” is valid: S L O S H → but S is already first; no duplicate S needed.  

Actually, O must appear once.  
Let’s try “SOLID” – but it doesn’t end with H.  
We need to end with H, so:  
S _ _ _ H with O in either 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, but feedback said O can’t be 2nd, so 3rd or 4th.

Looking for words:  
S O _ _ H  – “SOOTH” (uses O twice)  
S _ O _ H  – “SLOTH” (high-frequency letters, valid word)  

“SLOTH” uses letters S, L, O, T, H.  
- T is already ruled out (x from SOUTH), so discard.  
Try “SPOKH” – invalid.  
Try “SLOSH” – O in 3rd, H in 5th, letters S, L, O, S, H.  Has two S’s; still okay but L is new.

Quick check dictionary: “SLOSH” is valid.

Alternative: “SPOOF” – but doesn’t end with H.  
“SOUTH” already used.

Best valid word matching constraints: “SLOSH”.

But double-check letters used: CRANE, SOUTH ⇒ eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,U,T.  
“SLOSH” contains S,L,O,S,H – none of forbidden letters.  
It puts O in position 3; we’ll see if that fits feedback next round.

Therefore, guess SLOSH.
