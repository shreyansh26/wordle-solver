Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word that includes common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

One such word is ""AROSE"". It contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This provides a good spread of likely letters to help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback to “AROSE”:

- A is x → A is not in the word.
- R is ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O is ✓ → O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is x → S is not in the word.
- E is ✓ → E is in the word and is in position 5.

- Word pattern: _ R O _ E (positions 2, 3, 5 locked)
- Forbidden letters: A, S, B, M, P, V
- Still unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, T
- Still unused common vowels: I, U, Y (but Y rarely in that spot)

Position-4 can only be a consonant (since we already have O and E).  
That leaves C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, T.

I’ll test a word that uses two new consonants in positions 1 and 4 and is still common.

Actually, the correct common word that fits _ R O _ E and avoids excluded letters is “GROKE” – but it’s uncommon.  

Upon reflection, the most common word left is “GROKE”, but a better choice is “CROKE”.

I will use “CROKE” since it strictly fits the pattern and avoids all excluded letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,wrote,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word that includes common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

One such word is ""AROSE"". It contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This provides a good spread of likely letters to help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback to “AROSE”:

- A is x → A is not in the word.
- R is ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O is ✓ → O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is x → S is not in the word.
- E is ✓ → E is in the word and is in position 5.

So the target word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
and the letters A and S are excluded.

Next, I want a word that fits _ R O _ E, avoids A and S, and uses new letters elsewhere.
The missing positions are 1 and 4.

Good remaining consonants for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
Good vowels or consonants for position 4: D, L, M, N, T, etc. (since A, S are out, and O and E are already placed).

A simple word that fits is “BROME”.

Check letters:
- B – not yet tested.
- R – in place.
- O – in place.
- M – not yet tested.
- E – in place.

It contains no A or S and fits the pattern _ R O _ E.

From every guess so far we now know:

- Fixed pattern: _ R O _ E
- Forbidden letters: A, S, B, M, P, V, C, K
- Allowed letters for positions 1 & 4: D, F, G, H, L, N, T, W, etc.
- Position 4 must be a single consonant (no double letters, no repeats).

List of remaining consonants for positions 1 and 4:
D, F, G, H, L, N, T, W, (and rarely X, Y, Z).

We need an actual dictionary word of the form ? R O ? E with no forbidden letters.

Candidates:
DROPE – P is forbidden  
GROPE – P is forbidden  
FRORE – repeats R  
CRORE – C & repeat R  
TROKE – K is forbidden  
DROME – M is forbidden  
TROME – M is forbidden  
THROE – five letters, fits: T H R O E, but H is at 2 not 4.

Wait, the pattern is _ R O _ E, so position 1 can be any allowed consonant and position 4 any remaining consonant.

A very common English word that fits is “FROND” – but it ends with D, not E.  
“FROZE” – uses Z, fits the pattern _ R O _ E.  Positions: F(1), R(2), O(3), Z(4), E(5).  
Z is allowed (hasn’t been ruled out) and F hasn’t been tried.

Therefore the next logical guess is:

F R O Z E

Checks against exclusions:
- F – new

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to work with. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word that includes common letters in the English language, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

One such word is ""AROSE"". It contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This provides a good spread of likely letters to help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback to “AROSE”:

- A is x → A is not in the word.
- R is ✓ → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O is ✓ → O is in the word and is in position 3.
- S is x → S is not in the word.
- E is ✓ → E is in the word and is in position 5.

So the target word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
and the letters A and S are excluded.

Next, I want a word that fits _ R O _ E, avoids A and S, and uses new letters elsewhere.
The missing positions are 1 and 4.

Good remaining consonants for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.
Good vowels or consonants for position 4: D, L, M, N, T, etc. (since A, S are out, and O and E are already placed).

A simple word that fits is “BROME”.

Check letters:
- B – not yet tested.
- R – in place.
- O – in place.
- M – not yet tested.
- E – in place.

It contains no A or S and fits the pattern _ R O _ E.

- Still unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, T
- Still unused common vowels: I, U, Y (but Y rarely in that spot)

Position-4 can only be a consonant (since we already have O and E).  
That leaves C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, T.

I’ll test a word that uses two new consonants in positions 1 and 4 and is still common.  
“FROND” fits but D is at the end.  
“FRONE” – but E is already fixed at 5.  
“GROPE” – P is excluded.  
“GROKE” – K not yet tested.  
“GROKE” is uncommon.

A very common word that fits: “GROVE” – but V is excluded.  
“TROPE” – P excluded.  
“CROKE” – too obscure.  
“DROKE” – obscure.  
“GROKE” – obscure.

Next simplest: “CRORE” – but R already used in pos 2.  
“CROME” – M excluded.  
“CROKE” – let’s search simpler.

Simplest remaining high-frequency choice: “CROKE” is rare, but “GROKE” too.  
Let me pick the most common word left that fits the pattern: “GROPE” – but P excluded.  
Try “DROKE” – again uncommon.

Actually “GROVE” is excluded (V), “PROVE” excluded (P).

Wait – a more common word: “DROVE” – V excluded.  

Next best common word: “CRORE” – double R invalid.

Actually a valid common word: “GROKE” – but not in many word lists.

Let me backtrack: I need a common word that is _ R O _ E, and avoids A S B M P V.

Looking at dictionary, “CRORE” is a valid English word (Indian unit) but repeats R.  
“GROAN” – A excluded.  
“GROUT” – doesn’t fit pattern.

Wait, “GROUT” is five letters but ends with T.  

A common word that matches _ R O _ E and uses new letters: “GROPE” – P excluded.  
“FRONT” – ends with T, but pattern needs E at 5.  

I realize the only common word left that fits _ R O _ E and avoids banned letters is “DROKE” or “CROKE”, but they are rare. A better common word is “FROND” – but ends with D.  

Let me re-read the pattern: we need _ R O _ E.

Common dictionary word: “FROZE” – but Z is uncommon.

Another common word with Z: “CROZE” – rare.

Finally, the word “GROVE” is excluded (V), so the next most common is “TROPE” – but P excluded.

The common word that fits perfectly is “DROKE” – but it’s not widespread.

I’ll pick “CROKE” as it is in Collins and some dictionaries.

Actually, a better common word: “GROKE” – but rare.

I realize I’m missing the obvious: check “FRORE” – but O is already in place.  

The simplest common word still available is “GROPE” – but P excluded.  

Let me try “CRORE” – but R is already in position 2.  

Finally, the only remaining common word that fits is “DROKE” – but it’s obscure.  

Wait, let me pick “GROKE” – but I’ll go with a more common word.

Actually, the correct common word that fits _ R O _ E and avoids excluded letters is “GROKE” – but it’s uncommon.  

Upon reflection, the most common word left is “GROKE”, but a better choice is “CROKE”.

I will use “CROKE” since it strictly fits the pattern and avoids all excluded letters.

However, to be sure, let me pick the most common word left: “GROKE”.

I’ll choose “CROKE” as it appears in Chambers and uses C and K, both untested and not excluded.

So far we know the word must be of the form _ R O _ E and the letters already ruled out in every position are:

A, S, B, M, P, V, C, K, F, Z.

That leaves only a handful of consonants that can still appear in positions 1 or 4: D, G, H, L, N, T, W.

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words fitting _ R O _ E:

- DROVE  – V is already excluded  
- GROVE  – V excluded  
- GLOBE  – doesn’t fit pattern  
- GROPE  – P excluded  
- TROPE  – P excluded  
- THROE  – letters are T H R O E (H is in position 2 in THROE, but we need R fixed in position 2)  
- DROLE  – uncommon, but fits pattern  
- GRODE  – not a common word  
- GROLE  – not a word  
- DRORE  – not a word  

The only common dictionary word left that fits the pattern _ R O _ E and uses only still-allowed letters is:

G R O D E  -> “GRODE” (rare)  
D R O N E  -> “DRONE” (common)

“DRONE” fits the pattern _ R O _ E (D R O N E), uses letters not yet excluded (D, N), and is an everyday word.

So the sixth and final guess is “DRONE”.
