For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often have A, E, R, S, T, L, N, or other frequently appearing letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T).
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving us more distinct feedback.
- These letters appear frequently in English words, increasing the chance of getting some correct letters early.

None of the letters S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word at all, so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
That removes a huge chunk of common starting guesses.

Looking for another high-utility starting word that avoids S-L-A-T-E entirely and still covers fresh, common letters, I want to hit vowels and consonants we haven't tested yet.  
Good remaining letters include O, U, I, R, N, C, M, D, H, G, B.

A balanced word that uses several of these is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none appear in SLATE.
- It gives us two fresh vowels (O, U) and three fresh consonants (R, N, D) in one shot.

So far we know:

Letters we still haven’t tested: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and the remaining positions for R.

We also haven’t tried the vowels I or Y yet. A balanced next guess should:
1. Include R (since we know it’s in the word).
2. Avoid every eliminated letter (S,L,A,T,E,O,U,N,D).
3. Introduce as many fresh, common consonants and the unused vowels as possible.

The word “CRIMP” would be disqualified because of the P (not enough info) and the M/I combo, but we can do better by forcing R into a new spot and covering fresh letters.

One strong candidate is “BRICK”:
- B, R, I, C, K – none of these are in the eliminated set.
- Moves R to position 2.
- Tests two new consonants (B, C, K) and the vowel I.

We now have much more information:

2. Letters we know **are** in the word (in some positions):
   - I (correctly placed in position 3)
   - R (somewhere, but not positions 1 or 2)
   - C (somewhere, but not position 4)

3. Remaining unused common letters: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y (plus I and R already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3 (✓)
- Contains R (but not in positions 1 or 2)
- Contains C (but not in position 4)
- Uses only the still-allowed letters
- Avoids every eliminated letter

Let’s try to place R in positions 4 or 5 and C in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4), while filling remaining slots with fresh consonants.

Candidate pattern: ? ? I ? ? 
We must fit R and C into the remaining four positions (1,2,4,5), with the constraints above.

A quick scan of common English words fitting this pattern gives “CHIRP”:
- C (allowed in position 1)
- H (new letter)
- I (locked in position 3)
- R (allowed in position 4, since it cannot be 1 or 2)
- P (new letter)

All letters are still legal and we hit two new consonants (H, P) while respecting all constraints.

   - C (somewhere, but not position 4)

3. Remaining unused common letters: F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y (plus I and R already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3 (✓)
- Contains R (but not in positions 1 or 2)
- Contains C (but not in position 4)
- Uses only the still-allowed letters
- Avoids every eliminated letter

Let’s try to place R in positions 4 or 5 and C in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4), while filling remaining slots with fresh consonants.

Candidate pattern: ? ? I ? ? 
We must fit R and C into the remaining four positions (1,2,4,5), with the constraints above.

A quick scan of common English words fitting this pattern gives “CHIRP”:
- C (allowed in position 1)
- H (new letter)
- I (locked in position 3)
- R (allowed in position 4, since it cannot be 1 or 2)
- P (new letter)

All letters are still legal and we hit two new consonants (H, P) while respecting all constraints.",Guess 4: CHIRP -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) R(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
