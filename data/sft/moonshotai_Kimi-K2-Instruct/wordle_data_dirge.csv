- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll select a word that uses several of these letters. ""ARISE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, I, S, and E - five of the most common letters, all in different positions.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
1. Word ends with E.
2. Word includes R and I (but R≠2, I≠3).
3. Word has no A, no S.

Good remaining high-frequency consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels we still might try: O, U.

A word that keeps the confirmed E in position 5, uses R and I in other positions, and introduces new common letters is “TIGER”:
- T (new, common)
- I (known in word, now in slot 2)
- G (new, semi-common)
- E (already known to be correct in slot 4)
- R (known in word, now in slot 5, but E is already fixed in slot 5, so this would put both R and E in slot 5 – impossible. Oops, conflict.)

Next candidate: “TRIPE”
- T (new, common)
- R (moved to slot 2)
- I (moved to slot 3 – but feedback says I is not in slot 3. So no.)

Candidate: “TRIBE”
- T (new)
- R (moved to 2 – allowed for now)
- I (moved to 3 – feedback says I is not in 3. Still invalid.)

Candidate: “NICER”
- N (new)
- I (slot 2, ok)
- C (new)
- E (slot 4, correct)
- R (slot 5, but E must be in 5. Conflict again.)

Candidate: “RINSE” – contains S, which we know is out.

Candidate: “PRIME”
- P (new)
- R (slot 2)
- I (slot 3 – invalid, same problem)

Candidate: “DRIVE”
- D (new)
- R (slot 2)
- I (slot 3 – invalid)

Candidate: “MIRTH” – ends with H, not E.

Candidate: “INERT” – ends with T, not E.

Candidate: “UTILE” – keeps E at 5, has I and R.
- U (new)
- T (new)
- I (slot 3 – invalid again)

Candidate: “CRIER” – ends with R, not E.

Candidate: “GRIPE”
- G (new)
- R (slot 2)
- I (slot 3 – invalid)

Candidate: “FLIER” – ends with R.

Candidate: “OLIVE”
- O (new)
- L (new)
- I (slot 3 – invalid)

Candidate: “UNTIE” – ends with E, has I but no R. Must include R.

Candidate: “URINE”
- U (new)
- R (slot 2)
- I (slot 3 – invalid)

Candidate: “CURVE” – no I.

Candidate: “DIRGE”
- D (new)
- I (slot 2, ok)
- R (slot 3 – ok, since original R was in 2 and is now moved)
- G (new)
- E (slot 5)

DIRGE satisfies:
- E in 5 ✓
- I in 2 (not 3), R in 3 (not 2) ✓

- Introduces new common letters D and G.
