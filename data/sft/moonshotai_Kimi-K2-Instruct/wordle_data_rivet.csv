For the first guess, the goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can quickly narrow down possibilities. Some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess often includes a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E), including three vowels and two common consonants. This gives good coverage for the first attempt.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word, but not in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: x → not in the word  
- E: - → in the word, but not in position 5  

Letters we now know:
- R and E are in the word, but their exact positions are not yet known (R ≠ 2, E ≠ 5).  
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Includes R and E in new positions.  
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested (like T, N, I, L, C, U, etc.).  

A strong next candidate is “INTER”:
- Contains R (now in position 5) and E (now in position 4), testing new placements.  
- Introduces I, N, T, which are common and untested.  
- No excluded letters (A, O, S).  

This should efficiently narrow down positions for R and E while testing new letters.

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Letters we know for sure:
- E is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ at position 4 in INTER).

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R appears somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 5.
- I appears somewhere but not position 1.
- T appears somewhere but not position 3.

Letters that have been ruled out:
- A, O, S (from AROSE)
- N (from INTER)

When we map out the constraints:
- _ _ _ E _
- R cannot be at 2, 3, 5 ⇒ R must be at 1 or 4.  But 4 is already E, so R must be at 1.
- I cannot be at 1 ⇒ I must be at 2, 3, or 5.
- T cannot be at 3 ⇒ T must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.  1 is R, 4 is E, so T must be at 2 or 5.

So the pattern is looking like:
R _ _ E _

We still need two more letters (positions 2 and 5).  We have I and T floating around, and we want to test new, common letters that haven’t been used yet: L, C, D, U, M, B, etc.

Possible forms:
R I T E ?  → does “RITES” fit?
- But S was already ruled out from AROSE.

R I _ E T  → “RIET_” – not a valid word.

R _ I E T  → “RUIET”?  Not valid.

R _ T E I  → “RITEI”?  Not valid.

Let’s try a different combination that places T at position 2 and introduces new consonants:
R T _ E _  – we need two more letters.  Let’s try “RT…E…” – but we don’t want to double any ruled-out letters.

A common word that fits: “UTTER” – but it has T twice and U and T were partially tested.

Another word: “UTILE” – but we already know about I and E.

Instead, let’s test a word that places T at position 5, I at position 2, and introduces a new letter.

Pattern would be:
R I _ E T

What letter goes in position 3?  We need a common consonant not yet ruled out: L is a good candidate.

So “R I L E T” – “RILET” is not a word, but “R I D E T” is not valid either.

Actually, the word “RIVET” exists in English (meaning to fasten securely).
- R at 1 (required)
- I at 2 (allowed)
- V at 3 (new letter)
- E at 4 (fixed)
- T at 5 (allowed)

This introduces V as a new consonant and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “RIVET”.
