For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with high-frequency letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good mix of common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the word:
1. Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
2. Contains A and S, but in different positions than 1st and 4th respectively.
3. The remaining letters can be any others except R, O, or E.

A strong second guess would use new common letters while respecting the constraints. The letters we now know are in play: A, S (in unknown positions). The letters not used yet that are common: I, N, T, L, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""STAID"" because:
- S moves away from 4th position (now 1st).
- A moves away from 1st position (now 2nd).
- Includes new common letters T, I, D to test more possibilities.
- Doesn't use any of the forbidden letters (R, O, E).

This should efficiently narrow down remaining options.

Let’s interpret the combined feedback.

Known facts so far:
1. R, O, E, T, I, D are NOT in the word.
2. S is in the correct position (first letter).
3. A is in the word but NOT in the second position.

Current pattern: S _ _ _ _

Letters still valid (common ones among the remaining alphabet):
A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
but we want common consonants and the vowel A.

Since A cannot be second, possible positions for A: 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

Other slots should be filled with common consonants not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, etc.).

A good next guess places A in a new position while introducing new common letters.  
Let’s try “SHALY”:
- Starts with S ✓  
- Places A in 3rd position (new spot)  
- Uses H, L, Y, all of which are new common consonants not yet ruled out.

This tests A in 3rd slot and three fresh consonants at once.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is correct in position 1.
2. H is correct in position 2.
3. A is correct in position 3.
4. Letters R, O, E, T, I, D, L, Y are NOT in the word.

Thus the pattern is now: S H A _ _

The word must be SHA??

Remaining unused common letters (excluding everything ruled out) include:
B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters – preferably common ones. Common endings for SHA- words include CK, NK, MP, etc.

Let’s try “SHANK”:
- S, H, A already match.
- N and K have not been ruled out yet and are fairly common.
- It forms a real English word.

This will confirm/deny the last two positions efficiently.
