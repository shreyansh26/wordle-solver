For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good initial guess would use a combination of these letters. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, and E — covering several very common letters in useful positions. This gives us a good baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Alternative strong first guesses could be ""AROSE"", ""IRATE"", or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""SLATE"" for its balance of vowels and consonants.

- It contains both A and T somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or L.

Letters available to use in positions 1,2,3,4: we still have the common letters R, I, N, O, C, etc. Since A and T must appear somewhere, and E is locked in the last spot, we can try a word like CRATE (but T cannot be in position 4, so position 4 is now free for T). However, T cannot be in position 4, so CRATE is invalid. Instead we can try IRATE, but T cannot be in position 4 in IRATE either. 

A better choice is to place T in position 1 or 2, and A in position 1, 2 or 4 (since it cannot be in 3). Trying ""CRANE"" is a common second guess, but it doesn't use T. How about ""TREAD""? That has T in position 1 (allowed), R, E (locked), A in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3), so that's invalid. 

Another option is ""RETIA"" but that's not a valid English word. ""TAPER"" is 5 letters, has T in position 1 (ok), A in 2 (ok), P (new letter), E in 5 (correct), R in 4 (new). This fits all constraints - A is not in 3, T is not in 4. Let's use TAPER.

   - Letters in the word but not in their guessed positions: A, T
   - Letter in the correct position: E is in position 5.

   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the correct position, i.e., position 2.
   - P and R are not in the word at all.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 – contradicting the earlier feedback that E is in position 5.  
     The second feedback row therefore contains a typo: the “E(-)” should be “E(✓)”, because E is already confirmed to be correct in position 5.

Corrected feedback for TAPER:
T(-) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(x)

Summary of constraints so far:
- Word ends in E (position 5).
- A is in position 2.
- T is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 or 4.
- Absent letters: S, L, P, R.
- Remaining positions: 1, 3, 4 (only 3 and 4 are still free, since 2 and 5 are fixed).

Position 1: can be any letter not excluded (i.e., not S, L, P, R).  
Position 3: any letter not excluded.  
Position 4: must be T (the only remaining place T can go, because it can’t be 1 or 4? Wait: T is excluded from 1 and 4? No, it’s only excluded from 1 (from TAPER) and 4 (from SLATE). So T can go in positions 2, 3, or 5. But 2 is A, 5 is E, so T must be in position 3. 

But let’s double-check:
- From SLATE: T is in word but not in position 4.
- From TAPER: T is in word but not in position 1.
- Therefore T must be in position 3.

So far the pattern is: ? A T ? E
Only position 1 and 4 are left, but position 4 must also be filled. Wait, positions are 1-5: positions 2 and 5 are fixed as A and E, position 3 must be T, so positions 1 and 4 are open.

But we have only 5 positions: 1 _ 3 _ 5. Positions 2 and 5 are fixed as A and E, and we deduced T must be in position 3. So position 4 is still open. 

Wait, no: positions are 1 2 3 4 5. We have:
1: ?
2: A
3: ?
4: ?
5: E

And we know T must be in the word, and it cannot be in 1 or 4, so T must be in 3. So position 3 is T. So the pattern is: ? A T ? E

Now we need to pick a letter for positions 1 and 4, excluding S, L, P, R.

Common remaining letters are C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next word would test a few more common consonants. Let’s try C for position 1 and N for position 4: “C A T N E” → CATNE (not a word). 

Try H for 1 and M for 4: HATME (invalid). 

Try G for 1 and M for 4: GATME (invalid). 

Try M for 1 and N for 4: MATNE (invalid). 

Try C for 1 and M for 4: CATME (invalid). 

Try C for 1 and H for 4: CATHE (invalid). 

Try N for 1 and M for 4: NATME (invalid). 

Try N for 1 and D for 4: NATDE (invalid). 

Try M for 1 and N for 4: MATNE (invalid). 

Try M for 1 and D for 4: MATDE (invalid). 

Wait, maybe I should try words that fit ? A T ? E. Let me list valid English words fitting _ A T _ E.

Examples: BATHE, CATER (but R is excluded), DATER (R excluded), FATED (R not involved), GATED (R not involved), HATER (R excluded), LATER (L and R excluded), MATED, NAMED (but pattern is _ A T _ E), PATED (P excluded), RATED (R excluded), SATED (S excluded), TATER (R and T in 1 excluded), WAGED (doesn’t fit), etc.

Looking through possible words: BATHE (B A T H E) – all letters except B are allowed. B is not excluded, so BATHE is possible. Let me check letters: B not excluded, A, T, H, E. No S, L, P, R. So BATHE is valid.

Therefore, a logical next guess is BATHE.
