This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. To maximize the information gained from this guess, I should choose a word that contains common English letters and covers a variety of letters to eliminate as many possibilities as early as possible. 

Good starting words often include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants like T, R, S, N, L. A popular strategy is to use a word like ""RAISE"" or ""AROSE"" which contain 3-4 vowels and high-frequency consonants. 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it's a strong opening word:
- R: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
1. Word has the pattern: _ _ I _ _
2. S is in the word but NOT in position 4. It could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
3. Letters not in word: R, A, E (and we still don't know about others like T, N, L, etc.)

Common 5-letter words with I in 3rd position and S elsewhere:
Some possibilities: DITIS, LIMIT, VISTA, VISIT, WISPS, BISON, LISPS, etc.

Looking for a good second guess that:
- Keeps I in position 3
- Uses S in a different position (not 4)
- Introduces new common consonants (T, N, L, etc.)
- Avoids R, A, E

A good candidate is ""LIMIT"":
- L: new consonant
- I in position 2 (new position for I, but we know I must be in 3rd position - this would violate our known info)
Oops, no - I must stay in position 3.

Better candidate: ""DITIS"" - but double I's might not be optimal.

Another good option: ""WISPS""
- W: new letter
- I in position 3 (correct)
- S in position 2 (new position)
- P: new letter
- S in position 5 (new position)

But let's think of words with S in position 1 or 2.

""SLIMY"" - but uses A which we know isn't in word.

""STING"" - but has E which we know isn't in word.

""SPICY"" - has C,Y new letters, S in position 1, P in position 2, I in 3, C in 4, Y in 5. This uses S in position 1 which is allowed.

But even better might be ""SIGHT"":
- S in position 1
- I in position 3
- G, H, T are new letters
- Doesn't use any excluded letters (R,A,E)

This seems like a good second guess to test S in position 1 and introduce G, H, T.
