For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, I, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:

- I (3rd letter) → x (not in the word)

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E
- Has not been tried yet

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus A.

A good second guess should use fresh common letters while incorporating the known A. The word ""MOUNT"" uses M, O, U, N, T – these are all new letters, but it doesn’t contain A, so that’s no good. Instead, let’s try to include A in a different position.

The word ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. It includes A (position 3), and all letters are fresh. This seems like a strong choice to test more consonants while placing A in a new spot.

Another candidate could be ""CHANT"" (C, H, A, N, T), but ""PLANT"" uses P and L which are also common. I’ll go with ""PLANT"".

4. Still unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y

- A appears somewhere else (positions 1, 4, or 5)
- No other letters from {R, I, S, E, P, N, T}

Candidate construction:

Possible endings with fresh letters:
- ALBUM – uses B, U, M (all fresh). Looks good.
- ALLOY – but O is allowed, Y is allowed, but double L would waste a spot; also O is okay.
- ALGUM – less common.

But ALBUM is simpler and keeps the A in a new spot (position 1), giving more info.

Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O are good choices. A word like ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it includes:\n- Three common vowels (A, I, E)\n- Two common consonants (R, S)\n- No repeating letters\nThis gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback:\n- R (1st letter) → x (not in the word)\n- A (2nd letter) → - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I (3rd letter) → x (not in the word)\n- S (4th letter) → x (not in the word)\n- E (5th letter) → x (not in the word)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

The word ""MOUNT"" uses M, O, U, N, T – these are all new letters, but it doesn’t contain A, so that’s no good. Instead, let’s try to include A in a different position.\n\nThe word ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T. It includes A (position 3), and all letters are fresh. This seems like a strong choice to test more consonants while placing A in a new spot.\n\nAnother candidate could be ""CHANT"" (C, H, A, N, T), but ""PLANT"" uses P and L which are also common.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(✓) A(-) N(x) T(x)
3. ALBUM → A(✓) L(✓) B(x) U(✓) M(x)

What we now know with certainty:

- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: L (✓)
- Position 3: NOT B (x)
- Position 4: U (✓)
- Position 5: NOT M (x)

Forbidden letters anywhere: R, I, S, E, P, N, T, B, M

Remaining unused consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y  
Remaining unused vowel: O

The word so far is: A L _ U _

We need one more consonant for position 3 (cannot be B, M, etc.).

Candidate letters for spot 3 that are still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y

The simplest common word that fits A L _ U _ is ALGUM, but M is already ruled out.  
Another: ALDUS (but S is out).  
Another: ALC… – “ALCUD” not a word.  
Another: ALGUS – S is out.  
Another: ALG – we need a real word.

Let’s list all 5-letter words that start with AL and have U in position 4:

ALBUM – already tried  
ALGUM – uses M again (invalid)  
ALC…  

A valid word is “ALGAR” but R is out.  

Another valid word is “ALOUD” – A L O U D.  
- A, L, U are already confirmed positions.  
- O is the vowel we haven’t tried yet and it’s allowed.  
- D is a new consonant and allowed.  

Let’s verify:  
A(✓) L(✓) O(?) U(✓) D(?) – positions match known constraints.  

Therefore, “ALOUD” satisfies all current constraints.
