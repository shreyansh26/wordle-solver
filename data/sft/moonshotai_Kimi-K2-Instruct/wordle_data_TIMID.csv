- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help us quickly narrow down the possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular choices for first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: – (in word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

So:
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, S, E.
- Letter we know IS in the word but NOT in position 3: I.

We now need a 5-letter word that contains at least one I (and no R, A, S, E). Good next guesses should place the I in a different position and probe for other vowels/consants. Typical follow-up words include O, T, N, L, C, etc. Let’s pick a word with I and other common letters, avoiding the banned ones.

Options:
- POINT (has I in position 3 again – not useful, and has N)
- TONIC (has I in position 4, but uses C)
- BUILT (has I in position 3 again – no)
- CHOIR (has I in position 4, but uses R which is banned)
- LIMIT (has I in positions 1 and 4, uses L, M, T – no banned letters)

LIMIT is valid: letters are L, I, M, I, T. It contains I (twice, in positions 2 and 4) and none of R, A, S, E.

3. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ I M I _ and contains the letter T somewhere (because T is in the word but not in position 5). The T must therefore be in position 1.
