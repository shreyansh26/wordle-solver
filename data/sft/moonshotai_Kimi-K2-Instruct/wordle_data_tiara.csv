For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me as much information as possible about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English. Some good choices include:
- CRANE (common letters: C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" because it contains all vowels except O, plus two common consonants (R and S). This should give me good feedback on vowel positions and several consonants.

From the feedback on ARISE:

- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

1. The word contains A, R, I (each at some position other than the first three).
2. The word does NOT contain S or E.

Hence the letters known to appear: A, R, I.
Unknown positions for these three letters (since they can’t be in spots 1, 2, 3 respectively).
We also need two more letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E).

Since we have three letters (A, R, I) that must be somewhere in the word, we have two blanks left to fill with other consonants/vowels. A good second guess should:
- Place the known letters (A, R, I) in new positions.
- Introduce new common consonants to test.

A strategic choice is to move the known letters to positions they haven’t been tried in and add common unused letters. A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R is now in position 1 (it was not allowed in position 2).
- A is now in position 2 (it was not allowed in position 1).
- D and O are new letters to test.
- I is now in position 4 (it was not allowed in position 3).

The best strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English.

From the feedback on INART:
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word at all.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and is correctly placed at position 3.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is correctly placed at position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Summary of facts so far:
- Fixed letters: _ _ A R _ (positions 3 and 4 are definitely A and R).
- Letters we know are in the word: A, R, I, T.
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E, D, O, N.
- Position restrictions:
  – A is fixed at 3.
  – R is fixed at 4.
  – I cannot be at 1, 3, or 4 (from earlier: not 3 in ARISE, not 4 in RADIO, not 1 in INART) → possible positions for I: 2 or 5.
  – T cannot be at 5 → must be at 1 or 2.
  – Need one more letter (position 1 or 2 or 5) to complete the 5-letter word, chosen from remaining unused letters (common consonants not yet used: C, L, M, P, B, etc.).

Let’s deduce the only possible placements:
- If I is at 2, then T must be at 1 (since T can’t be at 5). The fifth letter would then be at position 5 from remaining letters.
- If I is at 5, then T must be at 1 or 2, but:
  – If T is at 1, then position 2 is open.
  – If T is at 2, then position 1 is open.

We need to pick the most plausible word. Let’s try placing I at 2 and T at 1:
- Word structure: T I A R _
- The last letter must be from remaining unused letters (not S, E, D, O, N). Common choices: C, L, M, P, B.
- A valid word: TIARA (but this is 5 letters). Checking letters:
  – T at 1 (allowed).
  – I at 2 (allowed).
  – A at 3 (correct).
  – R at 4 (correct).
  – A at 5 (A is already used at 3, but can it repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeats. However, TIARA is a valid word.)

But let’s see if we can find a word without repeating A. Next common consonant: C, L, M, P, B.
- TIARC? Not valid.
- TIARL? Not valid.
- TIARM? Not valid.
- TIARB? Not valid.

Alternative placement: I at 5, T at 1 or 2.
- If I at 5 and T at 1: word structure T _ A R I. Possible:
  – T U A R I? U not tested yet, but is it common? Not sure.
  – T C A R I? Not a word.
  – T L A R I? Not a word.
  – T M A R I? Not a word.

- If I at 5 and T at 2: word structure _ T A R I. Possible:
  – C T A R I? Not a word.
  – B T A R I? Not a word.
  – L T A R I? Not a word.

Hmm, seems like TIARA is the only valid word fitting T I A R _. But let’s check if repeats are possible. Since the rules don’t forbid letter repeats, TIARA is plausible.

Alternatively, let’s try I at 5, T at 1, and pick another common consonant:
- T _ A R I: The blank must be a consonant not yet used (C, L, M, P, B, etc.). Possible words:
  – T B A R I? No.
  – T P A R I? No.
  – T L A R I? No.

Seems TIARA is the closest valid word. Let’s verify:
- T (allowed at 1, not excluded).
- I (allowed at 2, not excluded).
- A (correct at 3).
- R (correct at 4).
- A (allowed, not excluded).

Thus, TIARA seems the best next guess to test these positions.
