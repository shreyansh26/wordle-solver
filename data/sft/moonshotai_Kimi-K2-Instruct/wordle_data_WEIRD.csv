- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to include as many of these as possible without repeating letters. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains R, A, I, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This will give me information about the presence and position of these letters in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for future guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE) we know:

- A is NOT in the word.
- I is in the word AND in position 3.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. Uses R and E in new positions (R≠1, E≠5).
3. Introduces several new common letters (to maximize info).

A good candidate is “TIMER”:
- T, M, R are fresh letters.
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is locked in position 3.
This tests T, M, the correct placement of E, and the correct placement of R.

Let’s update what we know after both guesses.

Guess 1: RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(-)
- I is definitely in position 3.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.
- A and S are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: TIMER → T(x) I(-) M(x) E(-) R(-)
- I was already known to be in position 3, so the “-” here is expected (it’s in the word but already fixed in place).  
- T and M are not in the word.  
- E is not in position 4.  
- R is not in position 5.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ _
- Letters in the word: R, E, I
- Letters not in the word: A, S, T, M
- Positions ruled out:
  - R ≠ 1, 5
  - E ≠ 4, 5
  - I is fixed at 3

We need a word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Contains both R and E somewhere.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
4. Avoids positions already ruled out for R and E.

Possible positions for R: 2, 3 (but 3 is I), 4  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 3 is I)

Let’s list possible patterns:
- If R is in 2: _ R I _ _
  - Then E must be in 1 or 4 (but 4 is allowed since E≠4 is not yet ruled out? Wait: from TIMER, E is not in position 4. So E cannot be in 4. So E must be in 1.
  - Pattern: E R I _ _
  - Remaining letters must not include A, S, T, M.
  - Possible remaining letters: common ones left are N, D, L, C, O, U, etc.
  - Let’s try ERING? No, “ERING” isn’t valid.
  - ERIND? Not a word.
  - ERICK? Not valid.
  - ERING isn’t a word.
  - Maybe ERINO? No.
  - Maybe ERIKE? But E is already used, and we need new letters.

Alternative: R in 4:
- Pattern: _ _ I R _
- Then E must be in 1 or 2 (since 3 is I, 4 is R, 5 is unknown).
- So possible:
  - E _ I R _
  - _ E I R _

Let’s explore E _ I R _:
- E _ I R _ : first letter E, second letter needs to be a valid letter not yet used (not A, S, T, M).
  - Possible second letters: N, D, L, C, O, U, etc.
  - ENIRD? Not valid.
  - EDIRE? Not valid.
  - EDIRK? Not valid.
  - EDIRT? T is out.
  - EDIRN? Not valid.
  - EDIRL? Not valid.
  - EDIRY? Y wasn’t ruled out, but “EDIRY” isn’t a word.

Next, _ E I R _:
- Second letter E, third I, fourth R.
- First and fifth letters: need to be valid letters not yet ruled out.
- Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word).
- Possible fifth letters: same set.
- Let’s think of words ending in _EIR_ but that’s not a pattern.
- Actually, pattern is _ E I R _.
- Possible words:
  - “HEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “BEIRA”? A is out.
  - “CEIRT”? Not valid.
  - “DEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “FEIR_”? Not sure.
  - “GEIRR”? Not valid.
  - “KEIR_”? Not sure.
  - “LEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “NEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “PEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “REIRD”? R is already used, and R is in 4.
  - “SEIRD”? S is out.
  - “VEIRD”? Not valid.
  - “WEIRD”? W is allowed, E is in word, I is in word, R is in word, D is allowed.
    - “WEIRD” fits: W E I R D.
    - Check constraints:
      - I is in position 3: yes.
      - E is in position 2 (allowed, since E≠4,5 is already satisfied).
      - R is in position 4 (allowed, since R≠1,5).
      - W and D are new letters not yet ruled out.
      - All letters are valid and not excluded (A, S, T, M excluded).
    - “WEIRD” is a valid 5-letter word.

Thus, “WEIRD” is a strong next guess.
