Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common English letters that can help eliminate or confirm multiple possibilities. 

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, T, L)
2. S and T are among the most frequent starting letters in English
3. L is a common middle letter
4. This combination can quickly reveal the presence/absence of these letters and their positions

L (x) – L is NOT in the word.  
A (x) – A is NOT in the word.  
T (x) – T is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter E (but E ≠ 5th letter).
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Our next guess should:
1. Re-use E in a different position.
2. Introduce new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Avoid any of the letters we now know are absent (S, L, A, T).

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, K, D, M, etc.

A balanced choice is “REIGN”:
- Uses E in position 2 (new position).
- Introduces R, I, G, N – all untested and reasonably common.
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

- R is in the word, but NOT in position 1.

Remaining common vowels: O, U, Y (but Y is less common as a vowel).  
Remaining common consonants: C, D, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Next goals:
1. Place E in a new position (3rd or 4th are still open).
2. Include R in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are still open).
3. Test new consonants.
4. Avoid all letters already ruled out.

A good candidate is “CHORE”:
- C and H are new.
- O is new.
- R is moved to position 3.
- E is moved to position 5 (but feedback said E is NOT in position 5 from Guess 1). Oops! That’s invalid.

Let’s swap E to position 4 instead: “OCHRE”.
- O is new vowel.
- C, H, R are new consonants, with R in position 4.
- E is now in position 5 – but we know E is NOT in position 5. Invalid again.

So CRB E K → “CRBEK” is not a valid English word. How about CREED? But D is not ruled out. CREED: C R E E D – uses E twice (but we already know E is in position 4, so double E is possible). But “CREED” is a valid word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Popular starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:

3. L is a common middle letter

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter E (but E ≠ 5th letter).
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Our next guess should:
1. Re-use E in a different position.
2. Introduce new, common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
3. Avoid any of the letters we now know are absent (S, L, A, T).

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, K, D, M, etc.

A balanced choice is “REIGN”:
- Uses E in position 2 (new position).
- Introduces R, I, G, N – all untested and reasonably common.
- Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

From the feedback so far we have:

Confirmed positions:
- C is 1st letter.
- E is 4th letter.
- D is 5th letter.

Confirmed letters (somewhere in word):
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from REIGN, COVER, CURED).
  Therefore R must be in position 2.

Letters ruled out:
S, L, A, T, I, G, N, O, V, U.

So the word structure is:
1: C
2: R
3: ? (must be a letter not ruled out)
4: E
5: D

The only unknown position is the 3rd letter. Available letters (common ones not yet used):
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common 5-letter English words matching CR_ED:
- CREED (but E is already in 4, and we have only one E confirmed)
- CRIED
- CROWD (but O is ruled out)
- CRWED – not a word
- CRFED – not a word
- CRIED – this uses I, but I was ruled out in REIGN
- CRBED – not a word
- CRKED – not a word
- CRMED – not a word
- CRHED – not a word
- CRJED – not a word
- CRZED – ""crazed"" but with Z, but that's unlikely
- CRXED – not a word
- CRYED – ""cried"" misspelled
- CRQED – not a word

Looking back at our available letters, actually the only common letter left is M, B, F, H, K, P.

Checking valid words:
- CR_BED: C, R, _, E, D
  - CR BED – ""CRBED"" – not a word
  - CR FED – ""CRFED"" – not a word
  - CR MED – ""CRMED"" – not a word
  - CR KED – ""CRKED"" – not a word
  - CR HED – ""CRHED"" – not a word
  - CR PED – ""CRPED"" – not a word

But ""CREED"" has two E's which could be possible since puzzle allows duplicates. However we already have E in position 4.

Wait, let me think differently - is there any word CR_ED with a single E? 

Actually, ""CREED"" is valid but has double E. Since we don't know if doubles are allowed, and ""CREED"" uses only one new letter (though E appears twice).

But ""CREED"" is C R E E D. Here E is in position 3 and 4. But we know E must be in position 4, so this fits.

But we have no info against double E, so ""CREED"" is possible.

Alternatively, ""CROWD"" is invalid due to O.

""CRIMP"" – but ends with P not D.

Actually, the only valid word seems ""CREED"".

But let me check again - is there CR_ED with single E?

Looking at dictionary: CRBED, CRFED, etc don't exist. So ""CREED"" seems the only candidate.

But we have D confirmed at 5th, E at 4th, C at 1st, R at 2nd. So word must be C R _ E D.

Valid word: ""CRIED"" – but I is ruled out.

""CRWED"" – no.

""CRXED"" – no.

""CRYED"" – no.

""CRKED"" – no.

""CRHED"" – no.

""CRPED"" – no.

""CRFED"" – no.

""CRBED"" – no.

""CRMED"" – no.

""CRZED"" – no.

""CRQED"" – no.

Wait, actually ""CREED"" is C R E E D which has E in 3rd and 4th. This fits the structure.

But is there any other? 

Looking again, ""CREED"" seems to be the only valid word matching C R ? E D with available letters. 

Therefore, the word must be ""CREED"".
</think>

Given the constraints:
- C is the 1st letter
- R must be the 2nd letter (only remaining valid position)
- E must be the 4th letter
- D must be the 5th letter
- The 3rd letter must be E to form the valid word ""CREED""

<guess>CREED</guess>",CREED,"From the feedback so far we have:

Confirmed positions:
- C is 1st letter.
- E is 4th letter.
- D is 5th letter.

Confirmed letters (somewhere in word):
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from REIGN, COVER, CURED).
  Therefore R must be in position 2.

Letters ruled out:
S, L, A, T, I, G, N, O, V, U.

So the word structure is:
1: C
2: R
3: ? (must be a letter not ruled out)
4: E
5: D

The only unknown position is the 3rd letter. Available letters (common ones not yet used):
B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, common 5-letter English words matching CR_ED:
- CREED (but E is already in 4, and we have only one E confirmed)
- CRIED
- CROWD (but O is ruled out)
- CRWED – not a word
- CRFED – not a word
- CRIED – this uses I, but I was ruled out in REIGN
- CRBED – not a word
- CRKED – not a word
- CRMED – not a word
- CRHED – not a word
- CRJED – not a word
- CRZED – ""crazed"" but with Z, but that's unlikely
- CRXED – not a word
- CRYED – ""cried"" misspelled
- CRQED – not a word

Looking back at our available letters, actually the only common letter left is M, B, F, H, K, P.

Checking valid words:
- CR_BED: C, R, _, E, D
  - CR BED – ""CRBED"" – not a word
  - CR FED – ""CRFED"" – not a word
  - CR MED – ""CRMED"" – not a word
  - CR KED – ""CRKED"" – not a word
  - CR HED – ""CRHED"" – not a word
  - CR PED – ""CRPED"" – not a word
