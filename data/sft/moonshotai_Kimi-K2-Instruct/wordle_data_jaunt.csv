For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good information about which vowels and consonants are in the secret word. The word should ideally contain:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
- No repeating letters to maximize information gain

- 2 common consonants (R, S)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): none of these letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

So the secret word:
- definitely contains an A (somewhere other than position 1).
- does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter English word that has an A (but not in position 1), and does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

A good second guess should:
1. keep the A (and place it in positions 2-5)
2. introduce new high-frequency letters while avoiding the four we now know are absent (R, O, S, E).

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, H, I, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- TAINT (but has an E-like vowel pattern)
- PLANT (but has P and L, both okay)
- CHANT (C, H, N, T are all still possible)
- MANLY (M, N, L, Y are all still possible)

I'll choose PLANT because it has the A in position 2, uses common letters P, L, N, T, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Step-by-step deduction:

1. Eliminate letters already ruled out:  
   Forbidden so far = R, O, S, E (from Guess 1) + P, L (from Guess 2).

2. Extract the positive info:  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (it appeared in position 3 in PLANT but was marked “-”, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5).  
   - N is in position 4.  
   - T is in position 5.

3. Thus the template is: _ _ _ N T and the letter A must occupy position 2 or 4.  
   Position 4 is already N, so A must be in position 2.

4. Template so far: _ A _ N T (positions 2,4,5 are fixed).

5. Allowed letters left (common ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

6. Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3 that make valid English words.

   Examples:  
   - C A I N T → CAINT (not a recognized word)  
   - C A V I N T → not valid  
   - C A M P N T → not valid  
   - C A B I N T → CABIN (but ends in N, not T)  
   - G A M I N T → GAMIN (not valid)  
   - M A G I N T → MAGIN (not valid)  
   - M A I N T → MAINT (not valid)  
   - H A U N T → HAUNT (valid)  
   - F A U N T → FAUNT (not common)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The word should ideally contain:
- Common vowels (like A, E, I, O)
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
- No repeating letters to maximize information gain

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): none of these letters appear anywhere in the secret word.

So the secret word:
- definitely contains an A (somewhere other than position 1).
- does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter English word that has an A (but not in position 1), and does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

A good second guess should:
1. keep the A (and place it in positions 2-5)
2. introduce new high-frequency letters while avoiding the four we now know are absent (R, O, S, E).

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, H, I, U, etc.

Candidate words:
- TAINT (but has an E-like vowel pattern)
- PLANT (but has P and L, both okay)
- CHANT (C, H, N, T are all still possible)
- MANLY (M, N, L, Y are all still possible)

I'll choose PLANT because it has the A in position 2, uses common letters P, L, N, T, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step-by-step deduction:

1. Eliminate letters already ruled out:  
   Forbidden so far = R, O, S, E (from Guess 1) + P, L (from Guess 2).

2. Extract the positive info:  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (it appeared in position 3 in PLANT but was marked “-”, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5).  
   - N is in position 4.  
   - T is in position 5.

3. Thus the template is: _ _ _ N T and the letter A must occupy position 2 or 4.  
   Position 4 is already N, so A must be in position 2.

4. Template so far: _ A _ N T (positions 2,4,5 are fixed).

5. Allowed letters left (common ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

6. Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3 that make valid English words.

   Examples:  
   - C A I N T → CAINT (not a recognized word)  
   - C A V I N T → not valid  
   - C A M P N T → not valid  
   - C A B I N T → CABIN (but ends in N, not T)  
   - G A M I N T → GAMIN (not valid)  
   - M A G I N T → MAGIN (not valid)  
   - M A I N T → MAINT (not valid)  
   - H A U N T → HAUNT (valid)  
   - F A U N T → FAUNT (not common)  
   - V A U N T → VAUNT (valid)  
   - B A U N T → BAUNT (not valid)

Among these, HAUNT and VAUNT are both valid 5-letter words. HAUNT is the more common choice.

Therefore, the next guess is HAUNT.

   Position 4 is already N, so A must be in position 2.

4. Template so far: _ A _ N T (positions 2,4,5 are fixed).

5. Allowed letters left (common ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

6. Try common consonants in positions 1 and 3 that make valid English words.

   Examples:  
   - C A I N T → CAINT (not a recognized word)  
   - C A V I N T → not valid  
   - C A M P N T → not valid  
   - C A B I N T → CABIN (but ends in N, not T)  
   - G A M I N T → GAMIN (not valid)  
   - M A G I N T → MAGIN (not valid)  
   - M A I N T → MAINT (not valid)  
   - H A U N T → HAUNT (valid)  
   - F A U N T → FAUNT (not common)  
   - V A U N T → VAUNT (valid)  
   - B A U N T → BAUNT (not valid)

Among these, HAUNT and VAUNT are both valid 5-letter words. HAUNT is the more common choice.

Therefore, the next guess is HAUNT.

So the pattern is: _ A U N T

We still need the first letter.  
Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, H.

Valid first-letter options (common consonants not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Quick scan of English 5-letter words matching *AUNT:
- DAUNT – possible  
- GAUNT – possible  
- JAUNT – possible  
- VAUNT – already tried (Guess 3 was HAUNT, but VAUNT wasn’t used; still, it’s not needed)  

Among these, DAUNT is a common word that hasn’t been tried and fits every constraint.

Check DAUNT against all exclusions:
D – not forbidden  
A – allowed in position 2  
U – allowed  
N – allowed  
T – allowed  

Perfect.
