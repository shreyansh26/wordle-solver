Since this is the first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal here is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters frequently used in English 5-letter words. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should balance these to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular opening choices for this reason.

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters (maximizes letter coverage)

This should give us strong feedback on which vowels and consonants are present in the word.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-)  – the letter A is present but in the wrong position.  
R(x)  – the letter R is not in the word at all.  
O(x)  – the letter O is not in the word at all.  
S(-)  – the letter S is present but in the wrong position.

So:
- The secret word contains A and S, but neither is in its original spot (A was 1st, S was 4th).  
- It does not contain R, O, or E.

Next, I want a word that keeps A and S but:
- moves A away from position 1,
- moves S away from position 4,
- avoids R, O, E,
- and introduces new high-value consonants and a different vowel.

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S is now in position 1 (not 4).  
- A is now in position 3 (not 1).  
- Adds T, N, D (common consonants).  
- Uses no R, O, E.

Step-by-step deductions so far:

1. From arose:
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are absent.

2. From stand:
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - A is correct in position 3.
   - T, N, D are absent.

So the target pattern is now:
S _ A _ _   (positions 1 and 3 locked)
Letters to avoid: R, O, E, T, N, D.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tested: L, C, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowel: I, U, (A already used).

We need:
- Position 2: any unused consonant or vowel except the excluded letters.
- Position 4: any unused consonant or vowel except the excluded letters.
- Position 5: any unused consonant or vowel except the excluded letters.

A good candidate that fits:
- S A _ _ _ (positions 1 and 3 fixed)
- Uses new letters: C, I, M

Possible word: “SCAIM” – but not a valid English word.
Next best: “SWAMI” – uses W, M, I (all unused and valid).

However, another good option is “SHACK” – but K hasn’t been tried yet, and fits S _ A _ _.

But let’s pick a simple, common word that starts with S and has A in the third spot: “SWASH” – but double S is unlikely.

Better choice: “SALTY” – but T and Y have issues.

Wait, we need to avoid T, N, D – so “SALTY” has T, which is excluded.

“SPACE” – but E is excluded.

“SAVVY” – double V and Y.

“SALSA” – double S and A, and S already in position 1.

“SAPPY” – double P and Y.

“SAMBA” – but B and M are new, and A already in position 3.

After checking, a valid common word fitting S _ A _ _ with new letters is:

“SPASM” – but double S at 1 and 5 is possible.

However, “SHACK” seems better: S H A C K – uses H, C, K (all new).

Yes, “SHACK” is a valid word and fits the constraints.

So:
S(1) fixed
H(2) new
A(3) fixed
C(4) new
K(5) new

From the latest feedback on “shack” we now know:

S(✓) H(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓)

That means:

- Position 1: S is fixed.  
- Position 3: A is fixed.  
- Position 4: C is fixed.  
- Position 5: K is fixed.  
- Position 2: the letter cannot be H (H is marked x), and must still be a valid English word.

So the pattern is:

S _ A C K

The only common English word that matches this exact pattern is “SACK_” – but since the last letter must be K, the complete word is “SACKK” which is invalid (double K).

Therefore, the only valid 5-letter word fitting S _ A C K is:

S P A C K – but this is not a valid English word.

Wait – actually, the only valid word that fits S _ A C K is “STACk” but T is already ruled out (from stand feedback).

Double-checking: from past letters ruled out: R, O, E, T, N, D, H.

Allowed letters for position 2: any letter not in the excluded set.

Looking at the pattern S _ A C K, the only valid English word is “SMACK” – but we need to check if M is allowed.

M was not previously excluded (from stand or shack feedback), so it’s allowed.

Thus, the only remaining valid word is:

SMACK
