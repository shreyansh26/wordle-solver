For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like E, A, O)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Common strong starting words include: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. Among these, STARE is particularly good because:
- S and T are very common starting letters
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- R is a very common consonant
- No repeating letters

This gives us a good spread of frequently occurring letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, A, R are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains an E, but it is NOT in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain S, T, A, or R anywhere.
3. We still have 21 other letters to consider (minus the 4 known excluded ones).

Good strategy for the second guess:
- Use common letters not yet ruled out
- Ensure E appears in a different position (positions 1-4)
- Avoid S, T, A, R
- Include other common consonants and vowels

Common remaining letters: N, L, C, D, O, I, U, M, P, etc.

Summary of all feedback so far

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ Word does NOT contain S, T, A, R  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain an E, but NOT in position 5.

2. OLDEN → O(-) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)  
   ⇒ Word does NOT contain D or N  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain an E, and it is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain both O and L, but each is in the wrong position.

So:
- E must be in position 3 (only remaining spot).  
- Word contains O and L somewhere except positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
- Allowed letters so far: B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus the already-excluded S, T, A, R, D, N).

A reasonable third guess needs:
- E in position 3.  
- O somewhere other than position 1.  
- L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Other letters should be common and not yet ruled out.

Candidate word that satisfies all constraints: “M O L E Y”
- E is in position 3 ✓  
- O is in position 2 (was wrong position 1 last time, so allowed) ✓  
- L is in position 3 → but position 3 is already E → so no, L must be elsewhere.  
Let me rethink quickly.

A valid word: “B O L E K”
- B not yet excluded.  
- O in position 2 (allowed).  
- L in position 3 clashes with E.  
Wait, E must occupy position 3, so L must occupy position 4 or 5 (but cannot be 2).

Try: “H O V E L”
- H allowed.  
- O in position 2.  
- E in position 3.  
- L in position 5 (was wrong at 2, so okay).  
Letters used are all still allowed.

Let's consolidate everything we know after the three guesses.

Excluded letters: S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V  
(they showed up as x somewhere)

Included letters (but all in wrong positions so far):
- E  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,3,4,5) → only possible spot left: position 2
- O  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,2)
- L  (must be somewhere other than positions 2,3,5)

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ _  (E is fixed in position 2)
- Must contain O and L somewhere in the remaining slots 1,3,4,5, with their positional constraints:
  – O not in 1 or 2 (already satisfied)
  – L not in 2,3,5 (so L must be in position 4)
- So far skeleton: _ E _ L _

We need one more consonant for positions 1 and 5.
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus O which must fit somewhere.

Since L is in 4 and E in 2, O must go into position 1, 3, or 5; but positions 3 and 5 are still open and 1 is still open.  
Let's try to fit O in position 1: O E _ L _

We still need a fifth letter for position 3 (cannot be any of the excluded letters).

A common consonant still available: M
So a candidate word: O E M L ?  
But we need 5 letters; the last letter must go in position 5.  
Let me pick C (also still allowed).  
Word: O E M L C → but this isn't a valid English word.

Try B for position 5: O E _ L B  
Need a third letter between E and L.  
A good candidate is M: O E M L B → also invalid.

Instead, let’s try O in position 3: _ E O L _

First letter: let’s pick B: B E O L ?  
We need a fifth letter for position 5.  A common consonant still allowed: K → BEOLK × invalid.

Try C: B E O L C → BEOLC × invalid.

Try C in position 1: C E O L ? → CEOLK × invalid.

Try M in position 1: M E O L ? → MEOLK × invalid.

We need a valid English word that fits:
- Pattern: _ E _ L _
- Must contain O, which can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- Must contain L in position 4
- E in position 2
- No excluded letters (S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V)

Let’s list valid words:
- M E L O N → but N is excluded.
- F E L O N → N excluded.
- J E L L Y → J allowed, Y allowed, but L repeats and we don’t know if double letters allowed. Also, L must be in position 4, so J E L L Y has L in 3 and 4 → violates L constraint.
- B E L O W → has B, E, L, O, W. Check constraints:
   – E is in position 2 ✓
   – L is in position 3 → but L must be in position 4 (from constraint L not in 2,3,5). So L in 3 is invalid.
- B E L L Y → double L and L in 3, invalid.
- P E L O T → T excluded.
- C E L L O → L in 3 invalid, O in 5 but O was in wrong position 2 in guess 2, so allowed in 5.
- C E L L O → invalid because L must be in 4, not 3.

Realize that L must be in position 4, so pattern is: _ E _ L _

And O must be placed in 1 or 3 or 5.

Brainstorm 5-letter English words that fit:
- F E M L E → invalid
- P E C L E → invalid
- C E N L E → N excluded
- B E C L E → invalid
- G E M L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- K E G L E → invalid
- K E P L E → invalid
- C O G L E → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- M E L O N → N excluded
- P E C L O → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- B O G L E → fits _ O _ L E → but we need E fixed in position 2.

Wait, we must have E in position 2, L in position 4.

So _ E _ L _

Need a valid word with O in 1 or 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- C E O L I → invalid
- C E B L O → invalid
- B E C L O → invalid
- J E C L O → invalid
- Y E C L O → invalid
- W E C L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- C E M L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid

Actually, a valid English word: M E C L O does not exist.

Let me try: C E B L O → invalid.

Another: B E C L O → invalid.

Realize I’m stuck. Let me try a systematic approach with remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus O, L, E (already placed).

We have:
- E in position 2
- L in position 4
- Need three more letters: positions 1, 3, 5
- Must include O somewhere among 1,3,5
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

Let’s try to place O in position 3:
Pattern: _ E O L _

We need letters for positions 1 and 5. Available common letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y, Z.

Try B for 1, C for 3: B E C L O → BE CLO → invalid.

So far, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me try a different approach.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit pattern _ E _ L _ with letters from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- B E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- C E L L O → invalid (L must be in 4, but here it’s in 3)
- C E B L E → invalid
- C E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid

I realize I’m not finding valid words easily. Let me try to list actual dictionary words that fit _ E _ L _.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting _ E _ L _:
- B E G L E → BE GL E → not matching
- B E G L E → not found
- C E L L O → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E T L E → T excluded
- C E D L E → D excluded
- B E D L E → D excluded
- F E D L E → D excluded
- M E D L E → D excluded
- G E D L E → D excluded
- P E D L E → D excluded
- C E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid
- C E M L E → invalid
- B E M L E → invalid
- M E B L E → invalid
- B E P L E → invalid
- C E P L E → invalid
- F E P L E → invalid
- M E P L E → invalid
- P E M L E → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- M O P L E → invalid
- B O P L E → invalid
- F O P L E → invalid
- G O P L E → invalid
- P O P L E → invalid
- W O P L E → invalid
- Y O P L E → invalid
- C O B L E → invalid
- B O B L E → invalid
- M O B L E → invalid
- F O B L E → invalid
- G O B L E → invalid
- J O B L E → invalid
- P O B L E → invalid
- W O B L E → invalid
- Y O B L E → invalid

I am realizing that the constraints are very tight. Let me re-list the exact constraints:

- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  2: must be E
  3: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  4: must be L
  5: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
- Must include O somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5)
- Must include L (already in 4)
- Must include E (already in 2)
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

So the only possible patterns are:
1. O E _ L _
2. _ E O L _
3. _ E _ L O

Let me try to find valid English words for each:

1. O E _ L _:
   O E B L E → invalid
   O E C L E → invalid
   O E F L E → invalid
   O E G L E → invalid
   O E J L E → invalid
   O E K L E → invalid
   O E M L E → invalid
   O E P L E → invalid
   O E Q L E → invalid
   O E W L E → invalid
   O E Y L E → invalid
   O E Z L E → invalid
   None of these are valid English words.

2. _ E O L _:
   B E O L K → invalid
   C E O L K → invalid
   F E O L K → invalid
   G E O L K → invalid
   J E O L K → invalid
   K E O L K → invalid
   M E O L K → invalid
   P E O L K → invalid
   Q E O L K → invalid
   W E O L K → invalid
   Y E O L K → invalid
   Z E O L K → invalid
   None valid.

3. _ E _ L O:
   B E C L O → invalid
   C E B L O → invalid
   F E C L O → invalid
   G E C L O → invalid
   J E C L O → invalid
   K E C L O → invalid
   M E C L O → invalid
   P E C L O → invalid
   Q E C L O → invalid
   W E C L O → invalid
   Y E C L O → invalid
   Z E C L O → invalid
   None valid.

I realize I’m missing possible combinations. Let me try other letters.

For pattern _ E _ L O, try:
- B E G L O → invalid
- C E G L O → invalid
- F E G L O → invalid
- G E G L O → invalid
- J E G L O → invalid
- K E G L O → invalid
- M E G L O → invalid
- P E G L O → invalid
- Q E G L O → invalid
- W E G L O → invalid
- Y E G L O → invalid
- Z E G L O → invalid
Still none.

I must have made an error in assuming L must be in position 4. Let me re-examine the constraints on L.

From guess 2 OLDEN → L(-) in position 2 → L is in the word but not in position 2.
From guess 3 HOVEL → L(-) in position 5 → L is in the word but not in position 5.

So L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after previous feedback).

So pattern is _ E _ _ _ with:
- E in position 2
- L must be in 1, 3, or 4
- O must be in 1, 3, or 5 (from OLDEN and HOVEL feedback)
- No S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V anywhere.

Let me explore:

Case 1: L in position 1 → L E _ _ _
   O must be in 3 or 5.
   Possible words:
   - L E O _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters, but position 4 is open, 5 is open.
     L E O N _ → N excluded
     L E O B _ → L E O B ? → LEOBK ×
     L E O C _ → L E O C ? → invalid
     L E O G _ → invalid
     L E O K _ → invalid
     L E O M _ → invalid
     L E O P _ → invalid
     L E O W _ → invalid
     L E O Y _ → invalid
     L E O Z _ → invalid
   - L E _ O _ → need 3rd letter, 5th letter.
     L E B O _ → L E B O ? → invalid
     L E C O _ → invalid
     L E G O _ → invalid
     L E J O _ → invalid

     L E P O _ → invalid
     L E W O _ → invalid
     L E Y O _ → invalid
     L E Z O _ → invalid
   - L E _ _ O → need 3rd and 4th letters.

     L E C _ O → invalid
     L E G _ O → invalid
     L E J _ O → invalid
     L E K _ O → invalid
     L E M _ O → invalid
     L E P _ O → invalid
     L E W _ O → invalid
     L E Y _ O → invalid
     L E Z _ O → invalid

Case 2: L in position 3 → _ E L _ _
   O must be in 1 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - O E L _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters.
     O E L B _ → invalid
     O E L C _ → invalid
     O E L G _ → invalid
     O E L J _ → invalid

     Q E L C O → invalid
     W E L C O → invalid
     Y E L C O → invalid
     Z E L C O → invalid

Case 3: L in position 4 → _ E _ L _
   O must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   Let me try O in position 1: O E _ L _
     Need 3rd letter: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z

     Try U: U E C L O → invalid
     Try W: W E C L O → invalid
     Try Y: Y E C L O → invalid
     Try Z: Z E C L O → invalid

I realize I’ve exhausted obvious combinations. Let me try a different valid English word pattern.

Consider the word “B E L O W”:
- B, E, L, O, W — all allowed so far.
- E is in position 2 ✓
- L is in position 3 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed.
- O is in position 4 → from feedback O must be in 1,3, or 5 → position 4 was never tested, so it's unknown. But from guess 2 OLDEN O was in position 1 (wrong), so position 4 could be new.
But in HOVEL O was in position 2 (wrong), so O could be in 4.

But we know O must be in the word, and positions 1,3,5 are the only ones allowed for O. So BELOW has O in 4 → invalid.

Another candidate: “M E L O N” → N excluded.

“F E L O N” → N excluded.

“J E L L O” → L repeats, and O in 5 could be allowed.

Check JELLO:
- J, E, L, L, O — letters allowed.
- E in position 2 ✓
- L in position 3 and 4 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed in 3 and 4.
- O in position 5 → allowed (must be in 1,3, or 5) ✓
- No excluded letters.
- It is a valid English word.

So JELLO seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is JELLO.

- E  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,3,4,5) → only possible spot left: position 2
- O  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,2)
- L  (must be somewhere other than positions 2,3,5)

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ _  (E is fixed in position 2)
- Must contain O and L somewhere in the remaining slots 1,3,4,5, with their positional constraints:
  – O not in 1 or 2 (already satisfied)
  – L not in 2,3,5 (so L must be in position 4)
- So far skeleton: _ E _ L _

We need one more consonant for positions 1 and 5.
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus O which must fit somewhere.

Since L is in 4 and E in 2, O must go into position 1, 3, or 5; but positions 3 and 5 are still open and 1 is still open.  
Let's try to fit O in position 1: O E _ L _

We still need a fifth letter for position 3 (cannot be any of the excluded letters).

A common consonant still available: M
So a candidate word: O E M L ?  
But we need 5 letters; the last letter must go in position 5.  
Let me pick C (also still allowed).  
Word: O E M L C → but this isn't a valid English word.

Try B for position 5: O E _ L B  
Need a third letter between E and L.  
A good candidate is M: O E M L B → also invalid.

Instead, let’s try O in position 3: _ E O L _

First letter: let’s pick B: B E O L ?  
We need a fifth letter for position 5.  A common consonant still allowed: K → BEOLK × invalid.

Try C: B E O L C → BEOLC × invalid.

Try C in position 1: C E O L ? → CEOLK × invalid.

Try M in position 1: M E O L ? → MEOLK × invalid.

We need a valid English word that fits:
- Pattern: _ E _ L _
- Must contain O, which can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- Must contain L in position 4
- E in position 2
- No excluded letters (S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V)

Let’s list valid words:
- M E L O N → but N is excluded.
- F E L O N → N excluded.
- J E L L Y → J allowed, Y allowed, but L repeats and we don’t know if double letters allowed. Also, L must be in position 4, so J E L L Y has L in 3 and 4 → violates L constraint.
- B E L O W → has B, E, L, O, W. Check constraints:
   – E is in position 2 ✓
   – L is in position 3 → but L must be in position 4 (from constraint L not in 2,3,5). So L in 3 is invalid.
- B E L L Y → double L and L in 3, invalid.
- P E L O T → T excluded.
- C E L L O → L in 3 invalid, O in 5 but O was in wrong position 2 in guess 2, so allowed in 5.
- C E L L O → invalid because L must be in 4, not 3.

Realize that L must be in position 4, so pattern is: _ E _ L _

And O must be placed in 1 or 3 or 5.

Brainstorm 5-letter English words that fit:
- F E M L E → invalid
- P E C L E → invalid
- C E N L E → N excluded
- B E C L E → invalid
- G E M L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- K E G L E → invalid
- K E P L E → invalid
- C O G L E → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- M E L O N → N excluded
- P E C L O → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- B O G L E → fits _ O _ L E → but we need E fixed in position 2.

Wait, we must have E in position 2, L in position 4.

So _ E _ L _

Need a valid word with O in 1 or 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- C E O L I → invalid
- C E B L O → invalid
- B E C L O → invalid
- J E C L O → invalid
- Y E C L O → invalid
- W E C L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- C E M L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid

Actually, a valid English word: M E C L O does not exist.

Let me try: C E B L O → invalid.

Another: B E C L O → invalid.

Realize I’m stuck. Let me try a systematic approach with remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus O, L, E (already placed).

We have:
- E in position 2
- L in position 4
- Need three more letters: positions 1, 3, 5
- Must include O somewhere among 1,3,5
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

Let’s try to place O in position 3:
Pattern: _ E O L _

We need letters for positions 1 and 5. Available common letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y, Z.

Try placing O in position 5:
Pattern: _ E _ L O

Need letters for positions 1 and 3.

Try B for 1, C for 3: B E C L O → BE CLO → invalid.

Try C for 1, K for 3: C E K L O → invalid.

Try M for 1, P for 3: M E P L O → invalid.

Try P for 1, B for 3: P E B L O → invalid.

So far, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me try a different approach.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit pattern _ E _ L _ with letters from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- B E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- C E L L O → invalid (L must be in 4, but here it’s in 3)
- C E B L E → invalid
- C E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid

I realize I’m not finding valid words easily. Let me try to list actual dictionary words that fit _ E _ L _.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting _ E _ L _:
- B E G L E → BE GL E → not matching
- B E G L E → not found
- C E L L O → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E T L E → T excluded
- C E D L E → D excluded
- B E D L E → D excluded
- F E D L E → D excluded
- M E D L E → D excluded
- G E D L E → D excluded
- P E D L E → D excluded
- C E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid
- C E M L E → invalid
- B E M L E → invalid
- M E B L E → invalid
- B E P L E → invalid
- C E P L E → invalid
- F E P L E → invalid
- M E P L E → invalid
- P E M L E → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- M O P L E → invalid
- B O P L E → invalid
- F O P L E → invalid
- G O P L E → invalid
- P O P L E → invalid
- W O P L E → invalid
- Y O P L E → invalid
- C O B L E → invalid
- B O B L E → invalid
- M O B L E → invalid
- F O B L E → invalid
- G O B L E → invalid
- J O B L E → invalid
- P O B L E → invalid
- W O B L E → invalid
- Y O B L E → invalid

I am realizing that the constraints are very tight. Let me re-list the exact constraints:

- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  2: must be E
  3: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  4: must be L
  5: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
- Must include O somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5)
- Must include L (already in 4)
- Must include E (already in 2)
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

So the only possible patterns are:
1. O E _ L _
2. _ E O L _
3. _ E _ L O

Let me try to find valid English words for each:

1. O E _ L _:
   O E B L E → invalid
   O E C L E → invalid
   O E F L E → invalid
   O E G L E → invalid
   O E J L E → invalid
   O E K L E → invalid
   O E M L E → invalid
   O E P L E → invalid
   O E Q L E → invalid
   O E W L E → invalid
   O E Y L E → invalid
   O E Z L E → invalid
   None of these are valid English words.

2. _ E O L _:
   B E O L K → invalid
   C E O L K → invalid
   F E O L K → invalid
   G E O L K → invalid
   J E O L K → invalid
   K E O L K → invalid
   M E O L K → invalid
   P E O L K → invalid
   Q E O L K → invalid
   W E O L K → invalid
   Y E O L K → invalid
   Z E O L K → invalid
   None valid.

3. _ E _ L O:
   B E C L O → invalid
   C E B L O → invalid
   F E C L O → invalid
   G E C L O → invalid
   J E C L O → invalid
   K E C L O → invalid
   M E C L O → invalid
   P E C L O → invalid
   Q E C L O → invalid
   W E C L O → invalid
   Y E C L O → invalid
   Z E C L O → invalid
   None valid.

I realize I’m missing possible combinations. Let me try other letters.

For pattern _ E _ L O, try:
- B E G L O → invalid
- C E G L O → invalid
- F E G L O → invalid
- G E G L O → invalid
- J E G L O → invalid
- K E G L O → invalid
- M E G L O → invalid
- P E G L O → invalid
- Q E G L O → invalid
- W E G L O → invalid
- Y E G L O → invalid
- Z E G L O → invalid
Still none.

I must have made an error in assuming L must be in position 4. Let me re-examine the constraints on L.

From guess 2 OLDEN → L(-) in position 2 → L is in the word but not in position 2.
From guess 3 HOVEL → L(-) in position 5 → L is in the word but not in position 5.

So L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after previous feedback).

So pattern is _ E _ _ _ with:
- E in position 2
- L must be in 1, 3, or 4
- O must be in 1, 3, or 5 (from OLDEN and HOVEL feedback)
- No S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V anywhere.

Let me explore:

Case 1: L in position 1 → L E _ _ _
   O must be in 3 or 5.
   Possible words:
   - L E O _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters, but position 4 is open, 5 is open.
     L E O N _ → N excluded
     L E O B _ → L E O B ? → LEOBK ×
     L E O C _ → L E O C ? → invalid
     L E O G _ → invalid
     L E O K _ → invalid
     L E O M _ → invalid
     L E O P _ → invalid
     L E O W _ → invalid
     L E O Y _ → invalid
     L E O Z _ → invalid
   - L E _ O _ → need 3rd letter, 5th letter.
     L E B O _ → L E B O ? → invalid
     L E C O _ → invalid
     L E G O _ → invalid
     L E J O _ → invalid
     L E K O _ → invalid
     L E M O _ → invalid
     L E P O _ → invalid
     L E W O _ → invalid
     L E Y O _ → invalid
     L E Z O _ → invalid
   - L E _ _ O → need 3rd and 4th letters.
     L E B _ O → invalid
     L E C _ O → invalid
     L E G _ O → invalid
     L E J _ O → invalid
     L E K _ O → invalid
     L E M _ O → invalid
     L E P _ O → invalid
     L E W _ O → invalid
     L E Y _ O → invalid
     L E Z _ O → invalid

Case 2: L in position 3 → _ E L _ _
   O must be in 1 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - O E L _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters.
     O E L B _ → invalid
     O E L C _ → invalid
     O E L G _ → invalid
     O E L J _ → invalid
     O E L K _ → invalid
     O E L M _ → invalid
     O E L P _ → invalid
     O E L W _ → invalid
     O E L Y _ → invalid
     O E L Z _ → invalid
   - _ E L _ O → need 1st and 4th letters.
     B E L C O → invalid
     C E L B O → invalid
     F E L C O → invalid
     G E L C O → invalid
     J E L C O → invalid

     P E L C O → invalid
     Q E L C O → invalid
     W E L C O → invalid
     Y E L C O → invalid
     Z E L C O → invalid

Case 3: L in position 4 → _ E _ L _
   O must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   Let me try O in position 1: O E _ L _
     Need 3rd letter: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z
     Try B: O E B L ? → need 5th letter: K → OEBLK ×

     Try Z: Z E O L ? → need 5th letter: K → ZEOLK ×
   Try O in position 5: _ E _ L O
     Need 1st and 3rd letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z
     Try B: B E C L O → invalid

     Try U: U E C L O → invalid
     Try W: W E C L O → invalid
     Try Y: Y E C L O → invalid
     Try Z: Z E C L O → invalid

I realize I’ve exhausted obvious combinations. Let me try a different valid English word pattern.

Consider the word “B E L O W”:
- B, E, L, O, W — all allowed so far.
- E is in position 2 ✓
- L is in position 3 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed.
- O is in position 4 → from feedback O must be in 1,3, or 5 → position 4 was never tested, so it's unknown. But from guess 2 OLDEN O was in position 1 (wrong), so position 4 could be new.
But in HOVEL O was in position 2 (wrong), so O could be in 4.

But we know O must be in the word, and positions 1,3,5 are the only ones allowed for O. So BELOW has O in 4 → invalid.

Another candidate: “M E L O N” → N excluded.

“F E L O N” → N excluded.

“J E L L O” → L repeats, and O in 5 could be allowed.

Check JELLO:
- J, E, L, L, O — letters allowed.
- E in position 2 ✓
- L in position 3 and 4 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed in 3 and 4.
- O in position 5 → allowed (must be in 1,3, or 5) ✓
- No excluded letters.
- It is a valid English word.

So JELLO seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is JELLO.",Guess 4: JELLO -> FEEDBACK: J(x) E(✓) L(✓) L(✓) O(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,CELLO,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common English letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like E, A, O)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Common strong starting words include: STARE, SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. Among these, STARE is particularly good because:
- S and T are very common starting letters
- A and E are the two most common vowels
- R is a very common consonant
- No repeating letters

This gives us a good spread of frequently occurring letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on STARE:
- S, T, A, R are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains an E, but it is NOT in position 5.
2. The word does NOT contain S, T, A, or R anywhere.
3. We still have 21 other letters to consider (minus the 4 known excluded ones).

Good strategy for the second guess:
- Use common letters not yet ruled out
- Ensure E appears in a different position (positions 1-4)
- Avoid S, T, A, R
- Include other common consonants and vowels

Common remaining letters: N, L, C, D, O, I, U, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is ""OLDEN"":
- Contains E (in position 4, satisfying the feedback)
- Uses common letters O, L, D, N that haven't been ruled out
- No S, T, A, R
- Good coverage of vowel/consonant mix

<guess>OLDEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of all feedback so far

1. STARE → S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ Word does NOT contain S, T, A, R  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain an E, but NOT in position 5.

2. OLDEN → O(-) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)  
   ⇒ Word does NOT contain D or N  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain an E, and it is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
   ⇒ Word DOES contain both O and L, but each is in the wrong position.

So:
- E must be in position 3 (only remaining spot).  
- Word contains O and L somewhere except positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
- Allowed letters so far: B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus the already-excluded S, T, A, R, D, N).

A reasonable third guess needs:
- E in position 3.  
- O somewhere other than position 1.  
- L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Other letters should be common and not yet ruled out.

Candidate word that satisfies all constraints: “M O L E Y”
- E is in position 3 ✓  
- O is in position 2 (was wrong position 1 last time, so allowed) ✓  
- L is in position 3 → but position 3 is already E → so no, L must be elsewhere.  
Let me rethink quickly.

A valid word: “B O L E K”
- B not yet excluded.  
- O in position 2 (allowed).  
- L in position 3 clashes with E.  
Wait, E must occupy position 3, so L must occupy position 4 or 5 (but cannot be 2).

Try: “H O V E L”
- H allowed.  
- O in position 2.  
- E in position 3.  
- L in position 5 (was wrong at 2, so okay).  
Letters used are all still allowed.

I’ll go with H O V E L.

<guess>HOVEL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OLDEN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(-) D(x) E(-) N(x)
Guess 3: HOVEL -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) V(x) E(-) L(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate everything we know after the three guesses.

Excluded letters: S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V  
(they showed up as x somewhere)

Included letters (but all in wrong positions so far):
- E  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,3,4,5) → only possible spot left: position 2
- O  (must be somewhere other than positions 1,2)
- L  (must be somewhere other than positions 2,3,5)

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ _ _  (E is fixed in position 2)
- Must contain O and L somewhere in the remaining slots 1,3,4,5, with their positional constraints:
  – O not in 1 or 2 (already satisfied)
  – L not in 2,3,5 (so L must be in position 4)
- So far skeleton: _ E _ L _

We need one more consonant for positions 1 and 5.
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus O which must fit somewhere.

Since L is in 4 and E in 2, O must go into position 1, 3, or 5; but positions 3 and 5 are still open and 1 is still open.  
Let's try to fit O in position 1: O E _ L _

We still need a fifth letter for position 3 (cannot be any of the excluded letters).

A common consonant still available: M
So a candidate word: O E M L ?  
But we need 5 letters; the last letter must go in position 5.  
Let me pick C (also still allowed).  
Word: O E M L C → but this isn't a valid English word.

Try B for position 5: O E _ L B  
Need a third letter between E and L.  
A good candidate is M: O E M L B → also invalid.

Instead, let’s try O in position 3: _ E O L _

First letter: let’s pick B: B E O L ?  
We need a fifth letter for position 5.  A common consonant still allowed: K → BEOLK × invalid.

Try C: B E O L C → BEOLC × invalid.

Try C in position 1: C E O L ? → CEOLK × invalid.

Try M in position 1: M E O L ? → MEOLK × invalid.

We need a valid English word that fits:
- Pattern: _ E _ L _
- Must contain O, which can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- Must contain L in position 4
- E in position 2
- No excluded letters (S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V)

Let’s list valid words:
- M E L O N → but N is excluded.
- F E L O N → N excluded.
- J E L L Y → J allowed, Y allowed, but L repeats and we don’t know if double letters allowed. Also, L must be in position 4, so J E L L Y has L in 3 and 4 → violates L constraint.
- B E L O W → has B, E, L, O, W. Check constraints:
   – E is in position 2 ✓
   – L is in position 3 → but L must be in position 4 (from constraint L not in 2,3,5). So L in 3 is invalid.
- B E L L Y → double L and L in 3, invalid.
- P E L O T → T excluded.
- C E L L O → L in 3 invalid, O in 5 but O was in wrong position 2 in guess 2, so allowed in 5.
- C E L L O → invalid because L must be in 4, not 3.

Realize that L must be in position 4, so pattern is: _ E _ L _

And O must be placed in 1 or 3 or 5.

Brainstorm 5-letter English words that fit:
- F E M L E → invalid
- P E C L E → invalid
- C E N L E → N excluded
- B E C L E → invalid
- G E M L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- K E G L E → invalid
- K E P L E → invalid
- C O G L E → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- M E L O N → N excluded
- P E C L O → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- B O G L E → fits _ O _ L E → but we need E fixed in position 2.

Wait, we must have E in position 2, L in position 4.

So _ E _ L _

Need a valid word with O in 1 or 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- C E O L I → invalid
- C E B L O → invalid
- B E C L O → invalid
- J E C L O → invalid
- Y E C L O → invalid
- W E C L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid
- C E M L O → invalid
- M E C L O → invalid

Actually, a valid English word: M E C L O does not exist.

Let me try: C E B L O → invalid.

Another: B E C L O → invalid.

Realize I’m stuck. Let me try a systematic approach with remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus O, L, E (already placed).

We have:
- E in position 2
- L in position 4
- Need three more letters: positions 1, 3, 5
- Must include O somewhere among 1,3,5
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

Let’s try to place O in position 3:
Pattern: _ E O L _

We need letters for positions 1 and 5. Available common letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y, Z.

So far, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me try a different approach.

Let me list all possible 5-letter English words that fit pattern _ E _ L _ with letters from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- B E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- C E L L O → invalid (L must be in 4, but here it’s in 3)
- C E B L E → invalid
- C E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid

I realize I’m not finding valid words easily. Let me try to list actual dictionary words that fit _ E _ L _.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting _ E _ L _:
- B E G L E → BE GL E → not matching
- B E G L E → not found
- C E L L O → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E T L E → T excluded
- C E D L E → D excluded
- B E D L E → D excluded
- F E D L E → D excluded
- M E D L E → D excluded
- G E D L E → D excluded
- P E D L E → D excluded
- C E G L E → invalid
- M E G L E → invalid
- B E G L E → invalid
- F E G L E → invalid
- W E G L E → invalid
- Y E G L E → invalid
- C E B L E → invalid
- M E C L E → invalid
- W E C L E → invalid
- C E M L E → invalid
- B E M L E → invalid
- M E B L E → invalid
- B E P L E → invalid
- C E P L E → invalid
- F E P L E → invalid
- M E P L E → invalid
- P E M L E → invalid
- C O P L E → invalid
- M O P L E → invalid
- B O P L E → invalid
- F O P L E → invalid
- G O P L E → invalid
- P O P L E → invalid
- W O P L E → invalid
- Y O P L E → invalid
- C O B L E → invalid
- B O B L E → invalid
- M O B L E → invalid
- F O B L E → invalid
- G O B L E → invalid
- J O B L E → invalid
- P O B L E → invalid
- W O B L E → invalid
- Y O B L E → invalid

I am realizing that the constraints are very tight. Let me re-list the exact constraints:

- Positions:
  1: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  2: must be E
  3: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
  4: must be L
  5: not S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V
- Must include O somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5)
- Must include L (already in 4)
- Must include E (already in 2)
- No duplicates unless they’re allowed.

So the only possible patterns are:
1. O E _ L _
2. _ E O L _
3. _ E _ L O

Let me try to find valid English words for each:

1. O E _ L _:
   O E B L E → invalid
   O E C L E → invalid
   O E F L E → invalid
   O E G L E → invalid
   O E J L E → invalid
   O E K L E → invalid
   O E M L E → invalid
   O E P L E → invalid
   O E Q L E → invalid
   O E W L E → invalid
   O E Y L E → invalid
   O E Z L E → invalid
   None of these are valid English words.

2. _ E O L _:
   B E O L K → invalid
   C E O L K → invalid
   F E O L K → invalid
   G E O L K → invalid
   J E O L K → invalid
   K E O L K → invalid
   M E O L K → invalid
   P E O L K → invalid
   Q E O L K → invalid
   W E O L K → invalid
   Y E O L K → invalid
   Z E O L K → invalid
   None valid.

3. _ E _ L O:
   B E C L O → invalid
   C E B L O → invalid
   F E C L O → invalid
   G E C L O → invalid
   J E C L O → invalid
   K E C L O → invalid
   M E C L O → invalid
   P E C L O → invalid
   Q E C L O → invalid
   W E C L O → invalid
   Y E C L O → invalid
   Z E C L O → invalid
   None valid.

I realize I’m missing possible combinations. Let me try other letters.

For pattern _ E _ L O, try:
- B E G L O → invalid
- C E G L O → invalid
- F E G L O → invalid
- G E G L O → invalid
- J E G L O → invalid
- K E G L O → invalid
- M E G L O → invalid
- P E G L O → invalid
- Q E G L O → invalid
- W E G L O → invalid
- Y E G L O → invalid
- Z E G L O → invalid
Still none.

I must have made an error in assuming L must be in position 4. Let me re-examine the constraints on L.

From guess 2 OLDEN → L(-) in position 2 → L is in the word but not in position 2.
From guess 3 HOVEL → L(-) in position 5 → L is in the word but not in position 5.

So L must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after previous feedback).

So pattern is _ E _ _ _ with:
- E in position 2
- L must be in 1, 3, or 4
- O must be in 1, 3, or 5 (from OLDEN and HOVEL feedback)
- No S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V anywhere.

Let me explore:

Case 1: L in position 1 → L E _ _ _
   O must be in 3 or 5.
   Possible words:
   - L E O _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters, but position 4 is open, 5 is open.
     L E O N _ → N excluded
     L E O B _ → L E O B ? → LEOBK ×
     L E O C _ → L E O C ? → invalid
     L E O G _ → invalid
     L E O K _ → invalid
     L E O M _ → invalid
     L E O P _ → invalid
     L E O W _ → invalid
     L E O Y _ → invalid
     L E O Z _ → invalid
   - L E _ O _ → need 3rd letter, 5th letter.
     L E B O _ → L E B O ? → invalid
     L E C O _ → invalid
     L E G O _ → invalid
     L E J O _ → invalid
     L E K O _ → invalid
     L E M O _ → invalid
     L E P O _ → invalid
     L E W O _ → invalid
     L E Y O _ → invalid
     L E Z O _ → invalid
   - L E _ _ O → need 3rd and 4th letters.
     L E B _ O → invalid
     L E C _ O → invalid
     L E G _ O → invalid
     L E J _ O → invalid
     L E K _ O → invalid
     L E M _ O → invalid
     L E P _ O → invalid
     L E W _ O → invalid
     L E Y _ O → invalid
     L E Z _ O → invalid

Case 2: L in position 3 → _ E L _ _
   O must be in 1 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - O E L _ _ → need 4th and 5th letters.
     O E L B _ → invalid
     O E L C _ → invalid
     O E L G _ → invalid
     O E L J _ → invalid
     O E L K _ → invalid
     O E L M _ → invalid
     O E L P _ → invalid
     O E L W _ → invalid
     O E L Y _ → invalid
     O E L Z _ → invalid
   - _ E L _ O → need 1st and 4th letters.
     B E L C O → invalid
     C E L B O → invalid
     F E L C O → invalid
     G E L C O → invalid
     J E L C O → invalid
     K E L C O → invalid
     M E L C O → invalid
     P E L C O → invalid
     Q E L C O → invalid
     W E L C O → invalid
     Y E L C O → invalid
     Z E L C O → invalid

Case 3: L in position 4 → _ E _ L _
   O must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   Let me try O in position 1: O E _ L _
     Need 3rd letter: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z
     Try B: O E B L ? → need 5th letter: K → OEBLK ×

     Try Y: Y E O L ? → need 5th letter: K → YEOLK ×
     Try Z: Z E O L ? → need 5th letter: K → ZEOLK ×
   Try O in position 5: _ E _ L O
     Need 1st and 3rd letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z
     Try B: B E C L O → invalid
     Try C: C E B L O → invalid
     Try F: F E C L O → invalid

     Try U: U E C L O → invalid
     Try W: W E C L O → invalid
     Try Y: Y E C L O → invalid
     Try Z: Z E C L O → invalid

I realize I’ve exhausted obvious combinations. Let me try a different valid English word pattern.

Consider the word “B E L O W”:
- B, E, L, O, W — all allowed so far.
- E is in position 2 ✓
- L is in position 3 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed.
- O is in position 4 → from feedback O must be in 1,3, or 5 → position 4 was never tested, so it's unknown. But from guess 2 OLDEN O was in position 1 (wrong), so position 4 could be new.
But in HOVEL O was in position 2 (wrong), so O could be in 4.

But we know O must be in the word, and positions 1,3,5 are the only ones allowed for O. So BELOW has O in 4 → invalid.

Another candidate: “M E L O N” → N excluded.

“F E L O N” → N excluded.

“J E L L O” → L repeats, and O in 5 could be allowed.

Check JELLO:
- J, E, L, L, O — letters allowed.
- E in position 2 ✓
- L in position 3 and 4 → but from feedback L must be in 1,3, or 4 → allowed in 3 and 4.
- O in position 5 → allowed (must be in 1,3, or 5) ✓
- No excluded letters.
- It is a valid English word.

So JELLO seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is JELLO.

From Guess 4 (JELLO):

- J(x)  → J is NOT in the word  
- E(✓)  → E is in position 2 and is CORRECT

- L(✓)  → second L is in position 4 and is CORRECT  
- O(✓)  → O is in position 5 and is CORRECT

Excluded so far: S, T, A, R, D, N, H, V, J  
Still allowed: B, C, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z plus any others not ruled out.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form ? E L L O.

Valid words:
- B E L L O  → BELLO  (valid, though ""bello"" is less common; “bellow” is 6 letters)
- C E L L O  → CELLO  (valid musical instrument)
- F E L L O  → not a standard word
- G E L L O  → not standard
- M E L L O  → MELLO  (variant of “mellow”, but 5-letter spelling exists)
- W E L L O  → not standard
- Y E L L O  → not standard

The clearest valid choices are CELLO and BELLO.  
Between them, CELLO is the more common, unambiguous 5-letter word.

So the next guess is CELLO.
