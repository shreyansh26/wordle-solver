For the first guess, we want to choose a word that provides maximum information - ideally one that includes common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities. This is often called a ""starter word"" in Wordle strategy.

Common good starter words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A (most common vowel)
- N and E (other common letters)
This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in 5-letter words.

The feedback from CRANE shows:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- A(x): A is not in the word
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 4

So we know:
- Letters we have: C, R, N
- Letters we don't have: A, E
- C is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2
- N is not in position 4

Since we have C, R, N to work with, we should try a word that uses these letters in different positions while introducing new common letters (especially vowels). The vowels we haven't tried yet are I, O, U.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- We could try ""ROUND"" - but we don't know about O, U, D yet
- ""STORM"" - but we don't know about S, T, M yet
- ""CHURN"" - but we don't know about H, U yet

I'll go with ""ROUND"" because it:
- Uses R in position 2 (R was not in position 2 before, so this is valid)
- Uses N in position 4 (N was not in position 4 before, so this is valid)

From both guesses we now know:

Letters definitely in the word  
- C (not in position 1)  
- R (not in position 2)  
- N (not in position 4)  
- O (not in position 2)  

Letters definitely NOT in the word  
A, E, U, D  

Remaining highly-common letters to test: S, T, L, I, Y, H, M, K, P, G, B, F.

Current “known” letters to place: C, R, N, O  
(We must still have a fifth letter; none of our three “in-word” letters may appear twice.)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains C, R, N, O and one new letter.
2. Places C anywhere except position 1.
3. Places R anywhere except position 2.
4. Places N anywhere except position 4.
5. Places O anywhere except position 2.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words shows “CRONY” satisfies all constraints:
- C is in position 1 → **invalid** (C can’t be first)
- “CORN” is only 4 letters.

Instead, look for words with the four letters plus one more consonant or vowel.  
“CRON” + Y → “CRONY” fails at C.

Next try rearranging:  
“CORNS” (has S) – C is first → invalid.  
“CONIC” – repeats C and has I which we haven’t tested.  
But “CONIC” has C twice and only one C confirmed in word → probably wrong.

Another candidate: “NORIC” – appears in some word lists, but uncommon.

Let me test “CORN” + last letter = S, Y, etc.  
“CORN” + S → CORNS (C first, no).  
“CORN” + Y → CORNY (C first, no).

Better: move C out of first position.  
“RONC” + one letter:  
“RONCY” – but Y is 5th, and we have no constraints on Y.

Actually “RONCH” (slang) or “RONCO” (brand) are too obscure.

Let me rethink: we need a common word.  
Consider “N” in 3rd position (allowed), “C” in 2nd or 3rd or 4th or 5th.

Try “NICER” – has I, E (E already out).  
“CRONE” – has E (out).

“CON” + “R” somewhere.  
“CONFR” – no.

Instead, insert S: “SCORN”  
- S is new.
