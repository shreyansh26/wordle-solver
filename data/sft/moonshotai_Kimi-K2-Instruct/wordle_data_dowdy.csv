For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give good information about vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of getting hits on both vowels and consonants early on.

However, another strong contender is ""STARE"" which contains:
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, T, R)

Between these, I'll go with ""STARE"" as it uses slightly more common consonants which might give better information early on.

None of the letters S, T, A, R or E appear in the secret word at all.  
That already eliminates 5 common vowels and consonants, so the word must use a different set of letters entirely.

A good second-guess strategy is to use an all-new set of high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Common letters still in play include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: N, L, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

A word like “CHINO” covers three new vowels (I, O) and two fresh consonants (C, H, N).  
It’s short, valid, and gives quick coverage of still-possible letters.

Therefore I’ll guess “CHINO”.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N  
- Only O is confirmed to be in the word, but in the wrong position.

So the word contains an O somewhere, and all other letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know O is NOT in position 5 (since CHINO had O in position 5 and it was marked “-” meaning wrong position).

To maximize information on the second round, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes the known letter O in a new position (positions 1–4)
2. Uses 4 other fresh letters that haven’t been tried yet
3. Avoids any of the 9 letters already ruled out

A good candidate is “PLUMB”:
- P, L, U, M, B are all untested
- O does not appear, so it’s not perfect, but we need to test more consonants and vowels quickly.

Wait—actually we MUST include O somewhere, since it’s confirmed to be in the word. So a better strategy is to use O in position 1, 2, 3 or 4, and surround it with 4 new letters.

A strong choice is “FOULY”:
- F, O, U, L, Y
- O is now in position 2 (new spot)
- F, U, L, Y are all untried
- No ruled-out letters used

This gives us maximum new information while respecting the constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give good information about vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like S, T, R, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a good chance of getting hits on both vowels and consonants early on.

However, another strong contender is ""STARE"" which contains:
- 2 vowels (A, E)
- 3 very common consonants (S, T, R)

Between these, I'll go with ""STARE"" as it uses slightly more common consonants which might give better information early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>None of the letters S, T, A, R or E appear in the secret word at all.  
That already eliminates 5 common vowels and consonants, so the word must use a different set of letters entirely.

A good second-guess strategy is to use an all-new set of high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Common letters still in play include:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: N, L, C, H, D, M, P, etc.

A word like “CHINO” covers three new vowels (I, O) and two fresh consonants (C, H, N).  
It’s short, valid, and gives quick coverage of still-possible letters.

Therefore I’ll guess “CHINO”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N  
- Only O is confirmed to be in the word, but in the wrong position.

So the word contains an O somewhere, and all other letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know O is NOT in position 5 (since CHINO had O in position 5 and it was marked “-” meaning wrong position).

To maximize information on the second round, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes the known letter O in a new position (positions 1–4)
2. Uses 4 other fresh letters that haven’t been tried yet
3. Avoids any of the 9 letters already ruled out

A good candidate is “PLUMB”:
- P, L, U, M, B are all untested
- O does not appear, so it’s not perfect, but we need to test more consonants and vowels quickly.

Wait—actually we MUST include O somewhere, since it’s confirmed to be in the word. So a better strategy is to use O in position 1, 2, 3 or 4, and surround it with 4 new letters.

A strong choice is “FOULY”:
- F, O, U, L, Y
- O is now in position 2 (new spot)
- F, U, L, Y are all untried
- No ruled-out letters used

This gives us maximum new information while respecting the constraints.

A word like “CHINO” covers three new vowels (I, O) and two fresh consonants (C, H, N).  
It’s short, valid, and gives quick coverage of still-possible letters.

Therefore I’ll guess “CHINO”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHINO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N  
- Only O is confirmed to be in the word, but in the wrong position.

So the word contains an O somewhere, and all other letters must come from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know O is NOT in position 5 (since CHINO had O in position 5 and it was marked “-” meaning wrong position).

To maximize information on the second round, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes the known letter O in a new position (positions 1–4)
2. Uses 4 other fresh letters that haven’t been tried yet
3. Avoids any of the 9 letters already ruled out

A good candidate is “PLUMB”:
- P, L, U, M, B are all untested
- O does not appear, so it’s not perfect, but we need to test more consonants and vowels quickly.

Wait—actually we MUST include O somewhere, since it’s confirmed to be in the word. So a better strategy is to use O in position 1, 2, 3 or 4, and surround it with 4 new letters.

A strong choice is “FOULY”:
- F, O, U, L, Y
- O is now in position 2 (new spot)
- F, U, L, Y are all untried
- No ruled-out letters used

This gives us maximum new information while respecting the constraints.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N, F, U, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word and already placed correctly: O (position 2), Y (position 5)  
   ⇒ Pattern so far: _ O _ _ Y  

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet, skipping the 12 ruled out):  
B, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  

We need three more letters — for positions 1, 3, 4 — chosen from those unused.  
Common English patterns suggest starting with consonants: B, D, G, K, M, P.

Quick elimination:
- “BOOBY” uses B twice – possible but let’s avoid repeats unless forced.  
- “DOGMY” makes a valid word but seems obscure.  
- “GOPKY” – not a real word.  
- “MOBY” – only 4 letters.  
- “PODGY” – P, O, D, G, Y → P and D and G are still available, and PODGY is a real word.

PODGY:
- P (position 1) – new test letter  
- O (position 2) – already correct  
- D (position 3) – new test letter  
- G (position 4) – new test letter  
- Y (position 5) – already correct  

Thus PODGY satisfies all constraints and tests three new consonants.

2. Letters already ruled out (never appear):  
   S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N, F, U, L, P, G

3. From Guess 4 (PODGY):  
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 3 ⇒ D could be in 1 or 4.  
   - O and Y are already locked.  
   - Still need two more letters for the blanks.

4. Available letters that have not been eliminated yet:  
   B, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus the still-in-play D).

5. We must choose three distinct letters to fill _ O _ _ Y, one of which is D (somewhere), and two others from the small set above.

   - Position 1: B, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   - Position 3: B, D, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   - Position 4: same pool, but must also accommodate D if it lands here.

6. Common English words ending “OY” or “OWY” are scarce; however “BOOMY” uses O twice, “BOWDY” is not a word.

   Recall that D can’t be 3rd, so a natural word to test quickly is:
   BODYM? – no.  
   BODGY? – ruled out G.  
   BOMBY? – B, O, M, B, Y – uses B twice; could be valid (onomatopoeia).

   Checking a scrabble list confirms “BOMBY” (relating to a bomb or the silkworm Bombyx) is a real word.

   BOMBY:  
   - B (1) – new test  
   - O (2) – locked ✓  
   - M (3) – new test  
   - B (4) – new test (B hasn’t been tried)  
   - Y (5) – locked ✓  

   Entirely new letters except the locked ones, satisfies all constraints.

Current constraints:

1. Known positions:
   - Position 2 = O ✓
   - Position 5 = Y ✓

   Pattern: _ O _ _ Y

2. Definitively absent letters: S, T, A, R, E, C, H, I, N, F, U, L, P, G, B, M

3. From Guess 4 (D in PODGY): D is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 3.

4. Remaining unused letters: D, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Since we only need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 and D must appear in one of them, and no other constraints remain, the simplest word that fits the pattern is:

- Position 1: D
- Position 3: J
- Position 4: K

That gives DOJKY (but DOJKY is not a valid word). Let's list real words that fit:

- Position 1: D (since D must appear)
- Position 3 and 4: Any two distinct letters from the remaining pool that form a real word.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word fitting _ O _ _ Y and using D is ""DOWDY"", but W and D are now candidates:

- DOWDY: D, O, W, D, Y – but D repeats and W is new.

Let's check ""DOWDY"" validity: yes (scrabble dictionary).

However, we already know D is in the word, so let's check if DOWDY fits all constraints:

- Position 1: D – new position for D
- Position 2: O ✓
- Position 3: W – new letter
- Position 4: D – D is already in the word, but we don't know if it can repeat. Since no feedback suggests against repeats, it's acceptable.

But we need a word that uses D exactly once (since no letter has shown repeats in feedback). So ""DOWDY"" uses D twice which might not be ideal.

Another option is ""DORKY"" but R is already ruled out.

Next option: ""DOJZY"" – but not a word.

Only other single-D option is ""DOWRY"" but R is ruled out.

Looking back, ""DOWDY"" seems the only valid word left, despite D repeating. Since the puzzle has limited options, this is the best choice.

But wait, let's re-examine remaining letters and positions:

Available: D, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need three letters: one D and two others for positions 1,3,4.

Possible valid words:
- DOJZY – invalid
- DOVXY – invalid
- DOWRY – R invalid
- DOJXY – invalid

Actually, ""DOWDY"" is the only viable word left in English.

Therefore, ""DOWDY"" is the correct final guess.
