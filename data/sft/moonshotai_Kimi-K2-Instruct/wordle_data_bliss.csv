For my first guess, I want to choose a word that covers common letters in the English language and has a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word. Common starting words often include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. After considering various options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters across different positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word AND in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like:
_ L _ _ _

We already know:
- S is somewhere in the word, but not at the start (position 1).
- No A, T, or E.

Good letters to try next would be common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). Since L is locked in position 2 and we need to test where S can go (positions 3-5), plus gather more info, a word like ""CLOWN"" or ""PLUMB"" could work, but let's think more systematically.

Let's pick a word with:
- L in position 2 (fixed)
- S somewhere else (positions 3-5)
- Common remaining letters to test.

""PLUSH"" seems good:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2, confirmed ✓)
- U (remaining vowel)
- S (must be in word, now testing position 4)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Common starting words often include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like T, N, S, R, L. After considering various options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first choice because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives good coverage of frequent letters across different positions.

- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word AND in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like:
_ L _ _ _

We already know:
- S is somewhere in the word, but not at the start (position 1).
- No A, T, or E.

Good letters to try next would be common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, O, U). Since L is locked in position 2 and we need to test where S can go (positions 3-5), plus gather more info, a word like ""CLOWN"" or ""PLUMB"" could work, but let's think more systematically.

Let's pick a word with:
- L in position 2 (fixed)
- S somewhere else (positions 3-5)
- Common remaining letters to test.

""PLUSH"" seems good:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2, confirmed ✓)
- U (remaining vowel)
- S (must be in word, now testing position 4)
- H (another common consonant)

This tests S in position 4 and checks P, U, H.

   So the word is: _ L _ S _ .
5. Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 3, 5 must come from the unused alphabet excluding A, T, E, P, U, H.

Good candidate consonants still unused and common: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y (avoiding Q, X, Z to stay common).
Vowels still unused: I, O.

We now want a word of the form C L V S C (where C = consonant, V = vowel) that:
- is a valid 5-letter English word,
- uses only the still-allowed letters,
- places S at position 4 and L at position 2.

Possible vowel positions: 3 or 5. If we put a vowel in position 3, the word would be _ L I S _ or _ L O S _.

Let’s list a few candidates:
- B L I S K (positions 1,3,5 tested: B, I, K)
- C L I P S (but P is excluded)
- F L I S K
- G L O S S (but position 3 would be O, 4 S, 5 S – has S twice and S already fixed once)

4. S is not in position 1 (from Guess 1), and now we see S is in position 4.
   So the word is: _ L _ S _ .
5. Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 3, 5 must come from the unused alphabet excluding A, T, E, P, U, H.

Good candidate consonants still unused and common: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, R, V, W, Y (avoiding Q, X, Z to stay common).
Vowels still unused: I, O.

We now want a word of the form C L V S C (where C = consonant, V = vowel) that:
- is a valid 5-letter English word,
- uses only the still-allowed letters,
- places S at position 4 and L at position 2.

Possible vowel positions: 3 or 5. If we put a vowel in position 3, the word would be _ L I S _ or _ L O S _.

Let’s list a few candidates:
- B L I S K (positions 1,3,5 tested: B, I, K)
- C L I P S (but P is excluded)
- F L I S K
- G L O S S (but position 3 would be O, 4 S, 5 S – has S twice and S already fixed once)
- B L O S S – same double-S issue
- C L I M S – M is okay, but does CLI MS exist? Not a word.
- B L I N S – valid word (BLINS are thin pancakes)

BLINS is valid and fits all constraints:
- B, I, N are from still-allowed letters.
- L in position 2 (✓), S in position 4 (✓).
- No forbidden letters.

- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So far we know the word is:
B L I _ S

Only position 4 is unknown. The letters we have ruled out are:
A, T, E, P, U, H, N (from all feedback).

Remaining common letters that fit in position 4: C, D, F, G, K, M, R, V, W, Y (vowels O and U are excluded, and I is already used).

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with BLIS- and ends with a consonant from the allowed set. The only common word is BLISS (but that would repeat S, and we already have S in position 5). Another valid word is BLISK (a real but less common word meaning the cutting edge of a tool).

Let’s verify:
- B, L, I, S already confirmed in their correct spots.
- K is still allowed (not yet ruled out).
- BLISK is listed in dictionaries as a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the word must be BLISK.

Remaining consonants that can appear in position 4: C, D, F, G, M, R, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern BL I _ S, where the blank is one of the allowed consonants.

Candidate words:
- BLICS – not a recognized word.
- BLIDS – not a recognized word.
- BLIGS – not a recognized word.
- BLIMS – not a recognized word.
- BLIPS – ruled out because P was eliminated in Guess 2.
- BLISS – ruled out because S is already in position 5 and would duplicate.
- BLITS – ruled out because T was eliminated.
- BLIVS – not a recognized word.
- BLIWS – not a recognized word.
- BLIYS – not a recognized word.

The only remaining common word that fits and has not been excluded is:
BLIMP: uses M in position 4, and none of the letters are forbidden so far.

So, BLIMP is the next logical guess.

Confirmed so far:
- Positions 1–3: B L I
- Position 5: S

So the word shape is B L I _ S.

Letters eliminated from the entire word: A, T, E, P, U, H, N, K, M.

That leaves only the consonants C, D, F, G, R, V, W, Y for position 4.

Among valid 5-letter English words matching B L I _ S, the only remaining standard word is BLIGS (plural of “blig,” an old dialect word for a small piece of land).

All other consonants listed above do not yield real words (Blics, Blids, Blifs, Bligs, Blirs, Blivs, Bliws, Bliys are not recognized words). BLIGS is the sole candidate left that fits every constraint.
