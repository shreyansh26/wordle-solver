For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain by testing letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels: A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters and a good vowel-consonant mix. The letters S, L, A, T, E are all very common in English words, so this should give us useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them are in the secret word at all.  
That tells us the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.

For the second guess we should avoid those letters and still cover common consonants and vowels.  
Remaining high-frequency letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word that uses none of the eliminated letters is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y).  
- C is a frequent consonant.  
- R is extremely common.  
- O gives us another vowel.  
- N and Y round it out with common letters.

- M I N G O → mingo – not common.
- D I N G O → dingo – valid 5-letter word: N at 2, I at 1, O at 5. All letters allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain by testing letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels: A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters and a good vowel-consonant mix. The letters S, L, A, T, E are all very common in English words, so this should give us useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them are in the secret word at all.  
That tells us the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E.

For the second guess we should avoid those letters and still cover common consonants and vowels.  
Remaining high-frequency letters include: R, I, N, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

A balanced word that uses none of the eliminated letters is “CRONY” (C, R, O, N, Y).  
- C is a frequent consonant.  
- R is extremely common.  
- O gives us another vowel.  
- N and Y round it out with common letters.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

Step 1 – Extract what is known  
- Eliminated letters (x): S, L, A, T, E, C, R, Y, U, D, G  
- Letters that must be in the word (from “-” or “✓” feedback):  
  – N (from UNION: N at position 2 = ✓)  
  – O (from CRONY: somewhere in the word)  
  – I (from UNION and DINGO: somewhere in the word)  

Step 2 – Position constraints  
- N must be at position 2 (✓).  
- O must NOT be at: 3 (CRONY), 4 (UNION), 5 (DINGO) ⇒ O can only be at 1.  
- I must NOT be at: 3 (UNION), 1 (DINGO) ⇒ I can be at 4 or 5.

Step 3 – Build the pattern so far  
O N _ _ _  (because O is forced to position 1 and N to position 2)  
and we still need to place I somewhere (allowed at 4 or 5) plus two more letters.

Step 4 – Choose allowed remaining letters  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the required I.

Step 5 – Pick the simplest valid word  
Look for a word that starts ON…, contains I, and uses only allowed letters.  
ONION is the obvious candidate:  
- O N I O N – all letters are in the allowed set and constraints are satisfied.  

Check:  
- Positions: O(1), N(2) ✓, I(3) but wait – we thought I cannot be at 3 from UNION.  
However, in UNION the feedback said I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at 3, so 3 is not allowed.  
Hence ONION is invalid because it would put I at 3.

Next candidate: ONFMI is not a word.  
Look at two-letter endings that include I:  
ONB I   – ONB_I → “ONIB_” not a word.  
ONF I   – not a word.  
ONP I   – “ONPI_” no.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” no.  
ONW I   – “ONWI_” no.  
ONK I   – “ONKI_” no.  

Actually we need a third and fourth letter plus the fifth letter.  
Pattern: O N _ _ _  
And we need to place I at 4 or 5.

Let’s try I at 4: O N _ I _  
Try ONI__ – the only common word is ONION (invalid).  
Try other letters:  
ONF I   – invalid.  
ONB I   – invalid.  

Next try I at 5: O N _ _ I  
We need two letters from B,F,H,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Z to go in positions 3 and 4.  
Looking for real words:  
ONF K I – not real.  
ONF H I – not real.  
ONK I   – 5-letter word “ONKI_” no.  
ONP I   – “ONPI_” no.  
ONB I   – “ONBI_” no.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” no.  

Wait, there is a legitimate English word that fits:  
O N I O N is invalid because I at 3.  
But we can try other combinations:  
ONFMI not a word.  

Let me systematically construct:  
Positions: 1 = O, 2 = N, 5 = I.  
Positions 3 and 4 must be from remaining letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.  
Looking for real 5-letter English words ending with I:  
- ONFMI – no.  
- ONBMI – no.  
- ONHMI – no.  

Actually there are very few 5-letter English words of the form ON _ _ I.  
One legitimate example is: ONFMI – not a word.  

But there is a known word: ONION, but it places I at 3 which is disallowed.  

Next idea: use I at 4, and choose allowed letters for 3 and 5.  
Pattern: O N _ I _  
Try O N B I F – not a word.  
O N F I B – no.  
O N J I B – no.  
O N K I B – no.  
O N V I B – no.  

After careful search, the only common 5-letter word that starts with ON, contains I, and uses allowed letters is:  
ONION (invalid because I at 3).  

Thus we must look for another letter combination.  
Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with ON and containing allowed letters:  
ONION (invalid), ONKOI (not a word), ONFOI (not a word), etc.  

Upon reflection, it appears the intended word is ONION, but the constraints forbid I at 3.  
Hence we must reconsider placement.  

But recall the feedback from DINGO says:  
D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
This indicates:  
- I is in the word but not at position 2.  
- O is in the word but not at position 5.  
- N is in the word but not at position 3.  

Combining with prior:  
- N must be at 2 (from UNION).  
- O must be at 1 (because 3,4,5 are forbidden).  
- I must be at 4 or 5 (because 1,2,3 are forbidden).  

Thus pattern: O N _ _ _ with I at 4 or 5.  
Looking for valid words:  
ONM I   – “ONMI_” not a word.  
ONF I   – “ONFI_” not a word.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” not a word.  
ONK I   – “ONKI_” not a word.  

Finally, the only common word that seems possible is:  
ONION – but I at 3 is forbidden.  

I realize there must be an error in my deduction. Let me re-express:  

From UNION: N(✓) at 2, I(-) not at 3, O(✓) at 4.  
But O(✓) at 4 means O is in the word and in the correct position (4).  
This contradicts my earlier interpretation.  

Let me re-read feedback carefully:  

Guess 3: UNION -> U(x) N(✓) I(-) O(✓) N(-)  
This means:  
- N is in position 2 (✓).  
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (I(-)).  
- O is in the word and in the correct position 4 (O(✓)).  

Guess 4: DINGO -> D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
This means:  
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (I(-)).  
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (N(-)).  
- O is in the word but not at position 5 (O(-)).  

Combining all:  
- N must be at position 2 (from UNION N(✓)).  
- O must be at position 4 (from UNION O(✓)).  
- I must be in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from UNION and DINGO).  

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ O _  
and I must be at position 1 or 5.  

Let’s test:  
I at 1: I N _ O _  
Possible letters for 3 and 5 from remaining allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.  
Looking for real words:  
INBOX – I N B O X – a valid 5-letter word.  
Check letters: I, N, B, O, X – none are eliminated.  
Positions: I(1), N(2), O(4) – all constraints satisfied.  

Therefore the next guess is INBOX.

  – N (from UNION: N at position 2 = ✓)  
  – O (from CRONY: somewhere in the word)  
  – I (from UNION and DINGO: somewhere in the word)  

Step 2 – Position constraints  
- N must be at position 2 (✓).  
- O must NOT be at: 3 (CRONY), 4 (UNION), 5 (DINGO) ⇒ O can only be at 1.  
- I must NOT be at: 3 (UNION), 1 (DINGO) ⇒ I can be at 4 or 5.

Step 3 – Build the pattern so far  
O N _ _ _  (because O is forced to position 1 and N to position 2)  
and we still need to place I somewhere (allowed at 4 or 5) plus two more letters.

Step 4 – Choose allowed remaining letters  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the required I.

Step 5 – Pick the simplest valid word

ONION is the obvious candidate:

Check:  
- Positions: O(1), N(2) ✓, I(3) but wait – we thought I cannot be at 3 from UNION.  
However, in UNION the feedback said I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at 3, so 3 is not allowed.  
Hence ONION is invalid because it would put I at 3.

Next candidate: ONFMI is not a word.  
Look at two-letter endings that include I:  
ONB I   – ONB_I → “ONIB_” not a word.  
ONF I   – not a word.  
ONP I   – “ONPI_” no.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” no.  
ONW I   – “ONWI_” no.  
ONK I   – “ONKI_” no.  

Actually we need a third and fourth letter plus the fifth letter.  
Pattern: O N _ _ _  
And we need to place I at 4 or 5.

Let’s try I at 4: O N _ I _  
Try ONI__ – the only common word is ONION (invalid).  
Try other letters:  
ONF I   – invalid.  
ONB I   – invalid.  

Next try I at 5: O N _ _ I  
We need two letters from B,F,H,J,K,M,P,V,W,X,Z to go in positions 3 and 4.  
Looking for real words:  
ONF K I – not real.  
ONF H I – not real.  
ONK I   – 5-letter word “ONKI_” no.  
ONP I   – “ONPI_” no.  
ONB I   – “ONBI_” no.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” no.  

Wait, there is a legitimate English word that fits:  
O N I O N is invalid because I at 3.  
But we can try other combinations:  
ONFMI not a word.  

Let me systematically construct:  
Positions: 1 = O, 2 = N, 5 = I.  
Positions 3 and 4 must be from remaining letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.  
Looking for real 5-letter English words ending with I:  
- ONFMI – no.  
- ONBMI – no.  
- ONHMI – no.  

Actually there are very few 5-letter English words of the form ON _ _ I.  
One legitimate example is: ONFMI – not a word.  

But there is a known word: ONION, but it places I at 3 which is disallowed.  

Next idea: use I at 4, and choose allowed letters for 3 and 5.  
Pattern: O N _ I _  
Try O N B I F – not a word.  
O N F I B – no.  
O N J I B – no.  
O N K I B – no.  
O N V I B – no.  

After careful search, the only common 5-letter word that starts with ON, contains I, and uses allowed letters is:  
ONION (invalid because I at 3).  

Thus we must look for another letter combination.  
Let me list valid 5-letter words starting with ON and containing allowed letters:  
ONION (invalid), ONKOI (not a word), ONFOI (not a word), etc.  

Upon reflection, it appears the intended word is ONION, but the constraints forbid I at 3.  
Hence we must reconsider placement.  

But recall the feedback from DINGO says:  
D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
This indicates:  
- I is in the word but not at position 2.  
- O is in the word but not at position 5.  
- N is in the word but not at position 3.  

Combining with prior:  
- N must be at 2 (from UNION).  
- O must be at 1 (because 3,4,5 are forbidden).  
- I must be at 4 or 5 (because 1,2,3 are forbidden).  

Thus pattern: O N _ _ _ with I at 4 or 5.  
Looking for valid words:  
ONM I   – “ONMI_” not a word.  
ONF I   – “ONFI_” not a word.  
ONV I   – “ONVI_” not a word.  
ONK I   – “ONKI_” not a word.  

Finally, the only common word that seems possible is:  
ONION – but I at 3 is forbidden.  

I realize there must be an error in my deduction. Let me re-express:  

From UNION: N(✓) at 2, I(-) not at 3, O(✓) at 4.  
But O(✓) at 4 means O is in the word and in the correct position (4).  
This contradicts my earlier interpretation.  

Let me re-read feedback carefully:  

Guess 3: UNION -> U(x) N(✓) I(-) O(✓) N(-)  
This means:  
- N is in position 2 (✓).  
- I is in the word but not at position 3 (I(-)).  
- O is in the word and in the correct position 4 (O(✓)).  

Guess 4: DINGO -> D(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
This means:  
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (I(-)).  
- N is in the word but not at position 3 (N(-)).  
- O is in the word but not at position 5 (O(-)).  

Combining all:  
- N must be at position 2 (from UNION N(✓)).  
- O must be at position 4 (from UNION O(✓)).  
- I must be in the word but not at positions 2 or 3 (from UNION and DINGO).  

Thus the pattern is: _ N _ O _  
and I must be at position 1 or 5.  

Let’s test:  
I at 1: I N _ O _  
Possible letters for 3 and 5 from remaining allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.  
Looking for real words:  
INBOX – I N B O X – a valid 5-letter word.  
Check letters: I, N, B, O, X – none are eliminated.  
Positions: I(1), N(2), O(4) – all constraints satisfied.  

Therefore the next guess is INBOX.",Guess 5: INBOX -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) B(✓) O(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
