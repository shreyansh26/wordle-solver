For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Popular and effective starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This gives us the best chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (✓).  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, S, and E are not in the word (x).

So we now know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an O, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Next steps:
- Try to place the O in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid any words containing R, S, or E.
- Fill the remaining three slots with letters that have not been tested yet and are common enough to be likely.

Possible consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, etc.  
Possible vowels we haven’t ruled out: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A balanced word that places O in position 2 and uses new letters is “ADOPT”. This gives:
- A in position 1 (already confirmed).  
- O in position 2 (allowed since O may be in any position except 3).  
- D, P, T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Recap of constraints so far:

1. First letter is A (fixed in position 1).

   Therefore O must be in position 5: A _ _ _ O.
3. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G.
4. Still allowed (not yet tested or not ruled out): B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three new letters for positions 2, 3, 4 and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

Common five-letter words ending in -AO are extremely rare in English, so -A _ _ _O is our pattern. A common word fitting this is A C I D O. But D is excluded. Next is A L I V O – but V is rare. Then A L B I O – not a word. Try A L I K O – not a word. A L I C O – not a word. Next think of A C H O O – no, ends in double O. A F O R K – no. A F I L O – not a word. Try A N I L O – N is excluded. 

Next think of A L I G O – G is excluded. Try A F I N O – N excluded. 

Realize we must pick from remaining letters: C, F, H, I, K, L, U, Y.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Popular and effective starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This gives us the best chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (✓).  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, S, and E are not in the word (x).

So we now know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an O, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Next steps:
- Try to place the O in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid any words containing R, S, or E.
- Fill the remaining three slots with letters that have not been tested yet and are common enough to be likely.

Possible consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, etc.  
Possible vowels we haven’t ruled out: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A balanced word that places O in position 2 and uses new letters is “ADOPT”. This gives:
- A in position 1 (already confirmed).  
- O in position 2 (allowed since O may be in any position except 3).  
- D, P, T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

1. First letter is A (✓).
2. Letter O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in AROSE it was in position 3 and marked “-”, and in ADOPT it was in position 2 and still “-”).
   Therefore O must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters R, S, E, P, T, D are NOT in the word.
4. We still need three more letters for the remaining three slots (positions 3, 4, 5).

Looking for common 5-letter words beginning with A, containing O in position 2 or 5, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Possible structure:
- If O is in position 2: A O _ _ _
- If O is in position 5: A _ _ _ O

Let’s explore A O _ _ _ first (position 2 for O) since that seems more likely.

We need three more letters, not including R, S, E, P, T, D. Good candidates are M, N, L, C, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

A common word that fits A O _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is “AMONG”.

Check:
- A(✓) position 1
- O in position 2 (allowed, not yet ruled out)
- M, N, G are fresh letters
- No forbidden letters included.

We need three new letters for positions 2, 3, 4 and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

Common five-letter words ending in -AO are extremely rare in English, so -A _ _ _O is our pattern. A common word fitting this is A C I D O. But D is excluded. Next is A L I V O – but V is rare. Then A L B I O – not a word. Try A L I K O – not a word. A L I C O – not a word. Next think of A C H O O – no, ends in double O. A F O R K – no. A F I L O – not a word. Try A N I L O – N is excluded. 

Next think of A L I G O – G is excluded. Try A F I N O – N excluded. 

Realize we must pick from remaining letters: C, F, H, I, K, L, U, Y.

A common word ending in -AO is ""AUDIO"" – but D is excluded. Not allowed.

Try A L I C O – C not yet ruled out, I not yet ruled out, L not yet ruled out.

But ALICO is not a recognized English word.

Try A C I D O – again D excluded.

Realize the only possible valid English word starting with A and ending with O using remaining allowed letters is ""AFOUL"". Check letters:

- A fixed in position 1.
- F not yet ruled out.
- O in position 5 (allowed).
- U not yet ruled out.
- L not yet ruled out.

Letters used: A, F, O, U, L – none are in the banned list (R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G).

Current constraints:

1. A is locked in position 1.
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from every feedback the O has always been “-”).
   This is impossible — a 5-letter word only has positions 2,3,4,5 left for O if it’s not in position 1.  
   Yet every guess placed O in one of those positions and it was still marked “-” (wrong place).  
   The only remaining logical conclusion is that the secret word has TWO Os: one already placed in the correct position and the other still looking for its place.  
   English 5-letter words with two Os starting with A and meeting all the exclusions are extremely rare, but the only one that fits is ALOOF.

  First O in position 2 (still “-” from earlier feedback) — but now we have a second O in position 4.  
  Letters L and F have already been tested (F and L are both “x”), but the two-O word must use allowed letters.  
  However, L has been shown as “x” in AFOUL. So L is out, so ALOOF is invalid.

Next candidate: AGOGO – but G was ruled out.

Next candidate: ACHOO – but H and C haven’t been ruled out, but O is in position 3 and 5.  
Positions: position 3 O and position 5 O.  
But position 3 O was “-” in AROSE, so that still fits “in word, wrong position”.  
Check letters: A, C, H, O.  
C and H are still allowed (never tested).  
AGOGO and ACHOO are the only two-O words starting with A. AGOGO uses G (ruled out), so ACHOO is left.

But CHOO is not a valid 5-letter word.  
Wait — ACHOO is actually a valid English word (the sound of a sneeze).  
Letters: A(✓), C (new), H (new), O (position 3, marked “-” before, now second O in position 5).  
Neither C nor H have been ruled out yet.  
Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G, F, L, U.  
So C and H are still allowed.

Hence, ACHOO is the only remaining valid word under these constraints.

Neither C nor H have been ruled out yet.  
Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G, F, L, U.  
So C and H are still allowed.

Hence, ACHOO is the only remaining valid word under these constraints.",Guess 5: ACHOO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) H(x) O(-) O(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Popular and effective starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ARISE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters

This gives us the best chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word right away.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (✓).  
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- R, S, and E are not in the word (x).

So we now know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an O, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Next steps:
- Try to place the O in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid any words containing R, S, or E.
- Fill the remaining three slots with letters that have not been tested yet and are common enough to be likely.

Possible consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, etc.  
Possible vowels we haven’t ruled out: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, and E is ruled out).

A balanced word that places O in position 2 and uses new letters is “ADOPT”. This gives:
- A in position 1 (already confirmed).  
- O in position 2 (allowed since O may be in any position except 3).  
- D, P, T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(-) O(-) P(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current deductions:

1. First letter is A (✓).
2. Letter O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in AROSE it was in position 3 and marked “-”, and in ADOPT it was in position 2 and still “-”).
   Therefore O must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters R, S, E, P, T, D are NOT in the word.
4. We still need three more letters for the remaining three slots (positions 3, 4, 5).

Looking for common 5-letter words beginning with A, containing O in position 2 or 5, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Possible structure:
- If O is in position 2: A O _ _ _
- If O is in position 5: A _ _ _ O

Let’s explore A O _ _ _ first (position 2 for O) since that seems more likely.

We need three more letters, not including R, S, E, P, T, D. Good candidates are M, N, L, C, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

A common word that fits A O _ _ _ and uses fresh letters is “AMONG”.

Check:
- A(✓) position 1
- O in position 2 (allowed, not yet ruled out)
- M, N, G are fresh letters
- No forbidden letters included.

Let’s try AMONG.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Recap of constraints so far:

1. First letter is A (fixed in position 1).
2. Letter O is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from feedback on AROSE and ADOPT and AMONG).  
   Therefore O must be in position 5: A _ _ _ O.
3. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G.
4. Still allowed (not yet tested or not ruled out): B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three new letters for positions 2, 3, 4 and they must not be any of the excluded letters.

Common five-letter words ending in -AO are extremely rare in English, so -A _ _ _O is our pattern. A common word fitting this is A C I D O. But D is excluded. Next is A L I V O – but V is rare. Then A L B I O – not a word. Try A L I K O – not a word. A L I C O – not a word. Next think of A C H O O – no, ends in double O. A F O R K – no. A F I L O – not a word. Try A N I L O – N is excluded. 

Next think of A L I G O – G is excluded. Try A F I N O – N excluded. 

Realize we must pick from remaining letters: C, F, H, I, K, L, U, Y.

A common word ending in -AO is ""AUDIO"" – but D is excluded. Not allowed.

Realize the only possible valid English word starting with A and ending with O using remaining allowed letters is ""AFOUL"". Check letters:

- A fixed in position 1.
- F not yet ruled out.
- O in position 5 (allowed).
- U not yet ruled out.
- L not yet ruled out.

Letters used: A, F, O, U, L – none are in the banned list (R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G).

Thus AFOUL is a valid candidate.

<guess>AFOUL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 3: AMONG -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) O(-) N(x) G(x)
Guess 4: AFOUL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) F(x) O(-) U(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

1. A is locked in position 1.
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from every feedback the O has always been “-”).
   This is impossible — a 5-letter word only has positions 2,3,4,5 left for O if it’s not in position 1.  
   Yet every guess placed O in one of those positions and it was still marked “-” (wrong place).  
   The only remaining logical conclusion is that the secret word has TWO Os: one already placed in the correct position and the other still looking for its place.  
   English 5-letter words with two Os starting with A and meeting all the exclusions are extremely rare, but the only one that fits is ALOOF.

Check:
- ALOOF  
  A(✓) position 1  
  First O in position 2 (still “-” from earlier feedback) — but now we have a second O in position 4.  
  Letters L and F have already been tested (F and L are both “x”), but the two-O word must use allowed letters.  
  However, L has been shown as “x” in AFOUL. So L is out, so ALOOF is invalid.

Next candidate: AGOGO – but G was ruled out.

Next candidate: ACHOO – but H and C haven’t been ruled out, but O is in position 3 and 5.  
Positions: position 3 O and position 5 O.  
But position 3 O was “-” in AROSE, so that still fits “in word, wrong position”.  
Check letters: A, C, H, O.  
C and H are still allowed (never tested).  
AGOGO and ACHOO are the only two-O words starting with A. AGOGO uses G (ruled out), so ACHOO is left.

But CHOO is not a valid 5-letter word.  
Wait — ACHOO is actually a valid English word (the sound of a sneeze).  
Letters: A(✓), C (new), H (new), O (position 3, marked “-” before, now second O in position 5).  
Neither C nor H have been ruled out yet.  
Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G, F, L, U.  
So C and H are still allowed.

Hence, ACHOO is the only remaining valid word under these constraints.

We now have these exact facts:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. O is in position 5 (because the last O in ACHOO received ✓).
3. O is therefore NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it’s already at 5).
4. Letters already ruled out:  
   R, S, E, D, P, T, M, N, G, F, L, U, C, H.  
   Still allowed and untested: B, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   (Among these, only I and K normally appear in common 5-letter words.)

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ O  
with positions 2-3-4 drawn only from the still-allowed set.

We need three consonants or vowels that make a valid English word ending in O, and all three letters must be from {B, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

The only ordinary English word of length 5 that starts with A, ends in O, and uses none of the banned letters is:

A B I K O – no such word
