For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained to narrow down the possible secret words. This means selecting a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A popular strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

Common letters in English include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, L, D. A good starting word might be ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes S (very common consonant)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of letters that could reveal useful information about which letters are present, absent, or in the correct positions.

- L(x) – L is **not** in the word.  
- A(-) – A is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
- T(-) – T is in the word but **not** in position 4.

1. Does **not** use S, L, or E.  
2. Uses **both** A and T in different positions than before.  
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible to keep narrowing the search.

Good new letters to test next are R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.  
A word that fits is “TRAIN”:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gained to narrow down the possible secret words. This means selecting a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A popular strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words.

Common letters in English include E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, L, D. A good starting word might be ""SLATE"" because:
- It includes S (very common consonant)
- L (common)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of letters that could reveal useful information about which letters are present, absent, or in the correct positions.

- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.  
- L(x) – L is **not** in the word.  
- A(-) – A is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
- T(-) – T is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- E(x) – E is **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters to **exclude**: S, L, E  
- Letters **present**: A, T  
- Positions: A is **not** in the 3rd position, T is **not** in the 4th position.

We need a second guess that:
1. Does **not** use S, L, or E.  
2. Uses **both** A and T in different positions than before.  
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible to keep narrowing the search.

Good new letters to test next are R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.  
A word that fits is “TRAIN”:
- T in the 1st position (different from 4th).  
- A in the 3rd position (different from 2nd).  
- Includes new letters R, I, N.  

So let’s try TRAIN.

- A is present but not in position 3 (✓).  
- R, I, N are now also eliminated.

We still know A and T must appear somewhere, so we must place them in positions we have not yet tested while introducing new common letters to keep narrowing possibilities.  
Common unused letters left: C, D, O, M, B, G, H, U, Y.

A good next word would:
1. Include both A and T in positions not yet tried.  
2. Avoid all ✗ letters.  
3. Bring in several fresh, high-frequency letters.

Candidate word: MATCH  
- Positions for A and T have changed (A at 2, T at 3).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of the facts so far:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):  
S, L, E, R, I, N, M, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):  
A (but not in position 2 or 3)  
T (but not in position 3 or 4)

Positions ruled out for each known letter:
A: positions 2, 3  
T: positions 3, 4  

Remaining letters that have never been played and are still legal:  
B, D, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We still need to place A and T somewhere.  
The only positions A has **not** been tested are 1, 4, 5.  
The only positions T has **not** been tested are 1, 2, 5.  

To maximize information, we’ll choose a word that:
1. Uses both A and T in previously untested spots.  
2. Introduces as many new, common, still-legal letters as possible.  

A good pick: ADOPT
- A is in position 1 (new for A)  
- T is in position 5 (new for T)  
- D, O, P are all new letters that have never been tried.

Guess 3: MATCH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) T(-) C(x) H(x)
Guess 4: ADOPT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback (A(✓) D(x) O(✓) P(x) T(✓)) we now know:

- A is in position 1.  
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.  
- T is in position 5.  

Letters still ruled out (all positions): S, L, E, R, I, N, M, C, H, D, P.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ _ T

Unused letters that are still legal: B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know O must appear once among positions 2, 3, or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with A, ends with T, contains the letter O in one of positions 2-4, and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible words:
- AFOOT (uses F, O twice)
- AGOUT (uses G, O, U)
- ABOUT (uses B, O, U)
- APORT (but P is ruled out)
- ALOUT (L is ruled out)
- AWAIT (I is ruled out)
- AXIOT (X, I is ruled out)
- AUDIT (D, I are ruled out)

Among these, only ABOUT and AGOUT are fully valid with current constraints.  
ABOUT is common and uses B, O, U (all still allowed). Let’s choose ABOUT.

Positions:
A (✓) B _ O U T  
But we only have 5 letters, so let’s write it properly: A B O U T.

Check:
- A in position 1 – confirmed ✓
- T in position 5 – confirmed ✓
- O somewhere valid – yes, position 3 (not excluded yet)
- All letters B, O, U are still allowed.

Therefore, ABOUT is the logical next guess.

Summary of the latest feedback:
A B O U T  →  A(✓) B(x) O(✓) U(x) T(✓)

Known facts:
- Fixed letters: A _ _ _ T  
- O must appear once, and it cannot be in position 3 (ADOPT already ruled that out).
  So O must be in position 2 or 4.
- Letters now blocked everywhere: S, L, E, R, I, N, M, C, H, D, P, B, U.

Still-unused but legal letters: F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A, ends with T.  
2. Contains O in position 2 **or** 4.  
3. Uses only the still-legal letters.

Check positions 2 and 4:

Position 2 = O : pattern A O _ _ T  
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need two distinct letters from that set to make a valid English word.

Scanning the list quickly, the only common English word that fits is AFOOT.  
Letters: A, F, O, O, T – but it has two O’s.  
Our earlier feedback never said how many O’s are allowed; we only know at least one O exists.  
So AFOOT is a legal candidate and uses F (still allowed).

Position 4 = O : pattern A _ _ O T  
No common English word matches this pattern using the remaining letters (e.g., AGOOT, AKOOT, etc., are not words).

Therefore the only viable next guess is AFOOT.
