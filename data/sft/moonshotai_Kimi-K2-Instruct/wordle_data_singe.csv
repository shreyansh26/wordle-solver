Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good opening word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid uncommon letters like Q, X, Z until we have more information

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers 5 of the most frequently used letters in English

This will give us valuable information about which of these key letters appear in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(x) → A is not in the word.
2. R(x) → R is not in the word.
3. O(x) → O is not in the word.
4. S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
5. E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S somewhere, but not as the 4th letter.
- It does not contain A, R, or O.

Common letters we haven’t used yet: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

We want to test new common letters while placing S in a different position (not 4th). A good candidate is ""STEIN"" but we already know R is not in the word, so that’s fine. However, let’s try ""TIDES"" which uses:
- T, I, D (new letters)
- S (in a new position: 2nd)
- E (already confirmed in the 5th spot)

But ""TIDES"" has S as the 4th letter, which we know is wrong. So instead, let’s use ""UNSET"":
- U, N, T (new letters)
- S in the 2nd position (different from 4th)
- E in the 5th position (confirmed)

""UNSET"" fits the rules and tests new letters efficiently.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good opening word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Use common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid uncommon letters like Q, X, Z until we have more information

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers 5 of the most frequently used letters in English

This will give us valuable information about which of these key letters appear in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(x) → A is not in the word.
2. R(x) → R is not in the word.
3. O(x) → O is not in the word.
4. S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
5. E(✓) → E is in the word and is in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S somewhere, but not as the 4th letter.
- It does not contain A, R, or O.

Common letters we haven’t used yet: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

We want to test new common letters while placing S in a different position (not 4th). A good candidate is ""STEIN"" but we already know R is not in the word, so that’s fine. However, let’s try ""TIDES"" which uses:
- T, I, D (new letters)
- S (in a new position: 2nd)
- E (already confirmed in the 5th spot)

But ""TIDES"" has S as the 4th letter, which we know is wrong. So instead, let’s use ""UNSET"":
- U, N, T (new letters)
- S in the 2nd position (different from 4th)
- E in the 5th position (confirmed)

""UNSET"" fits the rules and tests new letters efficiently.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s break down what we now know from the two guesses.

1. AROSE -> A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - Eliminates A, R, O.
   - E is fixed at position 5.
   - S is somewhere, but NOT at position 4.

2. UNSET -> U(x) N(-) S(-) E(-) T(x)
   - Eliminates U, T.
   - N is in the word but NOT at position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT at position 3.
   - E is in the word but NOT at position 4 (we already know E is at 5, so this was a redundant test).

Summary so far:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains S (not at positions 3 or 4) and N (not at position 2).
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, U, T.
- Still-allowed common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking for a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Includes S somewhere (positions 1 or 2) and N somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4).
- Uses only still-allowed letters.

One simple candidate is SNIDE:
- S at position 1 (valid).
- N at position 2 (invalid, from feedback N cannot be at 2) — so SNIDE is out.

Try SLIDE:
- S at 1 (valid), L, I, D, E (valid).
- N is missing — no good.

Try SPINE:
- S at 1 (valid), P, I, N at 3 (valid), E at 5 (valid).
- Letters used: S, P, I, N, E — all allowed and tests new letters P, I.

Let’s choose SPINE.

Possible positions left:
Positions 2, 3, 4 need filling with allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Y) plus N and I in their allowed slots.

We know:
- S _ _ _ E (S and E locked)
- N must sit in position 3 (it can’t be 2 or 4, and 1 and 5 are taken).
- I must sit in position 2 or 4 (it can’t be 3, and 5 is taken).
