This is the first guess, so I have no previous feedback to work from. My goal is to choose a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information. I want to use common letters that appear frequently in English words, as this maximizes the chance of getting hits.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

A popular starting word among Wordle players is ""CRANE"" because it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""RAISE"". Between these, I think ""RAISE"" is slightly better because it uses S and E which are extremely common, along with R, A, I.

Let me go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess since it covers five very common letters that might appear in many 5-letter words.

So far I know:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (5th letter).
- R, A, I, S are not in the word at all.

I now need a new 5-letter word ending in E that avoids R, A, I, S. Common remaining consonant letters to try include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc. I also still need to test the vowels O and U.

A balanced choice would include a mix of new consonants and the remaining vowels. “TONER” would be good, but it has R (already ruled out). “CLOVE” has C, L, O, V, E - all letters not yet tested except E. This seems like a strong second guess because it checks several new letters at once.

Other candidates: “CLOVE”, “MONEY” (but has N, O, Y), “BLOKE”, “CHUTE”. “CLOVE” looks the cleanest: C, L, O, V, E - none of C, L, O, V have been ruled out, and E is confirmed in the last slot.

Key facts:
- Positions 5 is definitely E.
- Letters already used and ruled out: R, A, I, S, C, L, O, V, N.
- Letters now confirmed present: U, D, G, E.  
  - U is somewhere in 1-4.
  - D is somewhere in 1-4.
  - G is somewhere in 1-4.

So the secret word is a permutation of {U, D, G, E} with one missing letter (we have four letters but need five).  
We need one more distinct letter that hasn’t been tried yet. The remaining common, untested consonants include T, H, M, Y, P, B, K, F, W, etc.

Candidate 5-letter words ending in E and containing U, D, G:
- The extra letter must go in one of the first four spots.
- Possible patterns: _udge, d_uge, etc.

A quick scan for such words:
- fudge – has F (untested)
- budge – B already not used, but we tried “nudge” so B is still available
- mudge – not a valid English word
- judge – J is untried
- pudge – P untried
- hugde – not a word
- gudge – archaic, probably not in list

“FUDGE” is the most common remaining option. It uses F (new letter) and keeps U, D, G, E.

Check:
- F: not tested before (OK)
- U, D, G, E: already confirmed (OK)
- No banned letters appear.

So guess FUDGE.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

My goal is to choose a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information. I want to use common letters that appear frequently in English words, as this maximizes the chance of getting hits.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

A popular starting word among Wordle players is ""CRANE"" because it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""RAISE"". Between these, I think ""RAISE"" is slightly better because it uses S and E which are extremely common, along with R, A, I.

Let me go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess since it covers five very common letters that might appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback:

1. Position 5 is E (fixed).
2. Letters confirmed present (somewhere in the first four positions): U, D, G.
3. Letters ruled out: R, A, I, S, C, L, O, V, N, F.

So the word is built with the multiset {U, D, G, E} plus one more letter that has not yet been tried. I need to pick a common, still-available consonant to add to these four letters and rearrange them.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested: T, H, M, Y, P, B, K, W, etc.

The only valid English 5-letter words ending in E that contain U, D, G are permutations that add one extra letter. The practical options are:

- ""BUDGE"" (B is untried)
- ""PUDGE"" (P is untried)

We need one more distinct letter that hasn’t been tried yet. The remaining common, untested consonants include T, H, M, Y, P, B, K, F, W, etc.

Candidate 5-letter words ending in E and containing U, D, G:
- The extra letter must go in one of the first four spots.
- Possible patterns: _udge, d_uge, etc.

A quick scan for such words:
- fudge – has F (untested)
- budge – B already not used, but we tried “nudge” so B is still available
- mudge – not a valid English word
- judge – J is untried
- pudge – P untried
- hugde – not a word
- gudge – archaic, probably not in list

“FUDGE” is the most common remaining option. It uses F (new letter) and keeps U, D, G, E.

Check:
- F: not tested before (OK)
- U, D, G, E: already confirmed (OK)
- No banned letters appear.

So guess FUDGE.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

1. Position 5 is E (fixed).
2. Letters confirmed present (somewhere in the first four positions): U, D, G.
3. Letters ruled out: R, A, I, S, C, L, O, V, N, F.

So the word is built with the multiset {U, D, G, E} plus one more letter that has not yet been tried. I need to pick a common, still-available consonant to add to these four letters and rearrange them.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested: T, H, M, Y, P, B, K, W, etc.

The only valid English 5-letter words ending in E that contain U, D, G are permutations that add one extra letter. The practical options are:

- ""MUDGE"" (M is untried)
- ""BUDGE"" (B is untried)
- ""PUDGE"" (P is untried)
- ""HUGDE"" is not a word
- ""GUDGE"" is archaic

""MUDGE"" (with M) looks the most common and plausible.

Therefore, my next guess is MUDGE.

Let me recap what I know for certain.

Fixed:
- Position 5 must be E.

Letters already confirmed to appear somewhere in positions 1–4:
- U, D, G.

Letters completely ruled out (so far):
R, A, I, S, C, L, O, V, N, F, M.

That leaves only a handful of consonants and vowels that haven’t been tried:
Remaining consonants: T, H, Y, P, B, K, W
Remaining vowels: none (only A, I, O, U have been tested; U is already in the word).

So the secret word must be built from {U, D, G, E} plus exactly one additional consonant from {T, H, Y, P, B, K, W}.  
The only regular English 5-letter word ending in E that contains U, D, G and one of those consonants is BUDGE (B is still untried).

But “budge” is the same pattern as the previous guesses, just swapping the initial consonant.  
If that doesn’t work, I’m out of common options, so I’ll try BUDGE.

(If BUDGE is rejected, the only remaining valid 5-letter English word with these letters is PUDGE or HUGDE, but those are less common; BUDGE is the clear next choice.)
