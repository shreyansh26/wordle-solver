For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and is likely to reveal information about multiple letters in the secret word. The best starting words often include vowels (especially A and E) and common consonants like R, T, N, S, or L. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- STARE
- AROSE

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's one of the most recommended starting words, containing S, L, A, T, E - which covers many high-frequency letters and both common vowels.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That rules out any word containing S, L, A, T, or E.

Good remaining common letters include:
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

1. Uses none of S, L, A, T, E.  
2. Hits several of the common remaining letters.

We know for certain the letters S, L, A, T, E, C, R are NOT in the word (they got “x”).  
From CHORD we also see:
- H is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the hidden word:
- uses H, O, D exactly once each.  
- never uses S, L, A, T, E, C, R.  
- has two more letters chosen from the still-untested set {B, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Since O must appear, and it can’t be in position 3, we should try a word that places O in 1, 2, 4, or 5, while also fitting H and D in remaining spots.  
A good high-frequency, multi-vowel candidate that meets all exclusions is “HOUND”:
- H is now in position 1 (allowed, because we only know H≠2).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed, because O≠3).  
- U is an untested vowel.  
- N and D are still legal consonants; D happens to land in position 5 (currently allowed because we only know D≠5 from a single “D” at position 5 in CHORD but it could still appear elsewhere).  

Wait — actually D was in position 5 in CHORD and got “-”, so D is NOT in position 5.  
Therefore D is in the word but not at position 5.  In HOUND, D is again at position 5, so that would conflict.  Let’s pick another word.

Instead, try “PHONY”:
- P is untested.  
- H is now in position 2 (not same as CHORD’s position → OK).  
- O is in position 3 → but O≠3 from CHORD, so this fails.  Need O elsewhere.

Another candidate: “DITCH” — but C, T, E are ruled out.

Try “DOUGH”:
- D in position 1 (allowed).  
- O in position 2 (allowed).  
- U in position 3 (newly tried).  
- G in position 4 (new).  
- H in position 5 (allowed; we only know H≠2).  

All letters are allowed; none of D, O, U, G, H have been eliminated, and we satisfy the known placements.  
Also, this gives us information on U and G as well as re-testing D, O, H.

Therefore DOUGH is a good third guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → all letters x → S, L, A, T, E are OUT.
2. CHORD → C x, R x, H (-), O (-), D (-)
   - H, O, D are in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
3. DOUGH → D (-) (so D is NOT in position 1), O (✓) (so O is in position 2), U x, G x, H (-) (so H is NOT in position 5).

Combining everything:
- Known letters: H, O, D must appear exactly once each.
- Known positions:
  – O is in position 2 (from DOUGH feedback).
  – D is NOT in positions 1, 5.
  – H is NOT in positions 2, 5.
- Other letters used so far and ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, U, G.

Remaining allowed letters (from alphabet minus all ruled-out ones):
B, F, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We still have two unknown positions (1, 3, 4, 5) but since O is locked at position 2, we need to place D and H into positions 1,3,4,5 respecting their exclusions, plus fill the remaining two slots from the still-unused letters.

Exclusions:
- D ≠ 1, 5
- H ≠ 2, 5

So possible placements:
- O is fixed at 2: _ O _ _ _

D must be at position 3 or 4
H must be at position 1, 3 or 4 (and not colliding with D).

Let’s enumerate possibilities where D and H occupy two of positions 1,3,4,5 (with above exclusions) and the remaining two letters are fresh.

Option 1: D in 3, H in 1 → H O D _ _  
We need two more letters from allowed set to fill positions 4 and 5.  
Both must be unused so far (B, F, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
Let’s pick common consonants: N, K.  
Candidate: HODNK – but not a valid English word.

Try HODIN – not common.

Try HODKI – not a word.

Try HODNI – not a word.

Option 2: D in 4, H in 1 → H O _ D _  
Need letters for 3 and 5, both from unused set.  
Let’s pick N and I: H O N D I – not a word.

Try H O K D Y – not a word.

Option 3: D in 3, H in 4 → _ O D H _  
Need letters for 1 and 5.  
Position 1: from allowed. Position 5: from allowed, no restriction yet on 5 except D≠5 and H≠5 (already ok).  
Let’s take B and N: B O D H N – not a word.

Option 4: D in 4, H in 3 → _ O H D _  
Need letters for 1 and 5.  
Again pick common: M and K: M O H D K – not a word.

We need a valid English word.

Let’s try to find real words that fit:
- _ O _ _ _ with O at 2  
- contains D and H somewhere in positions 1,3,4 and D not at 1 or 5, H not at 2 or 5.

Possible words:
- B O D H I – not valid
- F O H D Y – not valid
- J O H N D – not valid
- M O D H I – not valid
- P O H D Y – not valid
- V O H D Y – not valid
- N O D H I – not valid

Try rearranging: maybe H is at 1 and D at 4:
H O _ D _  
Need two more letters. Common unused consonants: N, K.  
H O N D K – not a word.

H O B D Y – not a word.

H O P D Y – not a word.

H O M D Y – not a word.

Try D at 3 and H at 1:
H O D _ _

H O D M Y – not a word.

H O D N Y – not a word.

H O D P Y – not a word.

Try D at 4 and H at 3:
_ O H D _  
B O H D Y – not a word.

M O H D Y – not a word.

P O H D Y – not a word.

Try D at 3 and H at 4:
_ O D H _  
B O D H I – not a word.

M O D H I – not a word.

F O D H I – not a word.

Perhaps the word ends with D:
But D cannot be at 5, so no.

Another approach: use I and N in remaining slots.

Let’s try a systematic scan of valid 5-letter words that:
- have O in position 2,  
- contain D and H elsewhere (D not at 1 or 5, H not at 2 or 5),  
- use only letters not yet ruled out.

Looking through mental dictionary:

- B O D H I – not valid  
- B O D H Y – not valid  
- B O H D Y – not valid  
- F O H D I – not valid  
- F O D H I – not valid  
- M O D H I – not valid

- P O D H I – not valid  
- P O H D I – not valid  
- W O H D I – not valid  
- W O D H I – not valid  
- N O D H I – not valid  
- V O D H I – not valid  

Hmm, none seem common. Perhaps we missed a combination.

Let’s try:

H O N D Y – not a word.

H O M D Y – not a word.

H O P D Y – not a word.

H O B D Y – not a word.

H O K D Y – not a word.

H O J D Y – not a word.

H O F D Y – not a word.

H O V D Y – not a word.

H O W D Y – Hmm, HOWDY is a valid word!

Check constraints:
- H is at 1 (ok, H ≠ 2,5)  
- O is at 2 (required ✓)  
- W is unused so far (ok)  
- D is at 4 (ok, D ≠ 1,5)  
- Y is unused so far (ok)

All conditions satisfied.

Thus the best next guess is HOWDY.
