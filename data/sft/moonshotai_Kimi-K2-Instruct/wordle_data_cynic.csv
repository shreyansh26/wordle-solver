1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

This is the first guess, so there's no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to choose a word that can efficiently narrow down possibilities. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, N, L).
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback.
3. Be a valid English word.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S, T (common consonants)
However, ""AROSE"" doesn't include 'T', which is highly frequent. 

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This covers many high-frequency letters without repeats.

""SLATE"" is widely regarded as one of the best starting words for Wordle-like games, so I'll go with that.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked with “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out entirely: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, H, K  
- Letters confirmed in the word: C (fixed at first position), I, N (both somewhere else)  

Therefore:
- Known pattern: C _ _ _ _  (C locked in position 1)  
- Still‐allowed letters (besides C, I, N): B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, plus the remaining vowels (none left except possibly Y)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Does NOT contain any of the ruled-out letters
3. Contains both I and N somewhere in positions 2-5

Let’s list some possibilities:
– C V I N _ : but V rarely follows I-N
– C I N _ _ : C I N G Y (but G and Y are allowed, G not ruled out yet)
– C _ I N _ : C P I N G (but P and G are allowed)
– C _ _ I N : C M I N I (but double I may be odd), C M I N Y (again, Y allowed)

A quick dictionary check shows the word “CINCH” which uses:
- C (locked)
- I
- N
- C is repeated, but that’s allowed and C is already confirmed
- H is ruled out (eliminates “CINCH” because of H)

Next possible word: “CIPIN” – not a valid English word.

“CIGYN” – not valid.

“CIPNY” – not valid.

Looking again, “CIMIX” – has X, which hasn’t been ruled out, but X is uncommon.

“CIVIC” – has C twice and V, I twice – possible.

But the simplest valid word that fits the constraints and uses common letters is “CIGYN” – but again, not valid.

Re-evaluate: “CINCY” – again, double C and Y – but “CINCY” isn’t a recognized word.

A valid English word that fits is “Civic” – C I V I C – uses C, I (twice), V. But we need N.

Another check: “Civic” doesn’t contain N.

Realization: we must have N somewhere in positions 2-5. Let’s look for words like C _ I N _ or C _ _ I N.

“Civic” is out.

“Cipin” – invalid.

“Cymin” – Y and M allowed, but “cymin” not a standard word.

“Cymic” – no N.

“Cynic” – C Y N I C – C (correct), Y, N, I, C – avoids all ruled-out letters and includes both I and N.

“Cynic” is a valid English word.

Letters in “Cynic”: C (position 1, fixed), Y, N, I, C.

- C (1): ✓ (already confirmed)
- Y: untested, not ruled out
- N: must be somewhere (positions 2-5)
- I: must be somewhere (positions 2-5)
- C (5): untested, allowed

Thus “CYNIC” is a valid guess that fits all constraints.
