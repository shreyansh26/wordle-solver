Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, T, N, S, L. A good strategy is to pick a word with diverse, frequently occurring letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern: A _ _ _ D   (both 1st and 5th letters confirmed ✓)
2. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, L, I, N, C
3. E is definitely in the word but every time we’ve placed it (positions 2, 3, 4) it has drawn “-”.  
   Therefore E must be in position 3 (the only remaining middle spot we haven’t tried yet).
4. H showed “-”, so H is in the word but not in position 3; it could be 2 or 4.
5. Still-legal middle letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word must look like:

A   ?   E   ?   D

with the remaining letters chosen from the still-legal set, and we need at least one of the two blanks to be H (since H is somewhere in the word).

Two possibilities for H placement:
- H in position 2: A H E _ D
- H in position 4: A _ E H D

Let’s choose the first option to keep things simple: AHE_D.

Inserting a new consonant we haven’t tried yet in the 4th spot, and avoiding all forbidden letters, “G” is still available.

Candidate word: AHEGD – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Valid 5-letter word that fits: AHEMD – still invalid.

Another valid word with H in position 2: AHEMD – no.

Let’s try H in position 4 instead: A _ E H D.  
Try “M” in position 2: A M E H D – not a word.

Try “T”: A T E H D – not valid.

Try “G” in position 2: A G E H D – not valid.

Try “B” in position 2: A B E H D – “abeht” – no.

Try “W” in position 2: A W E H D – no.

Try “V” in position 2: A V E H D – no.

Wait, let’s flip back to H in position 3?  But position 3 must be E.

Let’s list all 5-letter English words of pattern A _ E _ D:

- AGEND  – no
- ABEND  – no
- AYED   – 4 letters
- AMEED  – no
- AXLED  – but L is forbidden
- ACHED  – already tried
- AVENS  – no
- AWNED  – N is forbidden
- AYOND  – N & O forbidden
- AKELD  – K, E, L, D – L forbidden
- AKED   – 4 letters
- AYELD  – L forbidden
- ASKED  – S forbidden
- AVED   – 4 letters
- ACCED  – C forbidden
- ABEED  – not a word
- AGEED  – not a word
- APEEK  – not matching pattern
- AMEED  – no

Best valid word left seems to be “AMEND” but N is forbidden.

Wait, let me reconsider: maybe “E” is in position 2 instead?

We have only tried E in 2 once (in ACH**E**D where E was in 2nd place) but in ACH**E**D the feedback for 2nd-place E was “-”, so E cannot be in position 2 either.

So E must be in position 3.

That leaves only:

A _ E _ D

with H needing to go in 2 or 4, and the remaining positions filled from the still-legal consonants.

Real 5-letter word matching A H E _ D?

A H E A D – but we don’t know about second A yet.

Check the constraints:
- A ✓ (1st)  
- H – must be in word, and if we place it 2nd, feedback could confirm or deny  
- E in 3rd (required)  
- A in 4th (not forbidden)  
- D ✓ (5th)

“AHEAD” is a valid English word and fits all constraints so far.

Let’s go with that.

<guess>AHEAD</guess>",AHEAD,"Summary of what we now know:

1. Pattern: A _ _ _ D   (both 1st and 5th letters confirmed ✓)
2. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, L, I, N, C
3. E is definitely in the word but every time we’ve placed it (positions 2, 3, 4) it has drawn “-”.  
   Therefore E must be in position 3 (the only remaining middle spot we haven’t tried yet).
4. H showed “-”, so H is in the word but not in position 3; it could be 2 or 4.
5. Still-legal middle letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word must look like:

A   ?   E   ?   D

with the remaining letters chosen from the still-legal set, and we need at least one of the two blanks to be H (since H is somewhere in the word).

Two possibilities for H placement:
- H in position 2: A H E _ D
- H in position 4: A _ E H D

Let’s choose the first option to keep things simple: AHE_D.

Inserting a new consonant we haven’t tried yet in the 4th spot, and avoiding all forbidden letters, “G” is still available.

Candidate word: AHEGD – but that isn’t a valid English word.

Valid 5-letter word that fits: AHEMD – still invalid.

Another valid word with H in position 2: AHEMD – no.

Let’s try H in position 4 instead: A _ E H D.  
Try “M” in position 2: A M E H D – not a word.

Try “T”: A T E H D – not valid.

Try “G” in position 2: A G E H D – not valid.

Try “B” in position 2: A B E H D – “abeht” – no.

Try “W” in position 2: A W E H D – no.

Try “V” in position 2: A V E H D – no.

Wait, let’s flip back to H in position 3?  But position 3 must be E.

Let’s list all 5-letter English words of pattern A _ E _ D:

- AGEND  – no
- ABEND  – no
- AYED   – 4 letters
- AMEED  – no
- AXLED  – but L is forbidden
- ACHED  – already tried
- AVENS  – no
- AWNED  – N is forbidden
- AYOND  – N & O forbidden
- AKELD  – K, E, L, D – L forbidden
- AKED   – 4 letters
- AYELD  – L forbidden
- ASKED  – S forbidden
- AVED   – 4 letters
- ACCED  – C forbidden
- ABEED  – not a word
- AGEED  – not a word
- APEEK  – not matching pattern
- AMEED  – no

Best valid word left seems to be “AMEND” but N is forbidden.

Wait, let me reconsider: maybe “E” is in position 2 instead?

We have only tried E in 2 once (in ACH**E**D where E was in 2nd place) but in ACH**E**D the feedback for 2nd-place E was “-”, so E cannot be in position 2 either.

So E must be in position 3.

That leaves only:

A _ E _ D

Real 5-letter word matching A H E _ D?

A H E A D – but we don’t know about second A yet.

Check the constraints:
- A ✓ (1st)  
- H – must be in word, and if we place it 2nd, feedback could confirm or deny  
- E in 3rd (required)

“AHEAD” is a valid English word and fits all constraints so far.

Let’s go with that.",Guess 4: AHEAD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
