2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Common first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" because they contain common letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" for my first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S) 
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information

From the first‐guess feedback:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. Letters not in the word: A, O, S.
2. Letters definitely in the word: R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5).

I will now look for a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E,
- Does not contain A, O, or S,
- Places R ≠ position 2 and E ≠ position 5,
- Uses other common consonants (like T, N, L, C, D) and remaining vowels (I, U) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “ENTRY”:
- E is in position 1 (allowed),
- N, T, R, Y are all new letters to test,
- R is in position 4 (allowed),
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Let’s use that.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters confirmed OUT: A, O, S
   - Letters confirmed IN: R (not at position 2) and E (not at position 5)

2. ENTRY → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(✓) Y(✓)
   - Letters confirmed OUT: N, T
   - Letters confirmed IN: R at position 4, Y at position 5
   - E is confirmed in the word but NOT at position 1

Summary of constraints:
- Letters in the word: R, E, Y (with R at 4, Y at 5)
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, T
- E must be placed somewhere other than positions 1 and 5 → possible positions: 2, 3
- Still need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, S, N, T)

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a word that:
- Has R at position 4, Y at position 5
- Has E at position 2 or 3
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible structures:
- _ E R Y _ (but needs 5th letter which would replace Y, impossible)
- _ _ E R Y (position 3 for E)
- E _ R Y _ (but E can't be at position 1)
- _ E _ R Y (position 2 for E)

So the structure must be: _ E _ R Y or _ _ E R Y

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in RY with E in positions 2 or 3:
- FERRY (but T is out)
- BERRY (B is allowed)
- HERRY (H is allowed)
- PERRY (P is allowed)
- MERRY (M is allowed)

""BERRY"" fits all constraints:
- B (allowed)
- E (position 2, which is allowed)
- R (position 4, confirmed)
- R (redundant but allowed)
- Y (position 5, confirmed)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, T)
