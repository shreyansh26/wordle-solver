Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

A good first guess should use these common letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" fits this criteria perfectly as it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(-)  → R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O(x)  → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x)  → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-)  → E is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So we need:
- Must contain: A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Must NOT contain: O, S

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints:
- position 3 or 4 is good for A, R or E
- other letters should be high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out (T, L, N, I, D, C, etc.)

A convenient word that uses all three required letters without repeating any and avoids O and S:
“TREAD”

Check positions:
- T — allowed (not yet excluded)
- R — position 2: but feedback says “R(-)” so R cannot be in position 2 → conflict.  
  “TREAD” fails because R is in position 2.

Try another: “EARLY”
- E in position 1: allowed (feedback only ruled out position 5 for E)
- A in position 2: allowed (only ruled out position 1 for A)
- R in position 3: allowed (only ruled out position 2 for R)
- L, Y — new letters, no exclusions.

So “EARLY” fits all constraints.

Constraints so far:

• Letters that cannot appear: O, S, L.

Positions ruled out:
A: positions 1 (from arose) and 2 (from early) → must be in 3 or 4.
R: positions 2 (from arose) and 3 (from early) → must be in 1 or 4.
E: positions 5 (from arose) and 1 (from early) → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
Y: is fixed at position 5.

We need to place A, R, E into the remaining slots (1,2,3,4) while respecting the positional bans and ensuring each of A, R, E appears exactly once.

Let’s list the only possible distributions:

- If A is in 3:
  – R must be in 1 or 4; but E must also fit.
  – If R is in 1: then E must be in 2 or 4. 4 is still open, so possible word positions: R _ A E Y or R E A _ Y.
  – If R is in 4: then E must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by A, so E in 2: word shape _ E A R Y → need a consonant at 1.

- If A is in 4:
  – R must be in 1 (cannot be in 4).
  – E must be in 2 or 3.
  – So word shapes: R E _ A Y or R _ E A Y.

Candidate consonants left (high frequency, not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

Quickly test one of the simplest valid shapes:  
R E _ A Y → need a single consonant at 3.  
A common choice: “media” won’t work (no Y).  
Try “regay” – not a valid word.  
Try “repay”: R E P A Y – this is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:

- E in position 2 – allowed (banned only 1 & 5)
- A in position 4 – allowed (banned 1 & 2)

  – If R is in 4: then E must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by A, so E in 2: word shape _ E A R Y → need a consonant at 1.

- If A is in 4:
  – R must be in 1 (cannot be in 4).
  – E must be in 2 or 3.
  – So word shapes: R E _ A Y or R _ E A Y.

Candidate consonants left (high frequency, not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

Quickly test one of the simplest valid shapes:  
R E _ A Y → need a single consonant at 3.  
A common choice: “media” won’t work (no Y).  
Try “regay” – not a valid word.  
Try “repay”: R E P A Y – this is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Y in position 5 ✓ (matches feedback)
- E in position 2 – allowed (banned only 1 & 5)
- A in position 4 – allowed (banned 1 & 2)
- R in position 1 – allowed (banned 2 & 3)
- P is new, not ruled out.

- Letters that must appear: A, R (never yet correctly placed)
- Letters that are definitely out: O, S, L, P

Positions ruled out for each required letter:

- R: not in positions 2, 3, 5

We therefore know:

Only one 5-letter common word fits each case that contains all required letters without using excluded ones.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(-)  → R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O(x)  → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x)  → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-)  → E is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So we need:
- Must contain: A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Must NOT contain: O, S

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints:
- position 3 or 4 is good for A, R or E
- other letters should be high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out (T, L, N, I, D, C, etc.)

A convenient word that uses all three required letters without repeating any and avoids O and S:
“TREAD”

Check positions:
- T — allowed (not yet excluded)
- R — position 2: but feedback says “R(-)” so R cannot be in position 2 → conflict.  
  “TREAD” fails because R is in position 2.

Try another: “EARLY”
- E in position 1: allowed (feedback only ruled out position 5 for E)
- A in position 2: allowed (only ruled out position 1 for A)
- R in position 3: allowed (only ruled out position 2 for R)
- L, Y — new letters, no exclusions.

So “EARLY” fits all constraints.

   • L is not in the word.

Constraints so far:
• Letters that must appear: A, R, E, Y (and Y is fixed at position 5).
• Letters that cannot appear: O, S, L.

Positions ruled out:
A: positions 1 (from arose) and 2 (from early) → must be in 3 or 4.
R: positions 2 (from arose) and 3 (from early) → must be in 1 or 4.
E: positions 5 (from arose) and 1 (from early) → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
Y: is fixed at position 5.

We need to place A, R, E into the remaining slots (1,2,3,4) while respecting the positional bans and ensuring each of A, R, E appears exactly once.

Let’s list the only possible distributions:

- If A is in 3:
  – R must be in 1 or 4; but E must also fit.
  – If R is in 1: then E must be in 2 or 4. 4 is still open, so possible word positions: R _ A E Y or R E A _ Y.
  – If R is in 4: then E must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by A, so E in 2: word shape _ E A R Y → need a consonant at 1.

- If A is in 4:
  – R must be in 1 (cannot be in 4).
  – E must be in 2 or 3.
  – So word shapes: R E _ A Y or R _ E A Y.

Candidate consonants left (high frequency, not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,weary,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

A good first guess should use these common letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" fits this criteria perfectly as it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 1.
- R(-)  → R is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 2.
- O(x)  → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x)  → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-)  → E is somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 5.

So we need:
- Must contain: A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Must NOT contain: O, S

Let’s construct a word that satisfies these constraints:
- position 3 or 4 is good for A, R or E
- other letters should be high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out (T, L, N, I, D, C, etc.)

A convenient word that uses all three required letters without repeating any and avoids O and S:
“TREAD”

Check positions:
- T — allowed (not yet excluded)
- R — position 2: but feedback says “R(-)” so R cannot be in position 2 → conflict.  
  “TREAD” fails because R is in position 2.

Try another: “EARLY”
- E in position 1: allowed (feedback only ruled out position 5 for E)
- A in position 2: allowed (only ruled out position 1 for A)
- R in position 3: allowed (only ruled out position 2 for R)
- L, Y — new letters, no exclusions.

So “EARLY” fits all constraints.

Guess 2: early -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summarizing all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   • A, R, E are in the word but each is in the wrong position.
   • O and S are not in the word.

2. early → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(✓)
   • Y is in the correct position (5).
   • E, A, R are still in the word but still in the wrong positions.
   • L is not in the word.

Constraints so far:
• Letters that must appear: A, R, E, Y (and Y is fixed at position 5).
• Letters that cannot appear: O, S, L.

Positions ruled out:
A: positions 1 (from arose) and 2 (from early) → must be in 3 or 4.
R: positions 2 (from arose) and 3 (from early) → must be in 1 or 4.
E: positions 5 (from arose) and 1 (from early) → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
Y: is fixed at position 5.

We need to place A, R, E into the remaining slots (1,2,3,4) while respecting the positional bans and ensuring each of A, R, E appears exactly once.

Let’s list the only possible distributions:

- If A is in 3:
  – R must be in 1 or 4; but E must also fit.
  – If R is in 1: then E must be in 2 or 4. 4 is still open, so possible word positions: R _ A E Y or R E A _ Y.
  – If R is in 4: then E must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is taken by A, so E in 2: word shape _ E A R Y → need a consonant at 1.

- If A is in 4:
  – R must be in 1 (cannot be in 4).
  – E must be in 2 or 3.
  – So word shapes: R E _ A Y or R _ E A Y.

Candidate consonants left (high frequency, not excluded): C, D, F, G, H, I, N, T, U, V, W, etc.

Quickly test one of the simplest valid shapes:  
R E _ A Y → need a single consonant at 3.  
A common choice: “media” won’t work (no Y).  
Try “regay” – not a valid word.  
Try “repay”: R E P A Y – this is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Y in position 5 ✓ (matches feedback)
- E in position 2 – allowed (banned only 1 & 5)
- A in position 4 – allowed (banned 1 & 2)
- R in position 1 – allowed (banned 2 & 3)
- P is new, not ruled out.

Checks out.

   A, R, E are in the word but each is in the wrong position; O, S are not present.

2. early → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(✓)  
   Y is definitely at position 5; L is not in the word; A, R, E are still wrong-positioned.

3. repay → R(-) E(✓) P(x) A(-) Y(✓)  
   E is now confirmed in position 2; Y remains at 5; P is not in the word; R and A are still present but still in wrong spots.

Current constraints:

- Word pattern: _ E _ _ Y  (E at 2, Y at 5)
- Letters that must appear: A, R (never yet correctly placed)
- Letters that are definitely out: O, S, L, P

Positions ruled out for each required letter:
- A: not in positions 1, 2, 4
  ⇒ A must be in position 3.
- R: not in positions 2, 3, 5
  ⇒ R must be in position 1 or 4, but position 4 is open and still unknown.

We therefore know:  
R _ A _ Y  or  _ _ A R Y  

Since E must occupy position 2, the pattern is forced:

R E A _ Y  or  _ E A R Y  

Only one 5-letter common word fits each case that contains all required letters without using excluded ones.

1. R E A _ Y → “ready” would require D, but we haven’t tested D yet; it is allowed.  
2. _ E A R Y → no common 5-letter word in English ends with “eary”; thus the only viable candidate is “ready”.

Therefore the next guess is “ready”.

Current locked-in facts:
- Pattern: _ E A _ Y (positions 2=E, 3=A, 5=Y confirmed)
- Required letters still to place: R (must appear once)
- Letters banned: O, S, L, P, D, C, H
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5, and from previous feedback it was marked “-” in position 1 (from arose) and position 1 again (from ready) – so R is NOT in position 1 either.
- Therefore R must be in position 4.

So the unique remaining pattern is:
? E A R Y

All that’s left is to pick the first letter.  
Allowed consonants (not yet ruled out and not repeating): B, F, G, K, M, N, T, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter English word: B E A R Y → not a word.  
F E A R Y → “fear” + y, no.  
G E A R Y → exists as a surname but is rare.  
N E A R Y → not a word.  
T E A R Y → not a word.  
M E A R Y → not a word.  
K E A R Y → not a word.  
V E A R Y → not a word.  
W E A R Y → “weary”, which is a valid English word!

So the only remaining valid candidate is “weary”.
