2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the letters in the word. A good starting word should contain common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. Some popular choices include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE.""

Here are the considerations:
- **Vowels**: A, E, I, O, U are crucial. ""AROSE"" has A, O, E.
- **Common consonants**: R, S, T, L, N are frequent. ""AROSE"" has R, S.
- **Letter diversity**: Avoid repeating letters in the first guess to maximize information.

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S). This will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From Guess 1 we know:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)
- R and S are not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

Letters still to try: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Consonants most common in this position-set are T, L, N, C. To maximize information, a good next guess should:
1. Keep A, O, E fixed in their known spots.
2. Introduce two new consonants in positions 2 and 4.
3. Use high-frequency consonants we haven’t tested yet.

Candidates:
- A T O N E (uses T and N)
- A L O N E (uses L and N)
- A C O T E (uses C and T)
- A G O N E (uses G and N)

""ATONE"" is a common word, uses T and N, and fits A _ O _ E perfectly. It should quickly tell us about T and N while keeping the known letters locked.
