For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Letters like S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N are very frequent in English words. 

A good starting word should:
1. Have no repeated letters to test 5 distinct letters
2. Include multiple vowels (since every word has at least one vowel)
3. Include common consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- TRAIN (mix of common consonants and vowels)
- STARE (similar to AROSE but starts with S)
- AUDIO (mostly vowels but weak consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

3. O(x) – O is not in the word at all.

- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first, R cannot be second.

Next guess should:
- Reuse A and R (but move them to new positions).
- Introduce other common letters that haven’t been ruled out: T, I, N, L, U, D, M, C, G, etc.
- Since we now know A and R must appear, we should place them in positions 2–5 and fill the remaining slots with fresh, high-frequency letters.

A common second-guess pattern is to keep the “good” letters and swap in new fillers.  
Good candidates: TRAIN is out (uses S and E already excluded). ULTRA uses U, L, T, R, A. DRAFT uses D, R, A, F, T. CRATE uses C, R, A, T (but also E which is out).

Let me pull together everything the three clues have told us.

Known facts so far  
- R is in the word and must be in position 4.  
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
  – That only leaves position 3 for A.  
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: B, D, E, L, O, S, T, U.  
- Allowed remaining letters (still possible): C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ _ A R _  
(third letter is A, fourth letter is R).

We need to pick three consonants from the allowed list to fill slots 1, 2, and 5 such that the result is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at common words that fit _ _ A R _:  
- CHARD (D is banned)  
- CHARM (allowed letters)  
- FARMY (Y allowed)  
- PARRY (R repeats – we don’t yet know if R repeats, but it’s unlikely in a 5-letter word with only one R revealed)  
- VICAR (I in position 2, C in 1, V in 5)  
- CHAIR (R position wrong)  
- FAVOR (O banned)  

Among these, CHARM uses C, H, M which are all still allowed, and fits exactly _ _ A R _.  
So CHARM is the safest, information-rich next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Letters like S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N are very frequent in English words. 

A good starting word should:
1. Have no repeated letters to test 5 distinct letters
2. Include multiple vowels (since every word has at least one vowel)
3. Include common consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- TRAIN (mix of common consonants and vowels)
- STARE (similar to AROSE but starts with S)
- AUDIO (mostly vowels but weak consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
2. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
3. O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
4. S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
5. E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the mystery word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first, R cannot be second.

Next guess should:
- Reuse A and R (but move them to new positions).
- Introduce other common letters that haven’t been ruled out: T, I, N, L, U, D, M, C, G, etc.
- Since we now know A and R must appear, we should place them in positions 2–5 and fill the remaining slots with fresh, high-frequency letters.

A common second-guess pattern is to keep the “good” letters and swap in new fillers.  
Good candidates: TRAIN is out (uses S and E already excluded). ULTRA uses U, L, T, R, A. DRAFT uses D, R, A, F, T. CRATE uses C, R, A, T (but also E which is out).  
Let’s choose ULTRA: it re-uses A and R, places R in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 5 (allowed), introduces U, L, T which are all still possible, and avoids O, S, E.

Guess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(✓) A(-)

1. U(x) – U is not in the word at all.  
2. L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
3. T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
4. R(✓) – R is in the word and is now sitting in the 4th position.  
5. A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we now know:

- Letters known to be in the word: A (somewhere other than position 5), R (must be in position 4).  
- Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, U, L, T.  
- Allowed letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y plus any unused vowels (only I is still possible among common vowels).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 4.
- Has A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4 because R is there).
- Uses none of the banned letters: O, S, E, U, L, T.

A good next move is to test a fresh set of common consonants while keeping A and the fixed R.  
Let’s try: C (common, not yet tested), R (fixed), A (somewhere), plus two other new consonants.

Candidate: C R A _ _ – but we need to reshuffle A since it can’t be in position 5.

Try BRAID:  
- R is 4th ✓  
- A is 3rd (allowed)  
- B, I, D are all still possible letters.

That satisfies all constraints.

What we now know with absolute certainty:

1. Position 4 is R (✓).
2. A is in the word, but after four guesses it has been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3 and 5.  
   – The only remaining place for A is therefore **position 3**.
3. Letters that have been proved absent:  
   B, C, D, E, H, L, M, O, S, T, U.

That forces the pattern: _ _ A R _

Allowed consonants left (not yet ruled out): F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y

We need a real English word of the form C1 C2 A R C5 using only those consonants.

Scanning common words:  
- VICAR – I is in position 2, V in 1, R repeats (but we already have R fixed at 4).  
- VULGAR – contains ruled-out U, L.  
- FRIAR – I is in 2, F in 1, R repeats at 5 (same issue).  
- FAVOR – contains O.  
- VIGOR – contains O and G.  
- VICAR is actually okay because the second R is just part of the word, but we want to avoid repeating R unless necessary.  
- A better fit: FRIAR (but this repeats R).  
- Another candidate: INVAR (but V is allowed and fits).  
- A simpler word: VICAR (but C is banned). Wait, let’s be careful.

Let me list straightforward possibilities:

F A R ? – but A must be third.  
F I A R ? – no.  

Actually, “VICAR” fails because C is banned.  
“VIGOR” fails O and G (G not yet ruled out but O is).  
“FRIAR” fails because R is repeated (we already have R at 4).  

Valid remaining words fitting _ _ A R _ with allowed letters:

- FRIAR – but R repeats.  
- INVAR – I N A R (but INVAR is 6 letters).  
- VICAR – invalid C.  
- VAGAR – invalid G and A repeats.  

Actually, let’s stick strictly to the remaining consonants and common words.  

The most straightforward valid word left is **VICAR**, but C is banned.  
Next: **VIGAR** – no, G not yet ruled out but feels uncommon.  

A better approach: list all consonants allowed for positions 1,2,5:  
F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Check real words:

- V     I     A R ?   → VI A R _ → VI A R ? — VIARY? not a word.  
- P     A     A R ? — no.  
- K     N     A R ? — KNARL? KNARS?  
- F     A     A R ? — FAR_.  
- Actually, “FRIAR” is the most common English word of pattern _ _ A R _ with allowed letters. It’s valid, and the fact that it has a second R is acceptable because Wordle allows repeats unless already proven otherwise, and we have no evidence R is limited to once.  

But we have strong information: R is at position 4, and we have no info against a second R. So let’s try **FRIAR**.

But wait, let’s double-check: R is already fixed at 4, so position 5 can be another letter. So _ _ A R _ with distinct letters: F, I, N, K, etc.

Real word: **VICAR** – but C banned.  
**INVAR** – 6 letters, invalid.  
**FRIAR** – has R at 5, but that’s fine.  

Actually, the only common 5-letter word that fits _ _ A R _ with allowed letters is **FRIAR**.

However, let’s see if there is a better choice without repeating R unnecessarily.  

Another candidate: **NIGAR** – but N, I, G, A, R — G not yet ruled out, but NIGAR is uncommon.  
**VINAR** – not an English word.  

Realistically, **FRIAR** is the only valid English word that fits the pattern with remaining letters.  

So we go with FRIAR.

<think>
Wait, let me re-verify that R can appear twice. In standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat unless proven otherwise. We have no feedback indicating R can’t appear again, so FRIAR is acceptable.

But a better check: list all _ _ A R _ words with remaining letters.

Letters allowed: positions 1,2,5 can be F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Valid English words:

- VICAR – C banned.  
- FRIAR – F, R, I, A, R – acceptable.  
- VIGOR – O banned.  
- VINAR – not a standard word.  

Hence, **FRIAR** is the correct and only common choice.  
</think>

<guess>FRIAR</guess>",FRIAR,"What we now know with absolute certainty:

1. Position 4 is R (✓).
2. A is in the word, but after four guesses it has been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3 and 5.  
   – The only remaining place for A is therefore **position 3**.
3. Letters that have been proved absent:  
   B, C, D, E, H, L, M, O, S, T, U.

That forces the pattern: _ _ A R _

Allowed consonants left (not yet ruled out): F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y

We need a real English word of the form C1 C2 A R C5 using only those consonants.

Scanning common words:  
- VICAR – I is in position 2, V in 1, R repeats (but we already have R fixed at 4).  
- VULGAR – contains ruled-out U, L.  
- FRIAR – I is in 2, F in 1, R repeats at 5 (same issue).  
- FAVOR – contains O.  
- VIGOR – contains O and G.  
- VICAR is actually okay because the second R is just part of the word, but we want to avoid repeating R unless necessary.  
- A better fit: FRIAR (but this repeats R).  
- Another candidate: INVAR (but V is allowed and fits).  
- A simpler word: VICAR (but C is banned). Wait, let’s be careful.

Let me list straightforward possibilities:

F A R ? – but A must be third.  
F I A R ? – no.  

Actually, “VICAR” fails because C is banned.  
“VIGOR” fails O and G (G not yet ruled out but O is).  
“FRIAR” fails because R is repeated (we already have R at 4).  

Valid remaining words fitting _ _ A R _ with allowed letters:

- FRIAR – but R repeats.  
- INVAR – I N A R (but INVAR is 6 letters).  
- VICAR – invalid C.  
- VAGAR – invalid G and A repeats.  

Actually, let’s stick strictly to the remaining consonants and common words.  

The most straightforward valid word left is **VICAR**, but C is banned.  
Next: **VIGAR** – no, G not yet ruled out but feels uncommon.  

A better approach: list all consonants allowed for positions 1,2,5:  
F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Check real words:

- V     I     A R ?   → VI A R _ → VI A R ? — VIARY? not a word.  
- P     A     A R ? — no.  
- K     N     A R ? — KNARL? KNARS?  
- F     A     A R ? — FAR_.  
- Actually, “FRIAR” is the most common English word of pattern _ _ A R _ with allowed letters. It’s valid, and the fact that it has a second R is acceptable because Wordle allows repeats unless already proven otherwise, and we have no evidence R is limited to once.  

But we have strong information: R is at position 4, and we have no info against a second R. So let’s try **FRIAR**.

But wait, let’s double-check: R is already fixed at 4, so position 5 can be another letter. So _ _ A R _ with distinct letters: F, I, N, K, etc.

Real word: **VICAR** – but C banned.  
**INVAR** – 6 letters, invalid.  
**FRIAR** – has R at 5, but that’s fine.  

Actually, the only common 5-letter word that fits _ _ A R _ with allowed letters is **FRIAR**.

However, let’s see if there is a better choice without repeating R unnecessarily.  

Another candidate: **NIGAR** – but N, I, G, A, R — G not yet ruled out, but NIGAR is uncommon.  
**VINAR** – not an English word.  

Realistically, **FRIAR** is the only valid English word that fits the pattern with remaining letters.  

So we go with FRIAR.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,FAIRY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Letters like S, T, R, A, E, O, I, N are very frequent in English words. 

A good starting word should:
1. Have no repeated letters to test 5 distinct letters
2. Include multiple vowels (since every word has at least one vowel)
3. Include common consonants

Popular strategic starting words include:
- AROSE (contains 3 vowels and 2 common consonants)
- TRAIN (mix of common consonants and vowels)
- STARE (similar to AROSE but starts with S)
- AUDIO (mostly vowels but weak consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

1. A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
2. R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
3. O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
4. S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
5. E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the mystery word:
- Contains A and R somewhere.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A cannot be first, R cannot be second.

Next guess should:
- Reuse A and R (but move them to new positions).
- Introduce other common letters that haven’t been ruled out: T, I, N, L, U, D, M, C, G, etc.
- Since we now know A and R must appear, we should place them in positions 2–5 and fill the remaining slots with fresh, high-frequency letters.

A common second-guess pattern is to keep the “good” letters and swap in new fillers.  
Good candidates: TRAIN is out (uses S and E already excluded). ULTRA uses U, L, T, R, A. DRAFT uses D, R, A, F, T. CRATE uses C, R, A, T (but also E which is out).  
Let’s choose ULTRA: it re-uses A and R, places R in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 5 (allowed), introduces U, L, T which are all still possible, and avoids O, S, E.

<guess>ULTRA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on ULTRA:

1. U(x) – U is not in the word at all.  
2. L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
3. T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
4. R(✓) – R is in the word and is now sitting in the 4th position.  
5. A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we now know:

- Letters known to be in the word: A (somewhere other than position 5), R (must be in position 4).  
- Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, U, L, T.  
- Allowed letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y plus any unused vowels (only I is still possible among common vowels).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 4.
- Has A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4 because R is there).
- Uses none of the banned letters: O, S, E, U, L, T.

A good next move is to test a fresh set of common consonants while keeping A and the fixed R.  
Let’s try: C (common, not yet tested), R (fixed), A (somewhere), plus two other new consonants.

Candidate: C R A _ _ – but we need to reshuffle A since it can’t be in position 5.

Try BRAID:  
- R is 4th ✓  
- A is 3rd (allowed)  
- B, I, D are all still possible letters.

That satisfies all constraints.

<guess>BRAID</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(✓) A(-)
Guess 3: BRAID -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me pull together everything the three clues have told us.

Known facts so far  
- R is in the word and must be in position 4.  
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
  – That only leaves position 3 for A.  
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: B, D, E, L, O, S, T, U.  
- Allowed remaining letters (still possible): C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern: _ _ A R _  
(third letter is A, fourth letter is R).

We need to pick three consonants from the allowed list to fill slots 1, 2, and 5 such that the result is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at common words that fit _ _ A R _:  
- CHARD (D is banned)  
- CHARM (allowed letters)  
- FARMY (Y allowed)  
- PARRY (R repeats – we don’t yet know if R repeats, but it’s unlikely in a 5-letter word with only one R revealed)  
- VICAR (I in position 2, C in 1, V in 5)  
- CHAIR (R position wrong)  
- FAVOR (O banned)  

Among these, CHARM uses C, H, M which are all still allowed, and fits exactly _ _ A R _.  
So CHARM is the safest, information-rich next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know with absolute certainty:

1. Position 4 is R (✓).
2. A is in the word, but after four guesses it has been ruled out of positions 1, 2, 3 and 5.  
   – The only remaining place for A is therefore **position 3**.
3. Letters that have been proved absent:  
   B, C, D, E, H, L, M, O, S, T, U.

That forces the pattern: _ _ A R _

Allowed consonants left (not yet ruled out): F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y

We need a real English word of the form C1 C2 A R C5 using only those consonants.

Scanning common words:  
- VICAR – I is in position 2, V in 1, R repeats (but we already have R fixed at 4).  
- VULGAR – contains ruled-out U, L.  
- FRIAR – I is in 2, F in 1, R repeats at 5 (same issue).  
- FAVOR – contains O.  
- VIGOR – contains O and G.  
- VICAR is actually okay because the second R is just part of the word, but we want to avoid repeating R unless necessary.  
- A better fit: FRIAR (but this repeats R).  
- Another candidate: INVAR (but V is allowed and fits).  
- A simpler word: VICAR (but C is banned). Wait, let’s be careful.

Let me list straightforward possibilities:

F A R ? – but A must be third.  
F I A R ? – no.  

Actually, “VICAR” fails because C is banned.  
“VIGOR” fails O and G (G not yet ruled out but O is).  
“FRIAR” fails because R is repeated (we already have R at 4).  

Valid remaining words fitting _ _ A R _ with allowed letters:

- FRIAR – but R repeats.  
- INVAR – I N A R (but INVAR is 6 letters).  
- VICAR – invalid C.  
- VAGAR – invalid G and A repeats.  

Actually, let’s stick strictly to the remaining consonants and common words.  

The most straightforward valid word left is **VICAR**, but C is banned.  
Next: **VIGAR** – no, G not yet ruled out but feels uncommon.  

A better approach: list all consonants allowed for positions 1,2,5:  
F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Check real words:

- V     I     A R ?   → VI A R _ → VI A R ? — VIARY? not a word.  
- P     A     A R ? — no.  
- K     N     A R ? — KNARL? KNARS?  
- F     A     A R ? — FAR_.  
- Actually, “FRIAR” is the most common English word of pattern _ _ A R _ with allowed letters. It’s valid, and the fact that it has a second R is acceptable because Wordle allows repeats unless already proven otherwise, and we have no evidence R is limited to once.  

But we have strong information: R is at position 4, and we have no info against a second R. So let’s try **FRIAR**.

But wait, let’s double-check: R is already fixed at 4, so position 5 can be another letter. So _ _ A R _ with distinct letters: F, I, N, K, etc.

Real word: **VICAR** – but C banned.  
**INVAR** – 6 letters, invalid.  
**FRIAR** – has R at 5, but that’s fine.  

Actually, the only common 5-letter word that fits _ _ A R _ with allowed letters is **FRIAR**.

However, let’s see if there is a better choice without repeating R unnecessarily.  

Another candidate: **NIGAR** – but N, I, G, A, R — G not yet ruled out, but NIGAR is uncommon.  
**VINAR** – not an English word.  

Realistically, **FRIAR** is the only valid English word that fits the pattern with remaining letters.  

So we go with FRIAR.

<think>
Wait, let me re-verify that R can appear twice. In standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat unless proven otherwise. We have no feedback indicating R can’t appear again, so FRIAR is acceptable.

But a better check: list all _ _ A R _ words with remaining letters.

Letters allowed: positions 1,2,5 can be F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.

Valid English words:

- VICAR – C banned.  
- FRIAR – F, R, I, A, R – acceptable.  
- VIGOR – O banned.  
- VINAR – not a standard word.  

Hence, **FRIAR** is the correct and only common choice.

Wait, let’s be careful.\n\nLet me list straightforward possibilities:\n\nF A R ? – but A must be third.  \nF I A R ? – no.  \n\nActually, “VICAR” fails because C is banned.  \n“VIGOR” fails O and G (G not yet ruled out but O is).  \n“FRIAR” fails because R is repeated (we already have R at 4).  \n\nValid remaining words fitting _ _ A R _ with allowed letters:\n\n- FRIAR – but R repeats.  \n- INVAR – I N A R (but INVAR is 6 letters).  \n- VICAR – invalid C.  \n- VAGAR – invalid G and A repeats.  \n\nActually, let’s stick strictly to the remaining consonants and common words.  \n\nThe most straightforward valid word left is **VICAR**, but C is banned.  \nNext: **VIGAR** – no, G not yet ruled out but feels uncommon.  \n\nA better approach: list all consonants allowed for positions 1,2,5:  \nF, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.\n\nCheck real words:\n\n- V     I     A R ?   → VI A R _ → VI A R ? — VIARY? not a word.  \n- P     A     A R ? — no.  \n- K     N     A R ? — KNARL? KNARS?  \n- F     A     A R ? — FAR_.  \n- Actually, “FRIAR” is the most common English word of pattern _ _ A R _ with allowed letters. It’s valid, and the fact that it has a second R is acceptable because Wordle allows repeats unless already proven otherwise, and we have no evidence R is limited to once.  \n\nBut we have strong information: R is at position 4, and we have no info against a second R. So let’s try **FRIAR**.\n\nBut wait, let’s double-check: R is already fixed at 4, so position 5 can be another letter. So _ _ A R _ with distinct letters: F, I, N, K, etc.\n\nReal word: **VICAR** – but C banned.  \n**INVAR** – 6 letters, invalid.  \n**FRIAR** – has R at 5, but that’s fine.  \n\nActually, the only common 5-letter word that fits _ _ A R _ with allowed letters is **FRIAR**.\n\nHowever, let’s see if there is a better choice without repeating R unnecessarily.  \n\nAnother candidate: **NIGAR** – but N, I, G, A, R — G not yet ruled out, but NIGAR is uncommon.  \n**VINAR** – not an English word.  \n\nRealistically, **FRIAR** is the only valid English word that fits the pattern with remaining letters.  \n\nSo we go with FRIAR.\n\n<think>\nWait, let me re-verify that R can appear twice. In standard Wordle rules, letters can repeat unless proven otherwise. We have no feedback indicating R can’t appear again, so FRIAR is acceptable.\n\nBut a better check: list all _ _ A R _ words with remaining letters.\n\nLetters allowed: positions 1,2,5 can be F, G, I, K, N, P, V, W, Y.\n\nValid English words:\n\n- VICAR – C banned.  \n- FRIAR – F, R, I, A, R – acceptable.  \n- VIGOR – O banned.  \n- VINAR – not a standard word.  \n\nHence, **FRIAR** is the correct and only common choice.\n\n<guess>FRIAR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ULTRA -> FEEDBACK: U(x) L(x) T(x) R(✓) A(-)\nGuess 3: BRAID -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) D(x)\nGuess 4: CHARM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) R(✓) M(x)\nGuess 5: FRIAR -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) R(-) I(✓) A(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let me extract every solid fact from the five clues.

1. Position 4 must be R.  
   – From Guess 2 (ULTRA) we got R(✓) in slot 4; it has stayed ✓ ever since.

2. Letters we have now **confirmed** are in the word (in some unknown positions):
   - F (✓ in Guess 5)
   - I (✓ in Guess 5)

3. Letters **confirmed absent** so far:
   B, C, D, E, H, L, M, O, S, T, U, plus A (see below).

4. The letter A keeps getting “-” (present but in the wrong place) in every guess:
   - A(-) in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 across the five guesses.
   - There are only five positions; A has now been ruled out of 1, 2, 3, 5.
   - Therefore A **must** sit in position 4 — but R has already been locked into position 4.
   - These two facts are incompatible: a position can’t contain both R and A.

Conclusion: No 5-letter English word can satisfy all the feedback shown.  
The only logical action is therefore to state that the given feedback is impossible; nevertheless, the rules still require us to return a 5-letter guess.  
To comply, I will nevertheless give the closest valid pattern that fits every confirmed positive letter and avoids every banned letter, while recognizing the contradiction.

Current forced pattern:  
F _ I _ R   (since F and I are ✓, R is locked at 4, and A is impossible).

A real word that fits is **FAIRY** (Y has never been tested), but note the contradiction remains.

Because we must provide a legal 5-letter word, I’ll submit **FAIRY**.
