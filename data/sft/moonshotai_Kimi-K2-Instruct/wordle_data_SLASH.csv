For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting some hits. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters that are all very common
2. These letters appear frequently across many 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)
4. The structure allows for many possible combinations if we get partial matches

This is a strong starting word in Wordle strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities early.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

- A is present but cannot be in position 1
- R, O, E are completely absent
- Remaining unused common letters: T, L, I, N, C, U, Y, D, H, M, etc.

The word must use A somewhere in positions 2,3, or 5. Also needs 4 other unique letters not R,O,E.

A good next guess would be a word with S in position 4 and A in one of the other valid positions, using other common letters. 

I'll try ""STAIN"":
- S in position 4 (matches ✓)
- A in position 2 (valid since A cannot be in position 1)
- Uses T, I, N which are all common and not yet eliminated
- All letters are unique and only use allowed letters

H cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 5.  

Looking for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ H A S _

Possibilities:  
- If H is in position 1: “PHASE” (P, H, A, S, E) – but E is banned.  
- “GHAST” – G, H, A, S, T – T banned.  
- “SHASH” – S already fixed at 4, duplicate S not allowed (Wordle rules).  
- “WHASS” – double S again, and W, H, A, S, but duplicate S.  
- “WHASE” – E banned.  

Wait, H must be in position 5 because in CHASM we know H is not in position 2, and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as A and S. So pattern becomes _ _ A S H.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,SLASH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting some hits. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters that are all very common
2. These letters appear frequently across many 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)
4. The structure allows for many possible combinations if we get partial matches

This is a strong starting word in Wordle strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has S in the fourth position: _ _ _ S _
- A is present but cannot be in position 1
- R, O, E are completely absent
- Remaining unused common letters: T, L, I, N, C, U, Y, D, H, M, etc.

The word must use A somewhere in positions 2,3, or 5. Also needs 4 other unique letters not R,O,E.

A good next guess would be a word with S in position 4 and A in one of the other valid positions, using other common letters. 

I'll try ""STAIN"":
- S in position 4 (matches ✓)
- A in position 2 (valid since A cannot be in position 1)
- Uses T, I, N which are all common and not yet eliminated
- All letters are unique and only use allowed letters

O(x) – O is excluded  
S(✓) – S is fixed in position 4

Round 2 (STAIN)

T(x) – T is excluded  
A(✓) – A is fixed in position 3  
I(x) – I is excluded  
N(x) – N is excluded  

So far we know the pattern _ _ A S _ and the letters still allowed must include A (already placed) plus four new letters chosen from the remaining alphabet that have not been marked absent:  
Allowed letters now: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need:
Position 1: can be any allowed letter except A  
Position 2: any allowed letter  
Position 3: A (fixed)  
Position 4: S (fixed)  
Position 5: any allowed letter  

Common 5-letter words that fit _ _ A S _ and use no disallowed letters include CHASM, PLASM, BLAST, CLASP, GLASS, GRASP, etc.

From the four rounds of feedback:

Position 4: S (✓)
Position 5: H (✓)

Letters still allowed: any not yet excluded (R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M, F banned).  
The word must be _ L A S H.

The only common 5-letter English word that fits _ L A S H is ""CLASH"", but C is banned.  
Next possibility: ""BLASH"" – but B is not banned yet.  
""PLASH"" – P is allowed.  
""SLASH"" – S is already used in position 4, so duplicate S is not allowed.  
""GLASH"" – G is allowed.  

Among these, ""BLASH"" and ""PLASH"" and ""GLASH"" are valid.  
""PLASH"" is the most common among these.

Let me choose PLASH.

But wait, let me double-check:  
Letters banned: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M, F  
Letters allowed: A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
The pattern is _ L A S H.

Possible words:
- BLASH – B is allowed.
- PLASH – P is allowed.
- GLASH – G is allowed.

""BLASH"" is the first that comes to mind.

I'll go with ""BLASH"".

But let me recheck: in FLASH, L was marked ✓ in position 2. So the word must be _ L A S H. The first letter must be a letter not yet used and not banned. B is allowed. So ""BLASH"" is valid.

However, ""BLASH"" is a valid word meaning ""a heavy splash"". So it’s acceptable.

But let me think again: the word must be _ L A S H. The only common word is ""PLASH"" (meaning a splash or sound of water). ""BLASH"" is also valid but less common. I'll choose ""PLASH"".
</think>

We now know the exact pattern _ L A S H, with L, A, S, H fixed in positions 2-5. The only remaining letter is position 1, and it must be a letter not yet excluded (allowed: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). The only common word that fits is ""PLASH"".

""PLASH"" is the most common among these.

Let me choose PLASH.

But wait, let me double-check:  
Letters banned: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M, F  
Letters allowed: A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
The pattern is _ L A S H.

Possible words:
- BLASH – B is allowed.
- PLASH – P is allowed.
- GLASH – G is allowed.

""BLASH"" is the first that comes to mind.

I'll go with ""BLASH"".

But let me recheck: in FLASH, L was marked ✓ in position 2. So the word must be _ L A S H. The first letter must be a letter not yet used and not banned. B is allowed. So ""BLASH"" is valid.

However, ""BLASH"" is a valid word meaning ""a heavy splash"". So it’s acceptable.

But let me think again: the word must be _ L A S H. The only common word is ""PLASH"" (meaning a splash or sound of water). ""BLASH"" is also valid but less common. I'll choose ""PLASH"".We now know the exact pattern _ L A S H, with L, A, S, H fixed in positions 2-5. The only remaining letter is position 1, and it must be a letter not yet excluded (allowed: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting some hits. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters that are all very common
2. These letters appear frequently across many 5-letter words
3. It has a good mix of vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S)
4. The structure allows for many possible combinations if we get partial matches

This is a strong starting word in Wordle strategy because it helps eliminate many possibilities early.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has S in the fourth position: _ _ _ S _
- A is present but cannot be in position 1
- R, O, E are completely absent
- Remaining unused common letters: T, L, I, N, C, U, Y, D, H, M, etc.

The word must use A somewhere in positions 2,3, or 5. Also needs 4 other unique letters not R,O,E.

A good next guess would be a word with S in position 4 and A in one of the other valid positions, using other common letters. 

I'll try ""STAIN"":
- S in position 4 (matches ✓)
- A in position 2 (valid since A cannot be in position 1)
- Uses T, I, N which are all common and not yet eliminated
- All letters are unique and only use allowed letters

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

Round 1 (AROSE)  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 1  
R(x) – R is excluded  
O(x) – O is excluded  
S(✓) – S is fixed in position 4  
E(x) – E is excluded  

Round 2 (STAIN)  
S(✓) – confirms S in position 4  
T(x) – T is excluded  
A(✓) – A is fixed in position 3  
I(x) – I is excluded  
N(x) – N is excluded  

So far we know the pattern _ _ A S _ and the letters still allowed must include A (already placed) plus four new letters chosen from the remaining alphabet that have not been marked absent:  
Allowed letters now: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need:
Position 1: can be any allowed letter except A  
Position 2: any allowed letter  
Position 3: A (fixed)  
Position 4: S (fixed)  
Position 5: any allowed letter  

Common 5-letter words that fit _ _ A S _ and use no disallowed letters include CHASM, PLASM, BLAST, CLASP, GLASS, GRASP, etc.  
Among these, CHASM uses C, H, M – all still possible – and is a common word.

Guess 3: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) A(✓) S(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge after three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 4  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)  
   – A is in position 3  
   – T, I, N are out

3. CHASM → C(x) H(-) A(✓) S(✓) M(x)  
   – H is in the word but not in position 2  
   – C, M are out

So the pattern is: _ H A S _  
Letters still allowed: any not yet excluded (R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M disallowed).  
H cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 5.  

Looking for 5-letter words fitting:
- _ H A S _  
- must include H  
- no banned letters  

Possibilities:  
- If H is in position 1: “PHASE” (P, H, A, S, E) – but E is banned.  
- “GHAST” – G, H, A, S, T – T banned.  
- “SHASH” – S already fixed at 4, duplicate S not allowed (Wordle rules).  
- “WHASS” – double S again, and W, H, A, S, but duplicate S.  
- “WHASE” – E banned.  

Wait, H must be in position 5 because in CHASM we know H is not in position 2, and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as A and S. So pattern becomes _ _ A S H.

Letters left that haven’t been marked out: A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Need a word ending in ASH with no banned letters. Common ones:  
- CLASH – C banned  
- FLASH – F, L, A, S, H – all allowed  
- GLASH – valid but obscure  
- PLASH – P, L, A, S, H – all allowed  

“FLASH” uses only allowed letters and is common. I’ll choose FLASH.

Letters still allowed: any not yet excluded (R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M, F banned).  
The word must be _ L A S H.

The only common 5-letter English word that fits _ L A S H is ""CLASH"", but C is banned.  
Next possibility: ""BLASH"" – but B is not banned yet.  
""PLASH"" – P is allowed.  
""SLASH"" – S is already used in position 4, so duplicate S is not allowed.  
""GLASH"" – G is allowed.  

Among these, ""BLASH"" and ""PLASH"" and ""GLASH"" are valid.  
""PLASH"" is the most common among these.

Let me choose PLASH.

But wait, let me double-check:  
Letters banned: R, O, E, T, I, N, C, M, F  
Letters allowed: A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
The pattern is _ L A S H.

Possible words:
- BLASH – B is allowed.

""BLASH"" is the first that comes to mind.

I'll go with ""BLASH"".

But let me recheck: in FLASH, L was marked ✓ in position 2. So the word must be _ L A S H. The first letter must be a letter not yet used and not banned. B is allowed. So ""BLASH"" is valid.

However, ""BLASH"" is a valid word meaning ""a heavy splash"". So it’s acceptable.

But let me think again: the word must be _ L A S H. The only common word is ""PLASH"" (meaning a splash or sound of water). ""BLASH"" is also valid but less common. I'll choose ""PLASH"".We now know the exact pattern _ L A S H, with L, A, S, H fixed in positions 2-5. The only remaining letter is position 1, and it must be a letter not yet excluded (allowed: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). The only common word that fits is ""PLASH"".
