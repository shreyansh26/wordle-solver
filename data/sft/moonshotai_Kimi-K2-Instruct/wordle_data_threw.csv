For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)  
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes very common letters (C, R, N) along with A and E which are the two most common vowels. This should give good coverage to identify letters in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ROBED → R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - O, B, D are not in the word.
   - E is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 4.
   - R is still in the word but is not in position 1 (it was already known not to be in position 2).

We now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must appear somewhere in the first three positions (positions 1, 2, 3), but we’ve already eliminated positions 1 and 2 (from ROBED and CRANE respectively). Therefore, R must be in position 3.
- So the pattern is now: _ _ R E _
- We’ve eliminated C, A, N, O, B, D.
- We need to choose two more letters from the remaining alphabet (S, T, L, I, G, M, U, H, F, etc.) for positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with the pattern _ _ R E _:
- SPIRE, STARE, SIREN, SHIRE, etc. But N is already eliminated.
- FIRE, but F is possible.
- TIGER fits: T _ _ E R, but E is already in position 4 in our pattern _ _ R E _.
- HIRED: H I R E D, but D is eliminated.
- FIRED: F I R E D, D is eliminated.
- LIVER: L I V E R, but we need E in position 4, so _ I V E R, but V is not eliminated yet.
- Let’s check ""TIGER"" again but with the pattern _ _ R E _: that would be T I G E R, but E is in position 4, so this doesn’t match. I think I misapplied the pattern.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ R E _ (from R in position 3, E in position 4).

Looking at valid words:
- SPIRE: S P I R E → E is in position 5 (but we know E is in position 4 from ROBED). So this doesn’t fit.
- SHIRE: S H I R E → same issue, E in position 5.
- FIRER: F I R E R → E in position 4, R in position 5, but we don’t know if R repeats.
- Let me think differently: the word must be _ _ R E _, and we have not yet placed R in position 3, but the feedback says R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. Therefore R must be in position 3.

Thus the word is _ _ R E _. We need to pick two letters for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 5, avoiding C, A, N, O, B, D.

Possible candidates:
- S, T, L, I, G, U, H, F, M, etc.
- Let’s try ""TIGER"": T I G E R. This fits _ _ R E _? No, T I G E R has G in 3 and E in 4, R in 5. But we know R must be in position 3, so this is wrong.

Ah, I see the confusion. The pattern is _ _ R E _ only if R is in position 3. But R could also be in position 4 or 5, but we know E is in position 4, so R must be in position 3.

So possible words:
- URGE: too short.
- PURE: P U R E, but E must be in position 4, so P U R E is 4 letters.
- FIRER: F I R E R → but E is in position 4, R in 5. But R must be in position 3. Doesn’t fit.
- HIRED: H I R E D, but D is eliminated.
- Let me list valid 5-letter words with _ _ R E _:
  - SIREN (N eliminated)
  - CURED (C, D eliminated)
  - FIRED (D eliminated)
  - LURED (L, U, R, E, D; D eliminated)
  - PUREE (but E is already in position 4, and we have P U R E E, but E repeats)
  - GRIPE: G R I P E → R in 2, but R cannot be in 2 (from CRANE: R is not in position 2)
  - SPIRE: S P I R E → E in 5, but E must be in 4
  - Let me think of ""THERE"": T H E R E → E in 3, but E must be in 4
  - MERGE: M E R G E → E in 2, but E must be in 4
  - VERGE: V E R G E → E in 2
  - PERKY: P E R K Y → E in 2
  - HURRY: H U R R Y → R in 3 and 4, but E must be in 4
  - CURSE: C eliminated
  - PURSE: P U R S E → E in 5, but must be in 4
  - SURGE: S U R G E → E in 5
  - TURBO: B eliminated
  - MURKY: M U R K Y → E missing
  - FURRY: F U R R Y → E missing
  - HORSE: O eliminated
  - GORGE: O, G, E but O eliminated
  - Let me think of ""GRIPE"" again: G R I P E → R in 2 (invalid per CRANE), E in 5 (invalid per ROBED)
  - ""PERIL"": P E R I L → E in 2 (invalid), R in 3 (valid), but E must be in 4
  - ""PERCH"": C eliminated
  - ""PERKY"": E in 2
  - ""FERAL"": A eliminated
  - ""HERON"": N eliminated
  - ""SERGE"": S E R G E → E in 2
  - ""VERVE"": E in 2
  - ""LURER"": L U R E R → E in 4, R in 3 and 5. This fits _ _ R E R, but we don’t know if R repeats.
  - ""LURED"": D eliminated
  - ""FUROR"": O eliminated
  - ""LURID"": D eliminated
  - ""MURID"": D eliminated
  - ""PURIM"": M is allowed
  - ""PURIS"": S is allowed
  - ""PURRS"": but E must be in 4
  - Let me think of ""TIGER"" again: T I G E R → E in 4, R in 5, but R must be in 3. So this is not the pattern.
  - The correct pattern is _ _ R E _, so:
    - Position 3: R
    - Position 4: E
    - Positions 1, 2, 5: any letters not yet eliminated (avoid C, A, N, O, B, D)
    - Valid words:
      - FIRER: F I R E R → but R is in 3 and 5. We don’t know if R repeats.
      - LIRER: but is this a word? No.
      - PIRER: not a word.
      - SIRER: not a word.
      - TIRER: not a word.
      - WIRER: W I R E R → W is allowed, I is allowed, R in 3, E in 4, R in 5. This is a valid word meaning ""one who wires"".
      - But let me check if ""WIRER"" is a common English word. It is less common.
      - ""LITER"": L I T E R → T is allowed, I, L, E in 4, R in 5. But R must be in 3, so this doesn’t fit.
      - ""FILTER"": too long.
      - ""HIRED"": D eliminated.
      - ""GIRTH"": missing E
      - ""FIRST"": missing E
      - ""FIRES"": E in 5
      - ""FIRED"": D eliminated
      - ""PRIVY"": missing E
      - ""LIVER"": L I V E R → V is allowed, I, L, E in 4, R in 5. But R must be in 3, so this is L I V E R → I in 2, V in 3, but R must be in 3. So V in 3, R in 5. Thus R is not in 3, so this doesn’t fit.
      - Let me re-express the constraints:
        - Word is 5 letters: _ _ R E _
        - Letters not allowed: C, A, N, O, B, D
        - Remaining letters: S, T, L, I, G, U, H, F, M, Y, K, P, V, W, Z, etc.
        - Possible combinations:
          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" (valid word: to scatter)
          - S L R E _ → no common words
          - F R E _ _ → but E must be in 4
          - P R E S S → but E is in 3
          - S P R E E → but E is in 5
          - S K R E W → ""SKREW"" is a misspelling of ""SCREW"" (but C and W are allowed, but C is eliminated)
          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" is valid
          - G R E E T → but E is in 3
          - P R E Y S → but E is in 3
          - S H R E W → ""SHREW"" (but E is in 4, R in 3) → S H R E W → H in 2, R in 3, E in 4, W in 5. This fits _ _ R E _ and avoids all eliminated letters.

""SHREW"" is a valid English word (a small mammal) and fits all constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R E _ → S H R E W
- Avoids C, A, N, O, B, D
- Uses R in position 3, E in position 4

  - Let me think of ""TIGER"" again: T I G E R → E in 4, R in 5, but R must be in 3. So this is not the pattern.
  - The correct pattern is _ _ R E _, so:
    - Position 3: R
    - Position 4: E
    - Positions 1, 2, 5: any letters not yet eliminated (avoid C, A, N, O, B, D)
    - Valid words:
      - FIRER: F I R E R → but R is in 3 and 5. We don’t know if R repeats.
      - LIRER: but is this a word? No.
      - PIRER: not a word.
      - SIRER: not a word.
      - TIRER: not a word.
      - WIRER: W I R E R → W is allowed, I is allowed, R in 3, E in 4, R in 5. This is a valid word meaning ""one who wires"".
      - But let me check if ""WIRER"" is a common English word. It is less common.
      - ""LITER"": L I T E R → T is allowed, I, L, E in 4, R in 5. But R must be in 3, so this doesn’t fit.

      - Let me re-express the constraints:
        - Word is 5 letters: _ _ R E _
        - Letters not allowed: C, A, N, O, B, D
        - Remaining letters: S, T, L, I, G, U, H, F, M, Y, K, P, V, W, Z, etc.
        - Possible combinations:
          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" (valid word: to scatter)
          - S L R E _ → no common words
          - F R E _ _ → but E must be in 4
          - P R E S S → but E is in 3
          - S P R E E → but E is in 5
          - S K R E W → ""SKREW"" is a misspelling of ""SCREW"" (but C and W are allowed, but C is eliminated)
          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" is valid
          - G R E E T → but E is in 3
          - P R E Y S → but E is in 3
          - S H R E W → ""SHREW"" (but E is in 4, R in 3) → S H R E W → H in 2, R in 3, E in 4, W in 5. This fits _ _ R E _ and avoids all eliminated letters.

""SHREW"" is a valid English word (a small mammal) and fits all constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ R E _ → S H R E W
- Avoids C, A, N, O, B, D
- Uses R in position 3, E in position 4",Guess 3: SHREW -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(✓) R(✓) E(✓) W(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,threw,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)  
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes very common letters (C, R, N) along with A and E which are the two most common vowels. This should give good coverage to identify letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback (CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)):
- C is NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is NOT in the word.
- N is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E.
- R is not in position 2.
- E is not in position 5.
- The letters C, A, N are absent.

We need a word that uses R and E in other positions and avoids C, A, N. A good next guess that repositions R and E while introducing common new letters is ""ROBED"" (R in position 1, E in position 4, and new letters O, B, D).

<guess>ROBED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ROBED → R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
   - O, B, D are not in the word.
   - E is in the word and is now confirmed to be in position 4.
   - R is still in the word but is not in position 1 (it was already known not to be in position 2).

We now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ _ E _
- R must appear somewhere in the first three positions (positions 1, 2, 3), but we’ve already eliminated positions 1 and 2 (from ROBED and CRANE respectively). Therefore, R must be in position 3.
- So the pattern is now: _ _ R E _
- We’ve eliminated C, A, N, O, B, D.
- We need to choose two more letters from the remaining alphabet (S, T, L, I, G, M, U, H, F, etc.) for positions 1 and 2, forming a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with the pattern _ _ R E _:
- SPIRE, STARE, SIREN, SHIRE, etc. But N is already eliminated.
- FIRE, but F is possible.
- TIGER fits: T _ _ E R, but E is already in position 4 in our pattern _ _ R E _.
- HIRED: H I R E D, but D is eliminated.
- FIRED: F I R E D, D is eliminated.
- LIVER: L I V E R, but we need E in position 4, so _ I V E R, but V is not eliminated yet.
- Let’s check ""TIGER"" again but with the pattern _ _ R E _: that would be T I G E R, but E is in position 4, so this doesn’t match. I think I misapplied the pattern.

Wait, the pattern is _ _ R E _ (from R in position 3, E in position 4).

Looking at valid words:
- SPIRE: S P I R E → E is in position 5 (but we know E is in position 4 from ROBED). So this doesn’t fit.
- SHIRE: S H I R E → same issue, E in position 5.
- FIRER: F I R E R → E in position 4, R in position 5, but we don’t know if R repeats.
- Let me think differently: the word must be _ _ R E _, and we have not yet placed R in position 3, but the feedback says R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. Therefore R must be in position 3.

Thus the word is _ _ R E _. We need to pick two letters for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 5, avoiding C, A, N, O, B, D.

Possible candidates:
- S, T, L, I, G, U, H, F, M, etc.
- Let’s try ""TIGER"": T I G E R. This fits _ _ R E _? No, T I G E R has G in 3 and E in 4, R in 5. But we know R must be in position 3, so this is wrong.

Ah, I see the confusion. The pattern is _ _ R E _ only if R is in position 3. But R could also be in position 4 or 5, but we know E is in position 4, so R must be in position 3.

So possible words:
- URGE: too short.
- PURE: P U R E, but E must be in position 4, so P U R E is 4 letters.
- FIRER: F I R E R → but E is in position 4, R in 5. But R must be in position 3. Doesn’t fit.
- HIRED: H I R E D, but D is eliminated.

This fits _ _ R E R, but we don’t know if R repeats.\n  - ""LURED"": D eliminated\n  - ""FUROR"": O eliminated\n  - ""LURID"": D eliminated\n  - ""MURID"": D eliminated\n  - ""PURIM"": M is allowed\n  - ""PURIS"": S is allowed\n  - ""PURRS"": but E must be in 4\n  - Let me think of ""TIGER"" again: T I G E R → E in 4, R in 5, but R must be in 3. So this is not the pattern.\n  - The correct pattern is _ _ R E _, so:\n    - Position 3: R\n    - Position 4: E\n    - Positions 1, 2, 5: any letters not yet eliminated (avoid C, A, N, O, B, D)\n    - Valid words:\n      - FIRER: F I R E R → but R is in 3 and 5. We don’t know if R repeats.\n      - LIRER: but is this a word? No.\n      - PIRER: not a word.\n      - SIRER: not a word.\n      - TIRER: not a word.\n      - WIRER: W I R E R → W is allowed, I is allowed, R in 3, E in 4, R in 5. This is a valid word meaning ""one who wires"".\n      - But let me check if ""WIRER"" is a common English word. It is less common.\n      - ""LITER"": L I T E R → T is allowed, I, L, E in 4, R in 5. But R must be in 3, so this doesn’t fit.\n      - ""FILTER"": too long.\n      - ""HIRED"": D eliminated.\n      - ""GIRTH"": missing E\n      - ""FIRST"": missing E\n      - ""FIRES"": E in 5\n      - ""FIRED"": D eliminated\n      - ""PRIVY"": missing E\n      - ""LIVER"": L I V E R → V is allowed, I, L, E in 4, R in 5. But R must be in 3, so this is L I V E R → I in 2, V in 3, but R must be in 3. So V in 3, R in 5. Thus R is not in 3, so this doesn’t fit.\n      - Let me re-express the constraints:\n        - Word is 5 letters: _ _ R E _\n        - Letters not allowed: C, A, N, O, B, D\n        - Remaining letters: S, T, L, I, G, U, H, F, M, Y, K, P, V, W, Z, etc.\n        - Possible combinations:\n          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" (valid word: to scatter)\n          - S L R E _ → no common words\n          - F R E _ _ → but E must be in 4\n          - P R E S S → but E is in 3\n          - S P R E E → but E is in 5\n          - S K R E W → ""SKREW"" is a misspelling of ""SCREW"" (but C and W are allowed, but C is eliminated)\n          - S T R E W → ""STREW"" is valid\n          - G R E E T → but E is in 3\n          - P R E Y S → but E is in 3\n          - S H R E W → ""SHREW"" (but E is in 4, R in 3) → S H R E W → H in 2, R in 3, E in 4, W in 5. This fits _ _ R E _ and avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n""SHREW"" is a valid English word (a small mammal) and fits all constraints:\n- Pattern: _ _ R E _ → S H R E W\n- Avoids C, A, N, O, B, D\n- Uses R in position 3, E in position 4\n\n<guess>SHREW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ROBED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: SHREW -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(✓) R(✓) E(✓) W(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback:

- S (position 1) is NOT in the word.
- H (position 2) is in the word AND in the correct position.
- R (position 3) is in the word AND in the correct position.
- E (position 4) is in the word AND in the correct position.
- W (position 5) is in the word AND in the correct position.

So we now know the exact pattern: _ H R E W

We only need to find the single missing letter for position 1 that has not been eliminated yet.

Letters already eliminated in previous guesses:
- CRANE: C, A, N
- ROBED: O, B, D
- SHREW: S

Thus the first letter can be any remaining consonant except those listed. The remaining alphabet minus the eliminated letters is:
- Valid first letters: F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, Y, Z, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words that match _ H R E W:

- THREW – T is allowed; it’s a common word meaning “past tense of throw.”
- WHREW – Not a word.
- CHREW – C is eliminated.
- PHREW – Not a word.
- LHREW – Not a word.

Only “THREW” is a valid English word that fits the pattern _ H R E W and uses an allowed letter T in the first position.
</think>

The pattern is now _ H R E W, with only the first letter unknown. The letter T is still available and forms the common word “THREW”.
