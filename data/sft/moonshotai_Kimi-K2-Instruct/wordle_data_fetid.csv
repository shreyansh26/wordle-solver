For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible. 

One popular approach is to use a word like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" as they contain several common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common.

This will help me quickly eliminate or confirm several common letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word at all (x).  
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- contains the letter E somewhere (positions 1-4).  
- does NOT contain C, R, A, N anywhere.

I now want a word that:
1. Keeps E in a different position (not 5th).
2. Avoids C, R, A, N entirely.
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, D, U, P, M, B, G.

I’ll try a word that uses E plus several of these: let’s use “STOLE”.
- Letters: S, T, O, L, E – none of C, R, A, N.
- E is in position 5 (but feedback told us E is NOT in position 5) – so this is invalid.

Next try “TILES”.
- Letters: T, I, L, E, S – avoids C, R, A, N.
- E is in position 4 – acceptable.

I’ll go with “TILES”.

Candidate: “DEBIT” – has B, D, E, I, T.  
– Forbidden letters absent.  
– E in position 2 (allowed).  
– I in position 4 (allowed).  
– T in position 5 (allowed).  
– D, B are new letters.

“DEBIT” satisfies all current constraints.

From the new feedback:

DEBIT → D(-) E(✓) B(x) I(✓) T(-)

What we now know:

- E is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 4.
- D is in the word but not in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.
- B is NOT in the word (x).

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, L, S, B.

Thus the secret word looks like: _ E _ I _

Remaining letters to test: D, T, plus any new common ones (O, U, P, M, G, Y, etc.)

Constraints:
- Position 1: can be D (but not T, since T cannot be in position 1 from TILES feedback), or another new letter.
- Position 3: any valid letter (must not be forbidden).
- Position 5: can be T (since T is in the word but cannot be in position 5 - wait, that contradicts? Wait, let's re-check.)

Wait, let's re-express T constraints:

From TILES: T(-) → T is in word but NOT in position 1.
From DEBIT: T(-) → T is in word but NOT in position 5.
So T must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But positions 2 and 4 are already filled (E and I). So T must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ E T I _

Now we need to determine position 1 and 5.

From D feedback: D is in word but not in position 1 → so D must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ E T I D

Only position 1 remains. Possible letters (not forbidden, not already used): must be a valid 5-letter word ending with ETID.

Possible starting letters: common ones left are G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's list possible words ending in ETID:
- FETID (but F not yet tested)
- HETID (invalid)
- LETID (L is forbidden)
- METID (not a word)
- PETID (not a word)
- VETID (not a word)
- WETID (not a word)
- YETID (not a word)
- GETID (not a word)
- DETID (D is already in position 5)
- BETID (B is forbidden)
- SETID (S is forbidden)

Wait, ""FETID"" is a valid word meaning ""smelling extremely unpleasant"".

Check constraints:
- Starts with F (new letter, not forbidden)
- E in 2
- T in 3
- I in 4
- D in 5

All constraints satisfied.

But we have 6 tries and this is our 4th, so we can afford to guess FETID now.

However, let me double-check if there are other possibilities I missed. Are there other valid 5-letter words with pattern _ETID?

Searching English vocabulary: only ""FETID"" fits.

Thus, the only possible word is FETID.
