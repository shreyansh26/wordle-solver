1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are in the word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as an ideal first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me maximum information about the secret word's composition with just one guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 3
- E is correct in position 5  
- R and S are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

Letters we still need to test: consonants other than R, S and vowels other than A, O, E (i.e., mainly I, U, plus common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc.)

I want a word that:
1. Starts with A, has O in position 3, and ends with E
2. Does not contain R or S
3. Uses new letters we haven't tested yet to maximize information

Looking at common words that fit A _ O _ E, possible candidates:
- ABODE (but D is already tested via AROSE? No, D wasn't in AROSE)
- ANODE
- ALONE
- ALOPE (but P is less common)
- ATONE

""ALONE"" looks good because:
- Fits the pattern: A L O N E
- Uses new letters L and N that haven't been tested
- L and N are very common consonants
- It’s a real, common word

Current known facts:
- Pattern: A _ O _ E  (positions 1,3,5 already correct)
- Letters ruled out: R, S, L, N  
- Letters still allowed in positions 2 & 4: any remaining consonants or vowels (but we already have A,O,E, so only I, U left for vowels).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y  
I’ll try a few common words that fit A _ O _ E:

- ABODE (D not yet ruled out)
- ADOBE (swap B & D positions)
