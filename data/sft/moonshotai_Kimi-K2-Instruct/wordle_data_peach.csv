For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives maximum information. The goal is to eliminate as many possibilities as possible. 

I'll use the word ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- These are all very common letters in English words
- It covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This gives me a good baseline to start eliminating and identifying correct letters/positions.

Feedback recap:
- C: in the word, wrong spot (-)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word and in the right spot (✓)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word, wrong spot (-)

So the secret word has:
- A in position 3
- C somewhere other than position 1
- E somewhere other than position 5
- No R or N

I need a new 5-letter word that keeps A in position 3 and avoids R and N. I’d like to introduce some fresh common letters while respecting the constraints. A good candidate is “SPACE”:
- S T (new letters)
- P (new letter, still common)
- A is fixed in position 3 (matches ✓)
- C is now in position 1 (allowed because C can be anywhere except 1 is false—it was just “wrong spot” not forbidden in spot 1; the dash meant it’s in the word but not slot 1, so slot 1 is actually fine)
- E is now in position 5 (we know E is in the word but not in slot 5, so this is bad)
Oops—E can’t be in slot 5. Let me rethink.

Better word: “LANCE”
- L, N, C—but N is banned!
Next idea: “MACE” – only 4 letters.
Try “CHALK” – has R? No, but K is new. But C is in word but position 1 could be ok (dash only said not in 1, but actually dash means C is in word, not in 1, so 1 is ok). Wait, dash means C exists in word but not in that spot (1). So C can be anywhere except 1. So putting C in 1 would be ok? Actually dash means letter is in word, but not in that spot, so C can be in 2,3,4,5. But we already have A in 3, so C can be 2,4,5.

How about “PLACE”:
P L A C E
- A fixed in 3 ✓
- C now in 4 (allowed)
- E now in 5 – but feedback said E not in 5. So bad.

“CLASP”:
C L A S P
