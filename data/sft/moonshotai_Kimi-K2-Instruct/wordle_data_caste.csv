For my first guess, I want to choose a strategic word that provides maximum information. I should use common letters that appear frequently in English words, and ideally include a mix of vowels and consonants. After considering common 5-letter words, ""CRANE"" comes to mind as an excellent starting choice. It includes:
- C, R: common consonants
- A, E: common vowels
- N: another common consonant
This combination should help me identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)
- E is correct in position 5 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- R and N are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word has the pattern: C _ _ _ E
We know A is somewhere in positions 2, 4, or possibly 3 (but not 3 since A is in the wrong position).
We also know R and N are eliminated.

Good next letters to test: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, etc.
I need a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Ends with E
3. Contains A but not in position 3
4. Does not contain R or N

Possible candidates:
- CASTE: but T and S might be too early to test together
- CABLE: B and L are good options
- CADGE: testing D and G
- CHARE: but R is eliminated

""CHASE"" seems good because:
- C _ A _ E fits the pattern (A in position 3 was wrong, so position 3 is free)
- Tests H and S as new consonants
- Keeps A in position 3 (which we know is wrong, but this tells me A must be in position 2 or 4)
Actually, since A is in the word but not position 3, and positions 1 and 5 are fixed, A must be in position 2 or 4.

Let me pick a word that moves A to position 2: ""CABLE"" - C A B L E
This tests:
- A in position 2 (we know it's in the word)
- B and L as new letters
- Keeps C and E in correct positions
