Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This will help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
3. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This choice will help me quickly determine which of these common letters are in the word and their approximate positions.

2. INLET feedback

   E(-) – E exists but is NOT in position 4 (already knew it’s in 5, so this is redundant)  
   T(-) – T exists but is NOT in position 5 (already knew 5 is E, so T can be anywhere 1-4)

Summary of remaining letters:  
- Must contain A, S, T, E (with E fixed at 5)  
- Must NOT contain R, O, I, N, L  
- A cannot be in position 1  
- S cannot be in position 4  
- T cannot be in position 5 (already satisfied)

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y … but we need to place A, S, T and one more letter (since we have 5 letters total, E is fixed at 5).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E  
- Contains A, S, T  
- Has no R, O, I, N, L  
- Places A somewhere other than position 1  
- Places S somewhere other than position 4

_ _ _ _ E (E fixed) with positions 1-4 needing A, S, T plus one more allowed letter.

Possible positions:  
A can be in 2,3,4  
S can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)  
T can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

- A in 2, S in 3, T in 1: T A S _ E → TAS_E → Need a letter for position 4. Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y…  
  TASCE – not valid  
  TASKE – valid word (TASKE is archaic, but TASK is 4 letters) – actually TASK isn't 5 letters.  
  TASSE – valid (though uncommon, means a drinking cup)  
  TASTE – valid, but T is in 1, A in 2, S in 3, then T again – but T is already accounted for in 1. However, we have T already in position 1 and we’d have T in position 4 as well – but we only know T exists, not how many times. So TASTE is plausible.

Let’s check TASTE:  
- Ends with E (✓)  
- Contains A, S, T (✓)  
- No R,O,I,N,L (✓)  
- A is not in position 1 (✓)

- Places A somewhere other than position 1  
- Places S somewhere other than position 4  

Let’s list candidate patterns:  
_ _ _ _ E (E fixed) with positions 1-4 needing A, S, T plus one more allowed letter.

Possible positions:  
A can be in 2,3,4  
S can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)  
T can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

Let’s try:  
- A in 2, S in 3, T in 1: T A S _ E → TAS_E → Need a letter for position 4. Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y…  
  TASCE – not valid  
  TASKE – valid word (TASKE is archaic, but TASK is 4 letters) – actually TASK isn't 5 letters.  
  TASSE – valid (though uncommon, means a drinking cup)  
  TASTE – valid, but T is in 1, A in 2, S in 3, then T again – but T is already accounted for in 1. However, we have T already in position 1 and we’d have T in position 4 as well – but we only know T exists, not how many times. So TASTE is plausible.

Let’s check TASTE:  
- Ends with E (✓)  
- Contains A, S, T (✓)  
- No R,O,I,N,L (✓)  
- A is not in position 1 (✓)  
- S is not in position 4 (✓, it’s in 3)  

This seems valid.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,waste,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This will help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
3. It's a valid 5-letter English word

This choice will help me quickly determine which of these common letters are in the word and their approximate positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

A(-) – letter A is in the word but in the wrong position  
R(x) – letter R is not in the word  
O(x) – letter O is not in the word  
S(-) – letter S is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(✓) – letter E is in the correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains an A somewhere other than position 1.
- It contains an S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

To maximize information on the remaining common consonants and vowels, I’ll try a word that keeps E in position 5 and checks new letters like L, I, T, N, etc. A good candidate is “INLET”:

- I and N are very common.  
- L and T are also frequent.  
- Keeps E in position 5.  

This tests four new letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate the constraints we now have:

1. AROSE feedback  
   A(-) – A exists somewhere, but not in position 1  
   R(x) – R is not in the word  
   O(x) – O is not in the word  
   S(-) – S exists somewhere, but not in position 4  
   E(✓) – E is fixed in position 5  

2. INLET feedback  
   I(x) – I is not in the word  
   N(x) – N is not in the word  
   L(x) – L is not in the word  
   E(-) – E exists but is NOT in position 4 (already knew it’s in 5, so this is redundant)  
   T(-) – T exists but is NOT in position 5 (already knew 5 is E, so T can be anywhere 1-4)

Summary of remaining letters:  
- Must contain A, S, T, E (with E fixed at 5)  
- Must NOT contain R, O, I, N, L  
- A cannot be in position 1  
- S cannot be in position 4  
- T cannot be in position 5 (already satisfied)

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y … but we need to place A, S, T and one more letter (since we have 5 letters total, E is fixed at 5).

We need to find a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E  
- Contains A, S, T  
- Has no R, O, I, N, L  
- Places A somewhere other than position 1  
- Places S somewhere other than position 4  

Let’s list candidate patterns:  
_ _ _ _ E (E fixed) with positions 1-4 needing A, S, T plus one more allowed letter.

Possible positions:  
A can be in 2,3,4  
S can be in 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)  
T can be in 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

Let’s try:  
- A in 2, S in 3, T in 1: T A S _ E → TAS_E → Need a letter for position 4. Valid letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y…  
  TASCE – not valid  
  TASKE – valid word (TASKE is archaic, but TASK is 4 letters) – actually TASK isn't 5 letters.  
  TASSE – valid (though uncommon, means a drinking cup)  
  TASTE – valid, but T is in 1, A in 2, S in 3, then T again – but T is already accounted for in 1. However, we have T already in position 1 and we’d have T in position 4 as well – but we only know T exists, not how many times. So TASTE is plausible.

Let’s check TASTE:  
- Ends with E (✓)  
- Contains A, S, T (✓)  
- No R,O,I,N,L (✓)  
- A is not in position 1 (✓)  
- S is not in position 4 (✓, it’s in 3)  

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) L(x) E(-) T(-)
Guess 3: TASTE -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on TASTE:
- T(-) : T is in the word but not in position 1 → so T must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- A(✓) : A is in the word and in the correct position → position 2 is A.
- S(✓) : S is in the word and in the correct position → position 3 is S.
- T(✓) : T is in the word and in the correct position → position 4 is T.
- E(✓) : E is in the word and in the correct position → position 5 is E.

Therefore the word is _ A S T E.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with any consonant except the ones already excluded (R, O, I, N, L), and fits the pattern _ A S T E.

The only common word that fits this pattern is ""HASTE"".

Let's verify:
- H – not yet ruled out (not in any feedback as absent).
- A, S, T, E are confirmed in their positions.
- No forbidden letters.
