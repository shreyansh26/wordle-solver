Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word, even if not in the right position).

Some good starting words include: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a nice spread of common consonants and vowels that should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- S and T are not in the word (x)
- L and A are present but in wrong positions (-)
- E is correct and in the correct last position (✓)

So the secret word has:
- 4th letter = E
- Contains L and A somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3)
- Does not contain S or T

Possible positions for L and A:
- L could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 3, or 5)
- A could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5)

Since we want to test new letters while placing L and A in possible new positions, a good next guess is ""PLANE"":
- P: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (was position 2 in SLATE, so testing if it's in position 2 is fine since we don't know its exact position)
- A: moved to position 3
- N: new letter to test
- E: already confirmed correct in position 5

Wait, this might not be optimal because L was in position 2 in SLATE and got (-), so it can't be in position 2 again. Let me rethink.

Better positions:
L can be 1, 3, or 5
A can be 1, 2, or 5

2. The word contains L and A somewhere, but:
   - L is NOT in positions 2 (SLATE) or 1 (LOAVE).
   - A is NOT in positions 3 (SLATE) or 3 (LOAVE).
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, O, V.

We still have no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize info while respecting constraints, choose a word that:
- Keeps E in slot 5,
- Places L and A in their remaining possible slots,
- Introduces several new common consonants.

Good candidates:
- ALONE – but O is out.
- PLANE – P, N new; L in 3, A in 2 – respects constraints.
- CLONE – C, N new; L in 3, but O is out.
- CRANE – C, R, N new; A in 2; doesn’t contain L – violates requirement.

L must be in 3 or 4.
A must be in 1 or 2.

Try CRANE: lacks L.
Try FLAKE: F new, L in 3, A in 2, K new, E ok – looks valid.

FLAKE:
- F new
- L in 3 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3)
- K new
- E in 5 ok

This meets all constraints and introduces two new consonants (F, K).",Guess 3: FLAKE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(-) K(-) E(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,ANKLE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word, even if not in the right position).

Some good starting words include: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a nice spread of common consonants and vowels that should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S and T are not in the word (x)
- L and A are present but in wrong positions (-)
- E is correct and in the correct last position (✓)

So the secret word has:
- 4th letter = E
- Contains L and A somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3)
- Does not contain S or T

Possible positions for L and A:
- L could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 3, or 5)
- A could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5)

Since we want to test new letters while placing L and A in possible new positions, a good next guess is ""PLANE"":
- P: new letter to test
- L: moved to position 2 (was position 2 in SLATE, so testing if it's in position 2 is fine since we don't know its exact position)
- A: moved to position 3
- N: new letter to test
- E: already confirmed correct in position 5

Wait, this might not be optimal because L was in position 2 in SLATE and got (-), so it can't be in position 2 again. Let me rethink.

Better positions:
L can be 1, 3, or 5
A can be 1, 2, or 5

Let me choose ""FLAKE"":
- F: new letter
- L: moved to position 2 (but L can't be in position 2, so bad)
Oops.

""ALONE"":
- A: in position 1 (possible)
- L: in position 2 (but L can't be in position 2, since it was (-) there)
No.

""LEAFY"":
- L in 1 (ok)
- E in 2 (but E must be in 5)
No.

""CRANE"":
- C, R, N new letters
- A in 2
- E in 5 (correct)
L is not in this word, which is bad since we know L must be in.

""PLANE"":
- P new
- L in 2 (invalid, was (-) there)
No.

""GLADE"":
- G new
- L in 2 (invalid)
No.

""BLAME"":
- B new
- L in 2 (invalid)
No.

""CLAVE"":
- C new
- L in 2 (invalid)
No.

""FLAME"":
- F new
- L in 2 (invalid)
No.

I need words where L is not in position 2. Let me pick a word with L in 1, 3 or 5.

""LOAVE"" - but O and V are new, A in 3, E in 5. L in 1.

""LOAVE"":
- L in 1
- O new
- A in 3
- V new
- E in 5

This tests L in 1, A in 3, and new letters O, V. Seems good.

<guess>LOAVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: LOAVE -> FEEDBACK: L(-) O(x) A(-) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
LOAVE → L(-) O(x) A(-) V(x) E(✓)

Known facts:
1. E is in position 5 (✓ both times).
2. The word contains L and A somewhere, but:
   - L is NOT in positions 2 (SLATE) or 1 (LOAVE).
   - A is NOT in positions 3 (SLATE) or 3 (LOAVE).
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, O, V.

Possible positions so far:
- L can be 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E) → 3 or 4.
- A can be 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is E) → 1 or 2.

We still have no info on B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize info while respecting constraints, choose a word that:
- Keeps E in slot 5,
- Places L and A in their remaining possible slots,
- Introduces several new common consonants.

Good candidates:
- ALONE – but O is out.
- PLANE – P, N new; L in 3, A in 2 – respects constraints.
- CLONE – C, N new; L in 3, but O is out.
- CRANE – C, R, N new; A in 2; doesn’t contain L – violates requirement.

So let’s use PLANE:
- P / new
- L / in 2 (but L can’t be in 2 from SLATE) – oops, conflict.

Wait, L can’t be in 2 or 1 → positions 3 or 4 only.

Let’s list valid placements:
Word shape: _ _ _ _ E
L must be in 3 or 4.
A must be in 1 or 2.

Try CRANE: lacks L.
Try FLAKE: F new, L in 3, A in 2, K new, E ok – looks valid.

FLAKE:
- F new
- L in 3 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from 3)
- K new
- E in 5 ok

This meets all constraints and introduces two new consonants (F, K).

Step-by-step deduction:

1. E is locked in position 5 (✓ every time).

   - K (present but never correct spot)

3. Letters already ruled OUT: S, T, O, V, F.

4. Current positional constraints:
   - L cannot be 1, 2, or 3 (because LOAVE, SLATE, FLAKE all gave ""-"" for L in those spots).  
     So L must be in position 4 (only remaining).
   - A cannot be 3 (from SLATE, LOAVE, FLAKE all gave ""-"" for A in 3).  
     So A must be in 1 or 2.
