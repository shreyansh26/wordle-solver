2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is my first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that includes common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A good first guess should cover several of these to quickly narrow down possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in positions that are good initial tests.

All five letters in AROSE – A, R, O, S, E – were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word containing any of those letters.

To extract the most information on the next guess while avoiding the ruled-out letters, I’ll pick a word that uses several of the still-possible consonants plus a vowel that wasn’t in AROSE.

   - N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (✓ tells us it is now correctly placed in position 4)

3. Still-available letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the two fixed letters N and T.

We need a 5-letter pattern:
 _  _  I  N  _
with T in either the first or second blank, and the remaining blank filled from the allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:
T _ I N _  or  _ T I N _

Let’s pick the first pattern and choose an unused, fairly common remaining consonant for the second position. The letter “H” is still available and common enough.

Word: T H I N _

Now we need a final letter for position 5 that hasn’t been eliminated. From the still-allowed set, “K” is a good choice, giving “THINK”.
Check: T, H, I, N, K — none of these have been marked absent, and it satisfies all positional constraints.

So the next logical guess is THINK.

Word: T H I N _

Now we need a final letter for position 5 that hasn’t been eliminated. From the still-allowed set, “K” is a good choice, giving “THINK”.
Check: T, H, I, N, K — none of these have been marked absent, and it satisfies all positional constraints.

So the next logical guess is THINK.",Guess 4: THINK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
