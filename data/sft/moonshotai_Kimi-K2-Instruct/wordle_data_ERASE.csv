For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize information gain. Wordle experts often recommend starting with words that contain common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English:
- Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N
- Good consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A strategic first guess would include:
- Common vowels (like A and E)
- Common consonants (like R, S, T)

Some popular starting words are:
- STARE (S,T,A,R,E)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good information about multiple common letters in the secret word.

S(-) – S is in the word but not at position 1.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct spot (position 3).  
R(-) – R is in the word but not at position 4.

- Letter to exclude: T

  – S cannot be in position 1.  
  – R cannot be in position 4.

I want to test new letters while respecting the placement rules. Good candidates should:
1. Place S and R in new positions not ruled out.
2. Avoid T.
3. Introduce new common consonants (like L, N, C) or vowels (O, I).

Some possibilities:
- SHARE – but R cannot be in position 4.
- SNARE – R again in position 4 (invalid).
- CRANE – T is already out, but C is new; R would go in position 2 (not ruled out), N is new.
- SLATE – T is ruled out.
- SPARE – P is new, R would be in position 2 (OK), S in 1 is invalid (feedback says S not in 1).
- CRASE – R in 2 (OK), C new, but E is already known to be final so 5th letter must be E.

• Letter placements still restricted:
  – S cannot be in position 1 (Guess 1 feedback), so S must be in position 4.
  – We still need a letter for position 1 that is not C, N, T.

So the only remaining open slot is position 1, and we need a letter that:
  – Has not been ruled out (not C, N, T).
  – Can fit with S in position 4: _ R A S E.

The word must be “_RASE”.  
We still need a valid first letter (not C, N, T).

Possible English 5-letter words ending in -RASE:
- ERASE (E is already used in position 5, so not valid)
- PRASE (but “PRASE” is not a common 5-letter English word)
- BRASE (not a common word)
- GRASE (not a word)
- FRASE (not a word)

- “ARISE” would have A in 1, but we know A must be in position 3. So that’s invalid.

But actually, “ERASE” is a valid word, and it has E in position 5, which is allowed because E is already confirmed there. The other E in position 1 doesn’t conflict.

So “ERASE” is the only valid_looking candidate fitting _RASE. Let’s verify:

- Pattern: _ R A S E
- E in position 1: allowed (no restriction on extra E)
- S in position 4: allowed (only restriction was S not in position 1, which is satisfied)
- R in position 2: confirmed ✓
