Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that will give me maximum information. The best strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels that can help eliminate or confirm many letters at once. 

Good starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
- No repeating letters

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters or positions right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains:
- A (not in position 1)
- O (not in position 3)
- S (not in position 4)
- DOES NOT contain R or E

We still need to test for other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) to narrow down the remaining letters. A good second guess will:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S)
2. Move them to new positions
3. Introduce new letters

Looking at possible positions:
- A cannot be in position 1
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4

Let's try a word like ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3)
- S (confirmed, now in position 4) - but this violates the S not in position 4 rule!

Better option: ""TOAST"":
- T (new letter)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3)
- S (confirmed, now in position 4) - again violates S not in position 4

Alternative: ""SOLAN"":
- S (confirmed, now in position 1)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- L (new letter)
- A (confirmed, now in position 4)
- N (new letter)

This moves all confirmed letters to new positions and introduces 3 new letters (S, L, N).

However, ""SOLAN"" might not be the most efficient. Let's try ""STOMA"":
- S (position 1, new for S)
- T (new letter)
- O (position 3, but O cannot be here - bad)

Better: ""SONAR"":
- S (position 1)
- O (position 2)
- N (new)
- A (position 4)
- R (but R is confirmed not in word - bad)

Next: ""STOIC"":
- S (position 1)
- T (new)
- O (position 3 - but O can't be here)
  
""STOIC"" is invalid due to O position. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (position 1)
- A (position 2)
- L (new)
- O (position 4)
- N (new)

This keeps all confirmed letters and doesn't violate any position rules.

But actually, ""COATS"" might be better:
- C (new)
- O (position 2)
- A (position 3)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions:
- C in position 1  (✓)
- A in position 3  (✓)  
- S in position 5  (✓)

Letters that ARE in the word but are NOT yet in the correct position:
- O (was in position 3 in COATS, wrong spot; was in position 3 in AROSE, also wrong)
  – so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  – Position 5 is already S, so O must be in position 2 or 4.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, E, T

Known pattern so far:
C _ A _ S with O still to place.

Possible placements for O:
- Position 2 → C O A _ S
- Position 4 → C _ A O S

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches one of these two patterns and contains only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Let’s check the first pattern C O A _ S:
The missing letter (position 4) can be any consonant not yet eliminated. Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested include N, L, D, P, etc.  
Possible words: COANS, COALS, COADS, COAPS …  
“COALS” is a real word, so that’s a candidate.

Second pattern C _ A O S:
The missing letter (position 2) can be any consonant.  
Possible words: CNAOS – not valid, CLAOS – not valid, CPAOS – not valid, etc.  
No common English word seems to fit C?AOS.

Therefore the only plausible word is COALS (C O A L S).

Let’s verify letters:
- C (confirmed)  
- O (confirmed, now in position 2 – acceptable)  
- A (confirmed, position 3)  
- L (new letter)  
- S (confirmed, position 5)

This satisfies all constraints and gives us the next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels that can help eliminate or confirm many letters at once. 

Good starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
- No repeating letters

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct

This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters or positions right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word contains:
- A (not in position 1)
- O (not in position 3)
- S (not in position 4)
- DOES NOT contain R or E

We still need to test for other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) to narrow down the remaining letters. A good second guess will:
1. Keep the confirmed letters (A, O, S)
2. Move them to new positions
3. Introduce new letters

Looking at possible positions:
- A cannot be in position 1
- O cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4

Let's try a word like ""COAST"":
- C (new letter)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3)
- S (confirmed, now in position 4) - but this violates the S not in position 4 rule!

Better option: ""TOAST"":
- T (new letter)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- A (confirmed, now in position 3)
- S (confirmed, now in position 4) - again violates S not in position 4

Alternative: ""SOLAN"":
- S (confirmed, now in position 1)
- O (confirmed, now in position 2)
- L (new letter)
- A (confirmed, now in position 4)
- N (new letter)

This moves all confirmed letters to new positions and introduces 3 new letters (S, L, N).

However, ""SOLAN"" might not be the most efficient. Let's try ""STOMA"":
- S (position 1, new for S)
- T (new letter)
- O (position 3, but O cannot be here - bad)

Better: ""SONAR"":
- S (position 1)
- O (position 2)
- N (new)
- A (position 4)
- R (but R is confirmed not in word - bad)

Next: ""STOIC"":
- S (position 1)
- T (new)
- O (position 3 - but O can't be here)
  
""STOIC"" is invalid due to O position. Let's try ""SALON"":
- S (position 1)
- A (position 2)
- L (new)
- O (position 4)
- N (new)

This keeps all confirmed letters and doesn't violate any position rules.

But actually, ""COATS"" might be better:
- C (new)
- O (position 2)
- A (position 3)
- T (new)
- S (position 5 - new position for S)

This seems optimal as it:
1. Moves O from position 3 to 2
2. Moves A from position 1 to 3
3. Moves S from position 4 to 5
4. Introduces C and T

Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions:

Letters that ARE in the word but are NOT yet in the correct position:
- O (was in position 3 in COATS, wrong spot; was in position 3 in AROSE, also wrong)
  – so O must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
  – Position 5 is already S, so O must be in position 2 or 4.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, E, T

Known pattern so far:
C _ A _ S with O still to place.

Possible placements for O:
- Position 2 → C O A _ S
- Position 4 → C _ A O S

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches one of these two patterns and contains only letters we haven’t ruled out.

Let’s check the first pattern C O A _ S:
The missing letter (position 4) can be any consonant not yet eliminated. Remaining common consonants we haven’t tested include N, L, D, P, etc.  
Possible words: COANS, COALS, COADS, COAPS …  
“COALS” is a real word, so that’s a candidate.

Second pattern C _ A O S:

Possible words: CNAOS – not valid, CLAOS – not valid, CPAOS – not valid, etc.  
No common English word seems to fit C?AOS.

Only real word here is “COANS”.

Check second pattern C _ A O S:
   No common words fit (e.g., CBAOS, CDAOS, CFAOS, etc., all invalid).

Therefore the only candidate left is “COANS”.

Among these, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:\n- Three vowels (A, O, E)\n- Two very common consonants (R, S)\n- All letters are distinct\n\nThis gives me a good chance of hitting multiple correct letters or positions right away, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1)\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3)\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo the secret word contains:\n- A (not in position 1)\n- O (not in position 3)\n- S (not in position 4)\n- DOES NOT contain R or E\n\nWe still need to test for other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) to narrow down the remaining letters.
