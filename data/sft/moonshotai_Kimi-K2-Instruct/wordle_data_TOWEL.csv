- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word would use several of these letters.

Let's consider the word ""AROSE"":
- Contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- Covers multiple vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities

So we now know:
- Word pattern: T O _ E _
- Letters eliminated: A, R, S, N, D
- Letters confirmed in correct spots: T, O, E (positions 1, 2, 4)
- Need a third letter for position 3 and a fifth letter for position 5, using only remaining letters.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.
Vowels left to consider: I, U (since O and E are already placed)

Possible patterns:
- T O _ E _
With _ and _ to be filled from available letters.

Let's consider the third letter (position 3) - common options could be C, L, G, etc. and fifth letter (position 5) - common options could be H, L, K, Y, etc.

One strong candidate is ""TOPEK"" but PEEK is 4 letters... wait, need 5-letter word.
Actually looking at T O _ E _, possible words:
- TOBEL? Not valid.
- TOKE? Not valid.
- TOPLE? Not valid.
- TOWER? Has W but R is eliminated.
- TOGUE? Has G and U but G isn't common enough.
- TONGE? N is eliminated.
- TOILE? I is a vowel, but is TOILE a word? Actually TOILE is a valid English word meaning a type of fabric.

But let's think of more common words. Another approach is to cycle through possible consonants for position 3 and 5.

T O C E L – check TOCEL? Not valid.
T O L E Y – TOLEY? Not valid.
T O M E L – TOMEL? Not valid.

Actually, let's think systematically:
Valid English words fitting T O _ E _:
- TOILE (as noted)
- TOKEE? No
- TOGED? D eliminated
- TO M E K – TOMEK? Not valid
- TO P E L – TOPLE? Not valid
- TO G E T – T but T is used
- TO H E L – TOHEL? No
- TO J E T – J uncommon
- TO M E N – N eliminated
- TO W E L – W and L, but R is eliminated (W isn't eliminated though)

Actually ""TOWEL"" comes to mind:
- T O W E L
- T ✓ (1st), O ✓ (2nd), _ (3rd), E ✓ (4th), L (5th)

TOBEL? Not valid.
TOGEL? Not valid.
