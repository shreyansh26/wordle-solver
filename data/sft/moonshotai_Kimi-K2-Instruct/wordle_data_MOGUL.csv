For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E). It's also a valid 5-letter English word meaning ""got up"" or ""stood up"". This should give us good coverage for the first attempt.

From the feedback on AROSE we know:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (all x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it’s a “-” in position 3).

- O must appear somewhere other than position 3.
- Avoid A, R, S, E completely.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the secret word: A, R, S, E, N, I  
2. Letter O is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).  
   Therefore O must appear in position 1, 2, or 4.  
3. Letters that have never been tried yet and are therefore still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- contains O exactly once (no evidence of duplicates)  
- places O in position 1, 2, or 4  
- uses none of the eliminated letters A, R, S, E, N, I  
- uses only letters we haven’t ruled out

A convenient high-information choice is MOTEL:
- O in position 2 (valid so far)  
- M, T, L are all untested  
- E is ruled out, but wait – E is already eliminated!  
Oops, MOTEL uses E. Let’s pick again.

Current information:
- Known absent letters: A, R, S, E, N, I, C, D
- Letter O is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from guesses 1, 2, 3).  
  Remaining possible positions for O: 1 or 2.
- Letter U is confirmed in position 4 (✓).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 4.
2. Has O in position 1 or 2.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the already-known O and U).

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ U _
- _ O _ U _

Let’s look for common English words fitting these patterns.

Examples that satisfy:
- BUMPY – but lacks O.
- FOLLY – has O in position 2, U missing.
- GODLY – O in position 2, but U missing.
- GOULD – O in position 2, U in position 4.
- JOLLY – O in position 2, but U missing.
- MOLLY – same issue.
- POLLY – same issue.
- TOUCH – O in position 2, U in position 4.
- YOUTH – O in position 2, U in position 4.

Between GOULD, TOUCH, and YOUTH:
- GOULD: uses G, O, U, L, D – but D is eliminated (x in CLOUD).
- TOUCH: uses T, O, U, C, H – but C is eliminated (x in CLOUD).
- YOUTH: uses Y, O, U, T, H – none of these letters are eliminated.

Therefore, YOUTH satisfies all constraints: O in position 2, U in position 4, and no banned letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We must place one of these in positions 1, 3, 5.

Looking for common English words matching _ O _ U _:

BONUS – but N and S are eliminated.  
FORUM – F, O, R, U, M – but R is eliminated.  
GOPUR – not a word.  
JOKUL – a valid word meaning a mountain glacier.
KORUN – a currency (KORUN is plural of koruna).  
LOMUT – not a word.  
LOTUS – L, O, T, U, S – T and S eliminated.  
MODUS – M, O, D, U, S – D and S eliminated.  
NOVUM – N eliminated.  

Among these, JOKUL is valid but obscure. KORUN is also obscure (and uses N, eliminated). 

A better fit is JOKUL, but since JOKUL is a proper noun/geography term, we might prefer a more common word. However, no other common words fit _ O _ U _ with allowed letters. 

Alternatively, let's re-examine allowed letters: we can use L (from CLOUD feedback, L was ""-"" in position 2, so L is allowed). 

Looking again with L:

LOMUT – not a word.  
LOMUS – not a word.  
LOBUH – not a word.  

Given scarcity, the best available is JOKUL, but it's a proper noun. 

Another candidate: ""FOGOU"" – an ancient underground structure, but F, O, G, O, U – uses O twice (no evidence of double O), and G is allowed. However, it's obscure.

Re-checking the allowed letters and considering commonality, ""GOPUR"" is invalid, ""KORUN"" uses N (eliminated), ""JOKUL"" is the closest valid word (though obscure). 

Given constraints, the most plausible is JOKUL.

However, double-checking constraints: J, O, K, U, L – none of these are eliminated. 

Thus, JOKUL is valid, albeit uncommon. 

But wait – we can use L in position 1 or 3 or 5. 

Looking for _ O _ U _ with L:

Possible: L, O, ?, U, ? – need positions 3 and 5 filled with allowed letters.

Available for positions 3,5: K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, B, F, G, J, Q

Looking for valid words:

Looking at common words with L O _ U _:

LOKUM – a Turkish delight, uses K in position 3. Letters: L, O, K, U, M – none eliminated. 

LOKUM is valid (as in Turkish delight), and all letters allowed.

Thus, LOKUM is a better choice than JOKUL.

1. Letters known to be absent: A, R, S, E, N, I, C, D, Y, T, H  
2. U is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from CLOUD).  
3. O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓ from YOUTH).  

So the pattern is:
_ O _ U _

We need a 5-letter word fitting this pattern, using only letters not yet eliminated.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We must place one of these in positions 1, 3, 5.

Looking for common English words matching _ O _ U _:

BONUS – but N and S are eliminated.  
FORUM – F, O, R, U, M – but R is eliminated.  
GOPUR – not a word.  
JOKUL – a valid word meaning a mountain glacier.
KORUN – a currency (KORUN is plural of koruna).  
LOMUT – not a word.  
LOTUS – L, O, T, U, S – T and S eliminated.  
MODUS – M, O, D, U, S – D and S eliminated.  
NOVUM – N eliminated.  

Among these, JOKUL is valid but obscure. KORUN is also obscure (and uses N, eliminated). 

A better fit is JOKUL, but since JOKUL is a proper noun/geography term, we might prefer a more common word. However, no other common words fit _ O _ U _ with allowed letters. 

Alternatively, let's re-examine allowed letters: we can use L (from CLOUD feedback, L was ""-"" in position 2, so L is allowed). 

Looking again with L:

LOMUT – not a word.  
LOMUS – not a word.  
LOBUH – not a word.  

Given scarcity, the best available is JOKUL, but it's a proper noun. 

Another candidate: ""FOGOU"" – an ancient underground structure, but F, O, G, O, U – uses O twice (no evidence of double O), and G is allowed. However, it's obscure.

Re-checking the allowed letters and considering commonality, ""GOPUR"" is invalid, ""KORUN"" uses N (eliminated), ""JOKUL"" is the closest valid word (though obscure). 

Given constraints, the most plausible is JOKUL.

However, double-checking constraints: J, O, K, U, L – none of these are eliminated. 

Thus, JOKUL is valid, albeit uncommon. 

But wait – we can use L in position 1 or 3 or 5. 

Looking for _ O _ U _ with L:

Possible: L, O, ?, U, ? – need positions 3 and 5 filled with allowed letters.

Available for positions 3,5: K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, B, F, G, J, Q

Looking for valid words:

Looking at common words with L O _ U _:

LOKUM – a Turkish delight, uses K in position 3. Letters: L, O, K, U, M – none eliminated. 

LOKUM is valid (as in Turkish delight), and all letters allowed.

Thus, LOKUM is a better choice than JOKUL.

Final check: LOKUM – L (allowed), O (position 2 ✓), K (allowed), U (position 4 ✓), M (allowed). 

This fits perfectly.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Pattern: _ O _ U _  
   (O fixed in position 2, U fixed in position 4)

2. Letters known to be absent anywhere in the word:
   A, R, S, E, N, I, C, D, Y, T, H, K

3. Letters still allowed: B, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

4. From LOKUM:
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 1 (“-”)
   - M is in the word but NOT in position 5 (“-”)

Therefore:
- Position 1: must be one of B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z   (cannot be L)
- Position 3: must be one of B, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
- Position 5: must be one of B, F, G, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z   (cannot be M)

Look for a common English word that fits the pattern _ O _ U _ and uses only the allowed letters for the three unknown positions.

Scanning the remaining letters, pick common consonants: B, F, G, L, M, P, V.

Candidates:
- B: BOBUX – not a word.
- F: FOUL? – but we need U in position 4, so FOUL is _ O U _ (wrong pattern).
- G: GOBUX – not a word.
- J: JOBUX – not a word.
- L: LOBUM – not a word.
- M: MOBUL – not a word.
- P: POBUZ – not a word.
- V: VOGUM – not a word.

Let’s list actual Scrabble-valid words that fit the pattern “?o?u?” and contain none of the eliminated letters.

Using a mental word list:

GOLUP – not a word.  
GOBUR – not a word.  
FOGUM – not a word.  
JOBUM – not a word.  
VOGUL – not a word.  
BOGUS – but S is eliminated.  
BOGUM – not a word.  
BOGUL – not a word.  
FOLLY – lacks U in position 4.  
MOGUL – M O G U L. Check:
   M (allowed), O (fixed), G (allowed), U (fixed), L (allowed).  
   And none of the banned letters appear.  
   It also satisfies:  
   – L is not in position 1 (it’s in position 5, which is fine).  
   – M is not in position 5 (it’s in position 1, which is fine).  

Therefore MOGUL is both valid and consistent with every clue so far.

So, the next guess is MOGUL.
