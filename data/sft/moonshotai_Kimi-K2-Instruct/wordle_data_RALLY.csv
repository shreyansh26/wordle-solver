For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means choosing a word with common letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants. 

One popular strategy is to use words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" because they contain frequently occurring letters. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage to eliminate many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R and A are in the correct positions (first and second letters).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word starts with RA... and contains none of I, S, E.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good third letters to try next: common ones like N, L, T, etc.

Let’s try RAN?? which is common (R A N _ _).  
Next two letters: avoiding I,S,E. Let's pick D and O to make RANDO, but that's slang. Instead, RANDY is valid. Or RANTO – no. RANCO – no. Actually, RANDY is valid.

But maybe better to try another common 3rd: R A N _ _ .
Try R A N C H – “RANCH” is valid.

Letters used so far: R, A, N, C, H – none of which were ruled out (except R and A which are already confirmed correct). This tests N, C, H as new letters.

Alternative: R A M P S – but S is ruled out.
R A M P T – “RAMPT” is not a word. R A M P – too short.

“RANCH” seems solid.

So far we have:

- R and A are locked in positions 1 and 2 (RA _ _ _).
- Letters that have been shown NOT to appear anywhere: I, S, E, N, C, H, M, B, O.

Available letters for positions 3,4,5:
Vowels left: U, Y  
Consonants left: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a common 5-letter English word beginning with RA that doesn’t use any of the eliminated letters.

Likely candidates:
- RADLY – not a real word  
- RADIX – uses I (already ruled out)  
- RAGGY – uses G, G, Y (possible)  
- RALLY – uses L, L, Y (double L is fine)  
- RATTY – uses T, T, Y  
- RAZZY – uses Z, Z, Y  
- RAGGY, RALLY, RATTY, RAZZY are all valid, but RALLY is perhaps the most common.

Let me check:
R A L L Y  
Letters tested: L and Y (both new and still allowed).

Therefore: RALLY
