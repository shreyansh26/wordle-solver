For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Words like ""ARISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular opening guesses because they contain frequently used letters in English.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opening guess with:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Current knowledge:
- The word has N in position 4.
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from Guess 2 feedback: O(-)).

So we need:
- A 5-letter word with N in position 4.
- Must include O somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Must avoid C, R, A, E, S, U, D.

Possible consonants left to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, O (since A, E, U eliminated).

Good candidates to test several new consonants and keep O in a different spot:
- ""POINT"" – but U is already eliminated, and T is still possible.
- ""BLOND"" – but D is eliminated.
- ""GONIF"" – F is acceptable, but this is less common.
- ""MOUNT"" – U is eliminated.
- ""TONGA"" – A is eliminated.
- ""MONEY"" – E is eliminated.
- ""FOGIN"" – but N is fixed in position 4, so this would need to be ""FOIGN"" which isn't a word.
- ""LOGIN"" – but N is fixed in position 4, so this would be ""LOGNI"" which isn't valid.

Alternative approach: look for common 5-letter words with N in position 4, O somewhere else, and none of the eliminated letters. 

""JOLIN"" – J is possible, but is this a word? Not standard.
""BOING"" – but G is untested, and O is in position 2 (invalid).
""POINK"" – K is untested, O in position 2 (invalid).

Re-evaluate: O must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Words fitting:
- ""OINK_"" – but N is in 4, so ""OINK_"" isn't 5 letters.
- ""ONION"" – but N is in 4, so ""ONION"" has N in 3 and 5, which conflicts.
- ""OPINE"" – E eliminated.
- ""OXIDE"" – D and E eliminated.
- ""BOINK"" – K is untested, O in position 1, N in 4. This fits: B, O, I, N, K with no eliminated letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. Words like ""ARISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular opening guesses because they contain frequently used letters in English.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opening guess with:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (the 4th letter).

So we know:
- 4th letter is N.
- Letters C, R, A, E are eliminated.
- We still need to test other common letters like S, T, O, L, I, U, D, etc.

A good next guess would test several new common letters while placing N in the 4th position. ""STON"" sounds good, but we need a 5-letter word. Maybe ""STING"" or ""DONUT"" but we need to avoid A and E. ""SOUND"" keeps N in 4th position and tests S, O, U, D.

Let me choose ""SOUND"" as it tests:
- S (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (already confirmed in 4th position)
- D (common consonant)

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current knowledge:
- The word has N in position 4.
- Letters eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, S, U, D.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from Guess 2 feedback: O(-)).

So we need:
- A 5-letter word with N in position 4.
- Must include O somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Must avoid C, R, A, E, S, U, D.

Possible consonants left to test: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, O (since A, E, U eliminated).

Good candidates to test several new consonants and keep O in a different spot:
- ""POINT"" – but U is already eliminated, and T is still possible.
- ""BLOND"" – but D is eliminated.
- ""GONIF"" – F is acceptable, but this is less common.
- ""MOUNT"" – U is eliminated.
- ""TONGA"" – A is eliminated.
- ""MONEY"" – E is eliminated.
- ""FOGIN"" – but N is fixed in position 4, so this would need to be ""FOIGN"" which isn't a word.
- ""LOGIN"" – but N is fixed in position 4, so this would be ""LOGNI"" which isn't valid.

Alternative approach: look for common 5-letter words with N in position 4, O somewhere else, and none of the eliminated letters. 

""JOLIN"" – J is possible, but is this a word? Not standard.
""BOING"" – but G is untested, and O is in position 2 (invalid).
""POINK"" – K is untested, O in position 2 (invalid).

Re-evaluate: O must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Words fitting:
- ""OINK_"" – but N is in 4, so ""OINK_"" isn't 5 letters.
- ""ONION"" – but N is in 4, so ""ONION"" has N in 3 and 5, which conflicts.
- ""OPINE"" – E eliminated.
- ""OXIDE"" – D and E eliminated.
- ""BOINK"" – K is untested, O in position 1, N in 4. This fits: B, O, I, N, K with no eliminated letters.

""BOINK"" seems valid:
- B: new consonant
- O: in position 1 (allowed, since O must be somewhere and position 2 is invalid)
- I: new vowel
- N: confirmed in position 4
- K: new consonant
