For the first guess, it's strategic to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good choice should have diverse letters to test multiple possibilities at once. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular starters. 

Looking at the letters:
- A, E are very common vowels.
- R, S, T, N, L are common consonants.

""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E - hitting 3 vowels and 2 common consonants. This gives a good spread of letters to see what's present in the secret word.

From the feedback on arose:
- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in position 1.

- O(-) : O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.

1. Does not contain R, S, E
2. Contains both A and O
3. Places A and O in positions different from their previous positions (A not in pos 1, O not in pos 3)

Good candidates would use remaining common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc. Let's try ""ADOPT"":
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 2 (was 1 before - new position)
- O is in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this is bad)

Next try ""TALON"":
- Contains A and O
- A is in position 2 (new)

Feedback recap:

2. talon: T(x) A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)
   → A is now fixed in position 2.
   → O is fixed in position 4.
   → N is fixed in position 5.
   → T and L are absent.

Known so far:
- Letters present and fixed:  
  – A in position 2  
  – O in position 4  
  – N in position 5  
- Letters absent: R, S, E, T, L  
- We still need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining alphabet (excluding the absent letters).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Vowels we haven’t placed yet: I, U (A and O already fixed).

Let’s look for a pattern _A_O_N with legal letters for the blanks.

First blank (position 1) can be B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y.
Third blank (position 3) could be I or U (vowels) or any consonant that fits.

Quick checks:
- B A I O N → B A I O N (BAION) – valid.
- C A M O N → C A M O N (CAMON) – not a word.
- D A I O N → D A I O N (DAION) – valid in Scrabble lists but uncommon.
- D A M O N → D A M O N (DAMON) – a name; not ideal.
- P A I O N → P A I O N (PAION) – archaic.
- V A N O N – invalid.

Most promising everyday word appears to be ""BAION"" (Scrabble word), but let’s pick a more common one: ""DAION"" is obscure. Instead let’s try ""DAMON"" (name, but accepted). However names are iffy.

A better common word: ""CANON"" – but L is already out; C, A, N, O are allowed. However we already fixed N at 5, so ""CANON"" would put N at 3 – conflict.

Next try: ""C A I O N"" – not a word.

Another: ""F A C O N"" – invalid.

Good candidate: ""P A I O N"" – archaic.

Simplest common word fitting: ""PAION"" – no.

We need a legitimate 5-letter word matching _A_O_N.

Look at ""CAION"" – no.

Eventually: ""MAJON"" – no.

Better way: use consonants in 1 and 3, and check dictionary.
