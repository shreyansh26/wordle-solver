For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Common starting words include ""ADIEU"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""ADIEU"" covers 4 vowels but lacks common consonants
- ""CRANE"" has good consonants and 2 vowels
- ""SLATE"" has common letters and 2 vowels
- ""AROSE"" covers 4 vowels and a common consonant

""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess as it includes 4 vowels (A, O, E) and the very common letter S, giving good coverage of the alphabet.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- O and E are not in the word.  
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word must contain A, R and S, but not O or E.  
Furthermore, none of these letters is in its original position:
- First letter ≠ A  
- Second letter ≠ R  
- Fourth letter ≠ S  

I need a 5-letter English word that uses A, R, S and two new consonants (since O and E are ruled out).  
A good next step is to test a word that places these known letters in new spots while introducing fresh consonants.  
Possible consonants to try: T, N, L, M, P, etc.

Looking for words:
- STRAP uses S, T, R, A, P → places S at start, R third, A fourth.  
- CRISP uses C, R, I, S, P → has R, S but also I (vowel) and repeats S.  
- TRASH uses T, R, A, S, H → places T first, R second, A third, S fourth, H fifth.  
However, in TRASH, R is second, which we know is wrong (original R was second).  

STRAP looks better:
- S first (new position)  
- T new letter  
- R third (new position, originally second)  
- A fourth (new position, originally first)  
- P new letter  

STRAP obeys the constraints and tests new consonants.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the secret word and their correct positions:
- S is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- A is in position 4.

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- P (because P in STRAP got “-” feedback).

Letters that are definitely **not** in the word:
- O, E, T (from AROSE and STRAP feedback).

So the pattern so far is:
S _ R A _

We still need a consonant for position 2 and a consonant for position 5.  
We know P is in the word but **not** in position 5 (since P in STRAP got “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 5). Therefore P must be in position 2.

That fixes position 2 as P, giving us:
S P R A _

We now need a fifth letter that has not been ruled out. So far we have used:
A, R, S, P, T, O, E.  
Consonants still unused and not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit S P R A _:
- SPRAG – valid (a support timber)

Both fit, but SPRAY is a much more common English word, so it’s the safer choice.
