For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common English letters and can help identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E) which can quickly help identify which vowels are in the word.
- Two common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words.

This should give a solid starting point to narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word and already in the correct position.

So far we know:
- Pos 5 is E.
- S exists somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not 5).

We also know to avoid A, R, O entirely.  
Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Aim for another vowel-heavy word (since we only have E confirmed) while bringing in new consonants and relocating S.  
Good choices: “UNTIE”, “SLIDE”, “STING”, “SPINE”, “UTILE”, etc.

The simplest and most informative move is to test S in a new spot and introduce new letters T, N, I, L.  
“UNTIE” puts S nowhere and omits it, so skip.  
“SLIDE” would put S in pos 1 and bring L, I, D.  
“STING” would put S in pos 1 and bring T, I, N, G.  

Between these, “UNTIE” is poor because it drops S.  
“SLIDE” and “STING” are both strong.  
Choose “SLIDE”: it reuses S (now in pos 1), adds L, I, D, and keeps E in pos 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and vowels. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E) which can quickly help identify which vowels are in the word.
- Two common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words.

This should give a solid starting point to narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word and already in the correct position.

So far we know:
- Pos 5 is E.
- S exists somewhere in positions 1-4 (but not 5).

We also know to avoid A, R, O entirely.  
Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Aim for another vowel-heavy word (since we only have E confirmed) while bringing in new consonants and relocating S.  
Good choices: “UNTIE”, “SLIDE”, “STING”, “SPINE”, “UTILE”, etc.

The simplest and most informative move is to test S in a new spot and introduce new letters T, N, I, L.  
“UNTIE” puts S nowhere and omits it, so skip.  
“SLIDE” would put S in pos 1 and bring L, I, D.  
“STING” would put S in pos 1 and bring T, I, N, G.  

Between these, “UNTIE” is poor because it drops S.  
“SLIDE” and “STING” are both strong.  
Choose “SLIDE”: it reuses S (now in pos 1), adds L, I, D, and keeps E in pos 5.

<guess>SLIDE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)  
2. SLIDE → S(✓) L(x) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)

What we now know for certain:

- Position 1: must be **S** (from SLIDE’s ✓)
- Position 5: must be **E** (from both guesses’ ✓)

- Letters already confirmed **in the word but not yet locked to a position**:  
  – **I** (from SLIDE, got (-) in pos 3, but that position is now shown to be correct in SLIDE, so I is actually in position 3 and confirmed ✓)

- Letters known **not in the word**: A, R, O, L, D

Thus the pattern so far:  
S _ I _ E   (with the middle two letters still unknown)

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) that:
- have not been ruled out (so not A, R, O, L, D)  
- have not yet been tried (because all letters in AROSE and SLIDE have been accounted for except possibly duplicates).

Common remaining consonants: N, T, H, G, C, M, P, Y, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: U (we have not tested U yet), and sometimes Y.

Let’s pick a word that fits S _ I _ E and tests good remaining letters.  
Possibilities:  
- SNITE (but T wasn’t tested yet)  
- SPICE (but C wasn’t tested)  
- SHINE (H and N)  
- SWINE (W and N)

Among these, “SWINE” introduces two new letters (W and N) and keeps the known S, I, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: SLIDE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)  
2. SLIDE → S(✓) L(x) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)

What we now know for certain:

- Position 1: must be **S** (from SLIDE’s ✓)
- Position 5: must be **E** (from both guesses’ ✓)

- Letters already confirmed **in the word but not yet locked to a position**:  
  – **I** (from SLIDE, got (-) in pos 3, but that position is now shown to be correct in SLIDE, so I is actually in position 3 and confirmed ✓)

- Letters known **not in the word**: A, R, O, L, D

Thus the pattern so far:  
S _ I _ E   (with the middle two letters still unknown)

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) that:
- have not been ruled out (so not A, R, O, L, D)  
- have not yet been tried (because all letters in AROSE and SLIDE have been accounted for except possibly duplicates).

Common remaining consonants: N, T, H, G, C, M, P, Y, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: U (we have not tested U yet), and sometimes Y.

Let’s pick a word that fits S _ I _ E and tests good remaining letters.  
Possibilities:  
- SNITE (but T wasn’t tested yet)  
- SPICE (but C wasn’t tested)  
- SHINE (H and N)  
- SWINE (W and N)

Among these, “SWINE” introduces two new letters (W and N) and keeps the known S, I, E.  
So let’s try SWINE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: SLIDE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: SWINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) I(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SWINE:

- Positions 1, 3, 5 are still solid: S _ I _ E  
- W(x) and N(x) are now ruled out (they are not in the word at all).

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, L, D, W, N  
Letters confirmed in the word: S, I, E  
Letters still unused that are common in English and fit positions 2 and 4: T, H, G, C, M, P, Y, F, U, etc.

We need two more consonants (or vowels if needed) for positions 2 and 4.  
Pattern: S _ I _ E  

Possible words that fit this pattern and use only untested letters:
- SPICE (P and C) – but C was not tested yet, P was not tested yet  
- STIME (T and M) – T and M not tested yet  
- STILE (T and L) – but L is already ruled out  
- SUIPE (U and P) – U and P not tested yet  
- SMITE (M and T) – M and T not tested  

Among these, “SMITE” introduces M and T, two common letters that have not been ruled out.  
“SPICE” is also good, but let’s go with “SMITE” as it’s very common.

So the next guess is SMITE.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, L, D, W, N, M, T  
Still-available common letters for positions 2 & 4:  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, U, Y, etc.

The only 5-letter English pattern left is S _ I _ E.  
We need two new letters.

Let’s list remaining legal candidates that fit S _ I _ E and use only un-tried letters:

- SIFRE – F and R; R is out → invalid  
- SIGHE – G and H; neither tested yet  
- SIPKE – P and K; neither tested yet  
- SIKEE – duplicate E → invalid  
- SIKGE – K and G; neither tested yet

Among those, “SIGHE” is not a valid dictionary word.  
“SPIKE” uses P and K, both untested and valid letters.  
“SPICE” uses P and C.  
Let’s prefer “SPICE” (common word, introduces C and P).

So the next guess is SPICE.
