For the first guess, the goal is to maximize the information gained. This means choosing a word that has common letters and covers different positions well. 

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should use these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

The word ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E) plus R and S.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving high chances of hits.
- The positions are varied enough to give good information about letter placement.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and the highly frequent S and R.

What we learned  
- A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.  
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.  
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.  

So we must use only letters that are not A, O, S, and we must include both R and E somewhere.  
R cannot be in spot 2 and E cannot be in spot 5.  
Consonants that remain common are T, N, L, C, D, etc.; vowels we can still use are I, U, and sometimes Y.  

A good second-guess pattern is to keep R and E while introducing several new, well-distributed consonants.  
Candidate words that fit:  
- TREND (T new, R/E placed, N/D new)  
- INERT (I/N/T new, R/E placed)  
- CRUDE (C/D new, R/E placed, U new)  

Among these, TREND gives us three completely new consonants (T, N, D) plus the known R and E, while satisfying the positional constraints: R is not in slot 2, and E is not in slot 5. Therefore, I’ll go with TREND.

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E  

So every valid letter in the word must come from the remaining alphabet excluding A, O, S, N, D, T.  
Remaining consonants of normal frequency: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y)

We must use both R and E, and neither can be in positions already ruled out:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TREND) – so R is NOT in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 3 (from TREND).

- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need three more distinct letters that have not been used yet.  
Common remaining letters are I, U, C, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.  

Aiming to test several new letters while keeping R and E in plausible spots, a good choice is:

""PERKY""

- R (cannot be in 2, placed in 3 – allowed)  
- K (new)

This gives us four fresh letters and respects all constraints.

Another check:

From the three guesses so far we have:

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):  
A, O, S, N, D, T, P, K, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
R and E  

Therefore the secret word contains R and E, and every other letter must be chosen from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z  

Known positional constraints  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND).  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TREND and AROSE).  

So R could still be in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
E could still be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  

We need three more distinct letters, all from the allowed list.  
High-frequency consonants still available: C, F, G, H, L, M  
Vowels still available: I, U  

A good next word will:  
- Use R and E in positions that are still allowed.  
- Introduce several brand-new common letters to maximize information gain.  

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:  
- ULCER (U, L, C new; R position 5, E position 4)  
- CHURN (but N is already forbidden)  
- FILER (but P, K, Y already used, and L, I are new) – but R would be in position 4, E in 2, which are allowed.  
- MUCER (M, U, C new; R in 5, E in 4)  

Among these, ULCER uses three unused common letters (U, L, C) while placing R and E in still-allowed positions.

Let me verify:  
Letters used: U, L, C, E, R – none of them forbidden.  
Positions:  
- U is brand-new.  
- L is brand-new.  
- C is brand-new.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  

Therefore, ULCER is a strong next guess.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should use these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

The word ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E) plus R and S.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving high chances of hits.
- The positions are varied enough to give good information about letter placement.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and the highly frequent S and R.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

What we learned  
- A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.  
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.  
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.  

So we must use only letters that are not A, O, S, and we must include both R and E somewhere.  
R cannot be in spot 2 and E cannot be in spot 5.  
Consonants that remain common are T, N, L, C, D, etc.; vowels we can still use are I, U, and sometimes Y.  

A good second-guess pattern is to keep R and E while introducing several new, well-distributed consonants.  
Candidate words that fit:  
- TREND (T new, R/E placed, N/D new)  
- INERT (I/N/T new, R/E placed)  
- CRUDE (C/D new, R/E placed, U new)  

Among these, TREND gives us three completely new consonants (T, N, D) plus the known R and E, while satisfying the positional constraints: R is not in slot 2, and E is not in slot 5. Therefore, I’ll go with TREND.

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: TREND  
Feedback: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)

What we now know for certain:
Letters NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, N, D, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E  

So every valid letter in the word must come from the remaining alphabet excluding A, O, S, N, D, T.  
Remaining consonants of normal frequency: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y)

We must use both R and E, and neither can be in positions already ruled out:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TREND) – so R is NOT in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 3 (from TREND).

Therefore:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need three more distinct letters that have not been used yet.  
Common remaining letters are I, U, C, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.  

Aiming to test several new letters while keeping R and E in plausible spots, a good choice is:

""PERKY""  
But P and K and Y are all new, and R/E fit the allowed positions:
- P (new)  
- E (must be in 1-4, placed in 2)  
- R (cannot be in 2, placed in 3 – allowed)  
- K (new)  
- Y (new)  

This gives us four fresh letters and respects all constraints.

Another check:  
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, D, T) are used.  
- R and E are both included and placed in allowed positions.  

So PERKY looks like the best next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the goal is to maximize the information gained. This means choosing a word that has common letters and covers different positions well. 

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should use these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

The word ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent first guess because it contains:
- All five common vowels (A, O, E) plus R and S.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving high chances of hits.
- The positions are varied enough to give good information about letter placement.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE,"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and the highly frequent S and R.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

What we learned  
- A, O, S are NOT in the word at all.  
- R is in the word, but NOT in position 2.  
- E is in the word, but NOT in position 5.  

So we must use only letters that are not A, O, S, and we must include both R and E somewhere.  
R cannot be in spot 2 and E cannot be in spot 5.  
Consonants that remain common are T, N, L, C, D, etc.; vowels we can still use are I, U, and sometimes Y.  

A good second-guess pattern is to keep R and E while introducing several new, well-distributed consonants.  
Candidate words that fit:  
- TREND (T new, R/E placed, N/D new)  
- INERT (I/N/T new, R/E placed)  
- CRUDE (C/D new, R/E placed, U new)  

Among these, TREND gives us three completely new consonants (T, N, D) plus the known R and E, while satisfying the positional constraints: R is not in slot 2, and E is not in slot 5. Therefore, I’ll go with TREND.

<guess>TREND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: TREND  
Feedback: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)

What we now know for certain:
Letters NOT in the word at all: A, O, S, N, D, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E  

So every valid letter in the word must come from the remaining alphabet excluding A, O, S, N, D, T.  
Remaining consonants of normal frequency: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y)

We must use both R and E, and neither can be in positions already ruled out:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TREND) – so R is NOT in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 3 (from TREND).

Therefore:
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We need three more distinct letters that have not been used yet.  
Common remaining letters are I, U, C, L, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y, Z.  

Aiming to test several new letters while keeping R and E in plausible spots, a good choice is:

""PERKY""  
But P and K and Y are all new, and R/E fit the allowed positions:
- P (new)  
- E (must be in 1-4, placed in 2)  
- R (cannot be in 2, placed in 3 – allowed)  
- K (new)  
- Y (new)  

This gives us four fresh letters and respects all constraints.

Another check:  
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, D, T) are used.  
- R and E are both included and placed in allowed positions.  

So PERKY looks like the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: PERKY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses so far we have:

Forbidden letters (never appear in the word):  
A, O, S, N, D, T, P, K, Y  

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
R and E  

Therefore the secret word contains R and E, and every other letter must be chosen from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, V, W, X, Z  

Known positional constraints  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND).  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from TREND and AROSE).  

So R could still be in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
E could still be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  

We need three more distinct letters, all from the allowed list.  
High-frequency consonants still available: C, F, G, H, L, M  
Vowels still available: I, U  

A good next word will:  
- Use R and E in positions that are still allowed.  
- Introduce several brand-new common letters to maximize information gain.  

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:  
- ULCER (U, L, C new; R position 5, E position 4)  
- CHURN (but N is already forbidden)  
- FILER (but P, K, Y already used, and L, I are new) – but R would be in position 4, E in 2, which are allowed.  
- MUCER (M, U, C new; R in 5, E in 4)  

Among these, ULCER uses three unused common letters (U, L, C) while placing R and E in still-allowed positions.

Let me verify:  
Letters used: U, L, C, E, R – none of them forbidden.  
Positions:  
- U is brand-new.  
- L is brand-new.  
- C is brand-new.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  

Therefore, ULCER is a strong next guess.
