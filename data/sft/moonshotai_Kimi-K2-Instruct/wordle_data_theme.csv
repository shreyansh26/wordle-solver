For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Some strong starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" because it has three of the five most common vowels (A, E) and three of the most common consonants (S, T, R). This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and get useful feedback about their positions.

From the first feedback:

- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:

- T in 5th position: _ _ _ _ T E (but 5th letter must be E, so T can't be here)

Good options:
- ""ELITE"" - ends with E, has T in 4th position (not 2nd), and no S, A, R.

- Cannot contain S, A, R, W, I, N.
- No other letters have been tested.

Remaining common consonants that fit: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Starts with T, ends with E, 5 letters total.
- Uses only the allowed letters (not S, A, R, W, I, N).
- Introduces new letters to test.

Possible candidates:
- TUBEE (invalid, not a word)
- TULLE
- TUMMY (invalid)
- TULLE is valid but rare; maybe better to try common words.

Another common word: ""TULLE"" (fabric) - but L and U are new.

Another: ""TUMMY"" - invalid (has M, but not a word with E).
""TUQUE"" – uses Q, which is uncommon.

""THOSE"" – H, O, S are used; S is out.
""TOFFE"" – double F, but not a word.

""TOILE"" – I is out.

""TOPEE"" is valid (a type of hat).

But ""TULLE"" may be obscure. 

""THOLE"" – H, O, L, E; but A, I, N, S, R, W are out.
""THOLE"" is valid (a pin in a boat).

""THOLE"" seems good: T, H, O, L, E – all allowed.

But let's check another common word: ""TONER"" – R is out.
""TOPED"" – ends with D.
""TOPER"" – R out.
""TOPHE"" – P, H are new; but is it a word? (TOPHE is variant of TOPH, not common).

""TORSE"" – R is out.
""TOTEM"" – M, T are ok but ends with M.

- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓)

So we know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. T is somewhere in the word but not in 2nd position.
3. The letters that are definitely NOT in the word are S, A, R.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains T but not in 2nd position.
- Does not contain S, A, or R.

Let me think of possible words:
- T in 1st position: T _ _ _ E → e.g. ""TOWER"" (but O and W are untested; let’s see)
- T in 3rd position: _ _ T _ E → e.g. ""CITIE"" (invalid, not a word)
- T in 4th position: _ _ _ T E → e.g. ""ELITE"" (but T is in 4th position, and the word doesn't have S, A, R)
- T in 5th position: _ _ _ _ T E (but 5th letter must be E, so T can't be here)

Good options:
- ""ELITE"" - ends with E, has T in 4th position (not 2nd), and no S, A, R.
- ""TOWER"" - ends with E, has T in 1st position, and no S, A, R.
- ""TWINE"" - ends with E, has T in 1st position, and no S, A, R.

I'll choose ""TWINE"" because it introduces new letters (W, I, N) that haven't been tested yet, giving more information.

1. STARE → S(x) T(-) A(x) R(x) E(✓)

2. TWINE → T(✓) W(x) I(x) N(x) E(✓)
   - T is now confirmed in the 1st position (✓).
   - E is confirmed in the 5th position (✓).
   - Letters W, I, N are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: T _ _ _ E
- Cannot contain S, A, R, W, I, N.
- No other letters have been tested.

Remaining common consonants that fit: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Starts with T, ends with E, 5 letters total.
- Uses only the allowed letters (not S, A, R, W, I, N).
- Introduces new letters to test.

Possible candidates:
- TUBEE (invalid, not a word)
- TULLE
- TUMMY (invalid)
- TULLE is valid but rare; maybe better to try common words.

Another common word: ""TULLE"" (fabric) - but L and U are new.

Another: ""TUMMY"" - invalid (has M, but not a word with E).
""TUQUE"" – uses Q, which is uncommon.

""THOSE"" – H, O, S are used; S is out.
""TOFFE"" – double F, but not a word.
""TRUCE"" – R and U; R is out.
""TRIKE"" – R and I are out.
""TRUCE"" – R is out.

""TABLE"" – A is out.
""TUBED"" – D and B are new, but 5-letter word?
""TUBED"" is valid (past of tube). But A, I, N, S, R, W are out.

But ""TUBED"" ends with D, not E. Need to end with E.

""TOILE"" – I is out.
""TARGE"" – A, R are out.

""TOPEE"" – O, P are new; but A, I, N, S, R, W are out.
""TOPEE"" is valid (a type of hat).

Another: ""TULLE"" – U, L are new, valid word.

But ""TULLE"" may be obscure. 

""THOLE"" – H, O, L, E; but A, I, N, S, R, W are out.
""THOLE"" is valid (a pin in a boat).

""THOLE"" seems good: T, H, O, L, E – all allowed.

But let's check another common word: ""TONER"" – R is out.
""TOPED"" – ends with D.
""TOPER"" – R out.
""TOPHE"" – P, H are new; but is it a word? (TOPHE is variant of TOPH, not common).

""TORSE"" – R is out.
""TOTEM"" – M, T are ok but ends with M.

""THOLE"" seems to be the best of the valid words I can find that fits the pattern and introduces new letters (H, O, L).

Thus, I'll go with ""THOLE"".

Current confirmed information after four guesses:

- Pattern: T H _ M E  (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 locked)
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, A, R, W, I, N, O, L, Y
- Position 3 is still unknown; it must be a letter not among the excluded set.

Remaining possible letters for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, K, P, U, V, X, Z (plus others, but these are common).

Looking for a 5-letter English word that fits the exact pattern T H ? M E.

The only common English word that matches this pattern is:

TH + consonant + M E

- THBME – invalid
- THCME – invalid
- THDME – invalid
- THFME – invalid
- THGME – invalid
- THKME – invalid
- THPME – invalid
- THUME – invalid
- THVME – invalid
- THXME – invalid
- THZME – invalid

The only valid word is **THEME**, which uses the letter E in position 3. However, we have not tested E in position 3 yet, and E has only been confirmed in position 5. There is no feedback ruling out E in position 3.

Let's verify:
- THEME: T(✓), H(✓), E(?), M(✓), E(✓)
- E has not been tested in position 3, and it is allowed there.
- THEME is a valid 5-letter English word.

Thus, the correct next guess is THEME.
