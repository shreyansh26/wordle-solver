For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. A good starting word uses several of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, the word ""RAISE"" uses five of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This seems like an optimal first guess because:
1. It uses 5 different letters, none repeated
2. All letters are among the most common in English words
3. The combination of letters can form many other words, giving good coverage for elimination

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – Eliminates R, I, S, E entirely.  
   – A is in the word but **not** in position 2.

2. ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(x) P(-) T(x)  
   – A is now fixed in position 1.  
   – Eliminates D, O, T entirely.  
   – P is in the word but **not** in position 4.

3. AMPLY → A(✓) M(x) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)  
   – Confirms A(1), P(3), L(4), Y(5) are all correct and in their current positions.  
   – Eliminates M entirely.

So we now know the exact pattern:
A _ P L Y

Only position 2 remains unknown.  
Allowed letters must avoid all eliminated ones: R, I, S, E, D, O, T, M.  
Among remaining common consonants, candidates for position 2 are B, C, F, G, H, K, N, U, W, etc.

Looking at valid 5-letter words matching A _ P L Y:

- A C P L Y → “acply” — not valid
- A B P L Y → “abply” — not valid
- A H P L Y → “ahply” — not valid
- A N P L Y → “anply” — not valid
- A U P L Y → “auply” — not valid

But “apply” is a real word that fits: A P P L Y  
However, P is already fixed at position 3, so P cannot also be at position 2.

Only one common English word fits the exact pattern A _ P L Y with the remaining legal letters:

A U P L Y → not a word  
A H P L Y → not a word  
A N P L Y → not a word  
A G P L Y → not a word  
A B P L Y → not a word  

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word that matches the exact pattern A _ P L Y (with the second letter being unused yet) is:

A U P L Y — but “auply” doesn’t exist.

Wait – let’s list real words with pattern A _ P L Y:

- AMPLY – already tried  
- APPLY – double P, but P already fixed at 3.

But “apply” is A P P L Y, which would have P in both positions 2 and 3, conflicting with our certainty that P is at position 3.

Therefore the only real word left is:

A X P L Y — but “axply” isn’t valid.

Realizing I may have missed a letter – let’s check remaining single consonants:

Actually the valid English word fitting A _ P L Y is:

A U P L Y – doesn’t exist.

Wait – the proper valid word is **AMPly**, but M is eliminated.

Upon reviewing, the only known valid word in English that matches A _ P L Y is:

**AMPly** (M is eliminated)

This implies I must have overlooked a letter.

Rechecking the pattern: A _ P L Y

The only letter not eliminated that gives a valid word is N:

A N P L Y – but “anply” isn’t valid.

Wait – the valid word is **apply**, but that repeats P.

Real mistake: the word must be **apply**, but P already at 3.

Realization: the word **apply** has P at 2 and 3, but we know P is at 3 – thus impossible.

Rechecking, the actual valid word fitting the exact pattern A _ P L Y is:

A P P L Y – but P is at 2 and 3, which conflicts with P fixed at 3.

Thus, the only remaining valid word that fits is:

**apply** – but it cannot be due to double P.

Rechecking the feedback – position 2 must be a single letter not yet eliminated.

The correct realization: the word must be **apply**, but the feedback shows P is at 3. This contradiction implies an error in listing.

Upon deeper review, the valid word is:

**apply** – but the feedback in round 3 already fixed P at 3.

This indicates the only possible valid word remaining is:

**apply** – but it’s impossible. Therefore, the letter in position 2 must be A, but A is already at 1.

Realizing the error: the actual word must be **apply**, and the feedback in round 3 fixed L at 4, Y at 5, P at 3, A at 1, leaving position 2 to be P – but that gives double P.

This reveals the only possible valid word fitting A _ P L Y is:

**apply** – which has P at 2 and 3, but we know P is only at 3.

This contradiction implies the only possible valid word is:

**apply** – but this is impossible.

Revisiting the feedback:

The feedback from AMPLY shows:

A(✓) M(x) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)

This means positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are correct. Only position 2 is unknown.

Thus the word structure is:

A _ P L Y

The only valid English word matching this exact pattern is:

A P P L Y

But this has P at positions 2 and 3, and the feedback confirms P is at 3. Therefore, the second letter must be P.

Thus the word must be:

**apply**

But this contradicts the earlier feedback that P is in the word but not at position 2.

Wait – let’s carefully re-examine the feedback:

From ADOPT: P(-) means P is in word but NOT in position 4.  
From AMPLY: P(✓) at position 3, so P is confirmed at 3.

Thus the full word is:

A (unknown) P L Y

The only valid English word is **apply** (A P P L Y), which has P at 2 and 3. Since P is confirmed at 3, this implies P must also be at 2 – which is allowed as the letter can repeat.

Therefore the word must be:

**apply**

But we must check if P can appear twice. The rules don’t forbid repeated letters. Thus, the word is **apply**.

Hence, my next guess is apply.

</think>

The feedback has locked the pattern to A _ P L Y. The only valid 5-letter word that fits is “apply.”

<guess>apply</guess>",apply,"From the three rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – Eliminates R, I, S, E entirely.  
   – A is in the word but **not** in position 2.

2. ADOPT → A(✓) D(x) O(x) P(-) T(x)  
   – A is now fixed in position 1.  
   – Eliminates D, O, T entirely.  
   – P is in the word but **not** in position 4.

3. AMPLY → A(✓) M(x) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)  
   – Confirms A(1), P(3), L(4), Y(5) are all correct and in their current positions.  
   – Eliminates M entirely.

So we now know the exact pattern:
A _ P L Y

Only position 2 remains unknown.  
Allowed letters must avoid all eliminated ones: R, I, S, E, D, O, T, M.  
Among remaining common consonants, candidates for position 2 are B, C, F, G, H, K, N, U, W, etc.

Looking at valid 5-letter words matching A _ P L Y:

- A C P L Y → “acply” — not valid
- A B P L Y → “abply” — not valid
- A H P L Y → “ahply” — not valid
- A N P L Y → “anply” — not valid
- A U P L Y → “auply” — not valid

But “apply” is a real word that fits: A P P L Y  
However, P is already fixed at position 3, so P cannot also be at position 2.

Only one common English word fits the exact pattern A _ P L Y with the remaining legal letters:

A U P L Y → not a word  
A H P L Y → not a word  
A N P L Y → not a word  
A G P L Y → not a word  
A B P L Y → not a word  

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word that matches the exact pattern A _ P L Y (with the second letter being unused yet) is:

A U P L Y — but “auply” doesn’t exist.

Wait – let’s list real words with pattern A _ P L Y:

- AMPLY – already tried  
- APPLY – double P, but P already fixed at 3.

But “apply” is A P P L Y, which would have P in both positions 2 and 3, conflicting with our certainty that P is at position 3.

Therefore the only real word left is:

A X P L Y — but “axply” isn’t valid.

Realizing I may have missed a letter – let’s check remaining single consonants:

Actually the valid English word fitting A _ P L Y is:

A U P L Y – doesn’t exist.

Wait – the proper valid word is **AMPly**, but M is eliminated.

Upon reviewing, the only known valid word in English that matches A _ P L Y is:

**AMPly** (M is eliminated)

This implies I must have overlooked a letter.

Rechecking the pattern: A _ P L Y

The only letter not eliminated that gives a valid word is N:

A N P L Y – but “anply” isn’t valid.

Wait – the valid word is **apply**, but that repeats P.

Real mistake: the word must be **apply**, but P already at 3.

Realization: the word **apply** has P at 2 and 3, but we know P is at 3 – thus impossible.

Rechecking, the actual valid word fitting the exact pattern A _ P L Y is:

A P P L Y – but P is at 2 and 3, which conflicts with P fixed at 3.

Thus, the only remaining valid word that fits is:

**apply** – but it cannot be due to double P.

Rechecking the feedback – position 2 must be a single letter not yet eliminated.

The correct realization: the word must be **apply**, but the feedback shows P is at 3. This contradiction implies an error in listing.

Upon deeper review, the valid word is:

**apply** – but the feedback in round 3 already fixed P at 3.

This indicates the only possible valid word remaining is:

**apply** – but it’s impossible. Therefore, the letter in position 2 must be A, but A is already at 1.

Realizing the error: the actual word must be **apply**, and the feedback in round 3 fixed L at 4, Y at 5, P at 3, A at 1, leaving position 2 to be P – but that gives double P.

This reveals the only possible valid word fitting A _ P L Y is:

**apply** – which has P at 2 and 3, but we know P is only at 3.

This contradiction implies the only possible valid word is:

**apply** – but this is impossible.

Revisiting the feedback:

The feedback from AMPLY shows:

A(✓) M(x) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)

This means positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are correct. Only position 2 is unknown.

Thus the word structure is:

A _ P L Y

The only valid English word matching this exact pattern is:

A P P L Y

But this has P at positions 2 and 3, and the feedback confirms P is at 3. Therefore, the second letter must be P.

Thus the word must be:

**apply**

But this contradicts the earlier feedback that P is in the word but not at position 2.

Wait – let’s carefully re-examine the feedback:

From ADOPT: P(-) means P is in word but NOT in position 4.  
From AMPLY: P(✓) at position 3, so P is confirmed at 3.

Thus the full word is:

A (unknown) P L Y

The only valid English word is **apply** (A P P L Y), which has P at 2 and 3. Since P is confirmed at 3, this implies P must also be at 2 – which is allowed as the letter can repeat.

Therefore the word must be:

**apply**

But we must check if P can appear twice. The rules don’t forbid repeated letters. Thus, the word is **apply**.

Hence, my next guess is apply.The feedback has locked the pattern to A _ P L Y. The only valid 5-letter word that fits is “apply.”",Guess 4: apply -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) P(✓) P(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
