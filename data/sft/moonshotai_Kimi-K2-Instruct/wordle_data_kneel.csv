Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a starting word that will give me the maximum amount of information. Good starting words in Wordle-style games typically have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeated letters (to maximize information gain)
3. A good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, RAISE, etc. Among these, CRANE is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many English words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So:
1. The secret word contains N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. The secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A.

I need a new word that:
- Uses N and E, but places them in different positions than 4 and 5.
- Avoids C, R, and A entirely.
- Uses other letters that are common in 5-letter words.

Possible positions for N and E:
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I'll try a word like ""SENDY"" – but ""SENDY"" isn't a valid English word. Instead, let's try ""SENTY"" – also invalid. 

Looking at valid words, ""SENTO"" isn't valid either. How about ""TENSE""? That uses N and E in new positions (N in 3, E in 2), and avoids C, R, A. 

Another option is ""NEWSY"", but that has W and S which might be less common. 

""TONED"" could work – N in 3, E in 4 (but E was in position 5 before, so 4 is new). But this uses D which is less common.

""ELVEN"" has E in 1 and N in 5 – both new positions, and uses L, V which are decent letters.

Let’s list what we now know.

Letters we can rule out completely: C, R, A, V  
Letters that are definitely in the word: E, N, L  
Positions we have information about:

Position 1 (from ELVEN): E(-) → the word does NOT start with E.  
Position 2 (from ELVEN): L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
Position 3 (from ELVEN): V(x) → already ruled out.  
Position 4 (from ELVEN): E(✓) → the letter in position 4 must be E.  
Position 5 (from ELVEN): N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern looks like:
_ _ _ E _

With the constraints:
- The missing letters (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) must include N and L, but:
  – L cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 5.
- The remaining two slots must be filled with letters not yet used (anything except C, R, A, V).

We still need two more unique letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: S, T, D, B, etc.

Let’s try to place N and L in valid spots while picking other frequent letters.

Candidate: S L E N T – but that would put L in position 2 (illegal).  
Candidate: L I N E D – puts L in position 1 and N in position 3.  
  – Position 1: L allowed (no info against it)  
  – Position 2: I (new letter)  
  – Position 3: N (allowed, no restriction)  
  – Position 4: E (already locked)  
  – Position 5: D (new letter)

This satisfies all constraints so far.

Therefore, the next guess is LINED.

Let me summarize the updated constraints after three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
- C, R, A, V, I, D

Letters that **are** in the word:
- E (position 4 is fixed: _ _ _ E _)
- N (but not in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- L (but not in positions 1, 2, or 4)

Positions that remain open: 1, 2, 3, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 4 is E (✓).
- N is somewhere among positions 1, 2 (because it can’t be 3, 4, 5).
- L is somewhere among positions 3, 5 (because it can’t be 1, 2, 4).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible placements that satisfy all constraints:

Case 1: N in position 1  
Then pattern: N _ _ E _  
L must be in 3 or 5.  
Remaining letters: must pick two common unused letters for the open spots.

Sub-case 1a: N _ L E _  
Then position 2 needs a letter (not yet used, not C, R, A, V, I, D).  
Try N U L E S? S is common.  
Does NUL* exist? NULES – dictionary check says not a word.  
Next option: N _ L E T → N O L E T – not a word.  
N _ L E Y → N U L E Y – no.  
N _ L E K → N U L E K – no.

Sub-case 1b: N _ _ E L  
Then positions 2 and 3 need letters.  
N U T E L – not a word.  
N E S E L – has E twice, not allowed (E already in position 4).  
N O W E L – yes, NOWEL is a variant spelling of “noel,” but may not be accepted.  
N O S E L – not a word.  
N E X E L – has X (rare).  
N U N E L – has N twice.  
Looks like limited options here.

Case 2: N in position 2  
Then pattern: _ N _ E _  
L must be in 3 or 5.  

Sub-case 2a: _ N L E _  
Then position 1 and 5 need letters.  
Let’s pick common consonants for position 1 and 5.  
Try B N L E S – BNLES? Not a word.  
S N L E W – SNLEW? No.  
T N L E S – TNLES? No.  
M N L E T – MNLET? No.  
Looks like none of these are valid.

Sub-case 2b: _ N _ E L  
Then positions 1 and 3 need letters.  
Try S N O E L – SNOEL? Not a word.  
B N O E L – BNOEL? No.  
H N U E L – No.  
T N U E L – No.  

Case 3: Backtrack – maybe we missed a placement.  
Wait, in Case 1b, N _ _ E L, let's try:  
N O M E L – NOMEL isn’t a word.  
N U M E L – NUMEL – not a word.  
N U S E L – not a word.

Hmm, perhaps we need a different strategy. Let’s list possible words that fit _ _ _ E _ with N and L in allowed positions.

Looking at a mental list of common 5-letter words ending in E:

- T E N S E – contains T, N, E, S, E (but we already have N constrained).  
- P E N N E – has N twice.  
- B E N N E – no.  
- S E N S E – has N in disallowed position 3.  
- M E N U E – not a word.  
- G E N I E – has I (ruled out).  
- B U N N Y – ends in Y, but we need E in position 4.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine constraints:

We have: _ _ _ E _
- N must be in position 1 or 2
- L must be in position 3 or 5
- Cannot use C, R, A, V, I, D
- Need to pick from remaining letters

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Option 1: N in 1, L in 3  
Pattern: N _ L E _  
Need a letter for position 2 and 5.  
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but avoid rare ones).  
Try N U L E S – not a word.  
N O L E S – NOLES is a plural form (short for ""noles""), but might be proper noun.  
N U L E T – not a word.  
N S L E T – NSLET – no.  

Option 2: N in 1, L in 5  
Pattern: N _ _ E L  
Need letters for 2 and 3.  
N U M E L – NUMEL – no.  
N O B E L – NOBEL – yes, this is a valid word (Nobel prize).  
Let’s check constraints:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (not used yet, allowed)  
- B in 3 (not used yet, allowed)  
- E in 4 (fixed)  
- L in 5 (allowed)  
- Letters used: N, O, B, E, L – all satisfy constraints.

Option 3: N in 2, L in 3  
Pattern: _ N L E _  
Need 1 and 5 letters.  
Try S N L E T – SNLET – no.  
B N L E T – BNLET – no.  

Option 4: N in 2, L in 5  
Pattern: _ N _ E L  
Need 1 and 3 letters.  
Try S N O E L – SNOEL – no.  
T N O E L – TNOEL – no.  

Thus, NOBEL seems the only valid candidate fitting all constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

1. Common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. No repeated letters (to maximize information gain)
3. A good mix of vowels and consonants

Popular strategic starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, RAISE, etc. Among these, CRANE is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives a good spread of letters that appear in many English words.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, and A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So:
1. The secret word contains N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. The secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A.

I need a new word that:
- Uses N and E, but places them in different positions than 4 and 5.
- Avoids C, R, and A entirely.
- Uses other letters that are common in 5-letter words.

Possible positions for N and E:
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I'll try a word like ""SENDY"" – but ""SENDY"" isn't a valid English word. Instead, let's try ""SENTY"" – also invalid. 

Looking at valid words, ""SENTO"" isn't valid either. How about ""TENSE""? That uses N and E in new positions (N in 3, E in 2), and avoids C, R, A. 

Another option is ""NEWSY"", but that has W and S which might be less common. 

""TONED"" could work – N in 3, E in 4 (but E was in position 5 before, so 4 is new). But this uses D which is less common.

""ELVEN"" has E in 1 and N in 5 – both new positions, and uses L, V which are decent letters.

Let's go with ""ELVEN"" – it places E and N in new positions and introduces L and V.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s list what we now know.

Letters we can rule out completely: C, R, A, V  
Letters that are definitely in the word: E, N, L  
Positions we have information about:

Position 2 (from ELVEN): L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
Position 3 (from ELVEN): V(x) → already ruled out.  
Position 4 (from ELVEN): E(✓) → the letter in position 4 must be E.  
Position 5 (from ELVEN): N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern looks like:
_ _ _ E _

With the constraints:
- The missing letters (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) must include N and L, but:
  – L cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 5.
- The remaining two slots must be filled with letters not yet used (anything except C, R, A, V).

We still need two more unique letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: S, T, D, B, etc.

Let’s try to place N and L in valid spots while picking other frequent letters.

Candidate: S L E N T – but that would put L in position 2 (illegal).  
Candidate: L I N E D – puts L in position 1 and N in position 3.  
  – Position 1: L allowed (no info against it)  
  – Position 2: I (new letter)  
  – Position 3: N (allowed, no restriction)

- T E N S E – contains T, N, E, S, E (but we already have N constrained).  
- P E N N E – has N twice.  
- B E N N E – no.  
- S E N S E – has N in disallowed position 3.  
- M E N U E – not a word.  
- G E N I E – has I (ruled out).  
- B U N N Y – ends in Y, but we need E in position 4.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine constraints:

We have: _ _ _ E _
- N must be in position 1 or 2
- L must be in position 3 or 5
- Cannot use C, R, A, V, I, D
- Need to pick from remaining letters

Let’s enumerate possible placements:

Option 1: N in 1, L in 3  
Pattern: N _ L E _  
Need a letter for position 2 and 5.  
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but avoid rare ones).  
Try N U L E S – not a word.  
N O L E S – NOLES is a plural form (short for ""noles""), but might be proper noun.  
N U L E T – not a word.  
N S L E T – NSLET – no.  

Option 2: N in 1, L in 5  
Pattern: N _ _ E L  
Need letters for 2 and 3.  
N U M E L – NUMEL – no.  
N O B E L – NOBEL – yes, this is a valid word (Nobel prize).  
Let’s check constraints:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (not used yet, allowed)  
- B in 3 (not used yet, allowed)  
- E in 4 (fixed)  
- L in 5 (allowed)  
- Letters used: N, O, B, E, L – all satisfy constraints.

Option 3: N in 2, L in 3  
Pattern: _ N L E _  
Need 1 and 5 letters.  
Try S N L E T – SNLET – no.  
B N L E T – BNLET – no.  

Option 4: N in 2, L in 5  
Pattern: _ N _ E L  
Need 1 and 3 letters.  
Try S N O E L – SNOEL – no.  
T N O E L – TNOEL – no.  

Thus, NOBEL seems the only valid candidate fitting all constraints.Based on the accumulated constraints, the only valid 5-letter word I can form that satisfies all feedback is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Popular strategic starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, ADIEU, RAISE, etc. Among these, CRANE is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)

- N (common consonant)

So:

2. The secret word does NOT contain C, R, or A.

I need a new word that:
- Uses N and E, but places them in different positions than 4 and 5.

Possible positions for N and E:

I'll try a word like ""SENDY"" – but ""SENDY"" isn't a valid English word. Instead, let's try ""SENTY"" – also invalid. 

Looking at valid words, ""SENTO"" isn't valid either. How about ""TENSE""? That uses N and E in new positions (N in 3, E in 2), and avoids C, R, A.

Letters we can rule out completely: C, R, A, V  
Letters that are definitely in the word: E, N, L  
Positions we have information about:

Position 2 (from ELVEN): L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
Position 3 (from ELVEN): V(x) → already ruled out.  
Position 4 (from ELVEN): E(✓) → the letter in position 4 must be E.  
Position 5 (from ELVEN): N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern looks like:
_ _ _ E _

With the constraints:
- The missing letters (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) must include N and L, but:
  – L cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 5.
- The remaining two slots must be filled with letters not yet used (anything except C, R, A, V).

We still need two more unique letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried: S, T, D, B, etc.

Let’s try to place N and L in valid spots while picking other frequent letters.

- N (but not in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- L (but not in positions 1, 2, or 4)

Positions that remain open: 1, 2, 3, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 4 is E (✓).
- N is somewhere among positions 1, 2 (because it can’t be 3, 4, 5).
- L is somewhere among positions 3, 5 (because it can’t be 1, 2, 4).

Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible placements that satisfy all constraints:

Case 1: N in position 1  
Then pattern: N _ _ E _  
L must be in 3 or 5.  
Remaining letters: must pick two common unused letters for the open spots.

Sub-case 1a: N _ L E _  
Then position 2 needs a letter (not yet used, not C, R, A, V, I, D).  
Try N U L E S? S is common.  
Does NUL* exist? NULES – dictionary check says not a word.  
Next option: N _ L E T → N O L E T – not a word.  
N _ L E Y → N U L E Y – no.  
N _ L E K → N U L E K – no.

Sub-case 1b: N _ _ E L  
Then positions 2 and 3 need letters.  
N U T E L – not a word.  
N E S E L – has E twice, not allowed (E already in position 4).  
N O W E L – yes, NOWEL is a variant spelling of “noel,” but may not be accepted.  
N O S E L – not a word.  
N E X E L – has X (rare).  
N U N E L – has N twice.  
Looks like limited options here.

Case 2: N in position 2  
Then pattern: _ N _ E _  
L must be in 3 or 5.  

Sub-case 2a: _ N L E _  
Then position 1 and 5 need letters.  
Let’s pick common consonants for position 1 and 5.  
Try B N L E S – BNLES? Not a word.  
S N L E W – SNLEW? No.  
T N L E S – TNLES? No.  
M N L E T – MNLET? No.

Try S N O E L – SNOEL? Not a word.  
B N O E L – BNOEL? No.  
H N U E L – No.  
T N U E L – No.  

Case 3: Backtrack – maybe we missed a placement.

N O M E L – NOMEL isn’t a word.  
N U M E L – NUMEL – not a word.  
N U S E L – not a word.

Hmm, perhaps we need a different strategy. Let’s list possible words that fit _ _ _ E _ with N and L in allowed positions.

Looking at a mental list of common 5-letter words ending in E:

- T E N S E – contains T, N, E, S, E (but we already have N constrained).  
- P E N N E – has N twice.  
- B E N N E – no.  
- S E N S E – has N in disallowed position 3.  
- M E N U E – not a word.  
- G E N I E – has I (ruled out).  
- B U N N Y – ends in Y, but we need E in position 4.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine constraints:

We have: _ _ _ E _
- N must be in position 1 or 2
- L must be in position 3 or 5
- Cannot use C, R, A, V, I, D
- Need to pick from remaining letters

N O L E S – NOLES is a plural form (short for ""noles""), but might be proper noun.  
N U L E T – not a word.  
N S L E T – NSLET – no.  

Option 2: N in 1, L in 5  
Pattern: N _ _ E L  
Need letters for 2 and 3.  
N U M E L – NUMEL – no.  
N O B E L – NOBEL – yes, this is a valid word (Nobel prize).  
Let’s check constraints:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (not used yet, allowed)  
- B in 3 (not used yet, allowed)  
- E in 4 (fixed)  
- L in 5 (allowed)  
- Letters used: N, O, B, E, L – all satisfy constraints.

Option 3: N in 2, L in 3  
Pattern: _ N L E _  
Need 1 and 5 letters.  
Try S N L E T – SNLET – no.  
B N L E T – BNLET – no.  

Option 4: N in 2, L in 5  
Pattern: _ N _ E L  
Need 1 and 3 letters.  
Try S N O E L – SNOEL – no.  
T N O E L – TNOEL – no.  

Thus, NOBEL seems the only valid candidate fitting all constraints.Based on the accumulated constraints, the only valid 5-letter word I can form that satisfies all feedback is:

<guess>NOBEL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ELVEN -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) V(x) E(✓) N(-)
Guess 3: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(x) N(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: NOBEL -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) L(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:

Letters that do NOT occur at all:  
C, R, A, V, I, D, O, B

Letters that ARE in the word:  
E (fixed in position 4)  
N (somewhere, not in 1, 3, 4, 5 ⇒ only possible in position 2)  
L (fixed in position 5)

So the pattern is:  
_ N _ E L  

The only letter missing is position 1, and it must be one we’ve not ruled out yet.  
Allowed letters left (common ones): S, T, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, Y, Z.

Many valid words fit _ N _ E L; the most common consonant for that slot is S, giving SNELL.  
Check: S (allowed), N (must be in position 2), E (position 4), L (position 5) – everything checks out.

Hence: SNELL.
