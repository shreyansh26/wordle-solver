For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular starting choices because they cover common letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The remaining four letters are chosen from the other 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and the remaining vowels (none, since O and E are out and A is already in).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps A (moving it away from position 1)
- Introduces several high-frequency consonants not yet tried (like N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.)
- Avoids the already-eliminated letters R, O, S, E

A good second-guess candidate is “ANTIC”:
- A is now in position 2

From the two rounds of feedback so far:

- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- T is in the word and is in position 3.
- R, O, S, E, N, I, C have all been eliminated.
- The usable letters left are: A, T, plus the remaining letters that haven’t appeared yet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We now know the pattern is:
_ _ T _ _  (with T fixed in position 3)
and A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.

The most common 5-letter pattern with T in the middle is a consonant–vowel–T–consonant–consonant, so it’s efficient to try a word that:
- Keeps T in position 3.
- Puts A in a new location (not 1 or 2).
- Introduces several high-frequency remaining consonants (D, L, M, P, etc.).

“PLATE” would conflict (E is out), “BATON” has O, etc.  
A clean candidate that obeys all constraints is “MATHS”, but S is already out.  
Next: “PATCH” – C is out.

Summary of what we know after three guesses:

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, N, I, C, V, U, L  
Letters confirmed in the word: A, T  
Positions:

- T is in position 3 (from ANTIC feedback T✓)
- A is in the word and is now known to be in position 2 (from VAULT feedback A✓)

So the pattern is fixed as: _ A T _ _

We still need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen only from the remaining, never-tried letters:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We also know A and T are already placed, so they won’t appear again elsewhere.

A good next guess introduces a fresh pair of common consonants in positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.  
Among the still-available letters, the most frequent English consonants left are B, D, G, H, K, M, P.

Choosing “B” and “M” gives us “BATMY”, but “MY” is unlikely and “Y” is rare; instead, “MATHY” also uses “H” and “Y”.

Better common option: “BAT” + “H” + “K” → “BATHK” invalid (H and K together).  
Try “G” and “M” → “GAT M” → “GATEM” invalid.  
Better: “H” and “M” → “HAT M” → “HATEM” invalid.  
Best common English pattern remaining: “M” and “H” → “MATCH” — but C is out.  
Next: “P” and “H” → “PATHS” — S out.  
Next: “M” and “D” → “M” “A” “T” “D” “_” — “MAT D_” — “MATDY” invalid.  

Wait: we can just put “M” and “P” → “MAT P” — but we need 5 letters.

Re-evaluate: positions are fixed _ A T _ _  
We need a real 5-letter word with A in position 2 and T in position 3, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common consonants left that can start a word are B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W.

The simplest valid 5-letter word following _ A T _ _ pattern from the remaining pool is “BATON” (but O is out), “FATAL” (L, F, A, T, A, but F and L are in/out status?), we already ruled out L, etc.

Let me just directly build a valid candidate:  
Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, W  
Position 4: any remaining consonant  
Position 5: any remaining consonant

The most common remaining starting consonants are B, D, G, H, M, P.

Let’s try “BATHY” (but Y is rare).  
Instead, “MATHY” uses M, A, T, H, Y. H and Y are still legal and never tested. Although Y is uncommon, it’s acceptable for a guess. (Also “MATHS” but S is out.)

But we can look for a more common word.  
Another candidate: “PATCH” (C out).  
“WATCH” (C out).  
“MATCH” (C out).  
“GATHS” (S out).  
“BATHE” (E out).  
“HATMY” invalid.  
It appears almost every common English word in _ A T _ _ uses one of the already-eliminated letters. We are forced to try a less common word.

After scanning, the only workable guess from remaining letters: “BAT Y” → “BAT Y” -> “BAT Y” is invalid.  
Perhaps “PAT K” → “PAT K” no.  
Wait, we can use “PAT” + “H” + “K” no.  
Finally, the only remaining 5-letter word pattern that uses entirely legal letters is “MATHY” (M, A, T, H, Y).

So “MATHY” it is.

<guess>MATHY</guess>",MATHY,"Summary of what we know after three guesses:

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, N, I, C, V, U, L  
Letters confirmed in the word: A, T  
Positions:

- T is in position 3 (from ANTIC feedback T✓)
- A is in the word and is now known to be in position 2 (from VAULT feedback A✓)

So the pattern is fixed as: _ A T _ _

We still need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen only from the remaining, never-tried letters:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We also know A and T are already placed, so they won’t appear again elsewhere.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,PATTY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate many possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular starting choices because they cover common letters.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The remaining four letters are chosen from the other 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and the remaining vowels (none, since O and E are out and A is already in).

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps A (moving it away from position 1)
- Introduces several high-frequency consonants not yet tried (like N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.)
- Avoids the already-eliminated letters R, O, S, E

A good second-guess candidate is “ANTIC”:
- A is now in position 2
- N, T, I, C are all new letters that have not been tested yet

Guess 2: ANTIC -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) T(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback so far:

- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- T is in the word and is in position 3.
- R, O, S, E, N, I, C have all been eliminated.
- The usable letters left are: A, T, plus the remaining letters that haven’t appeared yet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We now know the pattern is:
_ _ T _ _  (with T fixed in position 3)
and A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.

The most common 5-letter pattern with T in the middle is a consonant–vowel–T–consonant–consonant, so it’s efficient to try a word that:
- Keeps T in position 3.
- Puts A in a new location (not 1 or 2).
- Introduces several high-frequency remaining consonants (D, L, M, P, etc.).

“PLATE” would conflict (E is out), “BATON” has O, etc.  
A clean candidate that obeys all constraints is “MATHS”, but S is already out.  
Next: “PATCH” – C is out.  
“PATLY” – Y is uncommon.  
“VAULT” – perfect: vowel order, new letters V, U, L.

Let’s go with “VAULT”:
- T remains in position 3.
- A is in position 2 (new location).
- V, U, L are all fresh letters.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from VAULT and MATHY)
- T is in position 3 (from ANTIC and MATHY)
- Y is in position 5 (from MATHY)

Confirmed pattern: _ A T _ Y

Letters ruled out so far:
R, O, S, E, N, I, C, V, U, L, M, H

Still available letters (untested and not ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Z

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with two distinct letters from the available set.

Looking at common English words ending in ""AT _ Y"":
- Possible combinations:
  - B A T _ Y: ""BATBY"" (invalid), ""BATGY"" (invalid), ""BATKY"" (no word), ""BATPY"" (no), ""BATFY"" (no)
  - G A T _ Y: ""GATBY"" (no), ""GATDY"" (no), etc.
  - F A T _ Y: ""FATLY"" (L is out), ""FATKY"" (no)
  - D A T _ Y: ""DATLY"" (L is out)
  - K A T _ Y: ""KATFY"" (no), ""KATBY"" (no)

The only common English word that fits _ A T _ Y is:
- B A T _ Y → ""BATTY"" (but we need to check T usage - T is already in position 3, so this would be valid if allowed to reuse T, but Wordle typically doesn't reuse letters unless they appear multiple times in the word)

However, ""BATTY"" uses T twice, which might not be the case. Looking at other options:
- ""PATLY"" (L is out)
- ""WATKY"" (no)
- ""GATPY"" (no)

After careful consideration, the most plausible real word is ""PATTY"" but P is still available and T can appear twice. However, ""PATTY"" uses P,A,T,T,Y - T appears twice which is possible.

But looking at the remaining available letters for position 4: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,W,X,Z

The simplest valid word is ""PATLY"" but L is out. Next is ""PATTY"" - but let's see if this is the only option.

Actually, the correct approach is to find a valid 5-letter word matching _ A T _ Y with available letters. The only common one is:

""PATTY"" - P,A,T,T,Y (T appears twice) - but this is valid in Wordle.

Another possibility is ""FATTY"" but F is available and T can appear twice.

Between these, ""FATTY"" is more common.

But let's think differently - we need two distinct new letters for positions 1 and 4.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,W,X,Z

Looking for actual words:
- ""PATKY"" (no)
- ""PATBY"" (no)
- ""GATBY"" (no)
- ""BATFY"" (no)
- ""DATKY"" (no)

There appears to be no common English word fitting _ A T _ Y with only new consonants in 1 and 4. This suggests we might need to use a less common word or verify our assumptions.

Upon re-examining, the word ""PATTY"" is indeed valid and uses P,A,T,T,Y - T can appear twice. This seems to be the most plausible next guess.

But looking at the feedback, Y is confirmed in position 5, and we have _ A T _ Y. The word ""PATTY"" would fit this pattern.

However, we need to check if T can be used twice - in Wordle, letters can appear multiple times if the actual word has them.

Therefore, the most likely word is ""PATTY"".

But wait - we've already used P (no, we haven't - P hasn't been guessed yet).

""PATTY"" uses P,A,T,T,Y - P and second T are new positions, which is acceptable.

Therefore, the guess is ""PATTY"".

<guess>PATTY</guess>",PATTY,"Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from VAULT and MATHY)
- T is in position 3 (from ANTIC and MATHY)
- Y is in position 5 (from MATHY)

Confirmed pattern: _ A T _ Y

Letters ruled out so far:
R, O, S, E, N, I, C, V, U, L, M, H

Still available letters (untested and not ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Z

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with two distinct letters from the available set.

Looking at common English words ending in ""AT _ Y"":
- Possible combinations:
  - B A T _ Y: ""BATBY"" (invalid), ""BATGY"" (invalid), ""BATKY"" (no word), ""BATPY"" (no), ""BATFY"" (no)
  - G A T _ Y: ""GATBY"" (no), ""GATDY"" (no), etc.
  - F A T _ Y: ""FATLY"" (L is out), ""FATKY"" (no)
  - D A T _ Y: ""DATLY"" (L is out)
  - K A T _ Y: ""KATFY"" (no), ""KATBY"" (no)

The only common English word that fits _ A T _ Y is:
- B A T _ Y → ""BATTY"" (but we need to check T usage - T is already in position 3, so this would be valid if allowed to reuse T, but Wordle typically doesn't reuse letters unless they appear multiple times in the word)

However, ""BATTY"" uses T twice, which might not be the case. Looking at other options:
- ""PATLY"" (L is out)
- ""WATKY"" (no)
- ""GATPY"" (no)

After careful consideration, the most plausible real word is ""PATTY"" but P is still available and T can appear twice. However, ""PATTY"" uses P,A,T,T,Y - T appears twice which is possible.

But looking at the remaining available letters for position 4: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,W,X,Z

The simplest valid word is ""PATLY"" but L is out. Next is ""PATTY"" - but let's see if this is the only option.

Actually, the correct approach is to find a valid 5-letter word matching _ A T _ Y with available letters. The only common one is:

""PATTY"" - P,A,T,T,Y (T appears twice) - but this is valid in Wordle.

Another possibility is ""FATTY"" but F is available and T can appear twice.

Between these, ""FATTY"" is more common.

But let's think differently - we need two distinct new letters for positions 1 and 4.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,W,X,Z

Looking for actual words:
- ""PATKY"" (no)
- ""PATBY"" (no)
- ""GATBY"" (no)
- ""BATFY"" (no)
- ""DATKY"" (no)

There appears to be no common English word fitting _ A T _ Y with only new consonants in 1 and 4. This suggests we might need to use a less common word or verify our assumptions.

Upon re-examining, the word ""PATTY"" is indeed valid and uses P,A,T,T,Y - T can appear twice. This seems to be the most plausible next guess.

But looking at the feedback, Y is confirmed in position 5, and we have _ A T _ Y. The word ""PATTY"" would fit this pattern.

However, we need to check if T can be used twice - in Wordle, letters can appear multiple times if the actual word has them.

Therefore, the most likely word is ""PATTY"".

But wait - we've already used P (no, we haven't - P hasn't been guessed yet). 

Rechecking:
Letters used so far in guesses: A,R,O,S,E,N,T,I,C,V,U,L,M,H,Y
Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,W,X,Z

""PATTY"" uses P,A,T,T,Y - P and second T are new positions, which is acceptable.

Therefore, the guess is ""PATTY"".",Guess 5: PATTY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
