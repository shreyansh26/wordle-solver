For the first guess, since we have no prior information, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words.
2. It contains 2 common consonants (R, S).
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, allowing us to test 5 unique letters at once.
4. It follows the 5-letter constraint and is a valid English word.

This gives us the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their potential positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern _ R _ _ _
2. Letters to exclude: A, O, S, E
3. Letters still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word that:
- Starts with any letter except A, O, S, E.
- Has R in the second position.
- Ends with any three letters except A, O, S, E.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good next word would introduce new common consonants and vowels. Since we need a vowel somewhere, and the good ones (A, O, E) are excluded, we can try I or U.

The word ""BRISK"" fits _ R _ _ _, but S is excluded. Similarly, ""CRISP"" has S excluded. ""DRINK"" has I and N, K as new letters. This seems like a solid next guess.

So far we know:

1. Pattern: _ R I _ _  (R fixed at 2nd, I fixed at 3rd).
2. Eliminated letters: A, O, S, E, D, N, K, F, T, Z.
3. Allowed letters still left (among common ones): B, C, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a real English word that is _ R I _ _ and uses three of the remaining allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Let’s list possible words:

- B R I B _ → BRIBE – valid.
- B R I C _ → BRICK – valid.
- B R I M _ → BRIMS – but S eliminated.
- C R I B _ → CRIBS – S eliminated.
- C R I M _ → CRIMP – valid.
- C R I B _ already saw.
- G R I M _ → GRIM_ – GRIME (E eliminated), GRIMP not a word, GRIMY – Y allowed.
- H R I … nothing common.
- P R I C _ → PRICE – E eliminated, PRICK – K eliminated, PRICY – but Y allowed.
- V R I … nothing common.
- W R I … nothing common.

Best candidates:
1. BRIBE – uses B, B, E (E is eliminated), so invalid.
2. BRICK – uses B, C, K (K is eliminated), so invalid.
3. CRIMP – uses C, M, P – all allowed. Valid word.
4. GRIMY – uses G, M, Y – all allowed. Valid word.

Both CRIMP and GRIMY fit. Between them, CRIMP is slightly more common and uses C, M, P which are all still in play.

Thus, CRIMP is the logical next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word has the pattern _ R _ _ _
2. Letters to exclude: A, O, S, E
3. Letters still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a word that:
- Starts with any letter except A, O, S, E.
- Has R in the second position.
- Ends with any three letters except A, O, S, E.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good next word would introduce new common consonants and vowels. Since we need a vowel somewhere, and the good ones (A, O, E) are excluded, we can try I or U.

The word ""BRISK"" fits _ R _ _ _, but S is excluded. Similarly, ""CRISP"" has S excluded. ""DRINK"" has I and N, K as new letters. This seems like a solid next guess.

3. Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-used R and I (which we now know are in their correct spots).

A good next guess should:
- Keep R and I locked in place
- Use three new, common letters for positions 1, 4, 5 (none of which may be any of the eliminated letters)
- Be a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ R I _ _

Candidate stems:
- BRING – N is eliminated
- GRIND – N, D eliminated
- FRISK – S, K eliminated
- PRICK – K, C eliminated
- TRIP_ – T, R, I already good, need two more allowed consonants
- BRIDE – D, E eliminated
- CRISP – S, P allowed but S eliminated
- GRIME – M, E eliminated
- PRIME – M, E eliminated

Word that works: TRIPS – but S eliminated.
Next: TRIM_ – but needs five letters; TRIMS – S eliminated.
FRITZ – Z uncommon, but valid.
CRIBS – S eliminated.
BRITS – S eliminated.

Among these, “FRITZ” is valid:
- F, R, I, T, Z
- None of F, T, Z have been eliminated yet.
- Fits _ R I _ _ pattern.

Another valid one: “TRIBE” – E eliminated.
“PRIZE” – E eliminated.

Best remaining:  
“FRITH” (archaic but valid) – H not eliminated.
“FRITZ” is valid and uses common letters.
