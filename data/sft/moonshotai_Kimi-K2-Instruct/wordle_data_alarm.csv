For the first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters and could help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common letters to see which ones might be in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- L is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ L _ _ _

And we know A is somewhere in the remaining four positions, but NOT in position 3.

Good next letters to try are common consonants like R, N, C, M, G, and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already confirmed but its position is unknown).

From both rounds of feedback:

- L is fixed in position 2.  
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (from SLATE) and **not** in position 3 again (from FLANK).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, F, N, K.

We now have the pattern:  
_ L _ _ _  
with one of positions 1, 4, or 5 being A.

A good next word should:
1. Put the A in one of those remaining positions.
2. Introduce new, common consonants not yet tried (R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.).

Let’s test placing A in position 1: A L _ _ _

We need two more consonants that are still allowed.  
Common remaining letters: R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.

A strong candidate is A L A R M, but that repeats A (we don’t know yet if any letter can be repeated).  
A better, non-repeating candidate is A L C R _ or A L _ _ _.

Let’s choose A L C R _ and finish with another common consonant not yet used: A L C R Y.

Wait—Y is acceptable? Yes, Y can appear.  
But is ALCRY a valid word? No—ALCRY is not a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a real word.  
Try A L A R M? Alarm is valid, but it has two A’s and we already know A appears once.  
We could test A L A R M anyway, but let’s avoid repeats until forced.

Try A L O R D → “ALORD” is invalid.  
Try C L A I R → fails pattern (L must be in position 2).  
Try B L A C K → B and C are new, A is now in position 3—but from earlier A cannot be in position 3.  
Try C L A M P → P is new, but A is again in position 3 (disallowed).

Instead, place A in position 4: _ L _ A _

BLAZE (Z not yet ruled out)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters and could help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common letters to see which ones might be in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- L is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ L _ _ _

And we know A is somewhere in the remaining four positions, but NOT in position 3.

Good next letters to try are common consonants like R, N, C, M, G, and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already confirmed but its position is unknown).

A word that fits _ L _ _ _, uses A somewhere (but not in 3rd), and avoids S, T, E is ""FLANK"":
- F: not previously ruled out
- L: correct 2nd letter
- A: fits (not in 3rd)
- N: new, common consonant
- K: new letter

This gives us: F L A N K

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: FLANK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both rounds of feedback:

- L is fixed in position 2.  
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (from SLATE) and **not** in position 3 again (from FLANK).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, F, N, K.

We now have the pattern:  
_ L _ _ _  
with one of positions 1, 4, or 5 being A.

A good next word should:
1. Put the A in one of those remaining positions.
2. Introduce new, common consonants not yet tried (R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.).

Let’s test placing A in position 1: A L _ _ _

We need two more consonants that are still allowed.  
Common remaining letters: R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.

A strong candidate is A L A R M, but that repeats A (we don’t know yet if any letter can be repeated).  
A better, non-repeating candidate is A L C R _ or A L _ _ _.

Let’s choose A L C R _ and finish with another common consonant not yet used: A L C R Y.

Wait—Y is acceptable? Yes, Y can appear.  
But is ALCRY a valid word? No—ALCRY is not a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a real word.  
Try A L A R M? Alarm is valid, but it has two A’s and we already know A appears once.  
We could test A L A R M anyway, but let’s avoid repeats until forced.

Try B L A C K → B and C are new, A is now in position 3—but from earlier A cannot be in position 3.

CLASH (S ruled out)  
GLADE (E ruled out)  
BLADE (E ruled out)  
GLAND (N ruled out)  
FLORA (F ruled out)

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,alarm,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to pick a word that has common letters and could help me quickly narrow down possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of common letters to see which ones might be in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- L is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ L _ _ _

And we know A is somewhere in the remaining four positions, but NOT in position 3.

Good next letters to try are common consonants like R, N, C, M, G, and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already confirmed but its position is unknown).

A word that fits _ L _ _ _, uses A somewhere (but not in 3rd), and avoids S, T, E is ""FLANK"":
- F: not previously ruled out
- L: correct 2nd letter
- A: fits (not in 3rd)
- N: new, common consonant
- K: new letter

This gives us: F L A N K

<guess>FLANK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FLANK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From both rounds of feedback:

- L is fixed in position 2.  
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (from SLATE) and **not** in position 3 again (from FLANK).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
- Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, F, N, K.

We now have the pattern:  
_ L _ _ _  
with one of positions 1, 4, or 5 being A.

A good next word should:
1. Put the A in one of those remaining positions.
2. Introduce new, common consonants not yet tried (R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.).

Let’s test placing A in position 1: A L _ _ _

We need two more consonants that are still allowed.  
Common remaining letters: R, C, M, G, B, D, etc.

A strong candidate is A L A R M, but that repeats A (we don’t know yet if any letter can be repeated).  
A better, non-repeating candidate is A L C R _ or A L _ _ _.

Let’s choose A L C R _ and finish with another common consonant not yet used: A L C R Y.

Wait—Y is acceptable? Yes, Y can appear.  
But is ALCRY a valid word? No—ALCRY is not a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a real word.  
Try A L A R M? Alarm is valid, but it has two A’s and we already know A appears once.  
We could test A L A R M anyway, but let’s avoid repeats until forced.

Try A L O R D → “ALORD” is invalid.  
Try C L A I R → fails pattern (L must be in position 2).  
Try B L A C K → B and C are new, A is now in position 3—but from earlier A cannot be in position 3.  
Try C L A M P → P is new, but A is again in position 3 (disallowed).

Instead, place A in position 4: _ L _ A _

Valid 5-letter words:  
BLAZE (Z not yet ruled out)  
CLASH (S ruled out)  
GLADE (E ruled out)  
BLADE (E ruled out)  
GLAND (N ruled out)  
FLORA (F ruled out)  
BRAVO (V and O new)

BRAVO fits:
- B, R, V, O are all new.
- A is in position 4 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (fixed).
- Pattern: _ L _ A _

Check validity: BRAVO is a valid 5-letter word.

So guess BRAVO.

<guess>BRAVO</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FLANK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) K(x)
Guess 3: BRAVO -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) A(✓) V(x) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the latest feedback (BRAVO):

- B (x), V (x), O (x) are all **not** in the word.  
- A is **confirmed** and in the **correct** position 4.  
- R is in the word but **wrong** position (it was in position 2).  

Current known facts:
- Pattern: _ L _ A _  (L fixed at 2, A fixed at 4).
- Letters ruled out: S, T, E, F, N, K, B, V, O.
- Letters still in play: R (must appear elsewhere), plus any new letters.

We need to place R in position 1, 3, or 5 while avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Try GLARE:  
- G, new.  
- L fixed at 2.  
- A fixed at 4.  
- R at 3 (allowed).  
- E ruled out ⇒ can’t use GLARE.

Try DRAIN:  
- D, new.  
- R at 3.  
- I, new.  
- N ruled out ⇒ can’t use DRAIN.

Try GRASP:  
- G, new.  
- R at 3.  
- S ruled out ⇒ can’t use.

Try CRAMP:  
- C, new.  
- R at 3.  
- P, new.  
Letters used: C, L, R, A, P — all allowed and valid word.

Pattern check: C L R A P (fits _ L _ A _ since A must be at 4).  
R is in position 3, which satisfies “R is in word but wrong position”.

Word “CLARP” is invalid. “CRAMP” is valid and fits pattern: C R A M P?  
Wait, pattern must be _ L _ A _.

Correct pattern is _ L _ A _. 

So we need positions: 1 _ 2 L 3 _ 4 A 5 _

Try PLAID: fails pattern.  
Try CLARY: Y not ruled out, but not a common word.  
Try CLADS: D, S ruled out.  

Better: C L A _ _ fails A must be at 4.

Correct pattern is _ L _ A _.  
Need valid word like GLARE (but E out), or DRAMA (M new, but A repeats and D new).  
DRAMA: A repeats, we don’t know yet.

Try DRAMA: D, R, A, M, A — A repeats, but word valid.  
But from earlier we only know one A exists. Let’s avoid repeat letters.

Try CLARK: K ruled out.  
Try C L A I R: A must be at 4, so C L _ A R.

Valid word: CLUAR? No.  
Valid word: CLAIM: A at 3 (forbidden).

Try C L O A R? Invalid.

Valid word: CLARO? Not common.  
Valid word: CLARY? Not common.

Real valid 5-letter word fitting _ L _ A _ with R elsewhere:

- CLEAR: E ruled out.  
- C L A R K: K ruled out.  
- C L A P S: S ruled out.  
- C L A M S: S out, M new but plural form.

Real valid choice: C L A M P? No, A at 3.

Actually pattern _ L _ A _ has A at 4.

Valid words:  
- GLAZE (Z new, E out).  
- FLACK (F, K out).  
- SLACK (S, K out).  
- PLACK (P, L, A, C, K — K out).  
- CRAMP (C, R, A, M, P — A at 3, must be at 4).  

Ah, mistake: pattern is _ L _ A _ (A at 4), so positions 1-2-3-4-5.  
So _ L _ A _ means A must be at 4.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ L _ A _:

- ALARM (A repeats, A at 1).  
- CLANG (G new, N ruled out).  
- CLASP (S ruled out).  
- CLARY (Y new).  
- FLANK (F, K out).  
- GLARE (E out).  
- PLANK (K out).  
- PLATE (T, E out).  
- ULAMA (U new, A repeats).  

Valid and clean: **CLARY** (C, L, A, R, Y) — all letters allowed, A at 4, R at 5 (new position), word valid.

But **CLARY** is a valid word (a plant).  
However, for common usage, let’s pick **GLARY** (G, L, A, R, Y) — also valid.

GLARY fits _ L _ A _ with G, L, A, R, Y.  
R is at 5 (new position), A at 4 (correct), L at 2 fixed.  
All letters new except L, A, R.

But R was in BRAVO at position 2 (wrong), now at position 5 (allowed).

GLARY is valid.

Let’s choose **GLARY**.
