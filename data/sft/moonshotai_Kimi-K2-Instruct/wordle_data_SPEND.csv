Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information by covering common letters in English 5-letter words. Good starting words typically contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. 

A classic high-information starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - covering the most common vowels
- 2 common consonants (R, S) - which are among the most frequent in English

This gives me good coverage to potentially hit multiple letters early and narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the word contains S and E, but:
- S is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

I need a new guess that:
- Uses S and E in different positions.
- Avoids A, R, O entirely.
- Helps discover the other three letters.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, C, H, M, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word that shifts S and E to new spots, and introduces some new common letters.  
A balanced choice is “UNSET”:
- Uses S in position 4 (not 3) and E in position 3 (not 5).
- Introduces U, N, T, which are common and unused so far.
- Avoids A, R, O.

This should efficiently test new letters while respecting the constraints.

Step 2 – Pin down the positions  
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (it appeared in 3 in AROSE and 3 in UNSET). It must be in 1, 2 or 5.  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (it appeared in 5 in AROSE and 4 in UNSET). It must be in 1, 2 or 4.  
- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNSET). It must be in 1, 3, 4 or 5.

Step 3 – Pick a new word that  
- keeps S, E, N inside the word,  
- moves each to a new, still-possible slot,  
- introduces fresh, common letters that have not been ruled out (good candidates are L, I, D, C, H, M, etc.).

Step 4 – Construct the candidate  
A convenient pattern that satisfies the above is to place  
S _ E _ N

Step 1 – Summarize the confirmed and ruled-out letters.

- Letters that ARE in the word and now in the right place:
  – S is in position 1 (✓)
  – E is in position 3 (✓)

- Letters that are in the word but still in the wrong place:
  – N (it appeared in positions 2 and 5 so far, but never in the correct spot).

- Letters that are NOT in the word (x’s so far):
  – A, R, O, U, T, L, I

Step 2 – Determine the remaining blanks.

We have the fixed skeleton:  
S _ E _ _ (positions 1 and 3 locked)

Step 3 – Place the known misplaced letter N.

N must go in either position 2 or 4 (those are the only remaining possibilities that haven’t been tested for N yet).

Step 4 – Choose the last remaining letter.

We still need one more letter for position 5 (or 4 if we put N in 2).  
From the remaining alphabet, the still-allowed consonants/vowels include, for example, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc. Using very common letters first helps narrow things fastest.

The two most promising skeletons are:

A) S N E _ _  → needs position 4 and 5 filled (N is now in 2)  
B) S _ E N _  → needs position 2 and 5 filled (N is now in 4)

Let’s try pattern B, because position 2 has more candidate letters left.  
We still need two fresh letters. Among the common unused consonants, “D” and “C” are high-frequency. Choosing “D” for position 2 and “C” for position 5 gives a valid word.

That yields: S D E N C (but SDENC is not a real English word).  
A common English word that fits S _ E N _ is “S P E N D”.

Let’s check:
- S in 1 ✓ (matches fixed letter)  
- P is new and allowed  
- E in 3 ✓  
- N in 4 (good, new spot for N)  
- D is new and allowed
