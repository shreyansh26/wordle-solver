For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter positioning that can help identify correct placements

This should give me solid information about which vowels are present and their positions, plus feedback on R and S.

The first guess “AROSE” got five x-marks, meaning none of the letters A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word at all.  
Therefore, I need a second guess that avoids every one of those five letters and still gives maximum information.

Looking for a word that contains only letters NOT in {A, R, O, S, E} and has common, distinct letters:

- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
- Vowels left: I, U

Popular choices among the remaining consonants: L, N, T, I, U.  
A well-balanced word using five distinct letters from the allowed set is “UNTIL”. It gives coverage of the remaining vowels (U, I) and several common consonants (N, T, L).

This should provide good new information.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → all five letters (A,R,O,S,E) are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → U(x), T(x), L(x) are NOT in the word, while N(-) and I(-) are in the word but in the wrong positions.

Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.

Letters we know are present: N, I (but not in their current positions).

Remaining alphabet letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters N and I.

Since N is in the word but not in position 3 (from UNTIL), and I is in the word but not in position 4, we need a word that:
- Contains both N and I
- Avoids all eliminated letters: A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L
- Uses valid 5-letter words

Looking at common words, ""PINNY"" is invalid because Y is in position 5 and N is repeated. ""MINCY"" uses Y and C, but Y is less common. ""CHIMP"" uses M,P,H but lacks N.

A good balanced word is ""CHINK"" - but K is acceptable since it's not eliminated. However, it doesn't use N or I.

Wait, we need N and I. The word ""MINIC"" uses M,I,N,I,C - but repeats I. ""PINKY"" uses P,I,N,K,Y - but Y is acceptable since not eliminated.

But ""PINKY"" has I in position 2 and N in position 3 - both positions are potentially valid since the previous feedback only told us the original positions were wrong, not these new ones.

Actually, the simplest word containing both N and I without any eliminated letters is ""BLINK"" - but L is eliminated. ""DINGY"" uses D,I,N,G,Y - all allowed letters.

""DINGY"" has:
- D (new consonant)
- I (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- G, Y (new consonants to test)

This seems optimal for gaining maximum new information while respecting all constraints.

Let me process the new feedback:

1. From DINGY:
   - D is in the word and in the correct 1st position (✓)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - Y is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

2. Combining all information:
   - Must contain: D (position 1), I, N, G, Y
   - Must NOT contain: A,R,O,S,E,U,T,L
   - Letters left to place: I, N, G, Y (positions 2-5)
   - Known constraints:
     - I ≠ position 2
     - N ≠ position 3
     - G ≠ position 4
     - Y ≠ position 5

3. So the word structure is: D _ _ _ _
   With remaining letters: I, N, G, Y to fill positions 2,3,4,5
   But positions have restrictions:
   - Position 2: NOT I
   - Position 3: NOT N
   - Position 4: NOT G
   - Position 5: NOT Y

4. Let's find a valid permutation of I,N,G,Y where:
   - I is not in position 2
   - N is not in position 3
   - G is not in position 4
   - Y is not in position 5

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: N,G,Y (not I)
- Position 3: I,G,Y (not N)
- Position 4: I,N,Y (not G)
- Position 5: I,N,G (not Y)

Valid permutations:
- D N I G Y: But G would be in position 4 (invalid)
- D N G I Y: Y in position 5 (invalid)
- D N G Y I: This works:
   - Position 2: N (allowed)
   - Position 3: G (allowed)
   - Position 4: Y (allowed)
   - Position 5: I (allowed)

- D G I N Y: N would be in position 4 (allowed), but Y in 5 (invalid)
- D G N I Y: Y in 5 (invalid)
- D G N Y I: This works:
   - Position 2: G (allowed)
   - Position 3: N (invalid - N cannot be in position 3)

- D Y I N G: G in 5 (allowed)
   - Position 2: Y (allowed)
   - Position 3: I (allowed)
   - Position 4: N (allowed)

   This works!

- D Y N I G: I in 4 (allowed), G in 5 (allowed)
   - Position 2: Y (allowed)
   - Position 3: N (invalid - N cannot be in position 3)

So the valid words are:
- DNIGY → D N G Y I
- DYING → D Y I N G

Both are valid English words. ""DYING"" is more common.

Based on the feedback:
- D is correctly placed at position 1
- The word must contain I, N, G, Y somewhere in positions 2-5
- Constraints:
  - I not in position 2
  - N not in position 3
  - G not in position 4
  - Y not in position 5

A valid arrangement that satisfies all constraints is ""DYING"".
