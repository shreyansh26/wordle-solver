For a first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include common vowels and consonants. Some strategic choices are words like:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

These words include frequently used letters (A, E, S, T, R, etc.) which helps maximize information gain. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opener with several common letters and good letter distribution. 

The letters in CRANE are:
C, R, A, N, E - covering 2 vowels (A,E) and 3 common consonants (C,R,N)

So far we know:
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it got a “-” instead of a ✓).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1) Contains the letter R (but not in position 2).
2) Does NOT contain C, A, N, E.
3) Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters we can still use: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (somewhere other than position 2).

Good next candidates:
- DRIFT – but contains I and F, which are decent.
- RUSTY – R in position 1 (allowed), covers U, S, T, Y.
- TRIPE – but contains E (already ruled out).
- BIRTH – covers B, I, T, H; R is in position 2, which is disallowed by the feedback.
- ROUST – R in position 1, O, U, S, T.

I’ll pick “ROUST” because it places R in position 1 (allowed), introduces 3 new common consonants (S, T) and a new vowel (O), and uses no excluded letters.

We need a word that:

Let’s try to build a candidate:
– R must be in 3/4/5
– O and U must fit in the remaining spots, avoiding their disallowed positions.

Possible patterns (with R fixed in each valid spot):
R3: _ _ R _ _
   – O can’t be 2, so O could be 1,4,5
   – U can’t be 3, so U could be 1,2,4,5

   – U can’t be 3, so U could be 1,2,4

A convenient word that fits R3 and has O and U elsewhere is:
FUROR (but O repeats).
DUROR (same issue).
BURRO (but R repeats).

A better word avoiding repeats: “BURRO” is invalid (double R).  
Try “BURRO” → R appears twice, unknown if allowed yet (but safer to avoid).

Another candidate: “BURRO” out, try “FUROR” no good.
Look for simple three-distinct-letter placements.

Try “FLOUR”: F, L, O, U, R – letters all allowed, positions:
R is 5 (OK), O is 3 (OK, not 2), U is 4 (OK, not 3). Looks good.

Check F, L, O, U, R:

BURRO (but R repeats).

A better word avoiding repeats: “BURRO” is invalid (double R).  
Try “BURRO” → R appears twice, unknown if allowed yet (but safer to avoid).

Another candidate: “BURRO” out, try “FUROR” no good.
Look for simple three-distinct-letter placements.

Let’s try “DROOP” – but O repeats.
Try “FLOUR”: F, L, O, U, R – letters all allowed, positions:
R is 5 (OK), O is 3 (OK, not 2), U is 4 (OK, not 3). Looks good.

Check F, L, O, U, R:
– None of F, L ruled out yet.
– O and U are allowed and placements avoid the “-” positions.

So “FLOUR” seems valid.

Summary of what we now know:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, S, T, F, L.

3. Positions so far:

Constraints for the remaining slots (1-4):
- Must include both O and U somewhere inside those four positions.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- U cannot be in position 4.
- Only letters not yet ruled out are allowed: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z, plus the known O,U.

Goal: find a valid English 5-letter word that ends in R and contains each of O and U exactly once in positions 1-4, respecting the positional bans above.

Let’s list possible placements of O and U across positions 1-4, with the bans respected:
- O banned from 3 → O can be 1,2,4
- U banned from 4 → U can be 1,2,3
- O and U must be placed in two different slots among 1-4.

Enumerate compatible (O,U) index pairs (i,j) with i≠j:
(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — all respect the bans.

For each of these pairs, we’ll fill the remaining two empty slots with letters that have not yet been ruled out and that appear in common English words ending in R.

After checking a dictionary of 5-letter words ending in R and containing both O and U, one high-frequency word that satisfies:

- Ends in R
- Contains both O and U
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- U is in position 1 (allowed)
- All letters used are still “legal”

That word is: BOUR (but that’s only 4 letters)… wait, let’s scan:

Valid 5-letter words ending in R with O and U somewhere in positions 1-4:
- HUMOR — contains H, U, M, O, R. Positions:

  Check constraints:
  – Ends in R ✓
  – Contains O and U ✓
  – O is in position 4 (allowed) ✓
  – U is in position 2 (allowed) ✓
  – Letters H, U, M, O, R — none of H, M ruled out yet.

HUMOR looks like a perfect fit.

(Quick sanity check: none of H,U,M,O,R are in the forbidden set; positions satisfy the bans.)

Hence, the next logical guess is HUMOR.

Good starting words often include common vowels and consonants. Some strategic choices are words like:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- ARISE
- ADIEU

These words include frequently used letters (A, E, S, T, R, etc.) which helps maximize information gain. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opener with several common letters and good letter distribution. 

The letters in CRANE are:
C, R, A, N, E - covering 2 vowels (A,E) and 3 common consonants (C,R,N)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it got a “-” instead of a ✓).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1) Contains the letter R (but not in position 2).
2) Does NOT contain C, A, N, E.
3) Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters we can still use: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R (somewhere other than position 2).

Good next candidates:
- DRIFT – but contains I and F, which are decent.
- RUSTY – R in position 1 (allowed), covers U, S, T, Y.
- TRIPE – but contains E (already ruled out).
- BIRTH – covers B, I, T, H; R is in position 2, which is disallowed by the feedback.
- ROUST – R in position 1, O, U, S, T.

I’ll pick “ROUST” because it places R in position 1 (allowed), introduces 3 new common consonants (S, T) and a new vowel (O), and uses no excluded letters.

2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it got “-” in both CRANE and ROUST).
3. O and U are in the word but in the WRONG positions (they each got “-” in ROUST).

Letters ruled out:
C, A, N, E, S, T

Letters whose positions are still uncertain (but present):
R – must be in positions 3, 4, or 5
O – must be somewhere other than position 2
U – must be somewhere other than position 3

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
plus R (positions 3-5), O (not 2), U (not 3).

We need a word that:
- Contains R somewhere in positions 3-5
- Contains O not in position 2
- Contains U not in position 3
- Uses only the allowed letters above

Let’s try to build a candidate:
– R must be in 3/4/5
– O and U must fit in the remaining spots, avoiding their disallowed positions.

Possible patterns (with R fixed in each valid spot):
R3: _ _ R _ _
   – O can’t be 2, so O could be 1,4,5
   – U can’t be 3, so U could be 1,2,4,5

R4: _ _ _ R _
   – O can’t be 2, so O could be 1,3,5
   – U can’t be 3, so U could be 1,2,5

R5: _ _ _ _ R
   – O can’t be 2, so O could be 1,3,4
   – U can’t be 3, so U could be 1,2,4

A convenient word that fits R3 and has O and U elsewhere is:
FUROR (but O repeats).
DUROR (same issue).
BURRO (but R repeats).

A better word avoiding repeats: “BURRO” is invalid (double R).  
Try “BURRO” → R appears twice, unknown if allowed yet (but safer to avoid).

From the new feedback:

- H(x)  → H is not in the word.
- U(✓)  → U is in the word and in position 2.
- M(x)  → M is not in the word.
- O(✓)  → O is in the word and in position 4.
- R(✓)  → R is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

So we now have the pattern:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5
Letter:   ?   U   ?   O   R

Known letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, S, T, F, L, H, M.
Allowed letters left: B, D, G, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word ending in “-OUR” with the second letter fixed as U and the fourth as O.  Only the first and third letters remain unknown, and they can only be chosen from the still-allowed set above.

Common 5-letter words ending in “OUR” with U in 2nd and O in 4th:
- BOUAR – not valid.
- GOURD – but ends in D; doesn’t fit pattern.
- JOUR? – no 5-letter word.
- V?OUR? – nothing obvious.

But one clear, well-known word fits:  
BOYAR ends in -R, but no.

Wait, the exact pattern is _U_OR:
Scanning the dictionary, the only common 5-letter word with that exact skeleton is:

BOUGH (doesn’t fit pattern)
P?U?O?R… let’s list all 5-letter words ending in “U O R” sequence (positions 2,4,5)…

Actually, “DOUR” is 4 letters, but we need a 5-letter word whose letters at positions 2,4,5 are U, O, R respectively, with the word ending in R.

The only valid 5-letter word that matches:  
“BOUAR” – not recognized.  
“GOUR” – 4 letters.  
“POUR” – 4 letters.

Wait, the pattern is:

1   2   3   4   5
?   U   ?   O   R

So the word must have the letters in positions 2,4,5 as U,O,R respectively.  A standard English word fitting this exact layout is:

GUIOR – no, not valid.  
BUIOR – no.  
JUIOR – no.  
QUIOR – no.  
VUIOR – no.  

Let’s step back and realize we have:

Pattern: _ U _ O R

A valid common 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is:

“VIGOR” – but G is in position 3, I in 1, but O is already fixed in 4th.  
“SUGAR” – ruled out (S,T,A).  
“BUGGY” – no.  

Wait, let’s list all English 5-letter words matching “_ U _ O R”:

- BUGOR – not a word.
- DUGOR – not a word.
- PUGOR – not a word.
- VUGOR – not a word.

- RIGOR – but R is already fixed in position 5, and I is allowed, G is allowed, so “RIGOR” has R in 5, I in 1, G in 3, O in 4, U in 2 – but U isn’t in RIGOR, so no.

Actually, “RIGOR” doesn’t have U in position 2.  Let’s scan again.

Wait, we have pattern:

1   2   3   4   5
?   U   ?   O   R

A recognized word fitting this exact pattern is:

“VIGOR” – no U.  
“SUGAR” – no.  
“BUGGY” – no.  

Actually, there is one common word:

“JUROR” (J-U-R-O-R) – but R repeats in 3 and 5, which is fine.

Check if J and the repeated R fit constraints:
- J is still allowed (never ruled out).
- U is in position 2 (✓).
- O is in position 4 (✓).
- R is in position 5 (✓).
- No forbidden letters.

“JUROR” is a valid 5-letter word matching every constraint.

Hence, the next guess is JUROR.
