### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices because they cover frequently used letters. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C, R, N (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
This should give good initial feedback on multiple letters.

From Guess 1 (CRANE) we learned:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).
- A is in the word AND in the 3rd position (✓).
- N and E are NOT in the word (x).

So the word so far looks like: _ _ A _ _
We know R appears somewhere, and we don’t have C, N, or E to worry about.

Good next letters to test are common ones we haven’t tried yet: S, T, L, P, H, etc.
A sensible second guess that keeps A in place and tries new letters while also testing R in new positions is “STARL” (but L is in position 5 and R in position 2 would conflict with the feedback). 

Let me instead choose “PARTY”:
- P is new.
- A is in the correct 3rd spot.
- R is in position 2 (different from the 2nd spot in CRANE, so allowed by the feedback).
- T and Y are new letters.

This tests R in a new position and introduces T, P, Y.

Re-examining the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
   - No C, N, E.
   - R exists somewhere, but not in position 2.
   - A is fixed in position 3.

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)
   - No P, T, Y.
   - A is NOT in position 2 (so still fixed in 3).
   - R is NOT in position 3 (but we already knew it’s not in 2).

Current pattern: _ _ A _ _
Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

We know R must appear (because it got “-” in both guesses) and it can’t be in 2nd or 3rd positions, so possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.

We also need to introduce new common consonants and remaining vowels. Good candidates: S, L, D, G, B, H, M, K, plus vowels I, O, U.

A strong third guess that places R in a new spot and tests several new letters is “SHARD”:
- S, H, D are new.
- A stays in 3.
- R is now placed in 4th position (allowed).
- It uses only allowed letters.

This will confirm or rule out S, H, D, and refine R’s position.

From the previous feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
   - A is locked in position 3.  
   - R exists somewhere but is NOT in positions 2 or 3.  

2. PARTY → P(x) A(-) R(-) T(x) Y(x)  
   - Still no P, T, Y.  
   - R still not in 3 (already known).  

3. SHARD → S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x)  
   - S, H, A, R are all in their correct positions.  
   - Only the last letter remains unknown.  

The current pattern is: **S H A R _**  

We know D is NOT in the word (from SHARD feedback). We have already eliminated C, N, E, P, T, Y, D.  

Remaining common letters to test for the last position: B, G, K, L, M, etc.  

The most straightforward 5-letter word fitting ""SHAR_"" is **SHARK**.

Therefore, the next guess should be **SHARK**.
