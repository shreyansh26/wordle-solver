For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several letters at once.

Let's summarize the new information from the second guess (REALS):

- R is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:

Letters that MUST appear: S, L, A, E  
Letter that must NOT appear: T, R  

Also, we have positional constraints:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE) or 5th (from REALS)
- L cannot be 2nd (from SLATE) or 4th (from REALS)
- A cannot be 3rd (from SLATE) or 3rd (from REALS) — same constraint
- E cannot be 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from REALS)

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (from remaining common letters: C, N, I, O, D, etc.), while respecting all the above.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

A promising candidate is ""LEASE"":
- L in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (but E cannot be 2nd — conflict!)
So ""LEASE"" is invalid.

Next try ""SCALES"" — too long.

Try ""SALES"":
- S 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st)

Try ""EASEL"":
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- L 5th (allowed)
But we already know E is not 2nd and L is not 4th, but this doesn't violate those — however it uses E twice, which isn't allowed (each letter in feedback is for exact positions).

Actually, we need to ensure we don't reuse letters beyond their occurrence. Since we only know these letters appear at least once, but not how many times, it's safe to assume they appear exactly once unless proven otherwise.

A valid candidate is ""LEANS"" but N is new and allowed.

But ""LEANS"" uses N as new letter, positions:
- L 1st (allowed)
- E 2nd (invalid — E cannot be 2nd)

Try ""CANES"":
- C new
- A 1st (allowed)
- N 2nd (new)
- E 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
But we need all S,L,A,E — ""CANES"" misses L.

We must include S,L,A,E plus one new letter. Let’s try to construct:

Need one more letter, say D. Word must be permutation of S,L,A,E,D.

Possible: ""DALES"":
- D new
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

""DEALS"":
- D new
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains S,L,A,E,D
- S not 1st or 5th (here 4th) ✔
- L not 2nd or 4th (here 3rd) ✔
- A not 3rd (here 2nd) ✔

""DEALS"" is a valid English word.

Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, the secret word must contain S, L, A, and E (each in a different position than previously guessed) and cannot contain T or R. The word must also be five letters, so it needs one additional letter not yet used. A valid candidate is ""DEALS,"" which introduces D and places the known letters in permissible positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several letters at once.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (SLATE), we know:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the word:
- contains S, L, A, E.
- does NOT contain T.
- the positions we have so far:
  1: not S
  2: not L
  3: not A
  5: not E

With these constraints, I need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (which cannot be T). Let’s think of a word that moves these known letters into new positions and introduces a common unused letter like R, N, I, O, C, or D.

A strong candidate is ""REALS"":

- R (new letter)
- E (moved from 5th to 2nd, allowed since E is in the word but not 5th)
- A (moved from 3rd to 2nd, allowed since A is in the word but not 3rd)
- L (moved from 2nd to 4th, allowed since L is in the word but not 2nd)
- S (moved from 1st to 5th, allowed since S is in the word but not 1st)

""REALS"" is valid, uses the known letters, and introduces R while avoiding T.

<guess>REALS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REALS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) A(-) L(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize the new information from the second guess (REALS):

- R is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:

Letters that MUST appear: S, L, A, E  
Letter that must NOT appear: T, R  

Also, we have positional constraints:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE) or 5th (from REALS)
- L cannot be 2nd (from SLATE) or 4th (from REALS)
- A cannot be 3rd (from SLATE) or 3rd (from REALS) — same constraint
- E cannot be 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from REALS)

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (from remaining common letters: C, N, I, O, D, etc.), while respecting all the above.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

A promising candidate is ""LEASE"":
- L in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (but E cannot be 2nd — conflict!)
So ""LEASE"" is invalid.

Next try ""SCALES"" — too long.

Try ""SALES"":
- S 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st)

Try ""EASEL"":
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- L 5th (allowed)
But we already know E is not 2nd and L is not 4th, but this doesn't violate those — however it uses E twice, which isn't allowed (each letter in feedback is for exact positions).

Actually, we need to ensure we don't reuse letters beyond their occurrence. Since we only know these letters appear at least once, but not how many times, it's safe to assume they appear exactly once unless proven otherwise.

A valid candidate is ""LEANS"" but N is new and allowed.

But ""LEANS"" uses N as new letter, positions:
- L 1st (allowed)
- E 2nd (invalid — E cannot be 2nd)

Try ""LANES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- N new (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""EALAS"" — invalid word.

Try ""EASLE"" — same as EASEL, invalid.

Try ""SALVE"" — V is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""SNALE"" — N new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ELANS"" — same as LANES but E first:
- E 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid — L cannot be 2nd)

Try ""SABLE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ECLAS"" — C new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed)
- C 2nd (new, allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- A 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid)

Try ""CLASE"" — C new:
- C 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCALE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""LACES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- C 3rd (new, allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""LASES"" — S appears twice, unclear if allowed.

Try ""ECLAS"" again — S 5th invalid.

Try ""ALECS"":
- A 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCENA"" — but A is 5th which is allowed, S 1st invalid.

Try ""CLEAN"":
- C new
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""CANES"":
- C new
- A 1st (allowed)
- N 2nd (new)
- E 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
But we need all S,L,A,E — ""CANES"" misses L.

We must include S,L,A,E plus one new letter. Let’s try to construct:

Need one more letter, say D. Word must be permutation of S,L,A,E,D.

Possible: ""DALES"":
- D new
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

""DEALS"":
- D new
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains S,L,A,E,D
- S not 1st or 5th (here 4th) ✔
- L not 2nd or 4th (here 3rd) ✔
- A not 3rd (here 2nd) ✔
- E not 5th or 2nd (here 1st) ✔
- No T or R ✔

- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:

Letters that MUST appear: S, L, A, E  
Letter that must NOT appear: T, R  

Also, we have positional constraints:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE) or 5th (from REALS)
- L cannot be 2nd (from SLATE) or 4th (from REALS)
- A cannot be 3rd (from SLATE) or 3rd (from REALS) — same constraint
- E cannot be 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from REALS)

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (from remaining common letters: C, N, I, O, D, etc.), while respecting all the above.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

A promising candidate is ""LEASE"":
- L in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (but E cannot be 2nd — conflict!)
So ""LEASE"" is invalid.

Next try ""SCALES"" — too long.

Try ""SALES"":
- S 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st)

Try ""EASEL"":
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- L 5th (allowed)
But we already know E is not 2nd and L is not 4th, but this doesn't violate those — however it uses E twice, which isn't allowed (each letter in feedback is for exact positions).

Actually, we need to ensure we don't reuse letters beyond their occurrence. Since we only know these letters appear at least once, but not how many times, it's safe to assume they appear exactly once unless proven otherwise.

A valid candidate is ""LEANS"" but N is new and allowed.

But ""LEANS"" uses N as new letter, positions:
- L 1st (allowed)
- E 2nd (invalid — E cannot be 2nd)

Try ""LANES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- N new (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""EALAS"" — invalid word.

Try ""EASLE"" — same as EASEL, invalid.

Try ""SALVE"" — V is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""SNALE"" — N new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ELANS"" — same as LANES but E first:
- E 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid — L cannot be 2nd)

Try ""SABLE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ECLAS"" — C new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed)
- C 2nd (new, allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- A 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid)

Try ""CLASE"" — C new:
- C 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCALE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""LACES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- C 3rd (new, allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""LASES"" — S appears twice, unclear if allowed.

Try ""ECLAS"" again — S 5th invalid.

Try ""ALECS"":
- A 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCENA"" — but A is 5th which is allowed, S 1st invalid.

Try ""CLEAN"":
- C new
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""CANES"":
- C new
- A 1st (allowed)
- N 2nd (new)
- E 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
But we need all S,L,A,E — ""CANES"" misses L.

We must include S,L,A,E plus one new letter. Let’s try to construct:

Need one more letter, say D. Word must be permutation of S,L,A,E,D.

Possible: ""DALES"":
- D new
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

""DEALS"":
- D new
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains S,L,A,E,D
- S not 1st or 5th (here 4th) ✔
- L not 2nd or 4th (here 3rd) ✔
- A not 3rd (here 2nd) ✔
- E not 5th or 2nd (here 1st) ✔
- No T or R ✔

""DEALS"" is a valid English word.Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, the secret word must contain S, L, A, and E (each in a different position than previously guessed) and cannot contain T or R. The word must also be five letters, so it needs one additional letter not yet used. A valid candidate is ""DEALS,"" which introduces D and places the known letters in permissible positions.

- S – cannot be 1st, 5th
- L – cannot be 2nd, 4th
- A – cannot be 3rd
- E – cannot be 2nd, 5th

Forbidden letters:
T, R, D

So far the set of letters we know about is S, L, A, E.  That is four letters; the word is five letters, so we need one more distinct letter not yet ruled out.  From the remaining common consonants, the best candidates are N, C, I, O, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters under the remaining positional constraints:

Possible slots:
S: 2, 3, 4
L: 1, 3, 5
A: 1, 2, 4, 5
E: 1, 3, 4

We need to pick a 5th letter.  The most frequent unused consonant is N, so we’ll add N.

Permutations that satisfy all constraints:

Try: N in 5th, A in 2nd, S in 3rd, E in 4th, L in 1st →  L A S E N → “LASEN” – not a valid word.

Try: L in 1st, A in 2nd, N in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th – but S cannot be 5th.

Try: L in 1st, S in 2nd, A in 4th, E in 3rd, N in 5th → L S E A N → “LSEAN” – invalid.

Try: S in 2nd, L in 3rd, A in 4th, E in 1st, N in 5th → E S L A N – “ESLAN” – invalid.

Try: S in 3rd, L in 5th, A in 1st, E in 4th, N in 2nd → A N S E L – “ANSEL” – valid English word.

Check constraints:
S (3) – allowed (not 1st,5th) ✓
L (5) – allowed (not 2nd,4th) ✓
A (1) – allowed (not 3rd) ✓
E (4) – allowed (not 2nd,5th) ✓
N is new, allowed ✓
No T, R, D ✓

Therefore “ANSEL” is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several letters at once.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess (SLATE), we know:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the word:
- contains S, L, A, E.
- does NOT contain T.
- the positions we have so far:
  1: not S
  2: not L
  3: not A
  5: not E

With these constraints, I need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (which cannot be T). Let’s think of a word that moves these known letters into new positions and introduces a common unused letter like R, N, I, O, C, or D.

A strong candidate is ""REALS"":

- R (new letter)
- E (moved from 5th to 2nd, allowed since E is in the word but not 5th)
- A (moved from 3rd to 2nd, allowed since A is in the word but not 3rd)
- L (moved from 2nd to 4th, allowed since L is in the word but not 2nd)
- S (moved from 1st to 5th, allowed since S is in the word but not 1st)

""REALS"" is valid, uses the known letters, and introduces R while avoiding T.

- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE) or 5th (from REALS)
- L cannot be 2nd (from SLATE) or 4th (from REALS)
- A cannot be 3rd (from SLATE) or 3rd (from REALS) — same constraint
- E cannot be 5th (from SLATE) or 2nd (from REALS)

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, A, E plus one more letter (from remaining common letters: C, N, I, O, D, etc.), while respecting all the above.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

A promising candidate is ""LEASE"":
- L in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (but E cannot be 2nd — conflict!)
So ""LEASE"" is invalid.

Next try ""SCALES"" — too long.

Try ""SALES"":
- S 1st (invalid, S cannot be 1st)

Try ""EASEL"":
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- L 5th (allowed)
But we already know E is not 2nd and L is not 4th, but this doesn't violate those — however it uses E twice, which isn't allowed (each letter in feedback is for exact positions).

Actually, we need to ensure we don't reuse letters beyond their occurrence. Since we only know these letters appear at least once, but not how many times, it's safe to assume they appear exactly once unless proven otherwise.

A valid candidate is ""LEANS"" but N is new and allowed.

But ""LEANS"" uses N as new letter, positions:
- L 1st (allowed)
- E 2nd (invalid — E cannot be 2nd)

Try ""LANES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- N new (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""EALAS"" — invalid word.

Try ""EASLE"" — same as EASEL, invalid.

Try ""SALVE"" — V is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""SNALE"" — N new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ELANS"" — same as LANES but E first:
- E 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid — L cannot be 2nd)

Try ""SABLE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""ECLAS"" — C new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed)
- C 2nd (new, allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- A 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid)

Try ""CLASE"" — C new:
- C 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCALE"":
- S 1st (invalid)

Try ""LACES"":
- L 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- C 3rd (new, allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

Try ""LASES"" — S appears twice, unclear if allowed.

Try ""ECLAS"" again — S 5th invalid.

Try ""ALECS"":
- A 1st (allowed)
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""SCENA"" — but A is 5th which is allowed, S 1st invalid.

Try ""CLEAN"":
- C new
- L 2nd (invalid)

Try ""CANES"":
- C new
- A 1st (allowed)
- N 2nd (new)
- E 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
But we need all S,L,A,E — ""CANES"" misses L.

We must include S,L,A,E plus one new letter. Let’s try to construct:

Need one more letter, say D. Word must be permutation of S,L,A,E,D.

Possible: ""DALES"":
- D new
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- E 4th (allowed)
- S 5th (invalid — S cannot be 5th)

""DEALS"":
- D new
- E 1st (allowed)
- A 2nd (allowed)
- L 3rd (allowed)
- S 4th (allowed)
This seems valid:
- Contains S,L,A,E,D
- S not 1st or 5th (here 4th) ✔
- L not 2nd or 4th (here 3rd) ✔
- A not 3rd (here 2nd) ✔
- E not 5th or 2nd (here 1st) ✔
- No T or R ✔

""DEALS"" is a valid English word.Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, the secret word must contain S, L, A, and E (each in a different position than previously guessed) and cannot contain T or R. The word must also be five letters, so it needs one additional letter not yet used. A valid candidate is ""DEALS,"" which introduces D and places the known letters in permissible positions.

Required letters (must appear exactly once each, based on feedback):
- S – cannot be 1st, 5th
- L – cannot be 2nd, 4th
- A – cannot be 3rd
- E – cannot be 2nd, 5th

Forbidden letters:
T, R, D

So far the set of letters we know about is S, L, A, E.  That is four letters; the word is five letters, so we need one more distinct letter not yet ruled out.  From the remaining common consonants, the best candidates are N, C, I, O, etc.

Let’s try to place the four known letters under the remaining positional constraints:

Possible slots:
S: 2, 3, 4
L: 1, 3, 5
A: 1, 2, 4, 5
E: 1, 3, 4

We need to pick a 5th letter.  The most frequent unused consonant is N, so we’ll add N.

Permutations that satisfy all constraints:

Try: N in 5th, A in 2nd, S in 3rd, E in 4th, L in 1st →  L A S E N → “LASEN” – not a valid word.

Try: L in 1st, A in 2nd, N in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th – but S cannot be 5th.

Try: L in 1st, S in 2nd, A in 4th, E in 3rd, N in 5th → L S E A N → “LSEAN” – invalid.

Try: S in 2nd, L in 3rd, A in 4th, E in 1st, N in 5th → E S L A N – “ESLAN” – invalid.

Try: S in 3rd, L in 5th, A in 1st, E in 4th, N in 2nd → A N S E L – “ANSEL” – valid English word.

Check constraints:
S (3) – allowed (not 1st,5th) ✓
L (5) – allowed (not 2nd,4th) ✓
A (1) – allowed (not 3rd) ✓
E (4) – allowed (not 2nd,5th) ✓
N is new, allowed ✓
No T, R, D ✓

Therefore “ANSEL” is a valid next guess.

- N is NOT in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- E is in the word and in position 4 (✓)
- L is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

Thus we now know the exact positions for three letters:

  _ _ S E L

We still need a 1st and 2nd letter.  
We also know the remaining letters must be chosen from the pool that excludes T, R, D, N.

From earlier steps, the word must contain A (but not in position 1), and S, L, E are already placed. Therefore A must appear exactly once and must be in position 1 or 2.  But it cannot be in position 1 (feedback), so A must be in position 2.

So far:

  _ A S E L

The only missing letter is the 1st.  It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (cannot be T, R, D, N).  Common remaining consonants: C, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need a valid English word of the form ? A S E L.

Quick scan:

BASEL – valid word (also a city)
CASEL – not a word
FASEL – not a word
GASEL – not common
HASEL – not a word
KASEL – not a word
MASEL – not standard
PASEL – not a word
VASEL – not a word
WASEL – not a word
YASEL – not a word

The only dictionary 5-letter word fitting _ A S E L is “B A S E L”.
