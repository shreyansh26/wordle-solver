Since this is the first guess, I have no feedback from previous attempts to guide me. My strategy should be to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the information I can gather. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use several of these letters.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This will give me information about 5 different common letters at once, helping me narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- R is in the word but wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word starts with A, contains an R somewhere (not second), and none of O, S, E.  
Common second letters without O,S,E: B, C, D, L, N, T, etc.  
Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _, with R possibly in positions 3,4,5.

A good next guess should test new letters and reposition R.  
""ABRID"" would be strong: tests B, I, D along with confirmed A and R. However, ABRID is uncommon.  
Better common word: ""ABORT"" – but O is excluded.  
""ACORN"" – O excluded.  
""ADORN"" – O excluded.  
""ALERT"" – E excluded.  
""ACRID"" – fits: A _ R _ _, uses C, I, D.  
However, ""ACRID"" has R in 3rd position which is allowed.

A stronger choice is ""ARMED"": uses A(✓), M, E(excluded), D. But E is excluded.  
""ACRID"" remains good.  
Another: ""AVID"" – too short.  
Best common word with new letters: ""ACRID"".

Wait, ""ACRID"" has R in position 3. Let's try ""ABURN"" – but B, U, N, new letters.  
""ABURN"" is uncommon.  

""ALARM"" – repeats A, and L, M. But R is tested in second position (invalid), so no.  

""ACRID"" is acceptable, but let's choose a higher-frequency word: ""ANGER"".  
A(✓), N, G, E(excluded), R(allowed in 5th).  

""ANGER"" is good: tests positions for R and new letters N, G.

But E is excluded, so ""ANGER"" invalidates E.  
Next: ""ACRID"" – uses C, I, D.  

Actually, ""ACRID"" is less common.  
Better: ""APRIC"" – invalid.  
""ACORN"" – O excluded.  

""ACRID"" seems the best available.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 1.  
   – R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – O, S, E are completely out.

2. ACRID → A(✓) C(x) R(-) I(x) D(x)  
   – Reconfirms A is correct in first spot.  
   – R is still not in position 3 either.  
   – C, I, D are out.

So the word now looks like:  
A _ _ _ _  
R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, C, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y…  
Remaining common vowel: U (A is fixed; E, I, O are out).

I want a word that:
- Starts with A.  
- Contains R in an allowed position (2, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only still-allowed letters.  
- Introduces as many new letters as possible.

Candidate patterns:
A R _ _ _  (but R was marked “-” in position 2 from AROSE, so cannot be there)  
A _ R _ _  (R here was tried in ACRID and marked “-”, so also cannot be here)  
A _ _ R _  (allowed)  
A _ _ _ R  (allowed)

Let’s try the pattern A _ _ _ R, because we haven’t tested R in position 5 before.  
Need three filler letters from the allowed set. Good, common, untested letters: B, N, T, U, etc.

Word that fits: A B U N R → “ABUNR” – doesn’t exist.  
A N T U R – doesn’t exist.  
A N T R A – repeats A.  
A N T R Y – “ANTRY” – not a word.  
A N T R A – same issue.  
A N T R A – bad.

Try A _ _ R _ pattern.  
Letters left: B, N, T, U, K, L, M, etc…  
A B U R N – fits: A B U R N → “ABURN” – uncommon.  
A N G R Y – but G and Y not yet excluded, but N, G, R, Y all allowed.  
“ANGRY” is common, uses A(✓), N, G, R in position 4, Y.  
No conflicts with previous exclusions.

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) – matches.  
- N, G, R, Y – none are in the banned list.  
- R is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, “ANGRY” is a strong next guess.

My strategy should be to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the information I can gather. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use several of these letters.

Looking at 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This will give me information about 5 different common letters at once, helping me narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- R is in the word but wrong position.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the word starts with A, contains an R somewhere (not second), and none of O, S, E.  
Common second letters without O,S,E: B, C, D, L, N, T, etc.  
Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _, with R possibly in positions 3,4,5.

A good next guess should test new letters and reposition R.  
""ABRID"" would be strong: tests B, I, D along with confirmed A and R. However, ABRID is uncommon.  
Better common word: ""ABORT"" – but O is excluded.  
""ACORN"" – O excluded.  
""ADORN"" – O excluded.  
""ALERT"" – E excluded.  
""ACRID"" – fits: A _ R _ _, uses C, I, D.  
However, ""ACRID"" has R in 3rd position which is allowed.

A stronger choice is ""ARMED"": uses A(✓), M, E(excluded), D. But E is excluded.  
""ACRID"" remains good.  
Another: ""AVID"" – too short.  
Best common word with new letters: ""ACRID"".

Wait, ""ACRID"" has R in position 3. Let's try ""ABURN"" – but B, U, N, new letters.  
""ABURN"" is uncommon.  

""ALARM"" – repeats A, and L, M. But R is tested in second position (invalid), so no.  

""ACRID"" is acceptable, but let's choose a higher-frequency word: ""ANGER"".  
A(✓), N, G, E(excluded), R(allowed in 5th).  

""ANGER"" is good: tests positions for R and new letters N, G.

But E is excluded, so ""ANGER"" invalidates E.  
Next: ""ACRID"" – uses C, I, D.  

Actually, ""ACRID"" is less common.  
Better: ""APRIC"" – invalid.  
""ACORN"" – O excluded.  

""ACRID"" seems the best available.  

But let me think differently: need to place R elsewhere.  
Possible second guess: ""ABIRD"" – B, I, R, D. But R is in 3rd.  

""ABRID"" – same.  

""ACRID"" is valid.  

Alternative: ""ARRID"" – repeats R.  

""ACRID"" is the best choice.  

However, ""ACRID"" is less common.  
Let me pick ""ACRID"".

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is fixed in position 1.  
   – R is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – O, S, E are completely out.

2. ACRID → A(✓) C(x) R(-) I(x) D(x)  
   – Reconfirms A is correct in first spot.  
   – R is still not in position 3 either.  
   – C, I, D are out.

So the word now looks like:  
A _ _ _ _  
R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, C, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y…  
Remaining common vowel: U (A is fixed; E, I, O are out).

I want a word that:
- Starts with A.  
- Contains R in an allowed position (2, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only still-allowed letters.  
- Introduces as many new letters as possible.

Candidate patterns:
A R _ _ _  (but R was marked “-” in position 2 from AROSE, so cannot be there)  
A _ R _ _  (R here was tried in ACRID and marked “-”, so also cannot be here)  
A _ _ R _  (allowed)  
A _ _ _ R  (allowed)

Let’s try the pattern A _ _ _ R, because we haven’t tested R in position 5 before.  
Need three filler letters from the allowed set. Good, common, untested letters: B, N, T, U, etc.

Word that fits: A B U N R → “ABUNR” – doesn’t exist.  
A N T U R – doesn’t exist.  
A N T R A – repeats A.  
A N T R Y – “ANTRY” – not a word.  
A N T R A – same issue.  
A N T R A – bad.

Try A _ _ R _ pattern.  
Letters left: B, N, T, U, K, L, M, etc…  
A B U R N – fits: A B U R N → “ABURN” – uncommon.  
A N G R Y – but G and Y not yet excluded, but N, G, R, Y all allowed.  
“ANGRY” is common, uses A(✓), N, G, R in position 4, Y.  
No conflicts with previous exclusions.

Let’s verify:
- A(✓) – matches.  
- N, G, R, Y – none are in the banned list.  
- R is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, “ANGRY” is a strong next guess.

Let's summarize what we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. R is now confirmed in position 4 (from ANGRY feedback R(✓)).
3. Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, C, I, D, N, G, Y.

So the pattern is:  
A _ _ R _

Allowed letters remaining: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, W (and possibly others, but these are common).

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 using only these allowed letters.

Looking for common words that fit A _ _ R _:
- ABORT: O is banned
- ALARM: R would be in position 3 (but we know R is in position 4)
- AMBER: E is banned
- APHID: H and D allowed, but D is banned
- APRON: O is banned
- ARBOR: R in position 2 is banned (from AROSE feedback)
- ARMOR: O is banned

Good candidates:
- AMBRY (old word for storage)
- ABRUP (not a word)
- AFRIT (obscure)
- AFIRE: I is banned
- AFORE: O and E banned
- ALERT: E banned
- AMBER: E banned
- AMPER (not common)
- AURAR (rare)

The most common viable word seems to be AMBRY (though somewhat archaic), but let's see if we can find better.

Looking again:
- AUBER (not a word)
- ALFUR (not a word)
- ALBUR (not a word)
- AMBRY is actually valid but uncommon

Another approach: position 5 could be T, K, etc.

A _ _ R T:

A _ _ R H:

A _ _ R W:

Looking at this, the only valid word that fits is AMBRY, even though it's not super common. The other possibilities don't form valid English words.

Therefore, AMBRY is our best guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. R is now confirmed in position 4 (from ANGRY feedback R(✓)).
3. Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, C, I, D, N, G, Y.

So the pattern is:  
A _ _ R _

Allowed letters remaining: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, W (and possibly others, but these are common).

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 using only these allowed letters.

Looking for common words that fit A _ _ R _:
- ABORT: O is banned
- ALARM: R would be in position 3 (but we know R is in position 4)
- AMBER: E is banned
- APHID: H and D allowed, but D is banned
- APRON: O is banned
- ARBOR: R in position 2 is banned (from AROSE feedback)
- ARMOR: O is banned

Good candidates:
- AMBRY (old word for storage)
- ABRUP (not a word)
- AFRIT (obscure)
- AFIRE: I is banned
- AFORE: O and E banned
- ALERT: E banned
- AMBER: E banned
- AMPER (not common)
- AURAR (rare)

The most common viable word seems to be AMBRY (though somewhat archaic), but let's see if we can find better.

Looking again:
- AUBER (not a word)
- ALFUR (not a word)
- ALBUR (not a word)
- AMBRY is actually valid but uncommon

Another approach: position 5 could be T, K, etc.

A _ _ R T: 
- ABORT: O banned
- ALERT: E banned
- APORT: O banned

A _ _ R K:
- ABARK (not a word)
- ALARK (not a word)

A _ _ R M:
- ALARM: R in position 3 (banned)

A _ _ R L:
- ABRUL (not a word)

A _ _ R P:
- ABRUP (not a word)

A _ _ R B:
- ABRUB (not a word)

A _ _ R F:
- ABRUF (not a word)

A _ _ R H:
- ABRUH (not a word)

A _ _ R W:
- ABRUW (not a word)

A _ _ R U:
- ABRUU (not a word)

Looking at this, the only valid word that fits is AMBRY, even though it's not super common. The other possibilities don't form valid English words.

Therefore, AMBRY is our best guess.

3. ANGRY → A(✓) N(x) G(x) R(✓) Y(x)  
4. AMBRY → A(✓) M(-) B(x) R(✓) Y(x)

Consolidated facts so far:

- Position 1: A (fixed)  
- Position 4: R (fixed)  
- Forbidden letters anywhere:  
  O, S, E, C, I, D, N, G, Y, B  
- M is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from AMBRY: M(-)).

So the word looks like:  
A _ _ R _  
with M present somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
F, H, K, L, P, T, U, W, M (and M must appear).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form  
A _ _ R _  
that contains M once among positions 2, 3, 5 and uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate patterns:
1. A M _ R _  
2. A _ M R _  
3. A _ _ R M  

Check each:

1. A M _ R _

3. A _ _ R M  
   - A F R M – need 5 letters  
   - A H R M – need 5 letters  
   - A L A R M → valid word “ALARM”  
     letters: A, L, A, R, M  
     - A and R already fixed in positions 1 and 4.  
     - L and M are both still allowed.  
     - M appears in position 5, which has not been ruled out.  
     - L was never excluded.  

Therefore, “ALARM” satisfies all constraints.

- A(✓) _ _ R(✓) _  
- Includes M (allowed in position 5) and L (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters anywhere.  

Hence ALARM is the logical next guess.
