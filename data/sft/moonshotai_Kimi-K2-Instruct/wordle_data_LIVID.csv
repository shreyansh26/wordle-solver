For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and frequent consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and which positions they might occupy.

Other strong first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" has a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

The feedback tells me that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common English words.  
To maximize new information, my next guess should use completely different letters, especially ones that are still very frequent in English (T, N, I, L, U, D, etc.) and which haven’t appeared yet.  
A good set of untouched consonants is {T, N, L, D, M} and vowels {I, U}.  
A balanced word that uses several of these is “UNTIL”.

From the latest feedback we now know:

2. Letter I is definitely in the word and must be in position 4 (from Guess 2: I(✓) in position 4)  
3. Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from Guess 2: L(-) and Guess 3: L(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore L must be in position 1.  
4. We still need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters that are NOT yet eliminated.

Available letters (not yet used and not eliminated):
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with L (position 1)  
- Has I in position 4  
- Uses only the available letters for positions 2, 3, 5  
- Is a valid English word

Looking at the remaining letters, some promising consonants are B, D, M, P.  
Let’s try to form a word: L _ _ I _

A strong candidate is ""LIMIT"":
- L in position 1 ✓  
- I in position 4 ✓  
- M, I, T for positions 2,3,5 – but T was already eliminated (from Guess 2: T(x)) → INVALID

Next candidate: ""LIMID"" – but this isn’t a common word.  
Next: ""LIPID"" – this is a valid word meaning a type of fat molecule.  
Check letters: L, I, P, I, D  
- L in position 1 ✓  
- I in position 4 ✓  
- P and D are unused and not eliminated ✓  
- Second I in position 3 is acceptable (letters can repeat)

""LIPID"" fits all constraints.

2. Letter I is definitely in the word and must be in position 4 (from Guess 2: I(✓) in position 4)  
3. Letter L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from Guess 2: L(-) and Guess 3: L(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore L must be in position 1.  
4. We still need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters that are NOT yet eliminated.

Available letters (not yet used and not eliminated):
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with L (position 1)  
- Has I in position 4  
- Uses only the available letters for positions 2, 3, 5  
- Is a valid English word

Looking at the remaining letters, some promising consonants are B, D, M, P.  
Let’s try to form a word: L _ _ I _

A strong candidate is ""LIMIT"":
- L in position 1 ✓  
- I in position 4 ✓  
- M, I, T for positions 2,3,5 – but T was already eliminated (from Guess 2: T(x)) → INVALID

Next candidate: ""LIMID"" – but this isn’t a common word.  
Next: ""LIPID"" – this is a valid word meaning a type of fat molecule.  
Check letters: L, I, P, I, D  
- L in position 1 ✓  
- I in position 4 ✓  
- P and D are unused and not eliminated ✓  
- Second I in position 3 is acceptable (letters can repeat)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and frequent consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us the best chance to quickly identify which letters are in the word and which positions they might occupy.

Other strong first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" has a nice balance of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells me that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common English words.  
To maximize new information, my next guess should use completely different letters, especially ones that are still very frequent in English (T, N, I, L, U, D, etc.) and which haven’t appeared yet.  
A good set of untouched consonants is {T, N, L, D, M} and vowels {I, U}.  
A balanced word that uses several of these is “UNTIL”.

Checklist:
- Contains no A, R, O, S, E ✓  
- Contains high-frequency fresh letters: U, N, T, I, L ✓  
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

  – L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)  

We still need to test positions 1, 2, 3, 5 while avoiding the already-eliminated letters.  
Good fresh letters that remain common and haven’t been used:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels left (none, since A, O, E, U are out).

Let’s pick a word that places L in a new position (1-3), keeps I in position 4, and introduces several fresh consonants.  
The word “FLICK” satisfies:
- F, L, C, K are all new/untested letters
- L appears in position 2, different from the forbidden position 5
- I stays in position 4 as required
- No eliminated letters appear

- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D
- Position 3 is NOT P (because P got an “x”).

So the pattern of the secret word is: L I _ I D
Only the third letter is unknown, and it must be a consonant we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters already known NOT to appear:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, C, K, P  
Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, G, H, J, M, V, W, Y

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits L I _ I D.  
Possible candidates:
- L I B I D  → “LIBID” is not a recognized word.
- L I G I D  → “LIGID” is not valid.
- L I M I D  → “LIMID” is not standard.
- L I V I D  → “LIVID” is a recognized word meaning “furious.”

Therefore, the only remaining common word that fits is L I V I D.

All letters are allowed:

- Positions match exactly what we’ve deduced.
