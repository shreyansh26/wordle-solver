Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback to guide us, the best approach is to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because:
- It contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E
- It has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly

A good next guess that uses common letters is ""SHAPE"". This uses H and P, which are common and will provide good info about the remaining letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- These letters can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly

So the confirmed pattern so far is:

We need a 5-letter English word that fits S _ A _ E and does NOT contain L or T.

Possible candidates (looking at common words):
- SPACE – contains P, C, but C is okay
- SHADE – contains H, D
- SHARE – contains H, R
- SHAPE – contains H, P
- STAGE – contains T, but T is already excluded
- SCAPE – contains C, P
- SALVE – contains L, but L is excluded

- SARGE – contains R, G
- SAUCE – contains U, C

Looking at these, words like SHAPE, SHARE, SHADE, SAPE (not valid), SCAPE, etc. fit the pattern and don't contain L or T.

A good next guess that uses common letters is ""SHAPE"". This uses H and P, which are common and will provide good info about the remaining letters.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. \n\nThe word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because:\n- It contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E\n- It has a good mix of vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)\n- These letters can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now know:\n- S is in the 1st position (✓)\n- L is not in the word at all (x)\n- A is in the 3rd position (✓)\n- T is not in the word at all (x)\n- E is in the 5th position (✓)\n\nSo the confirmed pattern so far is:\nS _ A _ E\n\nWe need a 5-letter English word that fits S _ A _ E and does NOT contain L or T.\n\nPossible candidates (looking at common words):\n- SPACE – contains P, C, but C is okay\n- SHADE – contains H, D\n- SHARE – contains H, R\n- SHAPE – contains H, P\n- STAGE – contains T, but T is already excluded\n- SCAPE – contains C, P\n- SALVE – contains L, but L is excluded\n- SABLE – contains L, excluded\n- SARGE – contains R, G\n- SAUCE – contains U, C\n\nLooking at these, words like SHAPE, SHARE, SHADE, SAPE (not valid), SCAPE, etc. fit the pattern and don\'t contain L or T.\n\nA good next guess that uses common letters is ""SHAPE"".

We now know the pattern is S H A _ E and the fourth slot cannot be L, T, P, R, K, or D.

Still-allowed consonants for slot 4 include M, V, N, B, G, C, F, etc.

Common English 5-letter words that fit SHA_E:

- SHAME – M is still allowed
- SHAVE – V is still allowed
- SHANE – N is still allowed
- SHAZE – Z is allowed but uncommon
