For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. The best approach is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. 

Some good first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
1. C - a common consonant
2. R - a common consonant
3. A - the most common vowel
4. N - a common consonant
5. E - the most common vowel

- C is in the correct position (first letter).
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that keeps C in position 1, puts E in position 2, and moves R to position 3 or 4. A good candidate is “CREEP”:
- C in position 1 (correct).
- E in position 2 (possible).
- E in position 3 (could be, but we don’t know if E is repeated).
- P is a new letter to test.
- P is a new letter to test.

But ""CREEP"" has E twice, and we don’t know if E is repeated. Instead, let’s try “CREST”:
- C in position 1 (correct).
- E in position 2 (possible).
- R in position 3 (possible).
- S and T are new letters to test.

Let’s consolidate the full set of constraints now.

From all guesses:

1. CRANE → C✓ at 1, R is in word but not in 2, A∉, N∉, E is in word but not in 5.
2. CREST → C✓1, R is in word but not in 2, E✓3, S∉, T∉.
3. CIDER → C✓1, I∉, D∉, E is in word but not in 4, R is in word but not in 5.

Summary:
- Word pattern: C _ E _ _
- R must appear once, and its only legal positions are 4 (since 2, 3, 5 have been ruled out).
- Therefore R is at 4.
- E is already locked at 3.
- Letters tried and eliminated: A, N, S, T, I, D.  
  Remaining candidate consonants for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.
- The most common among those for 2 and 5 are H, K, L, M, P.

We need two distinct consonants.  
Let’s try:
- Position 2: H (common middle consonant)
- Position 5: K (common end consonant)

Word: C H E R K → “CHERK” is invalid (not a recognized English word).

Next: Position 2: O (vowel we haven’t tried) → C O E R _  
No standard 5-letter word spells COER_.

Next: Position 2: L → C L E R _ → “CLERK” is valid and fits every constraint:
- C✓1, L new, E✓3, R at 4✓, K new.
- No disallowed letters.

Let’s propose CLERK.
