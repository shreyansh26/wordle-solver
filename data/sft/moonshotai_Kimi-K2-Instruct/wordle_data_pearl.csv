For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize the information I can gather. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters. The word ""SLATE"" is often considered an excellent starting choice because it includes the most common letters in English words: S, L, A, T, E. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So far we know:
1. The word contains L and E, but they are not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
2. The 3rd letter is definitely A (position 3 is fixed).
3. The letters S and T are not in the word at all.

I need a new guess that:
- Places A in the 3rd position
- Uses L and E in other positions (but not 2 and 5 for L and 5 for E respectively)
- Avoids S and T
- Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""CLEAR"":
- C is a common consonant not yet tested
- L appears in position 2 (but feedback says L is not in position 2, so this violates the constraint)
Oops, that won't work.

Another candidate: ""PEARL"":
- P is a new consonant
- E appears in position 1 (allowed since E is just not in position 5)
- A is correct in position 3
- R is a new consonant
- L appears in position 5 (feedback said L is not in position 2, so position 5 is allowed)

Let me use PEARL.
