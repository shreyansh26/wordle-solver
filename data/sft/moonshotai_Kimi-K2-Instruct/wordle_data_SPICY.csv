For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" or ""RAISE."" 

Looking at the options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels.
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E - includes three vowels and common consonants.
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E - strong consonants and vowels.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help identify or eliminate many letters efficiently.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- I is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ _
- Word contains S (not in 4th slot).
- Word does not contain R, A, or E.

With A and E eliminated, the remaining common vowels are O and U.

Consonants left to test: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z but let’s focus on the most frequent ones first.

We want a word that:
1. Has I in position 3.
2. Contains S but not in position 4.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow things down.

Candidate list:
- FOIST – F, O, I, S, T.  S is in position 4 → that’s the excluded spot (bad).
- BUILT – B, U, I, L, T.  Doesn’t contain S (bad).
- HOIST – H, O, I, S, T.  S is in position 4 (bad).
- STICK – S, T, I, C, K.  S is in position 1 (allowed), I in 3, good letters.
- STINT – S, T, I, N, T.  S in 1, I in 3, but repeats T twice; still legal.
- STILL – S, T, I, L, L.  S in 1, I in 3, L repeats; legal.

Among these, STICK is appealing because C and K are common consonants we haven’t tested yet, and it satisfies all constraints.

Let’s choose STICK.
