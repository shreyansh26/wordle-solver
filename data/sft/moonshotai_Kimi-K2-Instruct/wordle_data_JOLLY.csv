For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLICE"" are popular first guesses because they contain frequently used letters in English.

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most common in English words

This will give us maximum feedback about which vowels and consonants are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the secret word  
- R(x) – R is NOT in the secret word  
- O(-) – O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3  
- S(x) – S is NOT in the secret word  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the secret word  

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O somewhere other than position 3.  
- It does NOT contain A, R, S, or E at all.  

Goal for the second guess:
- Reuse the confirmed letter O in a new position.  
- Introduce other common letters that have not been ruled out.  
- A useful consonant cluster plus an alternative vowel.

Good candidate: “POINT”

From the two pieces of feedback:

POINT: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)

Current known facts:
- Secret word is _ O _ _ _
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T
- Still-available common consonants: B C D F G H K L M V W Y (and any others not listed)
- Still-available vowels: U (since O is already fixed, and A, E, I are out; Y could act as vowel too)

We need a word that:

2. Uses only letters **not yet eliminated**.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize information.

2. Forbidden letters so far (x marked)  
   - A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D  

3. Remaining candidates for the three open slots:  
   - Slot 1: any consonant not yet ruled out (B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z …)  
   - Slot 3: any consonant not yet ruled out (same list)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLICE"" are popular first guesses because they contain frequently used letters in English.

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most common in English words

This will give us maximum feedback about which vowels and consonants are in the word and their possible positions.

- A(x) – A is NOT in the secret word

- O(-) – O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3  
- S(x) – S is NOT in the secret word  
- E(x) – E is NOT in the secret word  

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O somewhere other than position 3.  
- It does NOT contain A, R, S, or E at all.  

Goal for the second guess:
- Reuse the confirmed letter O in a new position.  
- Introduce other common letters that have not been ruled out.  
- A useful consonant cluster plus an alternative vowel.

Good candidate: “POINT”
- P, I, N, T have not been ruled out.  
- O is placed in position 2 (different from position 3).

- COULD
- DOUGH
- FOCAL (but L is okay, C okay)
- HOUND
- MOMMY (but M twice might be wasteful)
- VOUCH
- WOULD
- YOUTH

Among these, “COULD” uses C, U, L, D – none of which have been ruled out – and keeps the O in position 2. It is also a frequent word, so it’s a strong next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of known facts after three guesses:

1. Positional knowledge  
   - Letter 2 is O (from POINT and COULD both showing O✓ in position 2).  
   - Letter 4 is L (from COULD showing L✓ in position 4).  

2. Forbidden letters so far (x marked)  
   - A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D  

3. Remaining candidates for the three open slots:  
   - Slot 1: any consonant not yet ruled out (B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z …)  
   - Slot 3: any consonant not yet ruled out (same list)  
   - Slot 5: any consonant not yet ruled out (same list)  

We need a word of the form:  
   _ O _ L _  

Legitimate English words fitting that pattern (and avoiding all forbidden letters) include:  
   BOGLY, BOILS (but I is banned), BOLLY, BOWLY, FOAMY (A banned), FOGEY (E banned), FOGLY, FOLEY (E banned), FOLLY (Y allowed), GOODY (D banned), GOLLY, HOLLY, JOLLY, MOLLY, MOLDY (D banned), MOLLY, POLLY (P banned), WOLLY, WOOLY, etc.

Among these, the most common everyday word (using only available letters) is “FOLLY”.

- F is not banned.  
- O is fixed in position 2.  
- L is fixed in position 4.  
- Second L and Y are both still allowed.  

Therefore “FOLLY” is the logical next guess.

Positional certainties:

- Position 3: L ✓

Forbidden letters so far (x marked):
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, F

Therefore the pattern is:
_ O L L Y

The only missing slot is the first letter.  
Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, G, H, K, M, V, W, Z (and a few others).

Common English words of the form B/G/H/K/M/V/W/Z + OLLY:
- BOLLY (not a standard dictionary word)
- GOLLY – valid
- HOLLY – valid
- MOLLY – valid
- WOLLY – rare

Among these, “HOLLY” and “MOLLY” are the most common; “GOLLY” is also well-known.  
We can try any of them; I’ll pick “HOLLY”.

- Position 4: L ✓  
- Position 5: Y ✓  

So the secret word is of the form _ O L L Y.

Letters ruled out in position 1 so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, D, F, H.

Still-available first letters (standard English alphabet minus the above): B, G, K, M, V, W, Z.

The only common English word that fits this restriction is:

(GOLLY, BOLLY, KOLLY, VOLLY, WOLLY, ZOLLY either don’t exist or are extremely rare).  
Therefore the unique remaining candidate is “MOLLY”.
