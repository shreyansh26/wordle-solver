Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. A good strategy is to use a word with several vowels and common consonants. 

Some optimal starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of the alphabet.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word, but NOT in the first position (it’s marked “-” instead of “✓”)
- R is in the word, but NOT in the second position
- I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

Therefore:
- The known letters present in the secret word are A and R, but their positions are still unknown (except they can’t be positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- We can safely exclude any word that contains I, S, or E.
- We still need three more letters that haven’t been tried yet.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Places A and R in new positions.
2. Introduces several new consonants/vowels that haven’t appeared yet.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already known to be in, and I, E are ruled out).

Let’s try a word like “TRAIN” – but “TRAIN” has I, which is ruled out.
Try “TRAIN” → has I (invalid because I is out).

Next try “TRUNK” – T, R, U, N, K. This uses R in a new position (2nd), introduces T, U, N, K. A is not included, but that’s fine since we can test A in a later guess. Actually, we need to include A to test its position.

Better try “CRANE” – but this has E (invalid).

“TRAMP” – no A.

“GRANT” – has R, A, N, T, G. R is in position 2 (new), A in position 3 (new), T, N, G are fresh.

Current knowledge:
- Letters known to be in the word: A and R.

- Positions already ruled out for R: position 2 (from ARISE) and position 2 (from GRANT) → so R cannot be in position 2.

1. Contains both A and R.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1 or 3.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Uses none of the eliminated letters (I, S, E, G, N, T).

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but must differ from A’s position).

Let me brainstorm some candidate words:
- A and R must both appear, so we need three more letters from the allowed set (excluding I,S,E,G,N,T).
- Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Allowed vowels: A (already used), O, U, Y (sometimes vowel)

Try “CORAL” – but has L, O, C. However, C is allowed. But we already have two known letters (A and R) so this might not be optimal. Actually, we know A and R are present, so we should focus on finding their correct positions and filling the remaining three slots with new letters.

Better to fix A and R in new positions and fill the rest with fresh letters. Let’s try:
- A in position 2, R in position 4: _ A _ R _
  Fill with allowed letters: B, O, D → “BOARD” – but has O, A, R, D, B. All allowed (none of I,S,E,G,N,T). This seems good. “BOARD” uses A in position 2 (new), R in position 4 (new), and introduces B, O, D.

Check:

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, L, M, P, U, O, Y, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1 or 3.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Uses none of the eliminated letters (I, S, E, G, N, T).

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but must differ from A’s position).

Let me brainstorm some candidate words:
- A and R must both appear, so we need three more letters from the allowed set (excluding I,S,E,G,N,T).
- Allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Allowed vowels: A (already used), O, U, Y (sometimes vowel)

Try “CORAL” – but has L, O, C. However, C is allowed. But we already have two known letters (A and R) so this might not be optimal. Actually, we know A and R are present, so we should focus on finding their correct positions and filling the remaining three slots with new letters.

Better to fix A and R in new positions and fill the rest with fresh letters. Let’s try:
- A in position 2, R in position 4: _ A _ R _
  Fill with allowed letters: B, O, D → “BOARD” – but has O, A, R, D, B. All allowed (none of I,S,E,G,N,T). This seems good. “BOARD” uses A in position 2 (new), R in position 4 (new), and introduces B, O, D.

Check:
- B: new
- O: new
- A: allowed (position 2)
- R: allowed (position 4)
- D: new

This should give us maximal information.

What we now know after three guesses:

1. Letters **confirmed in the word**:
   - A (but not at positions 1, 3, 4)
   - R (but not at positions 2, 4)

2. Letters **confirmed NOT in the word**:
   I, S, E, G, N, T, B, O, D

So A can only be in position 2 or 5.  
R can only be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but must differ from A’s final spot).

Allowed letters still unused: C, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Places A in position 2 or 5
- Places R in any remaining valid position (1, 3, or 5, avoiding A’s spot)
- Uses only letters from the still-allowed set above

Let us try A in position 2 first, because that gives R three possible positions (1, 3, 5).

Candidate layout: _ A _ _ _

We need to place R in 1, 3, or 5, and fill the remaining two slots with allowed letters.

1. R A _ _ _  
   Need three more letters (positions 3, 4, 5).  
   Allowed: C, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Good candidate: R A M P _ … but that’s only 4 letters.  
   Actually, we need 3 more letters: positions 3, 4, 5.  
   Example: R A C K _ → “RACKY” – but Y could be a stretch.  
   Let’s pick common letters: C, H, M → “RACHM” – not a real word.  
   “RANCH” – but N is excluded.  
   “RAC” + something else: “RAC” + “H” + “Y” → not standard.

2. _ A R _ _  
   A in 2, R in 3. Remaining positions 1, 4, 5 need allowed letters.  
   Example: C A R P L – but L is allowed. “CARPL” – not a real word.  
   “M A R C H” – but H is allowed. “MARCH” – H is allowed, M, A, R, C, H.  
   Check letters: M, A, R, C, H – none of them are in the excluded list.

This looks valid:
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- M, C, H not yet excluded
- Word exists: MARCH

So MARCH is a strong next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Some optimal starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

- A is in the word, but NOT in the first position (it’s marked “-” instead of “✓”)
- R is in the word, but NOT in the second position
- I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

Therefore:
- The known letters present in the secret word are A and R, but their positions are still unknown (except they can’t be positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- We can safely exclude any word that contains I, S, or E.
- We still need three more letters that haven’t been tried yet.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Places A and R in new positions.
2. Introduces several new consonants/vowels that haven’t appeared yet.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already known to be in, and I, E are ruled out).

Let’s try a word like “TRAIN” – but “TRAIN” has I, which is ruled out.
Try “TRAIN” → has I (invalid because I is out).

Next try “TRUNK” – T, R, U, N, K. This uses R in a new position (2nd), introduces T, U, N, K. A is not included, but that’s fine since we can test A in a later guess. Actually, we need to include A to test its position.

Better try “CRANE” – but this has E (invalid).

“TRAMP” – no A.

Latest feedback (MARCH):
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in position 2 (correct).
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 3.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- H(✓) – H is in position 5 (correct).

So far we know:
- Positions 2 and 5 are locked: _ A _ _ H
- Letters known in the word: A (position 2), R (somewhere else), H (position 5)
- Eliminated letters now include: I, S, E, G, N, T, B, O, D, M, C
- Therefore the only positions left to fill are 1 and 4, and the only letters we can use are those not yet eliminated and that haven’t been used.

Allowed letters still unused: F, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y (and others, but these are common).

We need a word of the form: ? A ? R H  or  ? A R ? H  (since R must be in the word but not in position 3, and positions 2 and 5 are fixed).

Case 1: R in position 4 → _ A _ R H  
We need a valid letter for position 1 and 3, but position 3 must be filled.  
Valid pattern: _ A _ R H  
Position 1 and 3 must be from the allowed letters.  
A simple scan for common 5-letter words ending in “ARH” or similar is unlikely—let’s list possibilities.

Case 2: R in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is excluded for R (feedback shows R(-) in position 3), so R must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is allowed.

Wait, position 3 is excluded for R. So R must be in position 1 or 4.

Subcase A: R in position 1 → R A _ _ H  
We need a valid letter for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed letters.  
Possible word: R A K E H – but E is out.  
R A K ? H → R A K _ H. We need a letter for position 4.  
R A K L H – not a word.  
R A P E H – E out.  
R A F L H – not a word.

Subcase B: R in position 4 → _ A _ R H  
Now we need a letter for positions 1 and 3.  
Looking for common 5-letter words:  
F A K R H – not valid.  
L A K R H – not valid.  
P A K R H – not valid.  
Actually, let’s think of real words only.  
A quick check: “FAIRH” – not a word.  
“PA RLH” – nothing.  
The only common word that comes to mind is “FARAH” but that’s a name and has A twice.  
Wait, let’s list all possible combinations with allowed letters:

Let’s list allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: F, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a real word matching: [F/K/L/P/U/V/W/Y] A [F/K/L/P/U/V/W/Y] R H  
This is restrictive.  

Scanning common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ R H with R in position 4 and A in 2 and H in 5:

- F A K R H – no.  
- P A K R H – no.  
- L A K R H – no.  

I realize this pattern is rare. Let me check my assumption: is there any standard word _ A _ R H?  
Common words ending in “ARH” are not frequent.  

Alternative: R in position 1 → R A _ _ H  
We need a real word of the form R A _ _ H.  
Possible: R A D A H – but D is excluded.  
R A C E H – C, E excluded.  
R A M E H – M, E excluded.  
R A F L H – not a word.  

This suggests a mistake in my earlier step: I may have missed that Y is allowed. Let me include Y.

Try “L A R Y H” – no.  
Actually, the only remaining pattern is R A _ _ H. Let me check my list again.  

Wait, there is a word: RALPH, but P is allowed and H is already fixed.  
R A L P H – yes!  
Check letters: R, A, L, P, H.  
- R: in word, allowed in position 1 (new).  
- A: position 2 (correct).  
- L: not yet eliminated.  
- P: not yet eliminated.  
- H: position 5 (correct).  
So R A L P H is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is RALPH.
