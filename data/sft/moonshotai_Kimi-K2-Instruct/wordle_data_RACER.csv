For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants to help eliminate or confirm many letters. Some excellent initial choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE.""

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good feedback on multiple common letters right away.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants to help eliminate or confirm many letters. Some excellent initial choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE.""

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good feedback on multiple common letters right away.

- E is in the word but not in position 5

So far we have: R A _ _ _
Letters known NOT to be present: I, S
Letters known to be present but position unknown: E (not in 5th place)

I need to find a 5-letter word that starts with RA, does not contain I or S, and has an E somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be in position 5).

Looking at common patterns:
- RA _ E _ (E in position 4)
- RA E _ _ (E in position 3)

Possible words:
- RAVEN (but V and N haven't been tested)
- RABID (contains I - invalid)
- RAGED (D hasn't been tested)
- RACER (but C hasn't been tested and E would be in position 5 - invalid)
- RAVER (E in position 5 - invalid)

""RAVEN"" seems like a good choice as it uses common letters V and N while testing E in position 4.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should include vowels and common consonants to help eliminate or confirm many letters. Some excellent initial choices include words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE.""

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good feedback on multiple common letters right away.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is correct in position 1 → word starts with R
- A is correct in position 2 → word is R A _ _ _
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So far we have: R A _ _ _
Letters known NOT to be present: I, S
Letters known to be present but position unknown: E (not in 5th place)

I need to find a 5-letter word that starts with RA, does not contain I or S, and has an E somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be in position 5).

Looking at common patterns:
- RA _ E _ (E in position 4)
- RA E _ _ (E in position 3)

Possible words:
- RAVEN (but V and N haven't been tested)
- RABID (contains I - invalid)
- RAGED (D hasn't been tested)
- RACER (but C hasn't been tested and E would be in position 5 - invalid)
- RAVER (E in position 5 - invalid)
- RAZED (Z hasn't been tested)

""RAVEN"" seems like a good choice as it uses common letters V and N while testing E in position 4.

<guess>RAVEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RAVEN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints after two guesses:

1. Word pattern: R A _ _ _
2. Letters confirmed in word: R, A, E
3. Positions known:
   - R is fixed in 1st
   - A is fixed in 2nd
   - E is fixed in 4th
   So the pattern is: R A _ E _
4. Letters known NOT present: I, S, V, N
5. Remaining positions (3rd and 5th) must be from unused letters, avoiding I, S, V, N.

Possible letters left for positions 3 & 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already used R, A, E).

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit R A _ E _:
- RACED (but C and D are candidates)
- RAGED (G is candidate)
- RAKED (K is candidate)
- RATED (T is candidate)
- RAZED (Z is candidate)

""RATED"" uses very common letters T and D, and since we haven't tested T yet, it's a strong candidate.

Alternative consideration: Could also be R A B E L (label), but L hasn't been tested either. ""RATED"" seems more likely.The word must start with ""RA"", have an ""E"" in the 4th position, and cannot contain I, S, V, or N. Testing ""RATED"" gives us new letters T and D to evaluate.

<guess>RATED</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RAVEN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: RATED -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we have:

1. The pattern is R A _ E _
2. Letters confirmed present: R, A, E
3. Letters confirmed missing: I, S, V, N, T, D

That leaves positions 3 and 5 to be filled with any letters not yet ruled out.  
Allowed letters (excluding the six already banned) are:  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not used).

We still need a valid English 5-letter word of the form R A _ E _.  
Quick scan of common words:

- RACED – ruled out (D missing)  
- RAGER – G still possible  
- RAKED – K still possible  
- RAME? – not a word  
- RAPED – P still possible  
- RAVED – V is out  
- RAZED – Z still possible, but uncommon  
- RALPH – not 5-letter pattern  
- RAVEL – L still possible  

Among these, “RAPED” or “RALPH” would test new consonants, but “RALPH” doesn’t fit the pattern because the last letter must be valid and L is still available.

Actually, let me think of the most common words: R A C E _ is invalid because T is missing, but R A G E _ could be RAGEN (invalid), RAGE? – nothing.

Wait, the list of common words that fit R A _ E _ is limited. Let me re-list:

- RACED – invalid (D missing)  
- RAGED – G still possible  
- RAKED – K still possible  
- RAPED – P still possible  
- RAZED – Z possible but uncommon  

Among these, “RAGED” uses G, which is a common consonant and hasn’t been ruled out. I’ll go with that.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed constraints:
1. Word pattern: R A _ E _
2. Positions 1, 2, 4 are locked (R, A, E).
3. Letters known **not** in the word: I, S, V, N, T, D, G.

We need a 5-letter English word starting with R A _ E _ that avoids all banned letters.

Candidate consonants still allowed for positions 3 and 5:  
B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words fitting R A _ E _:
- RACED – D banned  
- RAGED – G banned  
- RAKED – D banned  
- RAVED – V banned  
- RAZED – D banned  
- RAPED – D banned  
- RALPH – H is allowed, but the word must finish with the 5th letter (RALPH is RALPH, not R A L E H). Doesn’t fit.  
Wait, pattern is strictly R A _ E _. So we need 3rd and 5th letters.

Looking at the limited list, the most common word that fits is **RAZER**, but Z is allowed and R is already used in position 1 (no conflict). However, that would double R. Another option is **RAKER**, but D is banned, K still allowed.  
Actually, the word **RAKER** fits (R A K E R), but double R is acceptable.

Another word: **RAZER** (R A Z E R). Both RAKER and RAZER fit, but they use duplicate letters. However, nothing prevents duplicates in positions 1 and 5.

Another possibility: **RAMEN** – but N is banned.  
**RAVEL** – V banned.  
**RAZEL** – not a word.  
**RAVEN** – V and N banned.  
**RAKE** – 4-letter word.  

So, the remaining valid word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters is **RAKER**.

Let's go with **RAKER**.
