For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help gather maximum information. Research shows that the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Contains several vowels to test their presence
2. Uses common consonants
3. Doesn't repeat letters to maximize information gain

Some strong initial guesses include:
- ""AROSE"" - uses common letters and 3 vowels
- ""ADIEU"" - 4 vowels but less consonant info
- ""SLATE"" - good consonant spread with a vowel

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage to find hits or misses early.

The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the mystery word:
- Contains the letter S but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

I need a new guess that:
1. Keeps S but moves it to a different position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLIMY"" - uses S in position 1, includes L, I, M, Y
- ""SIGHT"" - uses S in position 1, includes I, G, H, T
- ""TUNIS"" - uses S in position 5 (but S can't be in position 4 anyway)

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   – S is present but not in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(✓) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   – S is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – L, I, M, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.  
- Remaining letters cannot be A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y.  
- S cannot appear elsewhere (since we already have one S and no repeats have been indicated).

Remaining common consonants/vowels still allowed:  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (but limited set of practical 5-letter words)  
Vowels left: U (the only vowel not ruled out).

Consider “SHUNT” – but U is the only vowel allowed and we already used it.

Research shows that the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. \n\nA good strategy is to use a word that:\n1. Contains several vowels to test their presence\n2. Uses common consonants\n3. Doesn\'t repeat letters to maximize information gain\n\nSome strong initial guesses include:\n- ""AROSE"" - uses common letters and 3 vowels\n- ""ADIEU"" - 4 vowels but less consonant info\n- ""SLATE"" - good consonant spread with a vowel\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage to find hits or misses early.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The feedback from AROSE tells me:\n- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).\n\nSo the mystery word:\n- Contains the letter S but not in position 4.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.\n\nI need a new guess that:\n1.

Current confirmed information:
- The word starts with S, T, U, N in positions 1-4: S T U N _
- The last letter is **not** any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, K.
- Remaining possible letters for position 5 (from the alphabet, excluding the above): B, C, D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Common 5-letter words ending with these letters, matching S T U N _:
  - STUND (variant spelling, uncommon)
  - STUNG (very common)
  - STUNK (already tested, K is out)
  - STUNS
Given the feedback so far and typical English word patterns, ""STUNG"" is the most plausible candidate, as ""G"" hasn't been ruled out yet.
