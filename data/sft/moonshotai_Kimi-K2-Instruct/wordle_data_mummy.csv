For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible. A good strategy is to use words with common consonants and vowels.

Looking at 5-letter words, some good starter options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E).

The feedback shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word at all. That means I need to use a completely different set of letters for my next guess.

Common high-frequency letters I have not yet tested include: S, T, I, O, L, U, M, D, P, G, B, H, F, K, Y, W, V, J, Q, X, Z.

Looking for a word that uses five new letters while still being common, SLUMP is a good choice because:
- S and T are the two most common letters in English overall, and I haven't tried either yet.
- L, U, M, P are also fairly common.

However, I could also try a word like SLUMP, STOMP, or GHOST. STOMP uses S, T, O, M, P - all new letters and very common.

My previous guess “LIMB” was only four letters (L I M B) – I forgot to add the final letter that keeps M in position 5. I need a valid 5-letter word ending in M that uses only the letters not yet ruled out.

Known absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, P  
Known present: M (and it is in position 5)

High-frequency letters still available: I, L, U, D, G, B, H, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

A correct 5-letter word ending in M using new letters: “FILM” is only 4 letters. Need to pick a 5-letter candidate.

Examples:  
- “BULIM” — not valid

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information I can get. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible. A good strategy is to use words with common consonants and vowels.

Looking at 5-letter words, some good starter options are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it covers several very common letters (C, R, A, N, E).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E appear in the secret word at all. That means I need to use a completely different set of letters for my next guess.

Common high-frequency letters I have not yet tested include: S, T, I, O, L, U, M, D, P, G, B, H, F, K, Y, W, V, J, Q, X, Z.

Looking for a word that uses five new letters while still being common, SLUMP is a good choice because:
- S and T are the two most common letters in English overall, and I haven't tried either yet.
- L, U, M, P are also fairly common.

However, I could also try a word like SLUMP, STOMP, or GHOST. STOMP uses S, T, O, M, P - all new letters and very common.

I'll go with STOMP because it maximizes coverage of the most common letters I haven't tried yet.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet used: I, L, U, D, G, B, H, F, K, Y, W, V, J, Q, X, Z.

A good guess should:
1. Keep M in position 5.
2. Introduce several new, common letters.
3. Still be a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate words ending in M: FILM, LIMB, BULM (rare), etc.

From the latest feedback (Guess 5: DUMMY):

- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.
- U(✓) – U is correct in position 2.
- M(✓) – M is correct in position 3.
- M(✓) – M is correct in position 4 (second M must also be correct).
- Y(✓) – Y is correct in position 5.

So the word has the pattern:
- Position 2 = U
- Position 3 = M
- Position 4 = M
- Position 5 = Y
- Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out (from all guesses):
C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, P, F, I, L, D.

Letters still available for position 1: B, G, H, K, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern _UMMY.

Checking possible first letters:
- BUMMY – not a word.
- GUMMY – valid word (meaning sticky).
- HUMMY – informal but accepted.
- KUMMY – not a word.
- VUMMY – not a word.
- WUMMY – not a word.
- XUMMY – not a word.
- ZUMMY – not a word.

The only valid English word fitting _UMMY is GUMMY.
