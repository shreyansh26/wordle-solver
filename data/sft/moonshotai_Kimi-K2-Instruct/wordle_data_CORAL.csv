For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. The best starting words often have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequent consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)
- SLATE (tests common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (another balanced choice)
- AUDIO (tests 4 vowels)

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of frequent letters without repeats.

I'll go with ""FLANK"" because:
- It contains F (a new consonant), L (must be here), A (must be here), N and K (both new).
- L is in position 2 (but feedback said L is not in position 2, so this is a problem - I need to move L).
- Wait, L cannot be in position 2. Let me rethink.

Better candidates:
- PLAIN: L is in position 3, A is in position 4. This satisfies the constraints (L not in 2, A not in 3).
- GLAND: L in 3, A in 4.
- CLAMP: L in 3, A in 4.

I'll choose ""PLAIN"" as it uses new frequent letters P, I, N while placing L and A in valid positions.

Round 1 – SLATE:  
S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)

- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

Round 2 – PLAIN:

- P, I, N are not in the word.  
- L is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed).  
- A is still in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed).

So we now know:
- Forbidden letters: S, T, E, P, I, N
- Must include: L and A
- L cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3

Remaining consonants to try (common ones not yet excluded): R, D, C, G, B, M, F, K, H, etc.
Remaining vowels (apart from A): O, U, Y

We need a 5-letter word that uses L and A and only the still-allowed letters, while placing L and A in valid spots.

Candidate structure:
- L must appear once, not in position 2.
- A must appear once, not in position 3.
- All other letters must avoid the forbidden set {S,T,E,P,I,N}.

Possible words:
1. RALMY – but Y is uncommon and M/Y not yet ruled out.
2. CARLA – but contains C,R and double A/L; also A is in position 3 which is invalid.
3. GLOAT – but O and T; T forbidden.
4. LARDY – but R,D,Y okay; A is position 2, L position 1: this satisfies the constraints (L not in 2, A not in 3).
5. BALDY – uses B, D, Y; A position 2, L position 1: okay.
6. CLARY – but Y okay, R okay, C okay; A position 3 is invalid.

Between LARDY and BALDY:
- BALDY: B, A, L, D, Y
  - A is in position 2 (valid: not 3)
  - L is in position 3 (valid: not 2)
  - All letters not yet forbidden.

Forbidden letters so far: S, T, E, P, I, N, B, D, Y  
Must contain both A and L exactly once.  
A must NOT be in position 3.  
L must NOT be in position 2.

Remaining common letters: R, C, G, F, M, K, H, U, O  
We need a 5-letter word using only allowed letters, containing both A and L in valid positions.

Possible structures to test quickly:
- A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)  

Trying to maximize coverage of new letters:
- CAROL – but O is allowed, R, C, L – A is position 2 (ok), L is position 4 (ok).  
- FAROL – uses F, R, O – but is not a common English word.  
- GALOR – same issue.  
- CLAMO – M and O ok, A in position 2, L in 3 – ok.  
- CALMR – uses C, M, R – A in 2, L in 3 – ok.

Of these, ""CLAMO"" and ""CALMR"" are not standard; ""CAROL"" is a common word.

Check CAROL:
C A R O L  
A at 2 ✔, L at 4 ✔

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequent consonants (S, T, R, N, L, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include:
- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)
- SLATE (tests common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE (another balanced choice)
- AUDIO (tests 4 vowels)

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of frequent letters without repeats.

- PLANK (but P is less common)

From Guess 4 (CAROL):

C(✓) – C is correct in position 1  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 2  
R(✓) – R is correct in position 3  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 4  
L(✓) – L is correct in position 5  

So far we know:

Positions:
1 = C  
3 = R  
5 = L  

Letters still required: A and O must appear exactly once each, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Forbidden letters (from earlier rounds): S, T, E, P, I, N, B, D, Y.

Available letters (excluding the above and the ones already placed C, R, L):  
A, O, F, G, H, K, M, U, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that:
- Are not any of the forbidden letters.  
- Position 2 must be A or O (but A can’t be in position 2, and O can’t be in position 4).  

Wait: A(-) means A is somewhere but not position 2.  
O(-) means O is somewhere but not position 4.

Therefore:
- Position 2 can be O (since A is excluded here).  
- Position 4 can be A (since O is excluded here).  

So the word must be:

C _ R _ L  
with position 2 = O and position 4 = A.

Thus the word is: C O R A L.

Let me verify:
- C in 1 ✓  
- O in 2 (allowed because O was indicated to be in the word and not excluded from position 2)  
- R in 3 ✓  
- A in 4 (allowed because A was indicated to be in the word and not excluded from position 4)  
- L in 5 ✓  

All constraints are satisfied, and no forbidden letters are used.
