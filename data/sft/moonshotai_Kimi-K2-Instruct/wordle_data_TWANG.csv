For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means selecting a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm letters. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps test the most common vowels
- Two very common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- This combination gives good coverage of common letters without too much overlap

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A – in the word but wrong position (-)
- R – not in the word (x)
- O – not in the word (x)
- S – not in the word (x)
- E – not in the word (x)

Take-aways:
1. The secret word has the letter A somewhere, but NOT in the first position.
2. R, O, S, E are all completely absent from the word.

- include A (but not in position 1)
- avoid R, O, S, E entirely
- test new common letters such as T, N, L, I, U, D, C, P, M, etc.

- avoids the excluded letters R, O, S, E entirely

Current known constraints:
1. Word is 5 letters.
2. Letters that must appear:
   - A is in position 3.
   - N is in position 4.
3. Letters that must NOT appear (from prior guesses):
   R, O, S, E, U, I, D, C, H.
4. From Guess 3, T is in the word but not in position 5 (T(-)).

Thus, the pattern is: _ _ A N T or _ _ A N _ with T somewhere else.

But since T cannot be in position 5, and position 4 is N, the only valid position for T is positions 1 or 2:
   T _ A N _ or _ T A N _

Now we need a single letter for the remaining blank that:
- Is not in the forbidden set (R, O, S, E, U, I, D, C, H).
- Has not been tested yet.

Possible letters left: B, F, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a common consonant; let’s try B for the first blank:
   B T A N _ or T B A N _

The remaining position (position 5) must be one of the unused letters. From the list above, let’s pick K (common enough and untested).

Pattern: T B A N K → TBANK is not a word.  
Pattern: B T A N K → BTANK is not a word.  
Pattern: T _ A N _ → let’s try T and then a consonant: T G A N K → not common.  
But “BLANK” is a valid word, fitting _ _ A N K but we have T to place.

Wait, since T must be somewhere in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are open:

Option 1: T _ A N _ → need a consonant for position 2 and a letter for position 5.  
Option 2: _ T A N _ → same.

Let’s try T in position 1 and L in position 2, and K in position 5: T L A N K → “TLANK” invalid.  
Next: T _ A N _ with F: T F A N _ → “TFAN_” invalid.

Better to re-evaluate: the pattern is _ _ A N _ with T somewhere in 1,2, or 5 (but 5 is invalid). So T must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s pick “PLANT” as a candidate, but P L A N T has T in 5, which is invalid.  
“STANK” has S excluded.  
“FRANK” has R excluded.  
“CLANK” has C excluded.  
“FLANK” has F, L, A, N, K – C and H already excluded, F, L, K are allowed. And T must be somewhere. But FLANK does not include T. So invalid.

Reconstructing: the word must include T, A, N, with A in 3, N in 4, and T in 1 or 2.

Thus:
- T _ A N _ or _ T A N _

Possible valid English words:
- “T A A N _” invalid.  
- “T B A N K” → invalid.  
- “T L A N K” → invalid.  
- “T M A N _” → T M A N _ → “TMANS” invalid.  
- “M T A N _” → “MTANS” invalid.  
- “G T A N _” → invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid words matching _ _ A N T or T _ A N _ or _ T A N _:

- “GIANT” has I and G – I is excluded (from UNAID), G is allowed. But I is excluded.  
- “PAINT” has I excluded.  
- “PLANT” has T in 5, invalid.  
- “GRANT” has R excluded.  
- “BLANT” invalid.  
- “GLANT” invalid.  
- “FLANT” invalid.  
- “SLANT” has S excluded.  
- “CHANT” already tried.  
- “BRANT” has R excluded.  
- “QUANT” has U excluded.  
- “TWANK” invalid.  
- “TRANK” has R excluded.  
- “THANK” has H excluded.  

Next, check _ T A N _ with T in 2:  
Possible words: “LTANK” invalid.  
“BTANK” invalid.  
“FTANK” invalid.  
“GTANK” invalid.  
“KTANK” invalid.  
“MTANK” invalid.  
“PTANK” invalid.  
“YTANK” invalid.  

But “ATMAN” has A in 1 and 3, not matching.  

Wait, the pattern _ _ A N _ with T must be in 1 or 2. Let’s check dictionaries for valid English words fitting:

- “STAND” has S excluded.  
- “STANG” has S excluded.  
- “STANK” has S excluded.  
- “STANT” invalid.  
- “SPANK” has S excluded.  
- “SWANK” has S excluded.  
- “BLANK” has no T.  
- “CLANK” has no T.  
- “FLANK” has no T.  
- “PLANK” has no T.  
- “SLANK” has S excluded.  
- “ULANS” has U excluded.  
- “ALANT” has A in 1 and 3, and T in 5 – T can’t be in 5.  

Re-examining: perhaps T is in position 2, and the word ends with K:

Pattern: _ T A N K → valid word is “BTANK” invalid, “GTANK” invalid, “MTANK” invalid.  
But “UTANK” invalid.  

Another angle: the word must be _ _ A N _ with T in 1 or 2, and remaining letters from B, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Valid English words fitting:
- “MTGNA” invalid.  
- “FTANK” invalid.  
- “YTANK” invalid.  

But “PLANK” lacks T.  

Realization: the only possible valid English word matching the constraints is “BLANK” but it lacks T. Thus, my deduction must have an error.

Recheck: from CHANT (C H A N T) feedback:
- C(x), H(x) → C, H excluded.
- A(✓) → A in 3.
- N(✓) → N in 4.
- T(-) → T is in word but not in 5.

Thus, the word must have A in 3, N in 4, T in 1 or 2.

Possible valid words:
- “T A A N _” invalid.  
- “T _ A N _” with second letter from remaining: B, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.  
  - “TBAAN” invalid.  
  - “TFAAN” invalid.  
  - “TGAAN” invalid.  
  - “TKAAN” invalid.  
  - “TLAAN” invalid.  
  - “TMAAN” invalid.  
  - “TPAAN” invalid.  
  - “TVAAN” invalid.  
  - “TWAAN” invalid.  
  - “TYAAN” invalid.  
  - “TZAAN” invalid.  

Wait, the pattern is 5 letters: positions are 1 2 3 4 5, with 3=A, 4=N, and T must be in 1 or 2.

Thus:
- T _ A N _ → second letter and fifth letter needed from remaining unused letters (B, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z), forming a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- “TBAAN” invalid.  
- “TBANK” invalid.  
- “TBA NK” invalid.  

But no valid English word fits T _ A N _ with the constraints.  

Alternative: T is in position 2:
- _ T A N _ → first and fifth letters needed from remaining.  

Valid words:
- “BTANK” invalid.  
- “FTANK” invalid.  
- “GTANK” invalid.  
- “KTANK” invalid.  
- “LTANK” invalid.  
- “MTANK” invalid.  
- “PTANK” invalid.  
- “YTANK” invalid.  

But “STANK” has S excluded.  

Realization: the word must be “PLANT” but T is in 5, which is invalid. Thus, the only remaining possibility is that the word ends with T in 2 and another letter: but no valid word.

Re-examining constraints: perhaps I misread T(-) from CHANT. T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 5. Thus, T could be in 1, 2, or 4. But 4 is N, so T must be in 1 or 2.

Given that, and the word must be _ _ A N _ with T in 1 or 2, and valid 5-letter English words:

- “TITAN” has I excluded.  
- “TALON” has O excluded.  
- “TAMAN” invalid.  
- “TABUN” has U excluded.  
- “TALAN” invalid.  
- “TAXON” has X and O excluded.  

But “TWANK” is slang.  

The only valid candidate fitting the pattern and constraints appears to be “PLANT” but T is in 5, which is invalid.  

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words with A in 3, N in 4, and T in 1 or 2:

- “T A A N _” invalid.  
- “T _ A N _” where _ are unused letters (B, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z).  
  - “TBAAN” invalid.  
  - “TGAAN” invalid.  
  - “TPAAN” invalid.  

But “TWAAN” invalid.  

This suggests the word must be “BLANK” but it lacks T, indicating a possible oversight.  

Rechecking: the word must have A in 3, N in 4, T somewhere (1 or 2), and other letters from the unused set.  

The only valid English word fitting is:

“T A N G Y” – invalid.  

Alternatively, “T A N K Y” – invalid.  

Realization: the word must be “PLANK” but lacks T. This indicates that the word must include T in 1 or 2, and I missed a valid word.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct valid word fitting _ _ A N _ with T in 1 or 2 is “T B A N K” but it’s invalid.  

However, “TANKY” is invalid.  

Thus, the only remaining valid word is “PLANT” but T is in 5. This contradiction implies an error in prior steps.

Rechecking CHANT feedback: C(x), H(x), A(✓), N(✓), T(-). Thus, T is in word but not in 5. Thus, T must be in 1, 2, or 3, but 3 is A, so 1 or 2.

The pattern is: [T or _][T or _] A N _.

Valid English words:
- “T A A N _” invalid.  
- “T B A N K” invalid.  
- “T M A N X” invalid.  

But “T W A N G” has W and G allowed, but G is allowed, W is allowed, but word is “TWANG”:

Check “TWANG”:
- T W A N G:
  - T in 1 (allowed)
  - W new
  - A in 3 (correct)
  - N in 4 (correct)
  - G new
  - All letters are unused.

Thus, “TWANG” is the valid word.
