For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common first guesses often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)
This provides a good spread of common letters that might appear in many words.

Let’s interpret the feedback for SLATE:

- S(-) : S is in the word but NOT in the first position.
- L(x) : L is NOT in the word at all.
- A(x) : A is NOT in the word at all.
- T(-) : T is in the word but NOT in the fourth position.
- E(✓) : E is in the word AND in the fifth position (final letter).

So the word:
- Ends with E
- Contains S (but not in position 1)  
- Contains T (but not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain L or A

With these constraints, I want a word that:
- Has E in position 5
- Has S somewhere in positions 2-5  
- Has T somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (but 5 is already E), so positions 1-3
- Uses letters we haven’t ruled out (no L, no A)

Common letters we haven’t tested much: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A word that satisfies this: “TRIES”.
- E in position 5 ✓
- S in position 5 (but this would duplicate E, so no) – wait, ""TRIES"" has S in position 4, which is fine
- T in position 1 ✓
- Uses R and I which are new letters

Another candidate: “STEER” – but E is duplicated and we already know E is last letter.  
Another: “TORSE” – but O and R are new, S is position 3, T position 1, E position 5.

But ""TRIES"" seems better because:
- T in position 1 ✓
- R in position 2 (new letter)
- I in position 3 (new letter)
- E in position 5 ✓
- S in position 4 (matches S is in word but not position 1)

I’ll go with “TRIES”.

From the third guess, THOSE → T(✓) H(✓) O(x) S(✓) E(✓).

Confirmed facts now:
- Word is T H _ S E
- The third letter is not O and we have not yet tried:
  Letters already ruled out: L, A, R, I, O
  Letters tried and still allowed: N, C, M, U, D, G, etc.

So we need a valid 5-letter word of the pattern T H _ S E, where the blank letter is:
- Not any of L, A, R, I, O
- Not yet used in that position

Common words matching T H _ S E:
- THOSE – we just eliminated because O was marked x
- THUSE – not a standard word
- THNSE – not a word
- THYSE – not a word
- THMSE – not a word
- THGSE – not a word
- THDSE – not a word
- THCSE – not a word
- THNSE – not a word
- THUSE – not standard
- Actually, the only standard English word is THESE.

""THESE"" fits the pattern T H _ S E and uses E in the third slot (which has not been ruled out). Let’s test it.

Pattern: T H E S E
Check constraints:
- T(1) ✓ already confirmed
- H(2) ✓ already confirmed
- E(3) – not ruled out, and not yet placed
- S(4) ✓ already confirmed
- E(5) ✓ already confirmed
