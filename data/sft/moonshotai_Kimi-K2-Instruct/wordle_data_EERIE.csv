For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these high-frequency letters without repeating any. Some good options are ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""IRATE"". 

I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give me information about these 5 letters right away, which should help narrow down possible words significantly.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRINE → T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)

Summary of what we know:
- E is at position 5 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N.

So the word is of the form _ _ _ _ E with:
- R must be at position 1, 4 (but I is already at 4 so R cannot be there) or R at 3 (but I is at 3 so R cannot be there). Wait, let's re-express this carefully.

From TRINE feedback:
- R is (-) in position 2 → R is in word but not at position 2.
- I is (-) in position 3 → I is in word but not at position 3.

So possible positions:
- R can be at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
- I can be at 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- E is fixed at 5.

Letters remaining to test: D, L, U, C, G, H, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- R _ I _ E
- R I _ _ E → but I cannot be at 3 (from TRINE), so this would be R I _ _ E with I at 2, but then R is at 1 (valid), I at 2 (valid per feedback), E at 5. Empty positions 3 and 4 need letters not yet eliminated.

Let me think of words fitting these patterns:
- R I _ _ E: R I D E _ but needs 5 letters so R I D E _ is too short. Maybe R I F L E (rifle), but F hasn't been tested yet.
- _ R _ I E: but I can't be at 4 (from TRINE I was at 3 but marked - meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 4). Wait no, in TRINE I was at 3 and got (-) meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try R I _ _ E:
- R I F L E: but L hasn't been tested, F hasn't been tested. This seems like a reasonable next guess to test R at 1, I at 2, E at 5, and test F and L.

Let me consolidate the information we now have.

Known facts:
1. E is fixed at position 5.
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from RIFLE feedback R(-) at 1, TRINE feedback R(-) at 2, and AROSE feedback R(-) at 2).  
   Therefore R must be at position 4.
3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from RIFLE feedback I(-) at 2, TRINE feedback I(-) at 3).  
   Therefore I must be at position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, O, S, T, N, F, L.

So the word pattern is:
I _ _ R E

We still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet eliminated and not yet placed.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet used): C, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- I C R E → not enough letters (needs 5)
- I C K R E → too long
Wait, positions are 1-5: I _ _ R E (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

So positions 2 and 3 need 2 letters from remaining set.

Let me list possible valid words fitting I _ _ R E:
- I D G R E → ""idgre"" - not a word
- I C E R E → ""icere"" - not a word
- I M P R E → ""impre"" - not a word
- I V Y R E → ""ivyre"" - not a word

Let me think differently - are there any real English words I _ _ R E?

Actually checking:
- INURE - but N is eliminated
- ICERE - not valid
- ICHOR - but O is eliminated and wrong ending
- IDLER - but L is eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" is archaic
- IMBAR - wrong ending
- IMPER - ""imper"" is archaic

Wait, what about:

- ""CIGRE"" - no, must start with I
- ""WICRE"" - no
- ""MICRE"" - no

Actually, let me check known 5-letter words ending in I _ _ R E:

Real candidates:
- INURE - N eliminated
- ICHOR - wrong ending and O eliminated
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" is valid but rare, K is allowed
- IMPER - ""imper"" is valid but rare
- ICHOR - wrong pattern
- IGGER - but G is allowed, double G
- ILLER - L eliminated
- INNER - N eliminated
- ITHER - ""ither"" is Scots for ""either"", but H is allowed
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated

Among these, the most likely valid words are:
- ICKER (though obscure)
- IMPER (though rare)
- ITHER (Scots, probably too obscure)

But we need common words. Let me re-examine the pattern.

Actually, let me systematically list valid English 5-letter words I _ _ R E:

Real words:
- INNER - N eliminated
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated
- ICHOR - wrong ending
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ILLER - L eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid

Between ""icker"" and ""imper"", ""imper"" seems slightly more common (from ""imperative"").

But let me check if I missed any:

- IGGER - valid (offensive term, but valid)
- ITHER - Scots
- ICHOR - wrong ending

Given the constraints, the most reasonable guess is ""imper"".

But actually, let me check ""icker"" and ""imper"" - both are quite obscure.

Wait, let me check the pattern more carefully - positions are:

1: I
2: ?
3: ?
4: R
5: E

Valid words:
- IMPRE - not a word
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ICHER - not a word
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid (as in ""to icker"" - a variant of ""eager"")
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid (as in ""imperative"")

Given the choices, ""imper"" is more likely. But let me check if there are others.

Actually, checking thoroughly, the only common word that fits is:

""ICIER"" - but that's I C I E R - R is at 4, but I is repeated which we don't know.

""IMMER"" - but M repeated

""IVYER"" - not a word

""IMBER"" - not a word

""INKER"" - N eliminated

Looking at this, the most probable valid word fitting I _ _ R E with letters not eliminated is:

""IMPER""

But let me check if ""imper"" is the only option, or if I missed:

Actually, ""UDDER"" - no
""UDDER"" - wrong pattern

I think ""imper"" is the best fit here.

But before finalizing, let me verify:

Letters used:
I (known at 1), R at 4, E at 5
M and P are new letters not yet tested
All constraints satisfied.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these high-frequency letters without repeating any. Some good options are ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""IRATE"". 

I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give me information about these 5 letters right away, which should help narrow down possible words significantly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Word contains an R somewhere except position 2.
- Word does NOT contain A, O, or S.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 5 (✓).
2. Places R in a different position to locate it.
3. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, I, L, C, D, U).

Good candidates: TRIPE, TRINE, CRANE, PRONE, URINE, etc.

I’ll choose “TRINE”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- E stays in position 5.
- R is moved to position 2 (it can’t be there from feedback, but it will become a ✓ elsewhere if correct, or we’ll learn more).

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRINE → T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)

Summary of what we know:
- E is at position 5 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N.

So the word is of the form _ _ _ _ E with:
- R must be at position 1, 4 (but I is already at 4 so R cannot be there) or R at 3 (but I is at 3 so R cannot be there). Wait, let's re-express this carefully.

From TRINE feedback:
- R is (-) in position 2 → R is in word but not at position 2.
- I is (-) in position 3 → I is in word but not at position 3.

So possible positions:
- R can be at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
- I can be at 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- E is fixed at 5.

Letters remaining to test: D, L, U, C, G, H, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- R _ I _ E
- R I _ _ E → but I cannot be at 3 (from TRINE), so this would be R I _ _ E with I at 2, but then R is at 1 (valid), I at 2 (valid per feedback), E at 5. Empty positions 3 and 4 need letters not yet eliminated.

Let me think of words fitting these patterns:
- R I _ _ E: R I D E _ but needs 5 letters so R I D E _ is too short. Maybe R I F L E (rifle), but F hasn't been tested yet.
- _ R _ I E: but I can't be at 4 (from TRINE I was at 3 but marked - meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 4). Wait no, in TRINE I was at 3 and got (-) meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try R I _ _ E:
- R I F L E: but L hasn't been tested, F hasn't been tested. This seems like a reasonable next guess to test R at 1, I at 2, E at 5, and test F and L.

- IMPER - ""imper"" is valid but rare
- ICHOR - wrong pattern
- IGGER - but G is allowed, double G
- ILLER - L eliminated
- INNER - N eliminated
- ITHER - ""ither"" is Scots for ""either"", but H is allowed
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated

Among these, the most likely valid words are:
- ICKER (though obscure)
- IMPER (though rare)
- ITHER (Scots, probably too obscure)

But we need common words. Let me re-examine the pattern.

Actually, let me systematically list valid English 5-letter words I _ _ R E:

Real words:
- INNER - N eliminated
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated
- ICHOR - wrong ending
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ILLER - L eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid

Between ""icker"" and ""imper"", ""imper"" seems slightly more common (from ""imperative"").

But let me check if I missed any:

- IGGER - valid (offensive term, but valid)
- ITHER - Scots
- ICHOR - wrong ending

Given the constraints, the most reasonable guess is ""imper"".

But actually, let me check ""icker"" and ""imper"" - both are quite obscure.

Wait, let me check the pattern more carefully - positions are:

1: I
2: ?
3: ?
4: R
5: E

Valid words:
- IMPRE - not a word
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ICHER - not a word
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid (as in ""to icker"" - a variant of ""eager"")
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid (as in ""imperative"")

Given the choices, ""imper"" is more likely. But let me check if there are others.

Actually, checking thoroughly, the only common word that fits is:

""ICIER"" - but that's I C I E R - R is at 4, but I is repeated which we don't know.

""IMMER"" - but M repeated

""IVYER"" - not a word

""IMBER"" - not a word

""INKER"" - N eliminated

Looking at this, the most probable valid word fitting I _ _ R E with letters not eliminated is:

""IMPER""

But let me check if ""imper"" is the only option, or if I missed:

Actually, ""UDDER"" - no
""UDDER"" - wrong pattern

I think ""imper"" is the best fit here.

But before finalizing, let me verify:

Letters used:
I (known at 1), R at 4, E at 5
M and P are new letters not yet tested
All constraints satisfied.

Let's consolidate the full set of constraints now.

1. E is at position 5 (✓) from every guess.
2. R is in the word but NOT at positions 1,2,3,4 (from IMPER feedback R(-) at 4).  
   ⇒ R must be at position 5 – but E is already fixed there.  
   This is impossible; therefore **R cannot appear anywhere in the word**.  
   But previous feedback said R(-) (present but wrong position) three times.  
   Re-reading:  
   - AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 2.  
   - TRINE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 2.  
   - RIFLE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 1.  
   - IMPER: R(-) means R is in word but not at 5.  

   Combining these:  
   - R must be at position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1,2,5).  
   - From IMPER: E(-) at 4 means E is NOT in position 4, which we already knew (E is at 5).  
   - From IMPER: I(-) at 1 means I is in the word but not at 1.  
   - From IMPER: M(x) and P(x) → M and P are NOT in the word.  

   So far:  
   - Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E fixed at 5).  
   - Contains both R and I.  
   - R must be at 3 or 4.  
   - I must be at 2,3,4 (but not 1).  

   Possible overlaps:  
   - If R is at 3, then I must be at 2 or 4.  
   - If R is at 4, then I must be at 2 or 3.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to quickly eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these high-frequency letters without repeating any. Some good options are ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", or ""IRATE"". 

I've decided to go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This will give me information about these 5 letters right away, which should help narrow down possible words significantly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Word contains an R somewhere except position 2.
- Word does NOT contain A, O, or S.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 5 (✓).
2. Places R in a different position to locate it.
3. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, I, L, C, D, U).

Good candidates: TRIPE, TRINE, CRANE, PRONE, URINE, etc.

I’ll choose “TRINE”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- E stays in position 5.
- R is moved to position 2 (it can’t be there from feedback, but it will become a ✓ elsewhere if correct, or we’ll learn more).

<guess>TRINE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRINE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRINE → T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)

Summary of what we know:
- E is at position 5 (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT at position 2 or 3.
- I is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N.

So the word is of the form _ _ _ _ E with:
- R must be at position 1, 4 (but I is already at 4 so R cannot be there) or R at 3 (but I is at 3 so R cannot be there). Wait, let's re-express this carefully.

From TRINE feedback:
- R is (-) in position 2 → R is in word but not at position 2.
- I is (-) in position 3 → I is in word but not at position 3.

So possible positions:
- R can be at 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2).
- I can be at 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- E is fixed at 5.

Letters remaining to test: D, L, U, C, G, H, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- R _ I _ E
- R I _ _ E → but I cannot be at 3 (from TRINE), so this would be R I _ _ E with I at 2, but then R is at 1 (valid), I at 2 (valid per feedback), E at 5. Empty positions 3 and 4 need letters not yet eliminated.

Let me think of words fitting these patterns:
- R I _ _ E: R I D E _ but needs 5 letters so R I D E _ is too short. Maybe R I F L E (rifle), but F hasn't been tested yet.
- _ R _ I E: but I can't be at 4 (from TRINE I was at 3 but marked - meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 4). Wait no, in TRINE I was at 3 and got (-) meaning I is in word but not at 3, so I could be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try R I _ _ E:
- R I F L E: but L hasn't been tested, F hasn't been tested. This seems like a reasonable next guess to test R at 1, I at 2, E at 5, and test F and L.

<guess>RIFLE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRINE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: RIFLE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) F(x) L(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me consolidate the information we now have.

Known facts:
1. E is fixed at position 5.
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from RIFLE feedback R(-) at 1, TRINE feedback R(-) at 2, and AROSE feedback R(-) at 2).  
   Therefore R must be at position 4.
3. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from RIFLE feedback I(-) at 2, TRINE feedback I(-) at 3).  
   Therefore I must be at position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, O, S, T, N, F, L.

So the word pattern is:
I _ _ R E

We still need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet eliminated and not yet placed.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones not yet used): C, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:
- I C R E → not enough letters (needs 5)
- I C K R E → too long
Wait, positions are 1-5: I _ _ R E (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

So positions 2 and 3 need 2 letters from remaining set.

Let me list possible valid words fitting I _ _ R E:
- I D G R E → ""idgre"" - not a word
- I C E R E → ""icere"" - not a word
- I M P R E → ""impre"" - not a word
- I V Y R E → ""ivyre"" - not a word
- I C O R E → but O is eliminated
- I C U R E → ""icure"" - not a word
- I M B R E → ""imbre"" - not a word
- I N D R E → N is eliminated
- I G H R E → ""ighre"" - not a word
- I C H R E → ""ichre"" - not a word
- I C A R E → A is eliminated
- I C E R E → ruled out
- I C Y R E → ""icyre"" - not a word
- I M M R E → repeated M
- I M P R E → ""impre"" - not valid
- I D L R E → L is eliminated
- I D D R E → repeated D
- I D G R E → not valid
- I D M R E → ""idmre"" - not valid
- I D V R E → ""idvre"" - not valid
- I C K R E → ""ickre"" - not valid
- I C H R E → ""ichre"" - not valid
- I M E R E → ""imere"" - not valid
- I C R E D → but E is fixed at 5
- I C R E W → but E is fixed at 5
- I C R E E → doubled E
- I C R E M → ""icrem"" - not valid
- I C R E P → ""icrep"" - not valid
- I C R E V → ""icrev"" - not valid
- I C R E D → ""icred"" - not valid
- I C R E K → ""icrek"" - not valid

Let me think differently - are there any real English words I _ _ R E?

Actually checking:
- INURE - but N is eliminated
- ICERE - not valid
- ICHOR - but O is eliminated and wrong ending
- IDLER - but L is eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" is archaic
- IMBAR - wrong ending
- IMPER - ""imper"" is archaic

Wait, what about:

- ""CIGRE"" - no, must start with I
- ""WICRE"" - no
- ""MICRE"" - no

Actually, let me check known 5-letter words ending in I _ _ R E:

Real candidates:
- INURE - N eliminated
- ICHOR - wrong ending and O eliminated
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" is valid but rare, K is allowed
- IMPER - ""imper"" is valid but rare
- ICHOR - wrong pattern
- IGGER - but G is allowed, double G
- ILLER - L eliminated
- INNER - N eliminated
- ITHER - ""ither"" is Scots for ""either"", but H is allowed
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated

Among these, the most likely valid words are:
- ICKER (though obscure)
- IMPER (though rare)
- ITHER (Scots, probably too obscure)

But we need common words. Let me re-examine the pattern.

Actually, let me systematically list valid English 5-letter words I _ _ R E:

Real words:
- INNER - N eliminated
- INFER - N eliminated
- INKER - N eliminated
- INVER - N eliminated
- ICHOR - wrong ending
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ILLER - L eliminated
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid

Between ""icker"" and ""imper"", ""imper"" seems slightly more common (from ""imperative"").

But let me check if I missed any:

- IGGER - valid (offensive term, but valid)
- ITHER - Scots
- ICHOR - wrong ending

Given the constraints, the most reasonable guess is ""imper"".

But actually, let me check ""icker"" and ""imper"" - both are quite obscure.

Wait, let me check the pattern more carefully - positions are:

1: I
2: ?
3: ?
4: R
5: E

Valid words:
- IMPRE - not a word
- IDLER - L eliminated
- ICHER - not a word
- ICKER - ""icker"" - valid (as in ""to icker"" - a variant of ""eager"")
- IMPER - ""imper"" - valid (as in ""imperative"")

Given the choices, ""imper"" is more likely. But let me check if there are others.

Actually, checking thoroughly, the only common word that fits is:

""ICIER"" - but that's I C I E R - R is at 4, but I is repeated which we don't know.

""IMMER"" - but M repeated

""IVYER"" - not a word

""IMBER"" - not a word

""INKER"" - N eliminated

Looking at this, the most probable valid word fitting I _ _ R E with letters not eliminated is:

""IMPER""

But let me check if ""imper"" is the only option, or if I missed:

Actually, ""UDDER"" - no
""UDDER"" - wrong pattern

I think ""imper"" is the best fit here.

But before finalizing, let me verify:

Letters used:
I (known at 1), R at 4, E at 5
M and P are new letters not yet tested
All constraints satisfied.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: TRINE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: RIFLE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) F(x) L(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: IMPER -> FEEDBACK: I(-) M(x) P(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's consolidate the full set of constraints now.

1. E is at position 5 (✓) from every guess.
2. R is in the word but NOT at positions 1,2,3,4 (from IMPER feedback R(-) at 4).  
   ⇒ R must be at position 5 – but E is already fixed there.  
   This is impossible; therefore **R cannot appear anywhere in the word**.  
   But previous feedback said R(-) (present but wrong position) three times.  
   Re-reading:  
   - AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 2.  
   - TRINE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 2.  
   - RIFLE: R(-) means R is in word but not at 1.  
   - IMPER: R(-) means R is in word but not at 5.  

   Combining these:  
   - R must be at position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1,2,5).  
   - From IMPER: E(-) at 4 means E is NOT in position 4, which we already knew (E is at 5).  
   - From IMPER: I(-) at 1 means I is in the word but not at 1.  
   - From IMPER: M(x) and P(x) → M and P are NOT in the word.  

   So far:  
   - Pattern: _ _ _ _ E (E fixed at 5).  
   - Contains both R and I.  
   - R must be at 3 or 4.  
   - I must be at 2,3,4 (but not 1).  

   Possible overlaps:  
   - If R is at 3, then I must be at 2 or 4.  
   - If R is at 4, then I must be at 2 or 3.  

   Letters eliminated so far: A, O, S, T, N, F, L, M, P.  
   Remaining common letters: C, D, G, H, K, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

   Let’s list valid patterns:  

   Case 1: R at 3 → _ I R _ E or _ _ R I E  
   Case 2: R at 4 → _ I _ R E or _ _ I R E  

   Real 5-letter words:  
   - C I R C E → invalid (C twice)  
   - V I R G E → invalid  
   - D I R G E → “dirge” – valid and fits _ I R G E (R at 3, I at 2)  
   - G I R D E → “girde” – obsolete spelling, probably invalid  
   - D I R K E → “dirke” – invalid  
   - B I R C E → “birce” – invalid  
   - C H I R E → “chire” – dialectal  
   - B I D R E → invalid  
   - C I D R E → “cidre” – French  
   - V I B R E → invalid  

   “DIRGE” is a valid English word fitting the constraints.  
   Let me verify:  
   - D and G new letters.  
   - R at 3, I at 2, E at 5.  
   - No disallowed letters.  
   It seems the best next guess.

- I must appear at position 2 or 4.
- Positions 1 and 4 (or 2) need letters from the remaining set.

Consider the two sub-cases:

Case A: I at 2 → _ I R _ E  
   Word shape: ? I R ? E  
   Need two letters for positions 1 and 4 from {C, H, K, U, V, W, Y, B…}.

   Real words that fit:  
   - C I R C E → invalid (C repeated, already eliminated)  
   - V I R U E → invalid  
   - B I R C E → invalid  
   - H I R E D → wrong ending  
   - C I R K E → “cirke” – invalid  
   - W I R E D → wrong ending  
   - H I R E R → wrong ending  
   - K I R K E → “kirke” – dialectal, K repeated  
   - C I R U E → invalid  
   - B I R K E → “birke” – dialectal  
   - C I R V E → invalid  
   - C I R B E → invalid  

   Closest real word: “BIRCH” – but ends in H not E.  
   “VIREO” – wrong ending.  
   Actually “VIRGE” (archaic for “verge”) – but G is eliminated.  

Case B: I at 4 → _ _ R I E  
   Word shape: ? ? R I E  
   Need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining set.

   Real words:  
   - C U R I E → “curie” – valid (unit of radioactivity)  
   - H U R I E → invalid  
   - B U R I E → invalid  
   - V U R I E → invalid  
   - C H R I E → invalid  
   - K U R I E → invalid  
   - W U R I E → invalid  
   - Y U R I E → invalid  

   “CURIE” is the only recognized word.

   Check letters: C and U are still allowed.  
   - R is at 3 (✓), I at 4, E at 5.  
   - C and U not yet eliminated.

Therefore “CURIE” satisfies every constraint.

<guess>CURIE</guess>",CURIE,"Let’s extract every constraint now:

1. E is at position 5 (✓).  
2. R is at position 3 (✓) – from DIRGE feedback R(✓).  
3. I is in the word but NOT at positions 1, 3 (from DIRGE I(-) at 2).  
   Therefore I must be at position 2 or 4.  
4. Letters eliminated so far:  
   A, O, S, T, N, F, L, M, P, D, G.  
   Remaining common consonants: C, H, K, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.
