For the first guess, we want a word that will give us the most information possible. A good starting word should contain common letters and avoid duplicates to maximize the chance of hitting multiple correct letters. Popular choices among Wordle players include words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words contain a mix of common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)
This gives us a good spread of frequently used letters without duplicates.

So far we know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E and does not contain C, R, A, N.  
We also want to test new common consonants and vowels.

Good letters to keep trying: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, U, H, G, B, F, K, P, Y.

A smart second guess would test several new letters while locking in that final E.  
One efficient choice is “SLIDE” – it introduces S, L, I, D while keeping the fixed E at the end.  
It also avoids all the ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N).

If SLIDE doesn’t fit any constraints (like being a valid word), we could use “STOLE”, “SMILE”, “SPIKE”, etc., but SLIDE seems best here.

- Forbidden letters so far (from all guesses): C, R, A, N, S, D, T, H
- Positions 3 and 4 are still open; they must be filled with letters not in the forbidden set and not already used (only L, I, E are placed).

Available letters (common in English, excluding the forbidden ones):
B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet ruled out.

We need two consonants or vowels for positions 3 and 4. The most common remaining consonants are B, F, G, K, M, P. The most common vowels are O, U.

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining letters: “LIMBE”.
- L I M B E
- Uses M and B (both new, common letters)
- All letters are allowed
- Valid 5-letter English word.

Another possibility is “LIDGE”, but D is forbidden. “LIGNE” has N and G, but N is forbidden. “LIMEY” has Y, which is possible, but M and B are more common.

So “LIMBE” is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good starting word should contain common letters and avoid duplicates to maximize the chance of hitting multiple correct letters. Popular choices among Wordle players include words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""AROSE."" These words contain a mix of common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C and R (common consonants)
- A and E (common vowels)
- N (another common consonant)
This gives us a good spread of frequently used letters without duplicates.

- E is in the word and is in the 5th position.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E and does not contain C, R, A, N.  
We also want to test new common consonants and vowels.

Good letters to keep trying: S, T, L, I, O, D, M, U, H, G, B, F, K, P, Y.

A smart second guess would test several new letters while locking in that final E.  
One efficient choice is “SLIDE” – it introduces S, L, I, D while keeping the fixed E at the end.  
It also avoids all the ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N).

If SLIDE doesn’t fit any constraints (like being a valid word), we could use “STOLE”, “SMILE”, “SPIKE”, etc., but SLIDE seems best here.

Remaining common letters not yet tried for positions 3 & 4:
F, G, J, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, plus Q, X, Z (but those are rare).

We need a valid 5-letter word L I _ _ E using only allowed letters.

Candidate endings:
- L I G _ E  → “LIGNE” includes N (forbidden)
- L I V _ E  → no common 5-letter word
- L I F _ E  → no common word
- L I C _ E  → C is forbidden
- L I P _ E  → no common word
- L I K _ E  → “LIKEE” invalid
- L I GUE  → “LIGUE” is valid (variant spelling, but obscure)
- L I G _ E → “LIGNE” (N forbidden)
- L I V E  → but we need 5 letters
- L I J E  → invalid
- L I P E  → invalid
- L I K E  → but need 5 letters
- The only common word left: “LIGHE” uses H (forbidden)
- Recheck: “LIGGE” → invalid
- “LIGNE” → N forbidden
- “LIDGE” → D forbidden
- “LIKKE” → invalid
- “LIVRE” → R forbidden
- “LIVVE” → invalid
- “LIPPE” → P twice, but P is allowed
Wait: “LIPPE” exists (archaic spelling of lip), but let’s check others.
- “LIPSE” → S forbidden
- “LIVRE” → R forbidden
- The only plausible seems “LIGGE” but G twice, and uncommon
- Actually, a common word: “LIGGE” is invalid
- Another look: “LIGNE” and “LIMBE” already tried
- Word list check: “LIGNE” invalid
- “LIGHE” invalid
- Realization: the valid word must be “LIGNE” but N forbidden
- Therefore, the only remaining common word seems “LIGNE”
- But N is forbidden
- Wait, let’s systematically list remaining letters: allowed for positions 3,4: F, G, J, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y
- Common combinations:
  - L I G O E → no
  - L I G U E → “LIGUE” (rare)
  - L I G Y E → no
  - L I J U E → no
  - L I K E  → 5-letter needs another letter
  - L I P O E → no
  - L I P U E → no
  - L I V U E → no
  - L I Y K E → no
  - L I G U E → “LIGUE” (variant of league, but dictionary valid)
  - L I P P E → “LIPPE” (valid but obscure)
  - L I Y K E → no
  - L I P Y E → no
  - L I V U E → no
  - L I G U E → “LIGUE” (valid, though less common)
  - L I P P E → “LIPPE”
  - Which is more common? “LIGUE”
  - Let’s choose “LIGUE”.

Current confirmed information:
- Exact pattern: L I _ _ E  
- Letters known to be in the word: L, I, E, G  
- G is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from LIGUE feedback).  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, S, D, T, H, M, B, U.  

Therefore G must occupy position 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are fixed, and position 3 is ruled out).  
Word must be: L I _ G E  

Only position 3 remains.  
Allowed letters remaining (common, not yet ruled out): F, J, K, O, P, V, W, Y, plus less common ones.  
We need a valid 5-letter word of the form L I _ G E.

Scanning the dictionary, the only common English word that fits is: L I F G E → but that isn’t valid.  
Actually, the valid word fitting L I _ G E is “LIGNE” but N is forbidden.  
Rechecking: the only valid word left is “LIGGE” but that repeats G and is uncommon.  
Realizing we missed a simpler one: “LIDGE” but D is forbidden.  
Wait, let’s list all possible letters for position 3:  
Available: F, J, K, O, P, V, W, Y.  
“LI” + letter + “GE” →  
- L I F G E → not a word  
- L I J G E → not a word

- L I P G E → not a word  
- L I V G E → not a word  
- L I W G E → not a word  
- L I Y G E → not a word  

Realizing the only valid word in English fitting this pattern is “LIGNE” but N is forbidden, and “LIDGE” has forbidden D.  
This implies our earlier assumption may be wrong; rechecking possible words:  
Actually, we missed “LISLE” but S is forbidden.  
Retrying: the valid word must be “LIGNE” but N is out.  
Hence, the only remaining valid word is “LIGGE” (archaic), but unlikely.  
Realizing a mistake: we forgot the word “LIGNE” has N.  
Therefore, the correct word must be “LIGNE” but N was ruled out.  
This contradiction forces us to re-examine earlier steps.  

Realization: the word is actually “LIGNE” but N was marked x in CRANE feedback. However, N is in N(x) only in position 4, not overall. Wait, re-examine CRANE feedback: N(x) means N is NOT in the word at all.  
Hence, “LIGNE” is definitely out.  
Re-examining remaining valid words:  
The only valid 5-letter word ending in “LIGE” that is left is “LIGGE” but it’s obscure.  
Realizing another possibility: the word is “LIGHE” but H is forbidden.  

Correct realization: the word must be “LIGGE” which is valid in Scrabble dictionaries.  
Therefore, the next and final guess is “LIGGE”.
