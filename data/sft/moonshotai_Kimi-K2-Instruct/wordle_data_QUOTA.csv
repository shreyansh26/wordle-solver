For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information by covering common letters. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good choice is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum coverage
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so we'll quickly narrow down possibilities

So far we know:
1. The third letter is O.
2. The letters R, S, E are not in the word.
3. The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

A good next guess should:

Guess 3: COALT → C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)
- C, L are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already know it is in position 3, so this is consistent).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already knew it must be in position 4 or 5, so this is also consistent).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current facts:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3 (but position 3 is O), or 4 (if A is in 5) or 5 (if A is in 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, D, M, N, C, L
- Allowed letters include: A, O (already placed), plus B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and T.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4 or 5.
3. Includes T somewhere (but not position 5 if A is in position 5).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Let's construct possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4, then T could be in position 1 or 2 or 5.
- If A is in position 5, then T could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Common word candidates fitting these constraints:
- ""TOWAN"" – but W isn't tested yet and N is forbidden.
- ""BOAT_"" – but we need T somewhere, and A must be in 4/5.
- ""FOAT_"" – similar issue.
- ""GOATY"" – Y is allowed, but let's try to be more systematic.

A better approach is to try a word that places A in position 4 and T in position 1 or 2, using new common letters.

Let's try ""TOGA_"" – but G and T are allowed, O in 3, A in 4: ""TOGA_"" isn't 5 letters. 

Another candidate: ""BOAST"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""GLOAT"" – L is forbidden.

""HOAGY"" – H and Y are new, A in 4, O in 3: valid word.

But let's pick a more straightforward word that uses T and A in their possible positions with new letters.

Consider ""FOATY"":
- F, Y are new.
- O in position 3.
- A in position 4.
- T in position 5 – but feedback says T is not in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next: ""TOGA_"" – not 5 letters.

""GOATY"" – T is in position 4, A in 5. This fits:
- G, Y are new.
- O in position 3.
- A in position 5.
- T in position 4 (feedback says T is not in position 5, which is fine here).

Let me verify GOATY:
- G: new
- O: in position 3 (correct)
- A: in position 5 (allowed)
- T: in position 4 (not forbidden)
- Y: new

Thus, ""GOATY"" is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information by covering common letters. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good choice is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum coverage
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so we'll quickly narrow down possibilities

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- S(x) – S is not in the word
- E(x) – E is not in the word

So far we know:
1. The third letter is O.
2. The letters R, S, E are not in the word.
3. The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Avoid R, S, E.
- Use A in a different position (2, 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Letters we have not tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A candidate that satisfies these constraints is “ADMON”:
- A in position 2 (since it can’t be in 1)
- O in position 3
- Uses new letters D, M, N

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- O is in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in position 1.

Guess 2: ADMON → A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
- D, M, N are NOT in the word.
- O appears but is NOT in position 4 (it must be in position 3, which we already know).
- A is still in the word but is NOT in position 1 or 2.

So now:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, D, M, N
- A must appear in position 3, 4 or 5 (but position 3 is O), so A must be in position 4 or 5.
- We should test new common consonants and vowels we have not tried yet: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Place A in position 4 or 5 to test its placement.
- Introduce new high-frequency letters like T, L, C, or H.

Let’s choose “COALT”:
- C, L, T are new letters.
- A in position 4.
- O in position 3.
- This is a valid word and tests useful letters.

Another candidate: ""BOAST"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""GLOAT"" – L is forbidden.

""HOAGY"" – H and Y are new, A in 4, O in 3: valid word.

But let's pick a more straightforward word that uses T and A in their possible positions with new letters.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known to not be in positions 1 or 2, so now it must be in position 4 or 5).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

4. GOATY → G(x) O(-) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
   - G, Y are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

From this, we now have:
- The word pattern: _ _ O T _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, T
- Letters known to be absent: R, S, E, D, M, N, C, L, G, Y
- A must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are taken or excluded)
- Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 2 with letters not yet eliminated.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 (not in the forbidden list): B, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern: [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] O T A

Looking at common English words ending in ""OTA"":
- ""P O T A"" is 4 letters.
- ""IOTA"" is 4 letters.
- ""JOTA"" is valid (Spanish origin, but accepted in English Scrabble dictionaries).
- ""F O T A"" is not a word.
- ""V O T A"" is not a word.
- ""H O T A"" is not a word.

But we need 5 letters. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in ""OTA"":
- ""FLOTA"" – but L is forbidden.
- ""PILOT"" – but O is in position 3, T in 4, A in 5, so PILOT would be P I L O T – L is forbidden.
- ""BLOAT"" – L is forbidden.
- ""FLOAT"" – L is forbidden.
- ""GLOAT"" – G and L are forbidden.
- ""POTATO"" – too long.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ O T A, since:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: A (only remaining spot for A)

So we need a 5-letter word like ??OTA. Valid words fitting this:
- ""V I O T A"" – V is allowed, I is allowed. ""VIOTA"" is not a common English word.
- ""P I O T A"" – ""PIOTA"" is not a word.
- ""B I O T A"" – ""BIOTA"" is a valid word meaning the flora and fauna of a region.

""BIOTA"":
- B and I are allowed (not in forbidden list).
- Fits the pattern: B I O T A.

Let's check:
- B: new letter, allowed.
- I: new letter, allowed.
- O: in position 3 (correct).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- A: in position 5 (only possible spot).

""BIOTA"" is a valid English word.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - R, S, E are not in the word at all.
   - O is in the word and in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. ADMON → A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
   - D, M, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent with already knowing it is in position 3).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.

3. COALT → C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)
   - C, L are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be in position 3).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known to not be in positions 1 or 2, so now it must be in position 4 or 5).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

4. GOATY → G(x) O(-) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
   - G, Y are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

From this, we now have:

- A must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are taken or excluded)
- Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 2 with letters not yet eliminated.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 (not in the forbidden list): B, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern: [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] O T A

Looking at common English words ending in ""OTA"":

- ""JOTA"" is valid (Spanish origin, but accepted in English Scrabble dictionaries).
- ""F O T A"" is not a word.
- ""V O T A"" is not a word.
- ""H O T A"" is not a word.

But we need 5 letters. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in ""OTA"":
- ""FLOTA"" – but L is forbidden.
- ""PILOT"" – but O is in position 3, T in 4, A in 5, so PILOT would be P I L O T – L is forbidden.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,QUOTA,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information by covering common letters. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good choice is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum coverage
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so we'll quickly narrow down possibilities

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- S(x) – S is not in the word
- E(x) – E is not in the word

So far we know:
1. The third letter is O.
2. The letters R, S, E are not in the word.
3. The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Avoid R, S, E.
- Use A in a different position (2, 4 or 5).
- Introduce new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Letters we have not tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A candidate that satisfies these constraints is “ADMON”:
- A in position 2 (since it can’t be in 1)
- O in position 3
- Uses new letters D, M, N

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
- R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- O is in position 3.
- A is in the word but not in position 1.

Guess 2: ADMON → A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
- D, M, N are NOT in the word.
- O appears but is NOT in position 4 (it must be in position 3, which we already know).
- A is still in the word but is NOT in position 1 or 2.

So now:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, D, M, N
- A must appear in position 3, 4 or 5 (but position 3 is O), so A must be in position 4 or 5.
- We should test new common consonants and vowels we have not tried yet: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Place A in position 4 or 5 to test its placement.
- Introduce new high-frequency letters like T, L, C, or H.

Let’s choose “COALT”:
- C, L, T are new letters.
- A in position 4.
- O in position 3.
- This is a valid word and tests useful letters.

<guess>COALT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
Guess 3: COALT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updating our knowledge with the new feedback:

Guess 3: COALT → C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)
- C, L are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already know it is in position 3, so this is consistent).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (we already knew it must be in position 4 or 5, so this is also consistent).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current facts:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3 (but position 3 is O), or 4 (if A is in 5) or 5 (if A is in 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, D, M, N, C, L
- Allowed letters include: A, O (already placed), plus B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and T.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4 or 5.
3. Includes T somewhere (but not position 5 if A is in position 5).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Let's construct possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4, then T could be in position 1 or 2 or 5.
- If A is in position 5, then T could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Common word candidates fitting these constraints:
- ""TOWAN"" – but W isn't tested yet and N is forbidden.
- ""BOAT_"" – but we need T somewhere, and A must be in 4/5.
- ""FOAT_"" – similar issue.
- ""GOATY"" – Y is allowed, but let's try to be more systematic.

A better approach is to try a word that places A in position 4 and T in position 1 or 2, using new common letters.

Let's try ""TOGA_"" – but G and T are allowed, O in 3, A in 4: ""TOGA_"" isn't 5 letters. 

Another candidate: ""BOAST"" – but S is forbidden.

Next: ""GLOAT"" – L is forbidden.

""HOAGY"" – H and Y are new, A in 4, O in 3: valid word.

But let's pick a more straightforward word that uses T and A in their possible positions with new letters.

Consider ""FOATY"":
- F, Y are new.
- O in position 3.
- A in position 4.
- T in position 5 – but feedback says T is not in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next: ""TOGA_"" – not 5 letters.

""GOATY"" – T is in position 4, A in 5. This fits:
- G, Y are new.
- O in position 3.
- A in position 5.
- T in position 4 (feedback says T is not in position 5, which is fine here).

Let me verify GOATY:
- G: new
- O: in position 3 (correct)
- A: in position 5 (allowed)
- T: in position 4 (not forbidden)
- Y: new

Thus, ""GOATY"" is a valid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize everything we now know from the four guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - R, S, E are not in the word at all.
   - O is in the word and in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. ADMON → A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)
   - D, M, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent with already knowing it is in position 3).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.

3. COALT → C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)
   - C, L are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be in position 3).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known to not be in positions 1 or 2, so now it must be in position 4 or 5).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

4. GOATY → G(x) O(-) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
   - G, Y are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent).
   - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).

From this, we now have:
- The word pattern: _ _ O T _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, T
- Letters known to be absent: R, S, E, D, M, N, C, L, G, Y
- A must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are taken or excluded)
- Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 2 with letters not yet eliminated.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 (not in the forbidden list): B, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern: [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] [B,F,H,I,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z] O T A

Looking at common English words ending in ""OTA"":
- ""P O T A"" is 4 letters.
- ""IOTA"" is 4 letters.
- ""JOTA"" is valid (Spanish origin, but accepted in English Scrabble dictionaries).
- ""F O T A"" is not a word.
- ""V O T A"" is not a word.
- ""H O T A"" is not a word.

But we need 5 letters. Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending in ""OTA"":
- ""FLOTA"" – but L is forbidden.
- ""PILOT"" – but O is in position 3, T in 4, A in 5, so PILOT would be P I L O T – L is forbidden.
- ""BLOAT"" – L is forbidden.
- ""FLOAT"" – L is forbidden.
- ""GLOAT"" – G and L are forbidden.
- ""POTATO"" – too long.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ O T A, since:
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: A (only remaining spot for A)

So we need a 5-letter word like ??OTA. Valid words fitting this:
- ""V I O T A"" – V is allowed, I is allowed. ""VIOTA"" is not a common English word.
- ""P I O T A"" – ""PIOTA"" is not a word.
- ""B I O T A"" – ""BIOTA"" is a valid word meaning the flora and fauna of a region.

""BIOTA"":
- B and I are allowed (not in forbidden list).
- Fits the pattern: B I O T A.

Let's check:
- B: new letter, allowed.
- I: new letter, allowed.
- O: in position 3 (correct).
- T: in position 4 (correct).
- A: in position 5 (only possible spot).

This fits:\n- G, Y are new.\n- O in position 3.\n- A in position 5.\n- T in position 4 (feedback says T is not in position 5, which is fine here).\n\nLet me verify GOATY:\n- G: new\n- O: in position 3 (correct)\n- A: in position 5 (allowed)\n- T: in position 4 (not forbidden)\n- Y: new\n\nThus, ""GOATY"" is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>GOATY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADMON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) O(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: COALT -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) A(-) L(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: GOATY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(-) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let\'s summarize everything we now know from the four guesses:\n\n1.

- O is correctly placed in position 3.
- T is correctly placed in position 4.
- A is correctly placed in position 5.
- B and I are NOT in the word.

We now know the exact pattern: _ _ O T A

Letters already eliminated from appearing anywhere in the word:
R, S, E, D, M, N, C, L, G, Y, B, I

Remaining allowable consonants for positions 1 and 2 (from the full alphabet excluding the forbidden set):
F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in “OTA”. Common English words in that family include:

- “FLOTA” – L is forbidden.
- “PILOT” – L is forbidden, and it’s _ _ O T A, not _ _ _ O T.
- Directly matching _ _ O T A:
  – “FLOAT” – L is forbidden.
  – “GLOAT” – G and L are forbidden.
  – “VIOTA” – not valid.
  – “FOHOT” – not valid.
  – “JOKOT” – not valid.
  
Let’s list every valid consonant pair for the first two slots:

1st letter: F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
2nd letter: same set (no repeats required)

Real English 5-letter words ending in OTA:
- “PHOTA” – not valid.
- “KNOTA” – not valid.
- “VROTA” – not valid.
- “JOTTA” – two T’s, but T is already fixed in 4th spot.
- “QUOTA” – Q, U, O, T, A – fits!  
  – Q in position 1, U in position 2, O in 3, T in 4, A in 5.
  – Q and U have not been ruled out.
  – Word “QUOTA” exists and is common.

Therefore, QUOTA is the uniquely fitting valid word.
