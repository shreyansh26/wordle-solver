For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. 

Some strategic considerations for a strong opening word:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid rare letters (Q, X, Z, J)
4. Don't repeat letters to cover more ground

Popular strong opening words include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, etc. These all cover 5 unique common letters.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- S, L, T are very common consonants
- A, E are the two most common vowels
- No letter repeats
- It forms a valid common English word

From the feedback:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so T is the 4th letter
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Position 4: T
- A is somewhere in the word, but not in spot 3
- No S, L, or E

We also know the word does not contain: S, L, E

Common letters still worth testing: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, etc.

Since A is in the word, and not in spot 3, we want to try placing A in a different position while keeping T in position 4.

A good next guess would be a word that:
- Has T in position 4
- Includes A but not in position 3
- Avoids S, L, E
- Tests new common letters

Possible candidates: RATIO (but O is at the end), CARTY (invalid), PARTY (invalid), MARTY (invalid), HATCH (but H is repeated), MATCH, WATCH, NATCH, etc.

Let's try ""MATCH"":
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (not 3, so valid)

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S x, L x, A -, T ✓, E x):
- Position 4 must be T.
- The word contains A, but A cannot be in position 3.
- S, L, E are absent.

From Guess 2 (MATCH → M x, A -, T -, C x, H x):
- A is present but NOT in position 2 either.
- T is present but NOT in position 3 (contradicts nothing; we already know it is in position 4).
- M, C, H are absent.

- Letters eliminated: S, L, E, M, C, H

Still-allowed common consonants: R, N, D, P, B, G, F, K, Y
Still-allowed vowels: A (already known), plus I, O, U if needed.

We need a 5-letter word:
- that has T in position 4
- that contains A but not in positions 2 or 3
- that uses only letters NOT yet ruled out

Candidate positions for A: 1 or 5.

Let’s try placing A in position 1:

- D, O, P, T (T in position 4) – none of these have been eliminated.
- All letters still possible.

Therefore “ADOPT” is valid.

Pattern: A _ _ T _

Candidate letters for positions 2,3,5: common ones left are R, N, D, P, B, G, F, K, Y, I, O, U.

A good middle-of-the-road word that keeps letters diverse: “ADOPT”
- A (position 1)
- D, O, P, T (T in position 4) – none of these have been eliminated.
- All letters still possible.

Check elimination list: A, D, O, P, T – none of them were marked x in any feedback.

Therefore “ADOPT” is valid.

(Another option like “APART” would repeat T, which is fine, but “ADOPT” tests new consonants and a new vowel.)

Let’s extract everything we now know.

Positions fixed so far:
- Position 4 is T (from SLATE).

Letters definitively in the word:
- A (from SLATE and MATCH) and now we know A is in position 1 (because ADOPT gave A ✓).

Letters definitively NOT in the word:
S, L, E, M, C, H, D, O, P.

Letters still possible (unused so far and not ruled out):
Consonants: R N B G F K Y W V J Q X Z  
Vowels: I, U  

We need a pattern: A _ _ T _ with the three blanks coming only from the still-allowed letters.

Good next guess should:
1. satisfy A _ _ T _
2. use 3 new, common letters from the still-allowed set
3. be a valid English word

Commonest remaining letters: R, N, I, U, B, G, F, K, Y.

Looking for words:
- A R I T ? – “ARBIT” is not valid.
- A R N T ? – “ARN…” nothing common.
- A R I T ? – “AR…IT” – “ARBIT” invalid.
- A F R I T – “AFRIT” (demon) – obscure.
- A U R I T – “AURIT” – invalid.
- A N I T ? – “ANIT_” – maybe “ANITE”? no.

A valid, common word that fits A _ _ T _ and only uses still-allowed letters: “ARINT” – not a word.

Let’s try a simpler common word: “ARINT” is invalid. “ANGRY” – T is in wrong place.

Wait: only remaining valid common word that fits A _ _ T _ and uses allowed letters: “ANGRY” no T; we need T in 4.

Need a word of form A _ _ T _.

Look at remaining letters: R N I U B G F K Y.

Possible combinations:
- A R N T Y – “ARN TY” – no.
- A R I T ? – “ARIT_” – “ARITE” – E eliminated.
- A R U T ? – “ARUT…” – no.
- A N I T ? – “ANIT_” – “ANITA” – A repeats, T is 4th, but N and I are new.
- A N I T A – “ANITA” – repeats A, but A is already fixed once, so invalid (duplicate A).

Next common word: “AFRIT” – obscure.

Another: “ARGOT” – O is eliminated.

Keep scanning – only one that looks reasonable and common: “ARINT” invalid.

Finally, a valid English word: “ARINT” no.

Recheck – “AUNTY” – U N Y; but Y is allowed, U N unused yet.

A U N T Y – positions: A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5).

Letters: A (already known), U, N, T (known), Y – all not yet eliminated. And it’s a valid word.

Therefore, “AUNTY” is the best next guess.
