Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C, U, Y. 

A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s shown with ✓ but since it’s not in the correct spot, it must be somewhere else).

So far we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
- C, R, A are not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Contains E but not in the 5th position.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Common letters left to try: S, T, L, I, D, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- Ends with _ _ _ N _ (but 4th letter is N, so _ _ _ N _).
- Must have E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since it can’t be 5th).
- Avoid C, R, A.

Some candidates:
- BENDY (but Y is less common, and B is okay)
- MENED (but double E is unlikely)
- LINED (good letters: L, I, N, E, D)
- SINGE (but has G which is less common)

""LINED"" seems good:
- L, I, N, E, D – covers common new letters (L, I, D) and uses known N (correct position) and E (must be somewhere).
- No C, R, A.
- E is in position 4 here, but wait – N is in position 4 from feedback, so E must be in another position. In ""LINED"", N is 3rd, E is 4th – but N must be 4th. So this is invalid.

Oops, correction: N is 4th, so word must be _ _ _ N _. Then E must be in positions 1-3 or 5 (but E can't be 5th from feedback, since E is in wrong position in CRANE where it was 5th). So E must be 1-3.

Let’s try ""SNEEK"":
- S, N, E, E, K – but double E is odd and K is less common.

""SNIDE"":
- S, N, I, D, E – N is 2nd here, but must be 4th. Invalid.

  - N is 4th (correct).
  - E is in word but not 5th (here it’s 3rd, so valid).

Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all (from any x’s):
   C, R, A, B, L, D

2. Positional facts:
   - N is in position 4 (✓ in both guesses)
   - E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (guess 1 had E in 5th spot and it was marked -, meaning “wrong position”).  
   - Therefore E must appear exactly once, and it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already N, so E can only be in 1, 2, or 3.

3. We still need to test 3 more unknown slots with letters that have not been ruled out.  
   The set of letters still possible (that haven’t been marked x) are:   
   E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known N and E.

4. We want to pick a word that:
   - Has N in position 4.
   - Has E somewhere in positions 1–3.
   - Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, B, L, D).
   - Introduces as many fresh common letters as possible to gain information quickly.

Candidate letters worth testing next: S, T, I, K, M, O, U, G, H.

Some quick checks:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ N _  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ N _  
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E N _

Let’s pick a word that satisfies all constraints and tests several new letters.

Example: ""SHEEN""
- S, H, E, E, N — but has two E’s, and we only know there is one E in the word. That’s invalid.

Try ""TENGE"":
- T, E, N, G, E — again double E, invalid.

Try ""WOKEN"":
- W, O, K, E, N — N is in 4th, E is in 4th too? No, here E is 4th and N is 5th. Invalid.

We need N in 4th and E in 1-3.

""VENUE"":
- V, E, N, U, E — E in 2nd and 5th: invalid (double E and N is 3rd).

""HENGE"":
- H, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (must be 4th), E appears twice: invalid.

""SHEEN"" style fails; let's be systematic.

Word must be: [allowed][allowed][allowed]N[allowed]  
E must appear once in the first three slots.

Let’s build a valid word.

Try ""HINGE"": H I N G E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HINGN"" — not a word.

""GINGN"" — no.

""INKEN"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEES"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""NEVER"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""VENIN"" — N is 3rd and 5th (invalid).

""SENGI"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENIE"" — N is 4th, E is 3rd — this fits:
- G, E, N, I, E — but double E again? No, only one E in ""GENIE"": wait, positions: G(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), E(5). N is 3rd here (must be 4th) — invalid.

""WENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters W, E, N, N, Y — double N, but N is allowed only once? No rule against multiple N’s, but unlikely.

""FENNY"" — F, E, N, N, Y — double N.

We need a word with N at 4th, E at 1-3, and no B, L, D, C, R, A.

Real word: ""PENNE"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd and 5th — double E invalid.

""VENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENGE"" — same.

""TINGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEEL"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""GENRE"" — R is invalid.

""ENTRY"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""UNEVE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""EVENN"" — not valid.

""FENCE"" — C invalid.

""NEEDS"" — N is 1st (invalid), D invalid.

""TENGE"" — already saw double E.

""WENCH"" — C invalid.

""HENNA"" — A invalid.

""SENSE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""VENUE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENOS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""SENGI"" — same.

""TENGE"" — same.

""WENGE"" — W, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""YENTE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""PENGO"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENAF"" — A invalid.

""GENIP"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""INKED"" — D invalid.

""MENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""FENGS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENTS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENCE"" — C invalid.

""JENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters J, E, N, N, Y. Double N allowed, but we test J, E, N, Y.

""JENNY"" fits all constraints:
- N is 4th.
- E is 2nd (allowed position).
- No C, R, A, B, L, D used.
- Tests J, E, N, N, Y — gives info on J, Y.

So ""JENNY"" is a valid next guess.

<guess>JENNY</guess>
</think>

<guess>JENNY</guess>",JENNY,"Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all (from any x’s):
   C, R, A, B, L, D

2. Positional facts:
   - N is in position 4 (✓ in both guesses)
   - E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (guess 1 had E in 5th spot and it was marked -, meaning “wrong position”).  
   - Therefore E must appear exactly once, and it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already N, so E can only be in 1, 2, or 3.

3. We still need to test 3 more unknown slots with letters that have not been ruled out.  
   The set of letters still possible (that haven’t been marked x) are:   
   E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known N and E.

4. We want to pick a word that:
   - Has N in position 4.
   - Has E somewhere in positions 1–3.
   - Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, B, L, D).
   - Introduces as many fresh common letters as possible to gain information quickly.

Candidate letters worth testing next: S, T, I, K, M, O, U, G, H.

Some quick checks:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ N _  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ N _  
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E N _

Let’s pick a word that satisfies all constraints and tests several new letters.

Example: ""SHEEN""
- S, H, E, E, N — but has two E’s, and we only know there is one E in the word. That’s invalid.

Try ""TENGE"":
- T, E, N, G, E — again double E, invalid.

Try ""WOKEN"":
- W, O, K, E, N — N is in 4th, E is in 4th too? No, here E is 4th and N is 5th. Invalid.

We need N in 4th and E in 1-3.

""VENUE"":
- V, E, N, U, E — E in 2nd and 5th: invalid (double E and N is 3rd).

""HENGE"":
- H, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (must be 4th), E appears twice: invalid.

""SHEEN"" style fails; let's be systematic.

Word must be: [allowed][allowed][allowed]N[allowed]  
E must appear once in the first three slots.

Let’s build a valid word.

Try ""HINGE"": H I N G E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HINGN"" — not a word.

""GINGN"" — no.

""INKEN"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEES"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""NEVER"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""VENIN"" — N is 3rd and 5th (invalid).

""SENGI"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENIE"" — N is 4th, E is 3rd — this fits:
- G, E, N, I, E — but double E again? No, only one E in ""GENIE"": wait, positions: G(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), E(5). N is 3rd here (must be 4th) — invalid.

""WENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters W, E, N, N, Y — double N, but N is allowed only once? No rule against multiple N’s, but unlikely.

""FENNY"" — F, E, N, N, Y — double N.

We need a word with N at 4th, E at 1-3, and no B, L, D, C, R, A.

Real word: ""PENNE"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd and 5th — double E invalid.

""VENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENGE"" — same.

""TINGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEEL"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""GENRE"" — R is invalid.

""ENTRY"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""UNEVE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""ENEMY"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""EVENN"" — not valid.

""FENCE"" — C invalid.

""NEEDS"" — N is 1st (invalid), D invalid.

""TENGE"" — already saw double E.

""WENCH"" — C invalid.

""HENNA"" — A invalid.

""SENSE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""VENUE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENOS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""SENGI"" — same.

""TENGE"" — same.

""WENGE"" — W, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""YENTE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""PENGO"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENAF"" — A invalid.

""GENIP"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""INKED"" — D invalid.

""MENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""FENGS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENTS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENCE"" — C invalid.

""JENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters J, E, N, N, Y. Double N allowed, but we test J, E, N, Y.

""JENNY"" fits all constraints:
- N is 4th.
- E is 2nd (allowed position).
- No C, R, A, B, L, D used.
- Tests J, E, N, N, Y — gives info on J, Y.

So ""JENNY"" is a valid next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,WHINE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C, U, Y. 

A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s shown with ✓ but since it’s not in the correct spot, it must be somewhere else).

So far we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
- C, R, A are not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Contains E but not in the 5th position.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Common letters left to try: S, T, L, I, D, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- Ends with _ _ _ N _ (but 4th letter is N, so _ _ _ N _).
- Must have E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since it can’t be 5th).
- Avoid C, R, A.

Some candidates:
- BENDY (but Y is less common, and B is okay)
- MENED (but double E is unlikely)
- LINED (good letters: L, I, N, E, D)
- SINGE (but has G which is less common)

""LINED"" seems good:
- L, I, N, E, D – covers common new letters (L, I, D) and uses known N (correct position) and E (must be somewhere).
- No C, R, A.
- E is in position 4 here, but wait – N is in position 4 from feedback, so E must be in another position. In ""LINED"", N is 3rd, E is 4th – but N must be 4th. So this is invalid.

Oops, correction: N is 4th, so word must be _ _ _ N _. Then E must be in positions 1-3 or 5 (but E can't be 5th from feedback, since E is in wrong position in CRANE where it was 5th). So E must be 1-3.

Let’s try ""SNEEK"":
- S, N, E, E, K – but double E is odd and K is less common.

""SNIDE"":
- S, N, I, D, E – N is 2nd here, but must be 4th. Invalid.

""BLEND"":
- B, L, E, N, D – N is 4th, E is 3rd. This fits:
  - N is 4th (correct).
  - E is in word but not 5th (here it’s 3rd, so valid).
  - No C, R, A.

""BLEND"" seems like a good next guess.

Let’s update our constraints with the new feedback from Guess 3.

Known facts so far:
1. Position 4 is N (✓ in every guess).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, B, L, D, J, Y.
3. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from Guess 2 and 3, E was marked with “-” in both places).
   Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
4. The word must be of the form [E or other][ ][E or other][N][ ] with E appearing exactly once (positions 1 or 3).

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
E, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 4.
- Has E exactly once, in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s list some possibilities:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Word pattern: E _ _ N _  
Need letters for positions 2, 3, 5 from the allowed set.

Candidate: ENING (not a word)  
EONIC (not)  
EVING (not)  
EGGING (double G, too long)  
ERING (R is banned)  
EHING (not)  
EMING (not)  
EIKON (O before N, not matching _ _ _ N _ pattern)  
EIKEN (E in 1 and 5, invalid)  

Nothing obvious.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
Word pattern: _ _ E N _  

Now pick letters from remaining set {F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Z} for positions 1, 2, 5.

Some candidate words:
- WOKEN – W, O, K, E, N → but O is ok, K ok, W ok; N is 5th (must be 4th) – no.
- TWEEN – T, W, E, E, N – double E – no.
- SWINE – S, W, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – but E cannot be 5th (from Guess 1 CRANE).  
- SPINE – S, P, I, N, E – again E in 5th – invalid.
- SHEEN – S, H, E, E, N – double E and E in 4th is N – invalid.
- SKEIN – S, K, E, I, N – N is 5th – invalid.
- STONE – S, T, O, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.
- SKENE – K, E, N, E, S – invalid.
- SHINE – S, H, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.

We need E in 3rd, N in 4th, and a valid remaining letter for 1st and 2nd and 5th.

Let’s think of words fitting  _ _ E N _ :

- “EVEN” – too short.
- “SEVEN” – S, E, V, E, N – E appears twice – invalid.
- “NIVEN” – N is 1st (invalid), I, V, E, N – N must be 4th – invalid.
- “GIANT” – A banned.
- “TEMEN” – T, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “FEMEN” – F, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMEN” – H, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMIN” – N is 5th – invalid.
- “TENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.
- “GENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.

Another systematic approach: use common remaining consonants S, T, K, G, H, M, P.

Let’s pick S, T, G, H, I, K, M.

Try ""THING"":
- T, H, I, N, G – N is 4th, but pattern needs _ _ E N _ – no E.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

“THING” missing E.

Try ""STHEN"" – not a word.

""STHEN"" invalid.

""STENG"" – invalid.

""STENE"" – double E.

""STUNG"" – U ok, G ok, but no E.

""STINK"" – I, K ok, but no E.

""STING"" – same.

""SWUNG"" – no E.

""SWINE"" – E in 5th invalid.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

Valid word: “SKEEN” – but double E.

“SKENE” – double E.

“SMELT” – N missing.

“SPENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – but E must be 3rd here – invalid.

“STENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – invalid.

“SWEPT” – N missing.

“SWEET” – N missing.

“TWEEN” – double E.

“VEXED” – X ok, E in 3rd, N missing.

Wait, let’s use a word list filter.

From a dictionary, words matching _ _ E N _ and letter constraints:
- “GREEN” – R banned.
- “CREEN” – C, R banned.
- “TWEEN” – double E.
- “SKEEN” – double E.
- “SPENT” – E in 2nd.
- “SWEPT” – N missing.
- “SKENE” – double E.
- “SMELT” – N missing.
- “STENT” – E in 2nd.
- “THENS” – not word, E in 3rd, but plural THENS is invalid.
- “WHENS” – plural, invalid.
- “THEN” – too short.
- “WHEN” – too short.
- “PHENE” – P, H, E, N, E – double E – invalid.

Actually, a proper word: “SPHEN” – but not common.

Another: “THEGN” – G ok, but T, H, E, G, N – N is 5th – invalid.

“THINE” – I ok, T, H, I, N, E – E is 5th – invalid.

“THREE” – R banned.

“SHENT” – S, H, E, N, T – N is 4th, E is 3rd, letters S, H, E, N, T – all allowed so far.

“SHENT” – is a valid English word (past tense of shend), albeit obscure.

We can use “SHENT”.

But let’s verify:
- Positions: S, H, E, N, T.
- N is 4th – ✓.
- E is 3rd – allowed (not 2nd or 5th).
- Letters used: S, H, E, N, T – none are banned yet.

So “SHENT” fits all rules.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,WHINE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C, U, Y. 

A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s shown with ✓ but since it’s not in the correct spot, it must be somewhere else).

So far we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
- C, R, A are not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Contains E but not in the 5th position.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Common letters left to try: S, T, L, I, D, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- Ends with _ _ _ N _ (but 4th letter is N, so _ _ _ N _).
- Must have E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since it can’t be 5th).
- Avoid C, R, A.

Some candidates:
- BENDY (but Y is less common, and B is okay)
- MENED (but double E is unlikely)
- LINED (good letters: L, I, N, E, D)
- SINGE (but has G which is less common)

""LINED"" seems good:
- L, I, N, E, D – covers common new letters (L, I, D) and uses known N (correct position) and E (must be somewhere).
- No C, R, A.
- E is in position 4 here, but wait – N is in position 4 from feedback, so E must be in another position. In ""LINED"", N is 3rd, E is 4th – but N must be 4th. So this is invalid.

Oops, correction: N is 4th, so word must be _ _ _ N _. Then E must be in positions 1-3 or 5 (but E can't be 5th from feedback, since E is in wrong position in CRANE where it was 5th). So E must be 1-3.

Let’s try ""SNEEK"":
- S, N, E, E, K – but double E is odd and K is less common.

""SNIDE"":
- S, N, I, D, E – N is 2nd here, but must be 4th. Invalid.

""BLEND"":
- B, L, E, N, D – N is 4th, E is 3rd. This fits:
  - N is 4th (correct).
  - E is in word but not 5th (here it’s 3rd, so valid).
  - No C, R, A.

""BLEND"" seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) E(-) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all (from any x’s):
   C, R, A, B, L, D

2. Positional facts:
   - N is in position 4 (✓ in both guesses)
   - E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (guess 1 had E in 5th spot and it was marked -, meaning “wrong position”).  
   - Therefore E must appear exactly once, and it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already N, so E can only be in 1, 2, or 3.

3. We still need to test 3 more unknown slots with letters that have not been ruled out.  
   The set of letters still possible (that haven’t been marked x) are:   
   E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known N and E.

4. We want to pick a word that:
   - Has N in position 4.
   - Has E somewhere in positions 1–3.
   - Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, B, L, D).
   - Introduces as many fresh common letters as possible to gain information quickly.

Candidate letters worth testing next: S, T, I, K, M, O, U, G, H.

Some quick checks:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ N _  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ N _  
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E N _

Let’s pick a word that satisfies all constraints and tests several new letters.

Example: ""SHEEN""
- S, H, E, E, N — but has two E’s, and we only know there is one E in the word. That’s invalid.

Try ""TENGE"":
- T, E, N, G, E — again double E, invalid.

Try ""WOKEN"":
- W, O, K, E, N — N is in 4th, E is in 4th too? No, here E is 4th and N is 5th. Invalid.

We need N in 4th and E in 1-3.

""VENUE"":
- V, E, N, U, E — E in 2nd and 5th: invalid (double E and N is 3rd).

""HENGE"":
- H, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (must be 4th), E appears twice: invalid.

""SHEEN"" style fails; let's be systematic.

Word must be: [allowed][allowed][allowed]N[allowed]  
E must appear once in the first three slots.

Let’s build a valid word.

Try ""HINGE"": H I N G E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HINGN"" — not a word.

""GINGN"" — no.

""INKEN"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEES"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""NEVER"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""VENIN"" — N is 3rd and 5th (invalid).

""SENGI"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENIE"" — N is 4th, E is 3rd — this fits:
- G, E, N, I, E — but double E again? No, only one E in ""GENIE"": wait, positions: G(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), E(5). N is 3rd here (must be 4th) — invalid.

""WENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters W, E, N, N, Y — double N, but N is allowed only once? No rule against multiple N’s, but unlikely.

""FENNY"" — F, E, N, N, Y — double N.

We need a word with N at 4th, E at 1-3, and no B, L, D, C, R, A.

Real word: ""PENNE"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd and 5th — double E invalid.

""VENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENGE"" — same.

""TINGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEEL"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""GENRE"" — R is invalid.

""ENTRY"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""UNEVE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""ENEMY"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""EVENN"" — not valid.

""FENCE"" — C invalid.

""NEEDS"" — N is 1st (invalid), D invalid.

""TENGE"" — already saw double E.

""WENCH"" — C invalid.

""HENNA"" — A invalid.

""SENSE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""VENUE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENOS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""SENGI"" — same.

""TENGE"" — same.

""WENGE"" — W, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""YENTE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""PENGO"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENAF"" — A invalid.

""GENIP"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""INKED"" — D invalid.

""MENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""FENGS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENTS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENCE"" — C invalid.

""JENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters J, E, N, N, Y. Double N allowed, but we test J, E, N, Y.

""JENNY"" fits all constraints:
- N is 4th.
- E is 2nd (allowed position).
- No C, R, A, B, L, D used.
- Tests J, E, N, N, Y — gives info on J, Y.

So ""JENNY"" is a valid next guess.

3. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from Guess 2 and 3, E was marked with “-” in both places).
   Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
4. The word must be of the form [E or other][ ][E or other][N][ ] with E appearing exactly once (positions 1 or 3).

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
E, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:

EGGING (double G, too long)  
ERING (R is banned)  
EHING (not)  
EMING (not)  
EIKON (O before N, not matching _ _ _ N _ pattern)  
EIKEN (E in 1 and 5, invalid)  

Nothing obvious.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
Word pattern: _ _ E N _  

Now pick letters from remaining set {F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Z} for positions 1, 2, 5.

Some candidate words:
- WOKEN – W, O, K, E, N → but O is ok, K ok, W ok; N is 5th (must be 4th) – no.
- TWEEN – T, W, E, E, N – double E – no.
- SWINE – S, W, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – but E cannot be 5th (from Guess 1 CRANE).  
- SPINE – S, P, I, N, E – again E in 5th – invalid.
- SHEEN – S, H, E, E, N – double E and E in 4th is N – invalid.
- SKEIN – S, K, E, I, N – N is 5th – invalid.
- STONE – S, T, O, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.
- SKENE – K, E, N, E, S – invalid.
- SHINE – S, H, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.

We need E in 3rd, N in 4th, and a valid remaining letter for 1st and 2nd and 5th.

Let’s think of words fitting  _ _ E N _ :

- “EVEN” – too short.
- “SEVEN” – S, E, V, E, N – E appears twice – invalid.
- “NIVEN” – N is 1st (invalid), I, V, E, N – N must be 4th – invalid.
- “GIANT” – A banned.
- “TEMEN” – T, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “FEMEN” – F, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMEN” – H, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMIN” – N is 5th – invalid.
- “TENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.
- “GENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.

Another systematic approach: use common remaining consonants S, T, K, G, H, M, P.

Let’s pick S, T, G, H, I, K, M.

Try ""THING"":
- T, H, I, N, G – N is 4th, but pattern needs _ _ E N _ – no E.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

“THING” missing E.

Try ""STHEN"" – not a word.

""STHEN"" invalid.

""STENG"" – invalid.

""STENE"" – double E.

""STUNG"" – U ok, G ok, but no E.

""STINK"" – I, K ok, but no E.

""STING"" – same.

""SWUNG"" – no E.

""SWINE"" – E in 5th invalid.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

Valid word: “SKEEN” – but double E.

“SKENE” – double E.

“SMELT” – N missing.

“SPENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – but E must be 3rd here – invalid.

“STENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – invalid.

“SWEPT” – N missing.

“SWEET” – N missing.

“TWEEN” – double E.

“VEXED” – X ok, E in 3rd, N missing.

Wait, let’s use a word list filter.

From a dictionary, words matching _ _ E N _ and letter constraints:
- “GREEN” – R banned.
- “CREEN” – C, R banned.
- “TWEEN” – double E.
- “SKEEN” – double E.
- “SPENT” – E in 2nd.
- “SWEPT” – N missing.
- “SKENE” – double E.
- “SMELT” – N missing.
- “STENT” – E in 2nd.
- “THENS” – not word, E in 3rd, but plural THENS is invalid.
- “WHENS” – plural, invalid.
- “THEN” – too short.
- “WHEN” – too short.
- “PHENE” – P, H, E, N, E – double E – invalid.

Actually, a proper word: “SPHEN” – but not common.

Another: “THEGN” – G ok, but T, H, E, G, N – N is 5th – invalid.

“THINE” – I ok, T, H, I, N, E – E is 5th – invalid.

“THREE” – R banned.

“SHENT” – S, H, E, N, T – N is 4th, E is 3rd, letters S, H, E, N, T – all allowed so far.

“SHENT” – is a valid English word (past tense of shend), albeit obscure.

We can use “SHENT”.

But let’s verify:
- Positions: S, H, E, N, T.
- N is 4th – ✓.
- E is 3rd – allowed (not 2nd or 5th).
- Letters used: S, H, E, N, T – none are banned yet.

So “SHENT” fits all rules.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s shown with ✓ but since it’s not in the correct spot, it must be somewhere else).

So far we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
- C, R, A are not in the word.

We need a new word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Contains E but not in the 5th position.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Common letters left to try: S, T, L, I, D, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s think of words that fit:
- Ends with _ _ _ N _ (but 4th letter is N, so _ _ _ N _).
- Must have E somewhere in positions 1-4 (since it can’t be 5th).
- Avoid C, R, A.

Some candidates:
- BENDY (but Y is less common, and B is okay)
- MENED (but double E is unlikely)
- LINED (good letters: L, I, N, E, D)
- SINGE (but has G which is less common)

""LINED"" seems good:
- L, I, N, E, D – covers common new letters (L, I, D) and uses known N (correct position) and E (must be somewhere).
- No C, R, A.
- E is in position 4 here, but wait – N is in position 4 from feedback, so E must be in another position. In ""LINED"", N is 3rd, E is 4th – but N must be 4th. So this is invalid.

Oops, correction: N is 4th, so word must be _ _ _ N _. Then E must be in positions 1-3 or 5 (but E can't be 5th from feedback, since E is in wrong position in CRANE where it was 5th). So E must be 1-3.

Let’s try ""SNEEK"":
- S, N, E, E, K – but double E is odd and K is less common.

""SNIDE"":
- S, N, I, D, E – N is 2nd here, but must be 4th. Invalid.

""BLEND"":
- B, L, E, N, D – N is 4th, E is 3rd. This fits:
  - N is 4th (correct).
  - E is in word but not 5th (here it’s 3rd, so valid).
  - No C, R, A.

""BLEND"" seems like a good next guess.

<guess>BLEND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) E(-) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

1. Letters we know are NOT in the word at all (from any x’s):
   C, R, A, B, L, D

2. Positional facts:
   - N is in position 4 (✓ in both guesses)
   - E is in the word, but NOT in position 5 (guess 1 had E in 5th spot and it was marked -, meaning “wrong position”).  
   - Therefore E must appear exactly once, and it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 4 is already N, so E can only be in 1, 2, or 3.

3. We still need to test 3 more unknown slots with letters that have not been ruled out.  
   The set of letters still possible (that haven’t been marked x) are:   
   E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known N and E.

4. We want to pick a word that:
   - Has N in position 4.
   - Has E somewhere in positions 1–3.
   - Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, A, B, L, D).
   - Introduces as many fresh common letters as possible to gain information quickly.

Candidate letters worth testing next: S, T, I, K, M, O, U, G, H.

Some quick checks:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ N _  
- If E is in position 2: _ E _ N _  
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E N _

Let’s pick a word that satisfies all constraints and tests several new letters.

Example: ""SHEEN""
- S, H, E, E, N — but has two E’s, and we only know there is one E in the word. That’s invalid.

Try ""TENGE"":
- T, E, N, G, E — again double E, invalid.

Try ""WOKEN"":
- W, O, K, E, N — N is in 4th, E is in 4th too? No, here E is 4th and N is 5th. Invalid.

We need N in 4th and E in 1-3.

""VENUE"":
- V, E, N, U, E — E in 2nd and 5th: invalid (double E and N is 3rd).

""HENGE"":
- H, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (must be 4th), E appears twice: invalid.

""SHEEN"" style fails; let's be systematic.

Word must be: [allowed][allowed][allowed]N[allowed]  
E must appear once in the first three slots.

Let’s build a valid word.

Try ""HINGE"": H I N G E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HINGN"" — not a word.

""GINGN"" — no.

""INKEN"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEES"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""NEVER"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""VENIN"" — N is 3rd and 5th (invalid).

""SENGI"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENIE"" — N is 4th, E is 3rd — this fits:
- G, E, N, I, E — but double E again? No, only one E in ""GENIE"": wait, positions: G(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), E(5). N is 3rd here (must be 4th) — invalid.

""WENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters W, E, N, N, Y — double N, but N is allowed only once? No rule against multiple N’s, but unlikely.

""FENNY"" — F, E, N, N, Y — double N.

We need a word with N at 4th, E at 1-3, and no B, L, D, C, R, A.

Real word: ""PENNE"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd and 5th — double E invalid.

""VENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENGE"" — same.

""TINGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KNEEL"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""GENRE"" — R is invalid.

""ENTRY"" — N is 1st (invalid).

""UNEVE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""ENEMY"" — N is 2nd (invalid).

""EVENN"" — not valid.

""FENCE"" — C invalid.

""NEEDS"" — N is 1st (invalid), D invalid.

""TENGE"" — already saw double E.

""WENCH"" — C invalid.

""HENNA"" — A invalid.

""SENSE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""VENUE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENOS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""SENGI"" — same.

""TENGE"" — same.

""WENGE"" — W, E, N, G, E — N is 3rd (invalid).

""YENTE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""PENGO"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""KENAF"" — A invalid.

""GENIP"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""INKED"" — D invalid.

""MENGE"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""FENGS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""GENTS"" — N is 3rd (invalid).

""HENCE"" — C invalid.

""JENNY"" — N is 4th, E is 2nd — letters J, E, N, N, Y. Double N allowed, but we test J, E, N, Y.

""JENNY"" fits all constraints:
- N is 4th.
- E is 2nd (allowed position).
- No C, R, A, B, L, D used.
- Tests J, E, N, N, Y — gives info on J, Y.

So ""JENNY"" is a valid next guess.

<guess>JENNY</guess>

<guess>JENNY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: BLEND -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) E(-) N(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: JENNY -> FEEDBACK: J(x) E(-) N(-) N(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update our constraints with the new feedback from Guess 3.

Known facts so far:
1. Position 4 is N (✓ in every guess).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, B, L, D, J, Y.
3. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from Guess 2 and 3, E was marked with “-” in both places).
   Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
4. The word must be of the form [E or other][ ][E or other][N][ ] with E appearing exactly once (positions 1 or 3).

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
E, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 4.
- Has E exactly once, in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s list some possibilities:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Word pattern: E _ _ N _  
Need letters for positions 2, 3, 5 from the allowed set.

Candidate: ENING (not a word)  
EONIC (not)  
EVING (not)  
EGGING (double G, too long)  
ERING (R is banned)  
EHING (not)  
EMING (not)  
EIKON (O before N, not matching _ _ _ N _ pattern)  
EIKEN (E in 1 and 5, invalid)  

Nothing obvious.  

Case 2: E in position 3  
Word pattern: _ _ E N _  

Now pick letters from remaining set {F,G,H,I,K,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Z} for positions 1, 2, 5.

Some candidate words:
- WOKEN – W, O, K, E, N → but O is ok, K ok, W ok; N is 5th (must be 4th) – no.
- TWEEN – T, W, E, E, N – double E – no.
- SWINE – S, W, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – but E cannot be 5th (from Guess 1 CRANE).  
- SPINE – S, P, I, N, E – again E in 5th – invalid.
- SHEEN – S, H, E, E, N – double E and E in 4th is N – invalid.
- SKEIN – S, K, E, I, N – N is 5th – invalid.
- STONE – S, T, O, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.
- SKENE – K, E, N, E, S – invalid.
- SHINE – S, H, I, N, E – N is 4th ok, E is 5th – invalid.

We need E in 3rd, N in 4th, and a valid remaining letter for 1st and 2nd and 5th.

Let’s think of words fitting  _ _ E N _ :

- “EVEN” – too short.
- “SEVEN” – S, E, V, E, N – E appears twice – invalid.
- “NIVEN” – N is 1st (invalid), I, V, E, N – N must be 4th – invalid.
- “GIANT” – A banned.
- “TEMEN” – T, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “FEMEN” – F, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMEN” – H, E, M, E, N – double E – invalid.
- “HEMIN” – N is 5th – invalid.
- “TENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.
- “GENET” – N is 3rd – invalid.

Another systematic approach: use common remaining consonants S, T, K, G, H, M, P.

Let’s pick S, T, G, H, I, K, M.

Try ""THING"":
- T, H, I, N, G – N is 4th, but pattern needs _ _ E N _ – no E.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

“THING” missing E.

Try ""STHEN"" – not a word.

""STHEN"" invalid.

""STENG"" – invalid.

""STENE"" – double E.

""STUNG"" – U ok, G ok, but no E.

""STINK"" – I, K ok, but no E.

""STING"" – same.

""SWUNG"" – no E.

""SWINE"" – E in 5th invalid.

We need _ _ E N _ with E in 3rd.

Valid word: “SKEEN” – but double E.

“SKENE” – double E.

“SMELT” – N missing.

“SPENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – but E must be 3rd here – invalid.

“STENT” – N is 4th, E is 2nd – invalid.

“SWEPT” – N missing.

“SWEET” – N missing.

“TWEEN” – double E.

“VEXED” – X ok, E in 3rd, N missing.

Wait, let’s use a word list filter.

From a dictionary, words matching _ _ E N _ and letter constraints:
- “GREEN” – R banned.
- “CREEN” – C, R banned.
- “TWEEN” – double E.
- “SKEEN” – double E.
- “SPENT” – E in 2nd.
- “SWEPT” – N missing.
- “SKENE” – double E.
- “SMELT” – N missing.
- “STENT” – E in 2nd.
- “THENS” – not word, E in 3rd, but plural THENS is invalid.
- “WHENS” – plural, invalid.
- “THEN” – too short.
- “WHEN” – too short.
- “PHENE” – P, H, E, N, E – double E – invalid.

Actually, a proper word: “SPHEN” – but not common.

Another: “THEGN” – G ok, but T, H, E, G, N – N is 5th – invalid.

“THINE” – I ok, T, H, I, N, E – E is 5th – invalid.

“THREE” – R banned.

“SHENT” – S, H, E, N, T – N is 4th, E is 3rd, letters S, H, E, N, T – all allowed so far.

“SHENT” – is a valid English word (past tense of shend), albeit obscure.

We can use “SHENT”.

But let’s verify:
- Positions: S, H, E, N, T.
- N is 4th – ✓.
- E is 3rd – allowed (not 2nd or 5th).
- Letters used: S, H, E, N, T – none are banned yet.

So “SHENT” fits all rules.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Updated constraints after Guess 4 (SHENT):

1. Position 4 = N (✓ confirmed every time).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   C, R, A, B, L, D, J, Y, S, T.
3. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - H – it is in the correct position (position 2).
   - E – it is in the word but *not* yet in the correct position (from every “-” mark).  
     E cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5, and from CRANE it cannot be 5th either.  
     Combining those, E must be in position 1.
4. Therefore we already know two fixed letters:  
   Position 1 = E, Position 2 = H, Position 4 = N.  
   Pattern so far: E H _ N _

5. Letters still available (not ruled out):  
   F, G, I, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
6. We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with distinct allowed letters.

So the word must be E H _ N _ with two new letters from the allowed set.

From Guess 5 (EHINK):

- E(-): E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- H(✓): H is in position 2.  
- I(✓): I is in position 3.  
- N(✓): N is in position 4 (already known).  
- K(x): K is NOT in the word.

So we now have:

1. Letters definitely in the word and their positions:  
   H in 2, I in 3, N in 4.

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   C, R, A, B, L, D, J, Y, S, T, K.

3. Letter E must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from all feedback).  
   The only remaining slot is position 5, but E is marked as “-” when it appeared in position 5 in CRANE.  
   However, CRANE’s E was in position 5 and marked “✓” (correct letter, correct position) — wait, no:  
   Looking back at Guess 1 (CRANE):  
   N(✓) and E(✓) — the symbols are ✓ meaning correct position.  
   So E was marked ✓ in position 5 — meaning E is indeed in position 5.

   Therefore E must be in position 5.

Thus the word is fixed as:  
_ H I N E

We just need the first letter, which must be from the still-allowed letters:  
F, G, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

A common 5-letter word matching this pattern is “WHINE”.
