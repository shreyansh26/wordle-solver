For the first guess when we have no prior information, it's strategically best to choose a word with common letters that can help us identify as many possible letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good first word should:
1. Use 5 different common letters
2. Avoid repeating letters
3. Have common letter positions (like E at the end)

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE - uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE - uses C, R, A, N, E
- STARE - uses S, T, A, R, E

I'm going to choose ""SLATE"" as it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives us good coverage of frequent consonants and vowels.

Feedback from SLATE:
- First letters: S (x) → S is not in the word

- Third letters: A (-) → A is in the word but not in position 3
- Fourth letters: T (x) → T is not in the word

- Has L, A, E somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 5)

Possible plan: Try to place L, A, E in new positions while testing other common letters. Good candidates might be words like:
- LEARN (but uses N which is good)
- ALLEY (but repeats L)
- LEAVE (but repeats E)
- LABEL (but repeats L and L is in position 2 which we know is wrong)

A good choice is ""ALERT"":
- Has A, L, E in new positions (1,2,4 vs 3,2,5)
- Adds R which is very common
- No S or T

Summary of what we now know:
1. Letters in the word: L, A, E, N
2. Letter positions so far:
   - L is in position 1 (✓)
   - E is NOT in position 2
   - A is NOT in position 3
   - N is in position 5 (✓)
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, R
4. Pattern so far: L _ _ _ N

We need to place A and E in the remaining three slots (positions 2, 3, 4) but:
- A cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 2

Possible valid distributions:
- E can go in positions 3 or 4
- A can go in positions 2 or 4 (but 4 might be taken by E)

We also need one more letter (the word is 5 letters and we only have L, A, E, N). A good strategy is to test another common consonant not yet ruled out. Remaining common consonants: C, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let’s try to keep A and E in valid positions while introducing a new common letter.

One candidate: L E A N ? – but we already have N at 5 and E can’t be at 2 (it would be in 2 here), so this is invalid.

Another: L A E N ? – invalid because A can’t be at 3 if we place it at 2, but we need 5 letters and have only 4 known letters.

Actually we have 4 known letters (L, A, E, N) and need to arrange them with one new letter in the pattern L _ _ _ N.

Valid placements:
- L _ _ _ N with A and E in positions 2,3,4 or 2,4,3 etc., but respecting constraints.

Let’s list possible combinations:
1. L E A _ N – but A is at 3 which is invalid (A is - in position 3 from SLATE)
2. L A E _ N – same issue, E would need to be at 3 but A is at 2 (valid), but we have only 4 letters
Wait, we have 4 letters and need to include one more. So the word must be L [A or E] [A or E or new letter] [new letter or A or E] N.

But we have only L, A, E, N, and need one more letter. The new letter must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try L E _ A N – but E is - in position 2 (from LEARN), so position 2 can’t be E.
Wait, no: from LEARN, E was in position 2 and got (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 2. So E can be in 3 or 4.

Similarly, A was in position 3 in LEARN and got (-), so A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in 2 or 4.

So possible arrangements:
- L A E _ N – but we need one more letter, and we only have A, E left to place, but we’ve used both.
Wait, no, the word must use L, A, E, N plus one more letter.

The pattern is L _ _ _ N with A and E in positions 2,3,4, plus one new letter.

Possible:
- L A E _ N – but we only have 4 letters and need 5.
This is confusing – let me rephrase: the word contains L, A, E, N (with L at 1 and N at 5), and one more letter from the remaining common letters.

So the word is L [A or E or new] [A or E or new] [A or E or new] N, with constraints:
- A not at 3
- E not at 2

Possible candidates:
- L E A D N – but N is already at 5, and D is new
- L A M E N – but N is at 5
- L E A V N – V is less common
- L A C E N – C is common
- L E A P N – P is okay
- L A G E N – G is okay
- L E A K N – K is okay

Among these, ""LACEN"" is not a word, but ""LACEN"" is invalid. Real word: ""LACEN"" doesn’t exist. 

Real words to try:
- L E A D N – no
- L A D E N – A at 2, E at 3 (but A can’t be at 3, and E can be at 3), plus D is new
- L E G A N – but N must be at 5, so L E G A N is 5 letters, E at 2 (invalid), A at 4 (valid), G at 3, N at 5. But E can’t be at 2.

""L A D E N"":
- Positions: L(1) A(2) D(3) E(4) N(5)
- Check constraints:
   - A is at 2 (allowed, since only restricted to not be at 3)
   - E is at 4 (allowed, since restricted to not be at 2 or 5)
   - D is new letter (good)
This seems valid.

Real words to try:
- L E A D N – no
- L A D E N – A at 2, E at 3 (but A can’t be at 3, and E can be at 3), plus D is new
- L E G A N – but N must be at 5, so L E G A N is 5 letters, E at 2 (invalid), A at 4 (valid), G at 3, N at 5. But E can’t be at 2.

""L A D E N"":
- Positions: L(1) A(2) D(3) E(4) N(5)
- Check constraints:
   - A is at 2 (allowed, since only restricted to not be at 3)
   - E is at 4 (allowed, since restricted to not be at 2 or 5)
   - D is new letter (good)
This seems valid.
