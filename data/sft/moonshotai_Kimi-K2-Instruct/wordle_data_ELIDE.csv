For the first guess, we want a word that provides maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters, including vowels and consonants, to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains 3 vowels and common consonants)
- ""SLATE"" (common letters and good consonant mix)
- ""CRANE"" (common letters)
- ""AUDIO"" (many vowels)
- ""RAISE"" (common letters)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify letters in the word quickly.

From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word ends with E. We need four new unique letters that haven't been tried yet. We should focus on consonants and vowels we haven't used. Letters not tried yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

A good second guess would be something like ""UNTIE"" or ""LINED"", but we need to ensure we use entirely new letters. ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - all new except E which we know is correct. This gives us 4 new letters to test while keeping E in position.

Another strong option is ""LINED"" (L, I, N, E, D), but ""UNTIE"" tests U and I which are common vowels we haven't tried. I'll go with ""UNTIE"" for broader vowel coverage.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ELIDE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that provides maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters, including vowels and consonants, to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- ""AROSE"" (contains 3 vowels and common consonants)
- ""SLATE"" (common letters and good consonant mix)
- ""CRANE"" (common letters)
- ""AUDIO"" (many vowels)
- ""RAISE"" (common letters)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify letters in the word quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the word ends with E. We need four new unique letters that haven't been tried yet. We should focus on consonants and vowels we haven't used. Letters not tried yet include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

A good second guess would be something like ""UNTIE"" or ""LINED"", but we need to ensure we use entirely new letters. ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - all new except E which we know is correct. This gives us 4 new letters to test while keeping E in position.

Another strong option is ""LINED"" (L, I, N, E, D), but ""UNTIE"" tests U and I which are common vowels we haven't tried. I'll go with ""UNTIE"" for broader vowel coverage.

Letters confirmed not present: A, R, O, S, U, N, T  
Letters confirmed present: E (position 5), I (somewhere else)

Remaining letters we can still use (excluding the x ones):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending with E and containing I in positions 1-4. Common consonants to test next: C, L, D, P, H, M.

A word like ""CHIDE"" fits all constraints:  
- Ends with E (✓)  
- Contains I (but not in position 4, so position 2 or 3)  
- Uses entirely new untested letters (C, H, D)  
- Good phonetic coverage for next elimination

Let's try ""CHIDE"".

We need a single letter for position 1 that is not yet used. Remaining unused letters: B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible first letters that form real words:

- W → WLIDE – not valid.
- X → XLIDE – not valid.
- Y → YLIDE – not a standard word.
- Z → ZLIDE – not valid.

Wait, let's double-check real English words ending in ""LIDE"" with a single letter prefix. The actual word is likely:
- SLIDE – but S is ruled out.
- GLIDE – but G is ruled out.
- BLIDE – not an English word.
- FLIDE – not an English word.
- PLIDE – not an English word.

However, there is a valid word: ""ELIDE"" – meaning to omit or suppress. Let's check:
- E for position 1: E was only confirmed in position 5, not ruled out elsewhere.
- So ""ELIDE"" fits: E in position 1, L in 2, I in 3, D in 4, E in 5.

Let's verify: E is allowed in position 1 since it was only confirmed in position 5. This seems correct.

Therefore, the only remaining valid word is ""ELIDE"".
