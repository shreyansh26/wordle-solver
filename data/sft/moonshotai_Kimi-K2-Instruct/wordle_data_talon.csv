For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities at once. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- All five most common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the two prior guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word: A (but not in position 1) and O (but not in position 3).
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, U, D, I.

So the secret word must contain A and O in some arrangement, with A not in slot 1 and O not in slot 3.

Other letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: T, L, N, C, G, B, M, P, H, Y, K…

The simplest way to proceed is to pick a word that places A and O in two different, still-possible slots while introducing several new consonants.  

Candidate words: A and O must appear once each, so we need arrangements like:
- A _ O _ _  (but O can’t be in slot 3—here it’s in slot 3, so this form is invalid)
- A _ _ O _
- A _ _ _ O
- _ A O _ _  (O in slot 3 → invalid)
- _ A _ O _
- _ A _ _ O
- _ _ A O _
- _ _ A _ O
- _ _ _ A O

Looking at these valid patterns, we can pick one that introduces new letters quickly. A simple pattern is _ A _ _ O.

A common word matching that pattern is “MAJOR”. Let me verify:
- M, J, R have not been tested yet (R is eliminated, so scratch MAJOR).
  
Next pattern: _ A _ O _  
“CABOT” – B and T are new letters, C and T are new. But E is eliminated, so no obvious conflict, but let’s check simpler.

T A _ _ _ : “TANGO” – G, N, T fresh, A second position, O fifth position (valid). No eliminated letters.

“TANGO” looks good.

- Contains: T, A, N, G, O
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- No R, S, E, U, D, I present
- Introduces T, N, G which are new.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to test multiple possibilities at once. \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:\n- All five most common vowels (A, O, E)\n- Two common consonants (R, S)\nThis gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the first guess feedback:\n\n- A(-): A is in the word but in a different position than position 1.\n- R(x): R is not in the word at all.\n- O(-): O is in the word but in a different position than position 3.\n- S(x): S is not in the word at all.\n- E(x): E is not in the word at all.\n\nWhat we now know:\n1.

Current information:

Letters known so far:
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (-)
- Eliminated letters: R, S, E, U, D, I, G

So the pattern is:
T A _ _ _  
with remaining letters to place: N, O, plus any untested consonants.

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 or 5, so it must be in position 4.
- N cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 5.

This forces the word to be:
T A _ O N  
with the blank being a new consonant we haven’t tried yet.

Possible consonants not yet tested: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting T A _ O N:
- TACON (but C was not eliminated, though not tested yet)
- TAPON (P not eliminated)
- TALON (L not eliminated)

TALON is a valid word using L, which hasn’t been tested. Let’s go with TALON.
