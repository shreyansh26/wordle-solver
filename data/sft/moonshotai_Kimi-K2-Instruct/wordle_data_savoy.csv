For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good distribution of letters to check against the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S and contains an A somewhere in positions 2-5.  
It cannot use L, T, or E.  
Good next letters to test: common consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P and remaining vowels O, I, U.  
A strong candidate is “SNARE” but it repeats E which we already know is excluded.  
A better word is “SNARL” but L is excluded.

Instead, choose “SACRO” but that’s 5 letters only.  
Actually, “SCRAN” is 5 letters but N is not strongly indicated yet.  
A balanced choice is “SPARE” – but E is excluded.  
Re-evaluate: must include A not in 3rd spot, and avoid L/T/E.  
Good word: “SPORT” but T is excluded.  
Another: “SWARM” uses W and R, both useful, and places A in 4th spot.  
Let me select “SWARD” – but D is less common.  
Instead, “SCARF” uses C, R, F while placing A in 3rd spot; however A cannot be in 3rd spot according to feedback (it was in 3rd spot and marked -).  
Thus A must be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th spot.  
Try “SACRA” – invalid double A placement.  
Best compromise: “SNARK” – uses N, R, K and places A in 3rd spot, but again A was in 3rd before and marked -, so A cannot be 3rd.  
Next: “SABER” – but E is excluded.  
Let’s choose “SARAN” – uses R, N and places A in 2nd spot.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. S is locked in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. A is locked in position 2 (✓ in guesses 2 and 3).
3. The word contains at least one more A, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in Guess 3 the final A was marked “-”; in Guess 2 the 4th-letter A was also marked “-”).  
   Therefore the extra A must be in position 3.
4. So the pattern so far is S A A _ _.
5. Letters ruled out so far: L, T, E, R, N, M, B.
6. Remaining consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet excluded.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts SAA and ends with two new consonants.  
Possible words: “SAAGH” (not common), “SAADH” (variant), “SAAGS” (plural), “SAAGY”, none standard.  
“SAAGS” is plural and not ideal.  
A clear, common word would be “SAAGY” but Y is vowel-like.

Actually, the only everyday English word that fits S A A _ _ is “SAAGS” (plural of saag), but dictionaries list it. Another option is “SAADH” (Indian musical note), but that’s obscure.  
“SAAGY” is not standard.

Rechecking: are we certain about the exact placement of the extra A?  
Yes – positions 4 & 5 have already been ruled out for the second A (marked “-” both times). So the second A must sit in position 3.

Hence the word must look like S A A _ _.  
Standard English lexicon gives “SAAGS” (plural of saag), “SAABs” (brand plural, but B already ruled out), none else.  
Therefore we must conclude the word is “SAAGS”, which is recognized by major dictionaries (e.g., Collins, OED).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,savoy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good distribution of letters to check against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S and contains an A somewhere in positions 2-5.  
It cannot use L, T, or E.  
Good next letters to test: common consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P and remaining vowels O, I, U.  
A strong candidate is “SNARE” but it repeats E which we already know is excluded.  
A better word is “SNARL” but L is excluded.  
Next try: “SCRAM” – but M is not high-frequency and we still need to place A.  
Instead, choose “SACRO” but that’s 5 letters only.  
Actually, “SCRAN” is 5 letters but N is not strongly indicated yet.  
A balanced choice is “SPARE” – but E is excluded.  
Re-evaluate: must include A not in 3rd spot, and avoid L/T/E.  
Good word: “SPORT” but T is excluded.  
Another: “SWARM” uses W and R, both useful, and places A in 4th spot.  
Let me select “SWARD” – but D is less common.  
Instead, “SCARF” uses C, R, F while placing A in 3rd spot; however A cannot be in 3rd spot according to feedback (it was in 3rd spot and marked -).  
Thus A must be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th spot.  
Try “SACRA” – invalid double A placement.  
Best compromise: “SNARK” – uses N, R, K and places A in 3rd spot, but again A was in 3rd before and marked -, so A cannot be 3rd.  
Next: “SABER” – but E is excluded.  
Let’s choose “SARAN” – uses R, N and places A in 2nd spot.  
Final candidate: “SARAN” is valid and tests new letters R and N while moving A to 2nd spot.

From the new feedback on SAAGS:

- S A _ _ _ is still locked (positions 1 and 2 ✓).
- The third letter A was marked (-) – so A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Therefore the extra A must be in position 4 or 5, and we have already seen it cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2) or 5 (Guess 3).  
  So there is **no valid position left** for the second A.  
That leaves only one possibility: **the word contains exactly one A**, located at position 2.  
All the “(-)” symbols we interpreted as “another A” were in fact telling us that those positions are **not A**, not that another A exists.  
Thus the word is S A _ _ _ with **no second A**.

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G.  
We still need to test consonants like C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

A simple, common word pattern is S A _ _ _ using remaining consonants.  
Good candidate: “SACKS” – but K and S are new; K wasn’t tested yet, and S is already fixed at start.  
Actually let’s pick a word that uses two new consonants and keeps the pattern.

A strong choice is “SAPPY” – but Y is vowel-like.  
Another: “SADDY” – but D+D and Y.  
“SANDY” – N is already ruled out.

Let’s list possible endings with remaining consonants:  
- S A C _ _ → “SACCO” (invalid), “SACHS” (proper noun)  
- S A D _ _ → “SADLY” (Y), “SADDO” (slang)  
- S A C K _ → “SACKS”  
“SACKS” is common and tests K and S at the end.

Therefore guess SACKS.

<guess>SACKS</guess>",SACKS,"From the new feedback on SAAGS:

- S A _ _ _ is still locked (positions 1 and 2 ✓).
- The third letter A was marked (-) – so A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Therefore the extra A must be in position 4 or 5, and we have already seen it cannot be in position 4 (Guess 2) or 5 (Guess 3).  
  So there is **no valid position left** for the second A.  
That leaves only one possibility: **the word contains exactly one A**, located at position 2.  
All the “(-)” symbols we interpreted as “another A” were in fact telling us that those positions are **not A**, not that another A exists.  
Thus the word is S A _ _ _ with **no second A**.

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G.  
We still need to test consonants like C, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y.

A simple, common word pattern is S A _ _ _ using remaining consonants.  
Good candidate: “SACKS” – but K and S are new; K wasn’t tested yet, and S is already fixed at start.  
Actually let’s pick a word that uses two new consonants and keeps the pattern.

A strong choice is “SAPPY” – but Y is vowel-like.  
Another: “SADDY” – but D+D and Y.  
“SANDY” – N is already ruled out.

Let’s list possible endings with remaining consonants:  
- S A C _ _ → “SACCO” (invalid), “SACHS” (proper noun)  
- S A D _ _ → “SADLY” (Y), “SADDO” (slang)  
- S A C K _ → “SACKS”  
“SACKS” is common and tests K and S at the end.

Therefore guess SACKS.",Guess 5: SACKS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x) S(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,savoy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common vowels and consonants to maximize the amount of information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good distribution of letters to check against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S and contains an A somewhere in positions 2-5.  
It cannot use L, T, or E.  
Good next letters to test: common consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P and remaining vowels O, I, U.  
A strong candidate is “SNARE” but it repeats E which we already know is excluded.  
A better word is “SNARL” but L is excluded.  
Next try: “SCRAM” – but M is not high-frequency and we still need to place A.  
Instead, choose “SACRO” but that’s 5 letters only.  
Actually, “SCRAN” is 5 letters but N is not strongly indicated yet.  
A balanced choice is “SPARE” – but E is excluded.  
Re-evaluate: must include A not in 3rd spot, and avoid L/T/E.  
Good word: “SPORT” but T is excluded.  
Another: “SWARM” uses W and R, both useful, and places A in 4th spot.  
Let me select “SWARD” – but D is less common.  
Instead, “SCARF” uses C, R, F while placing A in 3rd spot; however A cannot be in 3rd spot according to feedback (it was in 3rd spot and marked -).  
Thus A must be in 2nd, 4th, or 5th spot.  
Try “SACRA” – invalid double A placement.  
Best compromise: “SNARK” – uses N, R, K and places A in 3rd spot, but again A was in 3rd before and marked -, so A cannot be 3rd.  
Next: “SABER” – but E is excluded.  
Let’s choose “SARAN” – uses R, N and places A in 2nd spot.  
Final candidate: “SARAN” is valid and tests new letters R and N while moving A to 2nd spot.

<guess>SARAN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SARAN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>1. S is locked in at position 1 (✓ both times).
2. A is at position 2 and marked ✓ (correct) this time, so A is fixed in position 2.
3. The second A in SARAN was marked (-), telling us there is another A in the word but not in position 4.
4. R and N are not in the word at all (x).
5. Letters we have ruled out so far: L, T, E, R, N.
6. So the word pattern is now:  
   S A _ _ _  
   and must contain one more A somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
7. Common consonants still available: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
8. Good next choice is a word that keeps S A _ _ _, places the second A in position 4 or 5, and tests new consonants.

A balanced candidate is S A C K A – but “SACKA” is not a valid English word.
Try “SABRA” – ruled out R.
“SAGA_” – need a fifth letter. “SAGAS” is a word but repeats S.
“SALAD” – L is ruled out.
“SAMBA” – M and B are new; A in position 4. This seems solid.

Let’s go with SAMBA.

<guess>SAMBA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SARAN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x)
Guess 3: SAMBA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) M(x) B(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. S is locked in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. A is locked in position 2 (✓ in guesses 2 and 3).
3. The word contains at least one more A, but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in Guess 3 the final A was marked “-”; in Guess 2 the 4th-letter A was also marked “-”).  
   Therefore the extra A must be in position 3.
4. So the pattern so far is S A A _ _.
5. Letters ruled out so far: L, T, E, R, N, M, B.
6. Remaining consonants to test: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet excluded.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts SAA and ends with two new consonants.  
Possible words: “SAAGH” (not common), “SAADH” (variant), “SAAGS” (plural), “SAAGY”, none standard.  
“SAAGS” is plural and not ideal.  
A clear, common word would be “SAAGY” but Y is vowel-like.

Actually, the only everyday English word that fits S A A _ _ is “SAAGS” (plural of saag), but dictionaries list it. Another option is “SAADH” (Indian musical note), but that’s obscure.  
“SAAGY” is not standard.

Rechecking: are we certain about the exact placement of the extra A?  
Yes – positions 4 & 5 have already been ruled out for the second A (marked “-” both times). So the second A must sit in position 3.

Hence the word must look like S A A _ _.  
Standard English lexicon gives “SAAGS” (plural of saag), “SAABs” (brand plural, but B already ruled out), none else.  
Therefore we must conclude the word is “SAAGS”, which is recognized by major dictionaries (e.g., Collins, OED).

Let’s test it.

Let’s update the constraints with the latest feedback.

Current locked letters:
- Position 1: S (✓ every time)
- Position 2: A (✓ every time)

Word so far: S A _ _ _

Letters ruled out entirely (x at least once):
L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G, C, K

Letters still allowed: D, F, H, P, V, W, Y plus vowels I, O, U (A is already in position 2).

From Guess 5 the final S was marked (-), meaning the word contains an S but NOT in position 5.  
Since position 1 is already S (✓), the remaining S must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Therefore the pattern must be:
S A _ S _   or   S A _ _ S   (but the 5th-letter S is ruled out),  
so it must be S A _ S _.

Thus the word is S A _ S _ and the blank letter cannot be any of L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G, C, K.

Looking at the remaining consonants: D, F, H, P, V, W, Y.

Common English 5-letter words fitting S A _ S _:
- S A D S _  → “SADSY” (not valid)
- S A F S _  → “SAFES” (uses F)
- S A H S _  → “SAHSA” (invalid)
- S A P S _  → “SAP SE” (invalid)
- S A D S _  → “SADSA” (invalid)

Actually “SAFES” is a valid plural noun and uses the remaining consonant F.

Let’s confirm letters:
- S ✓ A ✓ F (not ruled out) E (ruled out) S (- position 5) → the E in SAFES is invalid.

Oops, E is already out.  
Next candidate: “SASSY” – but double S already fixed at positions 1 and 4, and Y is allowed.  
However, “SASSY” is valid and uses only allowed letters.

Another: “SAPID” – but D is allowed, P allowed, but doesn’t fit S A _ S _.

Let’s list again with correct pattern S A _ S _ and only allowed letters:

- S A D S _  → needs a fifth letter, but we have only 5 positions and last must be S.
Actually the pattern is S A (letter) S (letter).  
So positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining consonants.

Valid words:
- S A D D S – invalid.
- S A F E S – E excluded.
- S A H O S – O allowed, H allowed → “SAHOS” is not common.
- S A P P S – P allowed, but double P not helpful.
- S A P O S – O allowed, P allowed, S already placed → “SAPOS” not valid.
- S A P S _ – must be 5 letters, so S A P S _ is impossible (needs another letter).

Wait, let’s list real dictionary words with pattern S A ? S ?

- “SAD S” – impossible.
- “SAGS” – G ruled out.
- “SAPUS” – not common.
- “SARDS” – R ruled out.
- “SATIS” – T ruled out.
- “SAVES” – E ruled out.
- “SAXES” – X not yet used, E ruled out.
- “SAYST” – T ruled out.

Actually the only remaining common word is “SASH” (but it’s 4 letters) or “SASSY”.

“SASSY” fits: S A S S Y.
- S ✓ A ✓ S (-) S (-) Y (new letter, not yet excluded).
Letters: S, A, S, S, Y – all allowed so far.

Let’s verify:
- S in 1 ✓, A in 2 ✓.
- Third letter S is allowed (only position 5 S is marked - in Guess 5, no info on position 3).
- Fourth letter S is new placement.
- Y hasn’t been excluded.

Thus “SASSY” is a valid candidate.

Another possibility: “SASIN” – but N is ruled out.

Therefore the best remaining guess is SASSY.
</think>

<guess>SASSY</guess>",SASSY,"Let’s update the constraints with the latest feedback.

Current locked letters:
- Position 1: S (✓ every time)
- Position 2: A (✓ every time)

Word so far: S A _ _ _

Letters ruled out entirely (x at least once):
L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G, C, K

Letters still allowed: D, F, H, P, V, W, Y plus vowels I, O, U (A is already in position 2).

From Guess 5 the final S was marked (-), meaning the word contains an S but NOT in position 5.  
Since position 1 is already S (✓), the remaining S must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Therefore the pattern must be:
S A _ S _   or   S A _ _ S   (but the 5th-letter S is ruled out),  
so it must be S A _ S _.

Thus the word is S A _ S _ and the blank letter cannot be any of L, T, E, R, N, M, B, G, C, K.

Looking at the remaining consonants: D, F, H, P, V, W, Y.

Common English 5-letter words fitting S A _ S _:
- S A D S _  → “SADSY” (not valid)
- S A F S _  → “SAFES” (uses F)
- S A H S _  → “SAHSA” (invalid)
- S A P S _  → “SAP SE” (invalid)
- S A D S _  → “SADSA” (invalid)

Actually “SAFES” is a valid plural noun and uses the remaining consonant F.

Let’s confirm letters:
- S ✓ A ✓ F (not ruled out) E (ruled out) S (- position 5) → the E in SAFES is invalid.

Oops, E is already out.  
Next candidate: “SASSY” – but double S already fixed at positions 1 and 4, and Y is allowed.  
However, “SASSY” is valid and uses only allowed letters.

Another: “SAPID” – but D is allowed, P allowed, but doesn’t fit S A _ S _.

Let’s list again with correct pattern S A _ S _ and only allowed letters:

- S A D S _  → needs a fifth letter, but we have only 5 positions and last must be S.
Actually the pattern is S A (letter) S (letter).  
So positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining consonants.

Valid words:
- S A D D S – invalid.
- S A F E S – E excluded.
- S A H O S – O allowed, H allowed → “SAHOS” is not common.
- S A P P S – P allowed, but double P not helpful.
- S A P O S – O allowed, P allowed, S already placed → “SAPOS” not valid.
- S A P S _ – must be 5 letters, so S A P S _ is impossible (needs another letter).

Wait, let’s list real dictionary words with pattern S A ? S ?

- “SAD S” – impossible.
- “SAGS” – G ruled out.
- “SAPUS” – not common.
- “SARDS” – R ruled out.
- “SATIS” – T ruled out.
- “SAVES” – E ruled out.
- “SAXES” – X not yet used, E ruled out.
- “SAYST” – T ruled out.

Actually the only remaining common word is “SASH” (but it’s 4 letters) or “SASSY”.

“SASSY” fits: S A S S Y.
- S ✓ A ✓ S (-) S (-) Y (new letter, not yet excluded).
Letters: S, A, S, S, Y – all allowed so far.

Let’s verify:
- S in 1 ✓, A in 2 ✓.
- Third letter S is allowed (only position 5 S is marked - in Guess 5, no info on position 3).
- Fourth letter S is new placement.
- Y hasn’t been excluded.

Thus “SASSY” is a valid candidate.

Another possibility: “SASIN” – but N is ruled out.

Therefore the best remaining guess is SASSY.",Guess 6: SASSY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) S(-) S(-) Y(✓),FAIL
