- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Summary of both rounds:

Letters still in play: A, O, S (each must appear once in the word, but not in any of their previous positions).

Letters ruled out: R, E, C, T.

Positions ruled out so far  
- A: cannot be 1st (from AROSE) or 3rd (from COAST)  
- O: cannot be 3rd (from AROSE) or 2nd (from COAST)  
- S: cannot be 4th (from AROSE) or 5th (from COAST)

We need a word that contains A, O, S once each, no R/E/C/T, and none of the forbidden positions above.

Valid positions for each letter:
A: 2, 4, 5  
O: 1, 4, 5  
S: 1, 2, 3  

Let’s try to place A, O, S while filling the remaining two slots with other, still-legal letters (common choices: D, L, N, M, P, etc.).

One workable arrangement is  
S  A  L  O  N  → SALON  
Checks:
- Contains S, A, O each once.  
- No R, E, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – S is in 1st (allowed)  
  – A is in 2nd (allowed)  
  – O is in 4th (allowed)  
  – L and N are new filler letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Hence SALON is a good next candidate.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word and their exact positions  
- S (position 1)  
- A (position 2)  
- O (position 4)

Letters known **not** to be in the word: R, E, C, T, L, N.

The secret pattern so far is:  
S A _ O _

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the ruled-out letters. The most common remaining consonants and vowels are: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words that fit S A _ O _ and use only allowed letters include:
- SADIO (but D and I are allowed)
- SAGOT (T is ruled out)
- SAMBO (B is allowed, but M is allowed)
- SAPOD (P and D are allowed)
- SAVOY (V and Y are allowed)

Let me check if any of these are valid English words. ""SAPOD"" is not a valid word. ""SAVOY"" is a valid word (a type of cabbage or the French region). ""SABOT"" is valid but T is ruled out. ""SAMBO"" is valid, but M and B are allowed. Let me try ""SAVOY"":
- SAVOY: S(1), A(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)
- Letters used: S, A, V, O, Y
- Ruled-out letters: R, E, C, T, L, N are not used.
- This seems valid.

Another possibility is ""SAPID"" (meaning flavorful), but D hasn't been tested yet. However ""SAVOY"" seems more common.

Let me go with ""SAVOY"".
