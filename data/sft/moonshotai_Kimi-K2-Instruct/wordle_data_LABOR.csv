For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. Some popular choices are words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""CRANE.""

Looking at these options:
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - covers many common letters
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - another strong option
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good consonant coverage
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - includes N which is very common

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good information about which vowels are present and their positions, plus test two high-frequency consonants.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in the first position (-).
- A is in the word and in the second position (✓).
- I, S, and E are not in the word at all (x).

So we know:
- The word has structure: _ A _ _ _
- It contains the letter R somewhere, but not at the first position.
- It does not contain I, S, or E.

Good letters to test next are common consonants that haven’t been tried yet, such as T, N, L, C, etc. I’ll pick a word that keeps A in the second position, tries R in a different spot, and brings in new common consonants.

A strong candidate is “PARTY”:
- P is a new consonant.
- A stays in position 2 (✓).
- R moves to position 3.
- T and Y are new consonants to test.

Current facts:
1. Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
2. R is present but not at position 1 or 3 (since R(-) in both guesses).
3. Letters already ruled out: I, S, E, P, T, Y.
4. R must appear at either position 4 or 5.

Possible remaining consonants to test: N, L, C, B, D, G, K, M, H, etc.
We still need three new consonants plus the known R, fitting the pattern _ A _ R _ or _ A _ _ R.

A good word should:
- Keep A in place.
- Place R at position 4 or 5.
- Introduce new common consonants.

Option 1: _ A _ R _ → ""BARRN"" (invalid double R).
Option 2: _ A _ _ R → ""MARRY"" (invalid, Y already excluded).
Option 3: _ A N R _ → Valid but uncommon.
Option 4: _ A L _ R → ""VALOR"" (O not yet tested, V uncommon).

Better: _ A N _ R → ""BANGR"" (invalid, G-R uncommon).
Try _ A N D R → ""CANDR"" (invalid).

Best common word: _ A N _ R → ""BANDR"" (invalid), ""MANDR"" (invalid).

Re-evaluate: R must be at 4 or 5.
Valid word: _ A _ _ R → ""MAJOR"" (J uncommon, O not tested).
Valid word: _ A _ _ R → ""FAVOR"" (F and V uncommon).
Valid word: _ A _ _ R → ""LABOR"" (L, B, O all untested and common).

""LABOR"":
- L at 1: new letter.
- A at 2: correct.
- B at 3: new letter.
- O at 4: new vowel.
- R at 5: satisfies R must be at 4 or 5 (here 5).

This tests L, B, O while keeping A and placing R at 5.
