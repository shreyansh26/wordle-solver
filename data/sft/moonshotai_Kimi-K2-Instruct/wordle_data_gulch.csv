For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. 

After considering the options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
- It includes common consonants (S, L, T) and common vowels (A, E).
- It avoids rare letters, increasing the likelihood of hitting at least some correct letters or positions.
- It has no repeating letters, which is efficient for gaining information.

Thus, I'll start with ""SLATE.""

- L (-) – IS in the word, but NOT in position 2.  
- A (x), T (x), E (x) – NOT in the word.

- L is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew) and also not in position 3.
- I, M, B are NOT in the word.

So far the secret word:
- Must include L.
- Must include C.
- Must NOT include S, A, T, E, I, M, B.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- C cannot be in position 1.

Letters still allowed: C, L, D, F, G, H, K, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y plus any other consonants/vowels not ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word using at least C and L, in positions allowed, while avoiding all excluded letters.

Good candidate: “CLOUD” – but O, U, D have not been ruled out, and C would be in position 1 (forbidden).

Next candidate: “ULCER” – contains C and L, C is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 3 (forbidden). 

Next candidate: “LYRIC” – contains C and L, but L is in position 1 (allowed), C in position 5 (allowed). I is in the word – but I was ruled out in Guess 2.

Positions:

“CLINK” – I, N, K. I ruled out.

“CLONK” – O, N, K. O not yet ruled out. C in position 1 (forbidden).

“CLUNK” – U, N, K. C in position 1 (forbidden).

“CLOMP” – O, M, P. M ruled out.

“CLOCK” – C in position 1 (forbidden).

“CRUEL” – C, R, U, E, L. E ruled out.

“CRULL” – not a valid word.

“CURLY” – C, U, R, L, Y. C in position 1 (forbidden).

What words have C and L with C not in position 1 and L not in positions 2 or 3?

Positions:

1 2 3 4 5
C cannot be in 1.
L cannot be in 2 or 3.

So C could be in 2,3,4,5 and L could be in 1,4,5.

Example:
C in 2: _ C _ _ _
L in 1 or 4 or 5.

“LUCID” – I ruled out.

“LURCH” – C in 3 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed). H not ruled out.

“LURCH” is a valid 5-letter word:
- Contains C and L.
- C is in position 3 (not forbidden).
- L is in position 1 (not forbidden).
- Does not contain any ruled-out letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

From SLATE:
- S, A, T, E are out.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

From CLIMB:
- C is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- I, M, B are out.

From LURCH:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- U is in position 2 and is correct (✓).
- C is in position 4 and is correct (✓).
- H is in position 5 and is correct (✓).

So the secret word looks like:

Position: 1   2   3   4   5  
Pattern:  ?   U   ?   C   H  

Letters already placed:
- U in 2
- C in 4
- H in 5

Letters still needed:
- L (which now cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3).  
  The only remaining spot for L is position 1 (but L was marked “-” in position 1 in LURCH, meaning L is NOT in position 1 either).  
  Therefore L must appear, yet has no legal position left in the current pattern. That means our earlier assumption must be wrong – L cannot go anywhere in the word under the current placement of C and H.  

This contradiction reveals L must appear in the word, and the only way this is possible is if L is in position 3 (since positions 1,2,4,5 are taken by other constraints). But CLIMB already told us L is NOT in position 3.  

Wait, re-read the feedback carefully:

LURCH feedback:
- L(-) : letter L is in the word but wrong position. It was in position 1, so L cannot be in 1.
- U(✓) : U in position 2 is correct.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word.
- C(✓) : C in position 4 is correct.
- H(✓) : H in position 5 is correct.

So the confirmed positions are:
2 = U
4 = C
5 = H

Letters in word so far: U, C, H, L must be somewhere.

Positions left to fill: 1 and 3.

Letters allowed: any letters NOT yet ruled out (so not S,A,T,E,I,M,B,R).

Common remaining letters: D, F, G, K, N, O, P, W, Y, etc.

L must appear in one of positions 1 or 3. But:

From CLIMB: L cannot be in 2 or 3.  
From LURCH: L cannot be in 1.  

That leaves position 3 for L – but CLIMB already ruled out L in position 3.  

This contradiction means no valid placement for L. The only resolution is that L must be in position 3, despite CLIMB’s feedback.

Wait, re-check CLIMB feedback: CLIMB -> C(-) L(-) I(x) M(x) B(x).  
The “L(-)” here means L is in the word but not in position 2 of that guess (which was position 2). It does not say L cannot be in position 3. It only says L is not in position 2. Position 3 was never tested for L in CLIMB – the L in CLIMB was in position 2. Therefore L CAN be in position 3.

Therefore the word must be:

1   2   3   4   5  
?   U   L   C   H  

Only position 1 remains to be filled. It cannot be any ruled-out letters (S,A,T,E,I,M,B,R).

Possible letters for position 1: D, F, G, K, N, O, P, W, Y.

Testing possibilities:
- DULCH – not a word.
