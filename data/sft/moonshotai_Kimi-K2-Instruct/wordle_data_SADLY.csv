moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,SADLY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the very first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters frequently found in English words. This maximizes the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word would use a mix of these. 

Looking at common starting words used in games like Wordle, ""SLATE"" is highly regarded because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters including both common consonants and vowels. Other good options include ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has a great balance of high-frequency letters that should give good information regardless of the secret word.

2. Build a candidate list that satisfies:  
   - Starts with S.  
   - Contains L and A elsewhere.  
   - Must avoid T and E completely.

3. Possible letter choices for remaining spots (avoiding T and E): common remaining consonants like R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc., and vowels like I, O, U.

4. Pick a word that uses good common letters while satisfying constraints.

   One strong candidate is “SALON”:  
   - S in 1st (good).

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word starts with S (✓).
2. A is in position 2 (✓).
3. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 or 4 (because in SLATE it was position 2 and in SALON it was position 3: both are marked “-”).
4. Letters T, E, O, N are not in the word at all (x).

So far we have:
S A _ _ _  (positions 1 and 2 fixed).

Remaining positions (3, 4, 5) must include L somewhere (but not in 3 or 4 ⇒ only possible in position 5) and must avoid T, E, O, N.

Therefore the pattern is:
S A _ _ L

Letters still allowed: common consonants and vowels not yet excluded, e.g. R, I, C, H, D, G, etc.

A good, common word matching S A _ _ L is “SACRL” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Valid, common words ending in L starting with SA and avoiding forbidden letters:
- “SARIL” – not common.
- “SABUL” – not a word.
- “SADLY” – Y is allowed (not yet excluded) and all letters fit constraints.

Check “SADLY”:
- S ✓ at 1
- A ✓ at 2
- D, L, Y – none are T, E, O, N
- L at 5 – satisfies that it’s in the word but not positions 2, 3, 4.

So “SADLY” fits everything.
