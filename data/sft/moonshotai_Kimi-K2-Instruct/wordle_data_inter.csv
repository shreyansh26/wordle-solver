For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words. 

Some effective starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear frequently in English words, and covers a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after two guesses.

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 1)
- E (wrong in positions 5 and 2)
- N (wrong in positions 4 and 3)

Forbidden letters (definitely not in the word):
C, A, S

Other letters (status unknown):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Constraints on positions:
- Position 1: Not R
- Position 2: Not E
- Position 3: Not N
- Position 4: Not N
- Position 5: Not E

We still have to place R, E, N in the remaining legal spots, and we need two more distinct letters that aren’t C, A, S.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Uses R, E, N in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduces two new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.

Possible positions for each known letter:
- R can go in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E can go in positions 1, 3, 4.
- N can go in positions 1, 2, 5.

Let’s try placing them:
- Position 5 can have N (but not E or T).
- Position 4 can have E or R.
- Position 3 can have R or E (but not N).
- Position 2 can have N (but not E).
- Position 1 can have E or N.

A quick combination: E N _ _ _ won’t work because we don’t have space for R.
Try _ N _ E _ : positions 2=N, 4=E, then R must be in 3 or 5. 5 cannot be R (no restriction, but let’s test).

How about UNDER?
U, D are new letters; R, E, N are placed in positions 3, 4, 2 respectively – all legal.

Check constraints:
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only banned from 1 and 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only banned from 2 and 5).
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only banned from 3 and 4).
- U and D are fresh.

So “UNDER” satisfies every known rule.

Let's synthesize what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- N (correct in position 2)
- E (correct in position 4)
- R (correct in position 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
C, A, S, U, D

Current partial pattern:
_ N _ E R

So the word has 5 letters with:
- Position 2: N
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that are NOT in the forbidden set. The available letters (not yet ruled out) are:
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters from this pool, and we want to choose common ones that will give us maximum information while also being likely to form a real word.

Common letters in the available set: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, T

Looking at the pattern _N_ER, possible combinations:
- INFER: I(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), R(5) → This fits all constraints
- INNER: But we already have N in position 2, so position 3 can't be N (no restriction, but we need two different letters)
- ONSET: Doesn't fit the pattern
- PONER: Would need P and O, but pattern is _N_ER
- HONER: H and O

INFER seems perfect - it uses I and F (both still allowed), and forms a valid word that matches our constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This means selecting a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words. 

Some effective starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear frequently in English words, and covers a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is somewhere other than position 2.
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N is somewhere other than position 4.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is somewhere other than position 5.

We now know:
- The word contains R, N, E.
- It does NOT contain C or A.
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, we want a word that:
- Includes R, N, E in new positions.
- Avoids C and A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good next guess is ""RENTS"":
- Includes R, E, N (known letters) in new positions.
- Adds S and T (very common letters).
- Checks new positions for R, E, N: R in 1, E in 2, N in 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we know after two guesses.

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 1)
- E (wrong in positions 5 and 2)
- N (wrong in positions 4 and 3)

Forbidden letters (definitely not in the word):
C, A, S

Other letters (status unknown):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Constraints on positions:
- Position 1: Not R
- Position 2: Not E
- Position 3: Not N
- Position 4: Not N
- Position 5: Not E

We still have to place R, E, N in the remaining legal spots, and we need two more distinct letters that aren’t C, A, S.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Uses R, E, N in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduces two new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.

Possible positions for each known letter:
- R can go in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E can go in positions 1, 3, 4.
- N can go in positions 1, 2, 5.

Let’s try placing them:
- Position 5 can have N (but not E or T).
- Position 4 can have E or R.
- Position 3 can have R or E (but not N).
- Position 2 can have N (but not E).
- Position 1 can have E or N.

A quick combination: E N _ _ _ won’t work because we don’t have space for R.
Try _ N _ E _ : positions 2=N, 4=E, then R must be in 3 or 5. 5 cannot be R (no restriction, but let’s test).

How about UNDER?
U, D are new letters; R, E, N are placed in positions 3, 4, 2 respectively – all legal.

Check constraints:
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only banned from 1 and 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only banned from 2 and 5).
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only banned from 3 and 4).
- U and D are fresh.

So “UNDER” satisfies every known rule.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words. 

Some effective starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear frequently in English words, and covers a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is somewhere other than position 2.
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N is somewhere other than position 4.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is somewhere other than position 5.

We now know:
- The word contains R, N, E.
- It does NOT contain C or A.
- R is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, we want a word that:
- Includes R, N, E in new positions.
- Avoids C and A.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good next guess is ""RENTS"":
- Includes R, E, N (known letters) in new positions.
- Adds S and T (very common letters).
- Checks new positions for R, E, N: R in 1, E in 2, N in 3.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate everything we know after two guesses.

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- R (wrong in positions 2 and 1)
- E (wrong in positions 5 and 2)
- N (wrong in positions 4 and 3)

Forbidden letters (definitely not in the word):
C, A, S

Other letters (status unknown):  
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Constraints on positions:
- Position 1: Not R
- Position 2: Not E
- Position 3: Not N
- Position 4: Not N
- Position 5: Not E

We still have to place R, E, N in the remaining legal spots, and we need two more distinct letters that aren’t C, A, S.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
1. Uses R, E, N in still-allowed positions.
2. Introduces two new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.

Possible positions for each known letter:
- R can go in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E can go in positions 1, 3, 4.
- N can go in positions 1, 2, 5.

Let’s try placing them:
- Position 5 can have N (but not E or T).
- Position 4 can have E or R.
- Position 3 can have R or E (but not N).
- Position 2 can have N (but not E).
- Position 1 can have E or N.

A quick combination: E N _ _ _ won’t work because we don’t have space for R.
Try _ N _ E _ : positions 2=N, 4=E, then R must be in 3 or 5. 5 cannot be R (no restriction, but let’s test).

How about UNDER?
U, D are new letters; R, E, N are placed in positions 3, 4, 2 respectively – all legal.

Check constraints:
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only banned from 1 and 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it was only banned from 2 and 5).
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only banned from 3 and 4).
- U and D are fresh.

So “UNDER” satisfies every known rule.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(x)
Guess 3: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's synthesize what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- N (correct in position 2)
- E (correct in position 4)
- R (correct in position 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
C, A, S, U, D

Current partial pattern:
_ N _ E R

So the word has 5 letters with:
- Position 2: N
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that are NOT in the forbidden set. The available letters (not yet ruled out) are:
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters from this pool, and we want to choose common ones that will give us maximum information while also being likely to form a real word.

Common letters in the available set: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, T

Looking at the pattern _N_ER, possible combinations:
- INFER: I(1), N(2), F(3), E(4), R(5) → This fits all constraints
- INNER: But we already have N in position 2, so position 3 can't be N (no restriction, but we need two different letters)
- ONSET: Doesn't fit the pattern
- PONER: Would need P and O, but pattern is _N_ER
- HONER: H and O

INFER seems perfect - it uses I and F (both still allowed), and forms a valid word that matches our constraints.

Let me verify:
- Position 1: I (allowed, not in forbidden set)
- Position 2: N (correct from feedback)
- Position 3: F (allowed, not in forbidden set)
- Position 4: E (correct from feedback)
- Position 5: R (correct from feedback)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(-) S(x)
Guess 3: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: INFER -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have four confirmed letters in four confirmed positions:

1 2 3 4 5  
I N _ E R

Only position 3 is still unknown.  
Forbidden letters so far: C, A, S, U, D, F  
All others are still allowed.

Valid letters for position 3 (must not be any of C, A, S, U, D, F) and must give a real 5-letter word with the pattern I N _ E R.

Quick scan of common English words matching I N _ E R:

- INGER  – G is still allowed  
- INNER – N is already used in position 2, but position 3 could take N again and we have no rule preventing it; however, “INNER” is a valid word.  
- INKER – K is allowed.  
- INVER – V is allowed.  

“INNER” seems the most straightforward, since it keeps the N in position 2 and places N again in position 3. Let’s confirm:

- Position 3 = N is not forbidden.  
- Word “INNER” is in standard dictionaries.  

So we’ll guess INNER.

We now know the exact pattern and the only remaining unknown:

Position 1: I ✓  
Position 2: N ✓  
Position 3: ?  
Position 4: E ✓  
Position 5: R ✓  

The feedback for INNER tells us the third letter is **in the word but in the wrong position** (-).

Forbidden letters (never appear): C, A, S, U, D, F  
Forbidden in position 3 specifically: N (just learned)

So position 3 must be a letter that:
- has NOT been ruled out completely, and  
- is NOT the letter N.

Allowed letters still available include: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a single 5-letter word of the form I N _ E R that is in the word list.

Looking through common English words:

- INGER → “inger” is not a standard word.  
- INKER → real word.  
- INVER → real word but V has not been tried.  
- INTER → real word and T is still allowed.

“INTER” is the most common valid word with T in position 3.

So the final guess is INTER.
