This is my first guess, so I have no prior feedback to work with. The goal is to choose a word that can give me the most useful information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at common English letters, the vowels A, E, I, O, U appear often, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common. A good starting word would combine these to cover as many bases as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are very common in English words
- No duplicate letters, which gives maximum information per letter position
- It follows valid English word rules

This choice should help identify which vowels are present and give information about the consonants R and S as well.

A 5-letter word that fits _ _ I _ E with R and S to place: possible is ""RINSE"":
- R in 1, I in 3, N new, S in 4, E in 5.
Check constraints:

- T, A, O already excluded.

""RINSE"" seems like a valid choice.

Let’s summarize the information we now have from all three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A and O are NOT in the word.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(✓) E(-) S(-)
   - I is in position 3.
   - E is NOT in position 4 (but we already know it’s in position 5).
   - T is NOT in the word.
   - R is NOT in position 2.
   - S is NOT in position 5.

3. RINSE → R(-) I(-) N(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - R is NOT in position 1.
   - I is NOT in position 2 (but we already know it’s in position 3).
   - N is NOT in the word.
   - S is NOT in position 4.
   - E is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So the secret word is: _ _ I _ E, and must contain R and S in the remaining positions (1, 2, 4), with these constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from RINSE and TRIES/AROSE).
- S cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from RINSE and TRIES/AROSE).
- Therefore, the only possible positions left are:
   - R must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 2, and positions 3 and 5 are taken by I and E).
   - S must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Position 2 is the only remaining slot for S (since S can’t be in 4 or 5, and if S were in 1, then R would be in 4, leaving position 2 empty).

Thus the word must be: S R I R E or S _ I R E, but ""SRIRE"" isn’t a word. The correct arrangement is S _ I R E, so position 2 must be a letter we haven't ruled out yet, and the only letters left to try are common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding T, A, O, N).

Looking for 5-letter words ending in IRE:
- SPIRE: S P I R E. Check constraints:
   - S is in position 1 (allowed, as S hasn’t been tested in position 1 yet).
   - P is new.
   - I is in 3 (matches).
   - R is in 4 (allowed, as R can be in 4).
   - E is in 5 (matches).
   - No conflicts with previous feedback.

SPIRE seems valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The goal is to choose a word that can give me the most useful information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of getting hits.

Looking at common English letters, the vowels A, E, I, O, U appear often, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common. A good starting word would combine these to cover as many bases as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- All letters are very common in English words
- No duplicate letters, which gives maximum information per letter position
- It follows valid English word rules

This choice should help identify which vowels are present and give information about the consonants R and S as well.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but NOT in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains both R and S, but neither is in their original positions (R ≠ 2, S ≠ 4).
3. It does NOT contain A or O.

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels while placing R and S in new positions. A good word should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Move R and S to positions where they haven't been tried (e.g., R could be 1,3,4,5; S could be 1,2,3,5).
- Introduce new common letters like T, I, N, L.

Let’s try “TRIES”:
- T, I are new letters.
- R moves to position 1.
- S moves to position 3.
- Ends with E as required.

This should quickly tell me about T and I while reusing R and S in new spots.

- Contains R, S, I (✓ for I in position 3 from TRIES, but note that in TRIES the I was in position 3 and got ✓; however, in TRIES the E was in position 4 and got (-), meaning E is NOT in position 4 in the secret word. But we already know from AROSE that E is in position 5. So the TRIES feedback confirms E is position 5 and I is in position 3).

Wait, let’s re-express the TRIES feedback carefully:
- T(x): T not in word.
- R(-): R is in word but not in position 2.
- I(✓): I is in word and in position 3.
- E(-): E is in word but not in position 4 (but we know from AROSE it must be in position 5).
- S(-): S is in word but not in position 5.

So the secret word must:
- Be _ _ I _ E (I in position 3, E in position 5).
- Contain R and S somewhere in positions 1,2,4 (since R ≠ 2, S ≠ 5, and we’ve only excluded A, O, T so far).

So the secret word is: _ _ I _ E, and must contain R and S in the remaining positions (1, 2, 4), with these constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from RINSE and TRIES/AROSE).
- S cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from RINSE and TRIES/AROSE).
- Therefore, the only possible positions left are:
   - R must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 2, and positions 3 and 5 are taken by I and E).
   - S must be in position 1 or 2.
   - Position 2 is the only remaining slot for S (since S can’t be in 4 or 5, and if S were in 1, then R would be in 4, leaving position 2 empty).

Thus the word must be: S R I R E or S _ I R E, but ""SRIRE"" isn’t a word. The correct arrangement is S _ I R E, so position 2 must be a letter we haven't ruled out yet, and the only letters left to try are common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding T, A, O, N).

Need 5 letters with I in 3 and E in 5.\n\nA 5-letter word that fits _ _ I _ E with R and S to place: possible is ""RINSE"":\n- R in 1, I in 3, N new, S in 4, E in 5.\nCheck constraints:\n- R not in 2: okay, it’s in 1.\n- S not in 5: okay, it’s in 4.\n- T, A, O already excluded.\n\n""RINSE"" seems like a valid choice.\n\n<guess>RINSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(✓) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: RINSE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) N(x) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s summarize the information we now have from all three guesses:\n\n1.

The feedback from SPIRE is:
- S(✓) – S is exactly in position 1.
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- I(✓) – I is exactly in position 3.
- R(✓) – R is exactly in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is exactly in position 5.

So the word is:
S _ I R E

The only missing letter is position 2. From previous feedback, we have already ruled out:
A, O, T, N, P.

Common remaining letters for position 2 include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc. Looking for real 5-letter English words that fit S _ I R E:

- SC I R E → “SCIRE” is not a valid English word.
- SHIRE → valid word.
- SM I R E → “SMIRE” is not valid.
- SL I R E → “SLIRE” is not valid.
- SW I R E → “SWIRE” is not common (proper noun).
- ST I R E → “STIRE” is not valid (also T is already excluded).

“SHIRE” is the clear valid candidate.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1: ✓ (matches feedback).
- H is new and not excluded.
- I in position 3: ✓.
- R in position 4: ✓.
- E in position 5: ✓.

No conflicts.
