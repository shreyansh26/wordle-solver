- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some strong candidates include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that will give good information about their presence or absence in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is present but not in the first position.
- R is present but not in the second position.
- A is NOT in the word.
- N is NOT in the word.
- E is present but not in the fifth position.

So far we know the word:
- Contains C, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or N.

Letters already ruled out: A, N.

Letters we know exist (C, R, E) must appear somewhere in positions 2–5 for C, 1,3–5 for R, and 1–4 for E.

Next guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. We can try placing C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in any position except 2; and E in any position except 5.

A good candidate is “STORE”:
- S, T, O, R, E – all common letters.
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (forbidden by feedback), so this is bad. Let’s avoid E in position 5.

Another candidate: “CREST”:
- C is in position 1 (forbidden), so no.

“SCORE”:
- S, C, O, R, E.
- C is position 2 (allowed), R is position 4 (allowed), E is position 5 (forbidden) – again E in position 5.

“RECUT”:
- R, E, C, U, T.
- R is position 1 (allowed), E position 2 (allowed), C position 3 (allowed).
- Introduces U and T as new letters.

This seems like a good next guess.
