Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, I'll use a strategic word that covers common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters

Common strategic choices include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
1. C is a common starting consonant
2. R is very common in English words
3. A is the most common vowel
4. N is a frequent consonant
5. E is the second most common vowel
This gives good coverage of the alphabet while being a valid word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to eliminate: C, A, N, E, plus we already used R
- The word contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, L, etc.)

For the next guess, I want:
1. To include R in a new position (not second)
2. To test new high-frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, U
3. A valid word that meets these criteria

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" but that's 5 letters (T-R-I-U-M). Actually let me think of valid words:
- ""TRIUM"" is not a word
- ""STORM"" has R in position 3
- ""STRIP"" has R in position 4
- ""FIRST"" has R in position 4

Summary so far:
- R is known to be in position 4 (from Guess 2), but now Guess 3 shows R with (-) in position 5 → impossible contradiction?  
Wait: in Guess 2, R was in position 4 and got ✓, so it MUST be the 4th letter.  
But in Guess 3, R is in position 5 and got (-) — that only means it’s somewhere else (positions 1-4).  
So position 4 is still locked as R.

Letters eliminated so far:
C, A, N, E (from CRANE)  
S, T, M (from STORM)  
U (from HUMOR)

Letters confirmed:
H in position 1 (✓ in HUMOR)  
R in position 4 (✓ in STORM)

So the word looks like: H _ _ R _

O appeared with (-) in position 3 (HUMOR) → O is in the word, but not in position 3 → must be in position 2 or 5.

Candidate letters left: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus O and possibly I.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The best starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters

Common strategic choices include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
1. C is a common starting consonant
2. R is very common in English words
3. A is the most common vowel
4. N is a frequent consonant
5. E is the second most common vowel
This gives good coverage of the alphabet while being a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- A, N, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to eliminate: C, A, N, E, plus we already used R
- The word contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, L, etc.)

For the next guess, I want:
1. To include R in a new position (not second)
2. To test new high-frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, U
3. A valid word that meets these criteria

A good candidate is ""TRIUM"" but that's 5 letters (T-R-I-U-M). Actually let me think of valid words:
- ""TRIUM"" is not a word
- ""STORM"" has R in position 3
- ""STRIP"" has R in position 4
- ""FIRST"" has R in position 4

I'll go with ""STORM"" because:
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- Tests S, T, O, M which are all new letters
- Valid word

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

- R is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2  

Guess 2: STORM → S(x) T(x) O(-) R(✓) M(x)  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, M  
- O is in the word, but not in position 3  
- R is in the word AND in the correct position: position 4  

So far we know:
- R is fixed in position 4
- O is in the word, not in position 3
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, T, M  
- Still need to test common vowels I, U and consonants like L, D, G, P, etc.

We have the pattern: _ _ _ R _  
We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 4
2. Contains O in positions 1, 2, or 5 (not 3)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Candidate words:
- RIGOR → R in wrong place (needs to be 4th)
- FLOOR → O is in position 3 (invalid, already eliminated)
- HUMOR → R is 4th, O is 5th → valid
- VIGOR → same, R is 4th, O is 5th → valid
- PILOT → R missing

Between HUMOR and VIGOR, both fit. HUMOR tests H and U which haven't been used yet.
