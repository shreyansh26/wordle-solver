For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about possible letters in the secret word. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain many of these common letters to maximize the information gained. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular first guesses because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

From the feedback on AROSE we know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it’s not the first letter).
- R is not in the word at all (✗).
- O is not in the word at all (✗).
- S is not in the word at all (✗).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (it was in position 5, so the last letter is E).

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E and must contain A (but not as the 1st letter), and must not contain R, O, or S.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in E that meet these constraints and contain an A elsewhere, I’ll try a word with some other high-frequency letters like D, I, N, T, L, C, M, etc.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It ends in E.
- It contains A (in position 2, satisfying the “not first” condition).
- It avoids R, O, and S.
- The letters L, I, N are frequent and will give new information.

Current constraints:

1. Letter E must be present and in the last position (5).  
   – In Guess 2 (ALIEN) E was marked “-” (wrong position) because it was actually in position 4, but we already learned from Guess 1 that the correct position is 5. This just re-confirms E is the 5th letter.

2. Letter A must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it showed “-” in both guesses).  
   Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are NOT in the word at all (all received ✗ so far).

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing A in position 3 or 4, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate letters for the remaining three positions: positions 1, 2 and (whichever of 3/4 A doesn’t occupy).

Possible pattern forms:
- _ _ A _ E   or
- _ _ _ A E

Let’s pick a word fitting the first pattern, using common remaining consonants:  
“CH A D E” is invalid (no D).  
“CH A M E” → CHAME is not valid.  
“C H A V E” uses V which is untested but not forbidden – but CHAVE isn’t a valid word.  
“M A T E” can’t fit the pattern.  

Another idea: “PLACE” – but L is excluded.  
“GRAPE” – G, R forbidden.  
“CRATE” – R forbidden.  
“CRANE” – R, N forbidden.  
“PLATE” – L, T, E are OK, but L excluded.  

Next: “PEACE” – C is allowed, E is fixed at 5, A would be in position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain many of these common letters to maximize the information gained. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular first guesses because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it’s not the first letter).
- R is not in the word at all (✗).
- O is not in the word at all (✗).
- S is not in the word at all (✗).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (it was in position 5, so the last letter is E).

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E and must contain A (but not as the 1st letter), and must not contain R, O, or S.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in E that meet these constraints and contain an A elsewhere, I’ll try a word with some other high-frequency letters like D, I, N, T, L, C, M, etc.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It ends in E.
- It contains A (in position 2, satisfying the “not first” condition).
- It avoids R, O, and S.
- The letters L, I, N are frequent and will give new information.

1. Letter E must be present and in the last position (5).  
   – In Guess 2 (ALIEN) E was marked “-” (wrong position) because it was actually in position 4, but we already learned from Guess 1 that the correct position is 5. This just re-confirms E is the 5th letter.

2. Letter A must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it showed “-” in both guesses).  
   Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are NOT in the word at all (all received ✗ so far).

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing A in position 3 or 4, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate letters for the remaining three positions: positions 1, 2 and (whichever of 3/4 A doesn’t occupy).

Possible pattern forms:
- _ _ A _ E   or
- _ _ _ A E

Let’s pick a word fitting the first pattern, using common remaining consonants:  
“CH A D E” is invalid (no D).  
“CH A M E” → CHAME is not valid.  
“C H A V E” uses V which is untested but not forbidden – but CHAVE isn’t a valid word.  
“M A T E” can’t fit the pattern.  

Another idea: “PLACE” – but L is excluded.  
“GRAPE” – G, R forbidden.  
“CRATE” – R forbidden.  
“CRANE” – R, N forbidden.  
“PLATE” – L, T, E are OK, but L excluded.  

Next: “PEACE” – C is allowed, E is fixed at 5, A would be in position 3.  
Check P, E, A, C, E – yes, it ends in E, A is in position 3, and all letters are still allowed.

So my next guess is PEACE.

Let’s re-summarize the constraints from all feedback:

1. Word ends in E.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ E

2. Letter A must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (marked “-” every time).  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ A E

3. Letter V is in the word and in the correct position (HEAVE feedback shows V ✓ in position 4), but position 4 must now be A.  
   This is a contradiction unless V actually belongs in position 3.  
   Looking back at HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – marked “-” (so E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – marked “-” (so A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – marked ✓ (so V must be in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – marked ✓ (already known)  

   Therefore the correct pattern is: _ _ _ V E (with V fixed in 4, E fixed in 5).  
   Additionally, A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from prior guesses).  
   The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s already V.  
   This implies the letter A must actually be in position 2 (because earlier “-” marks were only for the positions tested, not absolute).  
   Rechecking: in PEACE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in HEAVE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in ALIEN, A was position 2 and got “-”; in AROSE, A was position 1 and got “-”.  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   But that conflicts with V being in position 4.  
   This contradiction means my prior step was wrong: the HEAVE feedback shows V is correct in position 4, so A must be elsewhere.  
   The only way to resolve is to realize that A is NOT required to be in position 4 – the prior “-” marks were simply indicating the tested positions were wrong, but A could still be in an untested position.  
   The correct interpretation:  
   - Pattern: _ _ _ V E (from HEAVE V ✓)  
   - A must be in the word but NOT in positions tested so far (1,2,3,5).  
   - The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s occupied by V.  
   Therefore A must actually be in position 2, because earlier “-” marks were for the specific tested positions, not absolute.  
   Rewriting constraints:  
   - Word ends in VE.  
   - Must contain A.  
   - Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C, H.  

   So pattern: _ A _ V E or _ _ A V E  
   But tested positions show A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5, so the only possible spot is position 4, which is V – impossible.  
   Re-examining HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – “-” (E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – “-” (A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – ✓ (V is in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – ✓ (E is in position 5)  
   Therefore the word must be: _ _ _ V E with A somewhere not in positions 1,2,3,5 – impossible except position 4, which is V.  
   The resolution is that the earlier “-” marks for A were only for the tested positions, not absolute.  
   The only possible remaining pattern is: _ A _ V E  
   because A cannot be in positions 1,3,5, and position 4 is V.  
   Therefore: _ A _ V E

<guess>DAVE</guess>",DAVE,"Let’s re-summarize the constraints from all feedback:

1. Word ends in E.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ E

2. Letter A must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (marked “-” every time).  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ A E

3. Letter V is in the word and in the correct position (HEAVE feedback shows V ✓ in position 4), but position 4 must now be A.  
   This is a contradiction unless V actually belongs in position 3.  
   Looking back at HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – marked “-” (so E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – marked “-” (so A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – marked ✓ (so V must be in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – marked ✓ (already known)  

   Therefore the correct pattern is: _ _ _ V E (with V fixed in 4, E fixed in 5).  
   Additionally, A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from prior guesses).  
   The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s already V.  
   This implies the letter A must actually be in position 2 (because earlier “-” marks were only for the positions tested, not absolute).  
   Rechecking: in PEACE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in HEAVE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in ALIEN, A was position 2 and got “-”; in AROSE, A was position 1 and got “-”.  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   But that conflicts with V being in position 4.  
   This contradiction means my prior step was wrong: the HEAVE feedback shows V is correct in position 4, so A must be elsewhere.  
   The only way to resolve is to realize that A is NOT required to be in position 4 – the prior “-” marks were simply indicating the tested positions were wrong, but A could still be in an untested position.  
   The correct interpretation:  
   - Pattern: _ _ _ V E (from HEAVE V ✓)  
   - A must be in the word but NOT in positions tested so far (1,2,3,5).  
   - The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s occupied by V.  
   Therefore A must actually be in position 2, because earlier “-” marks were for the specific tested positions, not absolute.  
   Rewriting constraints:  
   - Word ends in VE.  
   - Must contain A.  
   - Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C, H.  

   So pattern: _ A _ V E or _ _ A V E  
   But tested positions show A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5, so the only possible spot is position 4, which is V – impossible.  
   Re-examining HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – “-” (E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – “-” (A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – ✓ (V is in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – ✓ (E is in position 5)  
   Therefore the word must be: _ _ _ V E with A somewhere not in positions 1,2,3,5 – impossible except position 4, which is V.  
   The resolution is that the earlier “-” marks for A were only for the tested positions, not absolute.  
   The only possible remaining pattern is: _ A _ V E  
   because A cannot be in positions 1,3,5, and position 4 is V.  
   Therefore: _ A _ V E

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,mauve,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about possible letters in the secret word. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good strategy is to use words that contain many of these common letters to maximize the information gained. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular first guesses because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE we know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it’s not the first letter).
- R is not in the word at all (✗).
- O is not in the word at all (✗).
- S is not in the word at all (✗).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (it was in position 5, so the last letter is E).

So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E and must contain A (but not as the 1st letter), and must not contain R, O, or S.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in E that meet these constraints and contain an A elsewhere, I’ll try a word with some other high-frequency letters like D, I, N, T, L, C, M, etc.  
A good candidate is “ALIEN” because:
- It ends in E.
- It contains A (in position 2, satisfying the “not first” condition).
- It avoids R, O, and S.
- The letters L, I, N are frequent and will give new information.

<guess>ALIEN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALIEN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

1. Letter E must be present and in the last position (5).  
   – In Guess 2 (ALIEN) E was marked “-” (wrong position) because it was actually in position 4, but we already learned from Guess 1 that the correct position is 5. This just re-confirms E is the 5th letter.

2. Letter A must be in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (it showed “-” in both guesses).  
   Therefore A must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Letters R, O, S, L, I, N are NOT in the word at all (all received ✗ so far).

Remaining frequent letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing A in position 3 or 4, and using only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate letters for the remaining three positions: positions 1, 2 and (whichever of 3/4 A doesn’t occupy).

Possible pattern forms:
- _ _ A _ E   or
- _ _ _ A E

Let’s pick a word fitting the first pattern, using common remaining consonants:  
“CH A D E” is invalid (no D).  
“CH A M E” → CHAME is not valid.  
“C H A V E” uses V which is untested but not forbidden – but CHAVE isn’t a valid word.  
“M A T E” can’t fit the pattern.  

Another idea: “PLACE” – but L is excluded.  
“GRAPE” – G, R forbidden.  
“CRATE” – R forbidden.  
“CRANE” – R, N forbidden.  
“PLATE” – L, T, E are OK, but L excluded.  

Next: “PEACE” – C is allowed, E is fixed at 5, A would be in position 3.  
Check P, E, A, C, E – yes, it ends in E, A is in position 3, and all letters are still allowed.

So my next guess is PEACE.

<guess>PEACE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ALIEN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)
Guess 3: PEACE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s distil every constraint so far:

1. E must be the 5th letter (confirmed by Guess 1 & 3).
   Pattern so far: _ _ _ _ E

2. A must be present but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5  
   (it was marked “-” in all those spots across the three guesses).  
   → A must be in position 4.

   Pattern now: _ _ _ A E

3. Letters already ruled out (received ✗):
   R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C

4. Still-available common consonants:  
   B, D, F, G, H, K, M, T, W, Y, plus vowels U, (we already have A and E).

We need a 5-letter word of form _ _ _ A E using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BRAVE → R forbidden  
- CRANE → R, N, C forbidden  
- DRAMA → M ok, but second A impossible  
- FRAME → R, M ok, but R forbidden  
- GLADE → L, D ok, but L forbidden  
- GRACE → R, C forbidden  
- HEAVE → H ok, E ok (but already in position 5)  
- MAIZE → Z not used yet, but I and Z untested – MAIZE has I (forbidden)  
- PHASE → P forbidden  
- SHADE → S, H ok, but S forbidden  
- TASTE → S forbidden  
- TRACE → R, C forbidden  
- WAGON → O forbidden  
- YEAST → S forbidden  

A quick scan shows “HEAVE” fits:  
H, E, A, V, E  
– pattern _ _ _ A E (A in 4)  
– letters H, E, V allowed (V untested, not yet excluded)  
– “HEAVE” is a valid English word.

Let’s try HEAVE.

<guess>HEAVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ALIEN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(x) E(-) N(x)
Guess 3: PEACE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: HEAVE -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) A(-) V(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s re-summarize the constraints from all feedback:

1. Word ends in E.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ E

2. Letter A must be in the word, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (marked “-” every time).  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ A E

3. Letter V is in the word and in the correct position (HEAVE feedback shows V ✓ in position 4), but position 4 must now be A.  
   This is a contradiction unless V actually belongs in position 3.  
   Looking back at HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – marked “-” (so E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – marked “-” (so A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – marked ✓ (so V must be in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – marked ✓ (already known)  

   Therefore the correct pattern is: _ _ _ V E (with V fixed in 4, E fixed in 5).  
   Additionally, A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from prior guesses).  
   The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s already V.  
   This implies the letter A must actually be in position 2 (because earlier “-” marks were only for the positions tested, not absolute).  
   Rechecking: in PEACE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in HEAVE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in ALIEN, A was position 2 and got “-”; in AROSE, A was position 1 and got “-”.  
   Therefore A must be in position 4.  
   But that conflicts with V being in position 4.  
   This contradiction means my prior step was wrong: the HEAVE feedback shows V is correct in position 4, so A must be elsewhere.  
   The only way to resolve is to realize that A is NOT required to be in position 4 – the prior “-” marks were simply indicating the tested positions were wrong, but A could still be in an untested position.  
   The correct interpretation:  
   - Pattern: _ _ _ V E (from HEAVE V ✓)  
   - A must be in the word but NOT in positions tested so far (1,2,3,5).  
   - The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s occupied by V.  
   Therefore A must actually be in position 2, because earlier “-” marks were for the specific tested positions, not absolute.  
   Rewriting constraints:  
   - Word ends in VE.  
   - Must contain A.  
   - Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C, H.  

   So pattern: _ A _ V E or _ _ A V E  
   But tested positions show A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5, so the only possible spot is position 4, which is V – impossible.  
   Re-examining HEAVE feedback:  
   - H ✗  
   - E (position 2) – “-” (E not in position 2)  
   - A (position 3) – “-” (A not in position 3)  
   - V (position 4) – ✓ (V is in position 4)  
   - E (position 5) – ✓ (E is in position 5)  
   Therefore the word must be: _ _ _ V E with A somewhere not in positions 1,2,3,5 – impossible except position 4, which is V.  
   The resolution is that the earlier “-” marks for A were only for the tested positions, not absolute.  
   The only possible remaining pattern is: _ A _ V E  
   because A cannot be in positions 1,3,5, and position 4 is V.  
   Therefore: _ A _ V E  

   Available letters (not yet excluded): B, D, F, G, K, M, T, W, Y, U

Letter V is in the word and in the correct position (HEAVE feedback shows V ✓ in position 4), but position 4 must now be A.  \n   This is a contradiction unless V actually belongs in position 3.  \n   Looking back at HEAVE feedback:  \n   - H ✗  \n   - E (position 2) – marked “-” (so E not in position 2)  \n   - A (position 3) – marked “-” (so A not in position 3)  \n   - V (position 4) – marked ✓ (so V must be in position 4)  \n   - E (position 5) – marked ✓ (already known)  \n\n   Therefore the correct pattern is: _ _ _ V E (with V fixed in 4, E fixed in 5).  \n   Additionally, A must appear somewhere but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from prior guesses).  \n   The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s already V.  \n   This implies the letter A must actually be in position 2 (because earlier “-” marks were only for the positions tested, not absolute).  \n   Rechecking: in PEACE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in HEAVE, A was position 3 and got “-”; in ALIEN, A was position 2 and got “-”; in AROSE, A was position 1 and got “-”.  \n   Therefore A must be in position 4.  \n   But that conflicts with V being in position 4.  \n   This contradiction means my prior step was wrong: the HEAVE feedback shows V is correct in position 4, so A must be elsewhere.  \n   The only way to resolve is to realize that A is NOT required to be in position 4 – the prior “-” marks were simply indicating the tested positions were wrong, but A could still be in an untested position.  \n   The correct interpretation:  \n   - Pattern: _ _ _ V E (from HEAVE V ✓)  \n   - A must be in the word but NOT in positions tested so far (1,2,3,5).  \n   - The only remaining spot for A is position 4, but that’s occupied by V.  \n   Therefore A must actually be in position 2, because earlier “-” marks were for the specific tested positions, not absolute.  \n   Rewriting constraints:  \n   - Word ends in VE.  \n   - Must contain A.  \n   - Excluded letters: R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C, H.  \n\n   So pattern: _ A _ V E or _ _ A V E  \n   But tested positions show A cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5, so the only possible spot is position 4, which is V – impossible.  \n   Re-examining HEAVE feedback:  \n   - H ✗  \n   - E (position 2) – “-” (E not in position 2)  \n   - A (position 3) – “-” (A not in position 3)  \n   - V (position 4) – ✓ (V is in position 4)  \n   - E (position 5) – ✓ (E is in position 5)  \n   Therefore the word must be: _ _ _ V E with A somewhere not in positions 1,2,3,5 – impossible except position 4, which is V.  \n   The resolution is that the earlier “-” marks for A were only for the tested positions, not absolute.  \n   The only possible remaining pattern is: _ A _ V E  \n   because A cannot be in positions 1,3,5, and position 4 is V.  \n   Therefore: _ A _ V E  \n\n   Available letters (not yet excluded): B, D, F, G, K, M, T, W, Y, U  \n   Common words fitting _ A _ V E:  \n   - GAVE – G allowed, A in 2, V in 4, E in 5  \n   - MAVE – not valid  \n   - DAVE – D allowed  \n   - FAVE – F allowed  \n   - WAVE – W allowed  \n   - BAVE – not valid  \n   - TAVE – not valid  \n   - KAVE – not valid  \n   - YAVE – not valid  \n   Valid English words: GAVE, DAVE, FAVE, WAVE  \n\n   All are possible.

The feedback on DAVE was “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That’s just an error message—DAVE is only four letters.  
We need a **five-letter** word that ends in VE and contains A somewhere **before** the VE.

From prior constraints:
- Word ends in VE (V at 4, E at 5).  
- Must contain A.  
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5.  
  Therefore A must be in position 2 → pattern: _ A _ V E.

Still-allowed consonants for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, K, M, T, W, Y (no R, O, S, L, I, N, P, C, H).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form [consonant] A [consonant] V E.

Existing English words that fit:
- GRAVE  (R excluded)  
- BRAVE  (R excluded)  
- CRAVE  (R, C excluded)  
- BEVAE  – invalid  
- MAUVE  – 5 letters but U is allowed: M A U V E → MAUVE is valid.

MAUVE uses allowed letters (M, A, U, V, E) and matches the pattern _ A _ V E.
