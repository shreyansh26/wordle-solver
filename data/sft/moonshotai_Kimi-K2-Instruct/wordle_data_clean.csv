2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the information gained since common letters are more likely to reveal hits or misses. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (common consonants S, L, T and vowels A, E)
- AUDIO (uses many vowels)
- RAISE (common consonants R, S and vowels A, I, E)

I think SLATE is a strong choice because:
1. S is very common as the first letter
2. L, T are common consonants
3. A, E are the two most common vowels
4. It avoids repeating letters which would give less information than using 5 unique letters

This should give good coverage across possible letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Letters in word: A, E (but not in positions 3 or 5)
- Letters to avoid: S, T

Next, I need a word that:
1. Has L in position 2
2. Contains A and E (in positions 1 or 4)
3. Doesn't contain S or T
4. Uses 5-letter English words

Some possibilities:
- FLAKE: L in 2, A in 3, E in 5 - but A and E would be in wrong positions based on current info
- PLANE: L in 2, A in 3, E in 5 - same issue
- CLAVE: L in 2, A in 3, E in 5 - same issue
- GLARE: L in 2, A in 4, E in 5 - A is allowed in 4 (was in 3), E is allowed in 5 (was in 5 but needs to move)
- ALERT: T is forbidden
- CLEAR: L in 2, E in 4, A in 5 - this looks good because:
  - E moves from 5 to 4 (allowed since E was marked wrong position)
