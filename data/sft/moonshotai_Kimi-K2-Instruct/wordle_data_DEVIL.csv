For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters in English. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally use a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"".

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word. It also avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z which are unlikely to appear.

Only the letter “E” is in the word, and it is in the wrong position (last spot).  
Therefore, we must:
- Exclude A, R, O, S completely.  
- Keep an “E” somewhere other than position 5.  

We also want fresh, common letters not yet used. Good candidates include:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, etc.  

A balanced word that places the E in a new spot while introducing several new common letters is “UNTIE”: it has E in position 3, and adds U, N, T, I.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters absolutely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): I, E.
   – I is in position 4 (✓).
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So E must occur in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already taken by I), so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both I (fixed at position 4) and E (in 1, 2, or 3).
- Uses only letters not previously ruled out.

Candidates fitting I _ _ _ E or some permutation with I in position 4:
– E _ I _ _ (but E can’t be last)
– _ E _ I _
– _ _ E I _

A word that satisfies: E in position 1, I in position 4, and uses only fresh letters is “ELIMB”? That’s not valid. Let’s pick a common word:
“EVIL” is 4 letters. “EVICT” has C and T (T already ruled out).

Check: E _ I _ _ (position 4 I) and valid letters.

“EMILE” has M (allowed), E in 1, I in 4, E in 5 (but E can’t be in 5). So no.

“EVIL” is 4 letters. “EDICT” has T.

“EXILE” has E in 1, X (allowed), I in 3, but we need I in 4.

“EXILE” has I in 3 which conflicts.

Wait, we need I in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ I _ where E is not in 5 and must appear in 1,2, or 3.

From the feedback so far:

Known facts:
- Letters excluded forever: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: I, E, E (two E’s, one I)
- Position information:
  – I is in 4th position (from Guess 2: I is ✓ in 4th)
  – E is in the word but NOT in 2nd or 5th position (from Guess 3: E is ✓ in 2nd, but was marked as wrong position (-) in 2nd and 5th places). This means E must be in 1st or 3rd position.

Current pattern: [E or _] [not E] [E or _] I [not E], with two E’s total and one I.

We need to use only remaining common letters not yet excluded: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed E and I.

Since we have two E’s and one I, likely the word is something like:
E _ E I _ or _ E E I _ (but E can’t be in 2nd from Guess 3 feedback), so only E _ E I _ is possible.

Possible valid 5-letter words fitting E _ E I _ with remaining letters:
- EKEID? Not valid.
- EPEIC? Not valid.
- EVEID? Not valid.
- EMEIC? Not valid.
- EGEIC? Not valid.
- EDEIC? Not valid.

Actually, looking at valid English words, ""EPEIC"" isn't valid, but ""EPEIC"" isn't a word. Let me think of real words.

Valid words with pattern E _ E I _:
- EPEIC (no)
- EDEIC (no)
- EMEIC (no)

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the second E could be in 3rd position and the first position is not E. But we know from Guess 3 that E is confirmed in 2nd position (✓), but earlier it was marked as wrong position (-) in 2nd. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: BELIE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) E(-)

This means:
- B is not in the word (x)
- E in 2nd position is correct (✓)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- I in 4th position is correct (✓)
- E in 5th position is not in the word (x)

This is a crucial correction! The feedback for Guess 3 shows:
- E is confirmed in 2nd position (✓)
- E is NOT in 5th position (x)
- L is in the word but not in 3rd position (-)

So the pattern is now: _ E _ I _ with:
- L somewhere in the word (but not 3rd)
- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B
- Letters available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L and the confirmed letters E and I

Possible words fitting _ E L I _ or _ E _ I L:
- JELIB? No
- HELIX? Has X (allowed), H, E, L, I, X
- HELIX: H E L I X → fits _ E L I _ pattern
- MELIC? Has C (allowed), M, E, L, I, C → but pattern would be M E L I C
- DELIC? D excluded? D is allowed
- VELIC? V allowed
- PELIC? P allowed

""HELIX"" is a valid word, fits _ E L I _ pattern, uses H, E, L, I, X - all allowed letters.

Let me check if there's a better fit. ""MELIC"" is also valid. ""HELIX"" seems good as it introduces H and X which are high information letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that contains common letters in English. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally use a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common strong starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"".

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word. It also avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z which are unlikely to appear.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Only the letter “E” is in the word, and it is in the wrong position (last spot).  
Therefore, we must:
- Exclude A, R, O, S completely.  
- Keep an “E” somewhere other than position 5.  

We also want fresh, common letters not yet used. Good candidates include:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, T, U, etc.  

A balanced word that places the E in a new spot while introducing several new common letters is “UNTIE”: it has E in position 3, and adds U, N, T, I.  
Another viable option is “ELBOW” (E in position 1), but “UNTIE” uses more of the remaining high-frequency letters.  

I’ll go with “UNTIE”.

1. Letters absolutely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (somewhere): I, E.
   – I is in position 4 (✓).
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So E must occur in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already taken by I), so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both I (fixed at position 4) and E (in 1, 2, or 3).
- Uses only letters not previously ruled out.

Candidates fitting I _ _ _ E or some permutation with I in position 4:
– E _ I _ _ (but E can’t be last)
– _ E _ I _
– _ _ E I _

A word that satisfies: E in position 1, I in position 4, and uses only fresh letters is “ELIMB”? That’s not valid. Let’s pick a common word:
“EVIL” is 4 letters. “EVICT” has C and T (T already ruled out).

Check: E _ I _ _ (position 4 I) and valid letters.

“EMILE” has M (allowed), E in 1, I in 4, E in 5 (but E can’t be in 5). So no.

“EVIL” is 4 letters. “EDICT” has T.

“EXILE” has E in 1, X (allowed), I in 3, but we need I in 4.

“EXILE” has I in 3 which conflicts.

Wait, we need I in position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ I _ where E is not in 5 and must appear in 1,2, or 3.

“MEDIA” has A (ruled out). “BELIE” has E in 2 and I in 4. That fits: B, E, L, I, E. But only one I. Let’s use “BELIE”.

Letters used: B, E, L, I, E – all allowed.

The feedback for Guess 3 shows:\n- E is confirmed in 2nd position (✓)\n- E is NOT in 5th position (x)\n- L is in the word but not in 3rd position (-)\n\nSo the pattern is now: _ E _ I _ with:\n- L somewhere in the word (but not 3rd)\n- No A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B\n- Letters available: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L and the confirmed letters E and I\n\nPossible words fitting _ E L I _ or _ E _ I L:\n- JELIB? No\n- HELIX? Has X (allowed), H, E, L, I, X\n- HELIX: H E L I X → fits _ E L I _ pattern\n- MELIC? Has C (allowed), M, E, L, I, C → but pattern would be M E L I C\n- DELIC? D excluded? D is allowed\n- VELIC? V allowed\n- PELIC? P allowed\n\n""HELIX"" is a valid word, fits _ E L I _ pattern, uses H, E, L, I, X - all allowed letters.\n\nLet me check if there\'s a better fit. ""MELIC"" is also valid. ""HELIX"" seems good as it introduces H and X which are high information letters.\n\n<guess>HELIX</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)\nGuess 3: BELIE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) E(-)\nGuess 4: HELIX -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
Let's consolidate the information we now have.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B, H, X

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in both BELIE and HELIX)
- I is in position 4 (✓ at position 4 in UNTIE, BELIE, HELIX)

Letter L is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ E _ I _

And L must appear in position 1 or 5.

Possible letters left to use: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has I in position 4
3. Contains L exactly once (since we've only seen one L so far)
4. Has L in position 1 or 5
5. Uses only the letters not ruled out

Let's explore both cases:

Case 1: L in position 1
Pattern: L E _ I _

Possible letters for positions 3 and 5: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words with this pattern:
- L E G I M → not a word
- L E V I S → S is excluded
- L E D I G → not a word
- L E G I T → T is excluded
- L E V I C → not a word
- L E W I S → S is excluded
- L E C I D → not a word
- L E F I G → not a word
- L E F I K → not a word
- L E M I C → not a word

Case 2: L in position 5
Pattern: _ E _ I L

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z

Valid words:
- D E C I L → not a word
- F E C I L → not a word
- G E C I L → not a word
- M E C I L → not a word
- P E C I L → not a word
- V E C I L → not a word
- W E C I L → not a word
- Z E C I L → not a word

Wait, let me think of actual english words that fit _ E _ I L:
- P E C I L → PENCIL (but PENCIL has N which is excluded)
- D E C I L → DECIL (not a word)
- G E C I L → GECIL (not a word)
- V E C I L → VECIL (not a word)
- M E C I L → MECIL (not a word)

Hmm, let me reconsider. The word ""VEIL"" is 4 letters. ""PEVIL""? Not a word.

Actually, ""LEVEL"" - but that has L in position 3 which is forbidden.

""VEXIL"" - uses X which is excluded.

""MEDIL"" - not a word.

""FEDIL"" - not a word.

Wait, let me think more systematically. The valid remaining letters are:

C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, L

For pattern _ E _ I L:
- First letter: any of C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z
- Third letter: any of C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for real words:

- C E C I L → CECIL (a name, but valid)
- D E V I L → DEVIL (D, E, V, I, L - all allowed)
- F E V I L → FEVIL (not a word)
- G E M I L → GEMIL (not a word)
- K E V I L → KEVIL (not a word)
- M E D I L → MEDIL (not a word)
- P E V I L → PEVIL (not a word)
- V E D I L → VEDIL (not a word)
- W E D I L → WEDIL (not a word)
- Y E V I L → YEVIL (not a word)
- Z E V I L → ZEVIL (not a word)

""DEVIL"" seems like the most common valid word fitting _ E V I L. All letters D, E, V, I, L are allowed based on previous feedback.

Let me verify:
- D: not excluded
- E: confirmed in position 2 (✓)
- V: not excluded
- I: confirmed in position 4 (✓)
- L: confirmed in word but not position 3 (here it's in position 5, which is allowed)

Therefore, ""DEVIL"" is a valid next guess.
