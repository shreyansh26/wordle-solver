My approach for the first guess is to use a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses some of these. A good starting word would be something like ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - many common letters and in common positions. Alternatively, ""AROSE"" is another good option. I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better positioned for feedback.

Let me go with SLATE as it has:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common
- A: most common vowel
- T: common
- E: most common letter overall

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word, but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

- Contains L, but L cannot be in position 2

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)

   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. LEVER → L(✓) E(-) V(x) E(-) R(x)

   - The first E is in position 2 but is NOT correct there (and therefore also not correct in position 4).
   - V and R are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: L _ _ _ E
- It contains L only once (since only one L is marked ✓).
- It does NOT contain S, A, T, V, R.
- E appears only once, as the final letter.

We still need to place the letters in positions 2, 3, 4 using any letters that have not been ruled out and making sure we don’t reuse any excluded letters.

Good remaining consonants: N, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (A and E already handled).

A strong next step is to pick a word that fills positions 2-4 with common remaining letters, ensuring we avoid the ruled-out set. A good candidate is “LINED.”

- I, N, D have not been ruled out.

- It does NOT contain S, A, T, V, R.
- E appears only once, as the final letter.

We still need to place the letters in positions 2, 3, 4 using any letters that have not been ruled out and making sure we don’t reuse any excluded letters.

Good remaining consonants: N, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (A and E already handled).

A strong next step is to pick a word that fills positions 2-4 with common remaining letters, ensuring we avoid the ruled-out set. A good candidate is “LINED.”
- L in 1 ✓
- I, N, D have not been ruled out.
- Ends with E ✓
- Does not contain S, A, T, V, R ✔

Let’s check:
- LINED – L I N D E
  - L: correct position 1
  - I, N, D: new letters
  - E: correct position 5
  - No excluded letters used.

Therefore, LINED is a solid next guess.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I\'ll choose a word that uses some of these.

From all the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. LEVER → L(✓) E(-) V(x) E(-) R(x)
   - L is confirmed in position 1.
   - V, R not in the word.
   - E is only in position 5 (the two E’s in positions 2 & 4 are wrong).

3. LINED → L(✓) I(x) N(✓) E(-) D(x)
   - Word now looks like: L _ N _ E
   - I and D are NOT in the word.
   - N is confirmed in position 3.

So the pattern is: L _ N _ E  
We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that have NOT yet been ruled out and don’t repeat any excluded letters.

Excluded letters so far (must avoid): S, A, T, V, R, I, D  
Remaining common consonants for positions 2 and 4: C, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits L _ N _ E with valid letters.  
Candidate choices:
- LANCE – A already excluded  
- LUNGE – U is allowed, G allowed  
- LYNCH – Y, C, H allowed  
- LUNGE and LYNCH both fit.

LUNGE uses U (position 2) and G (position 4).  
Both U and G have not been ruled out.

Therefore, LUNGE is a good next guess.
