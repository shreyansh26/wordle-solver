For the first guess, the optimal strategy is to choose a 5-letter word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common letters in English include vowels like E, A, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word covers a mix of these letters without repeating any letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. After considering these, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and vowels without repetition.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correctly placed in the first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word must:
1. Start with S.
2. Not contain L, A, T, or E.

Possible next steps:
- Second letter: cannot be L or A or T or E. Common consonants left: C, R, N, M, P, etc.
- Third letter: same constraints.
- Fourth letter: same constraints.
- Fifth letter: same constraints.

We need a word that starts with S, does not contain L/A/T/E, and uses common remaining letters. Good candidate: ""SHOCK"" (S, H, O, C, K) - none of the forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (H, O, C, K).

Other options could be ""SICKO"" or ""SNICK"", but ""SHOCK"" seems to cover a good range of new letters.

So far we have:
- First letter is definitely S.
- Letters L, A, T, E, H, O, C, K are all NOT in the word (all marked ×).

That leaves the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word looks like S _ _ _ _ and its other four letters come from the allowed set above.

A quick scan of common English words that start with S and avoid those forbidden letters:
- SOUND – but O and U are still possible? Wait, O was in SHOCK and marked ×, so O is out. U is still possible.
- SURGE – but G and E are still possible? E was in SLATE and marked ×, so E is out. G is still possible.
- SPIRE – E is out.
- SWORD – O is out.
- SING/SINO – I, N, G are still possible.
- SWING – W is allowed, N, G, I are allowed.

Let’s pick a candidate that uses several of the most common remaining consonants and vowels (I and U are still allowed vowels).

“SING_” doesn’t form common words easily; “SINGE” has E (forbidden).  
“SURGE” has E (forbidden).

Try “SURFY” – but Y is less common.  
Try “SURGE” – still E.  
Try “SING_” – maybe “SING_” isn’t viable.

Another common word I notice is “SINUS” – but double S is possible, and all letters are allowed (S, I, N, U, S). However, we already know the first letter is S, so the second S would be in position 5 – but double S is unusual.

Wait, let’s list some common S-words avoiding the banned letters:
- SINUS
- SINGH/SING_ (H is out)
- SWORD (O is out)
- SUNDER (too long)
- SUNNY (O is out, Y is possible)
- SQUID (Q, U, I, D)
- SQUID has Q, U, I, D – all allowed.

- SPRIG – but G is allowed, and it fits S P R I G.
- SFRIG – not a word.

Let’s choose “SPRIG” because it uses three new allowed consonants (P, R, G) and fits the constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common letters in English include vowels like E, A, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word covers a mix of these letters without repeating any letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. After considering these, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and vowels without repetition.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correctly placed in the first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word must:

2. Not contain L, A, T, or E.

Possible next steps:
- Second letter: cannot be L or A or T or E. Common consonants left: C, R, N, M, P, etc.
- Third letter: same constraints.
- Fourth letter: same constraints.
- Fifth letter: same constraints.

We need a word that starts with S, does not contain L/A/T/E, and uses common remaining letters. Good candidate: ""SHOCK"" (S, H, O, C, K) - none of the forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (H, O, C, K).

- First letter is definitely S.
- Letters L, A, T, E, H, O, C, K are all NOT in the word (all marked ×).

That leaves the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word looks like S _ _ _ _ and its other four letters come from the allowed set above.

A quick scan of common English words that start with S and avoid those forbidden letters:
- SOUND – but O and U are still possible? Wait, O was in SHOCK and marked ×, so O is out. U is still possible.
- SURGE – but G and E are still possible? E was in SLATE and marked ×, so E is out. G is still possible.
- SPIRE – E is out.
- SWORD – O is out.
- SING/SINO – I, N, G are still possible.
- SWING – W is allowed, N, G, I are allowed.

Let’s pick a candidate that uses several of the most common remaining consonants and vowels (I and U are still allowed vowels).

“SING_” doesn’t form common words easily; “SINGE” has E (forbidden).  
“SURGE” has E (forbidden).

Try “SURFY” – but Y is less common.  
Try “SURGE” – still E.  
Try “SING_” – maybe “SING_” isn’t viable.

Another common word I notice is “SINUS” – but double S is possible, and all letters are allowed (S, I, N, U, S). However, we already know the first letter is S, so the second S would be in position 5 – but double S is unusual.

Wait, let’s list some common S-words avoiding the banned letters:
- SINUS
- SINGH/SING_ (H is out)
- SWORD (O is out)
- SUNDER (too long)
- SUNNY (O is out, Y is possible)
- SQUID (Q, U, I, D)
- SQUID has Q, U, I, D – all allowed.

“SQUID” is a valid 5-letter word, starts with S, and only uses allowed letters (S, Q, U, I, D).

Let me summarize the definitive information we have so far:

1. Fixed letters and positions:

   - Position 5: G (✓ in SPRIG)

2. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (all marked ×):
   L, A, T, E, H, O, C, K, Q, U, D, P, R

3. Letter that is in the word but NOT in the position guessed:
   I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SQUID and SPRIG feedback)

4. Word pattern so far:
   S _ _ _ G

5. Allowed letters for positions 2 and 3 (from remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones):
   B, F, J, M, N, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. Since I must appear somewhere, and the only remaining possible positions are 2 and 3 (position 4 is excluded for I), the word must contain I in either position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S I _ _ G
- S _ I _ G

But position 5 is G, so possible words:
- S I _ I G (but this would have two I's, which is possible but less common)
- S I _ _ G
- S _ I _ G

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with S and ending with G that contain I but avoid all forbidden letters:

- SING_ - but position 4 is not I
- ""SING"" is too short
- ""S I N G"" - but we need 5 letters
- ""S I N G"" + another letter - but we've used G at end

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need S _ _ _ G with I appearing in position 2 or 3, and avoiding all forbidden letters.

Possible combinations:
- S I N G - but this is 4 letters
- S I N G + ? - but G is already at end
- Actually we need 5 letters: S _ _ _ G with I in position 2 or 3

Let me list possible words:
- S I N G - no, 4 letters
- S W I N G - but W and N are allowed, and I is in position 3, which is allowed
- Check letters in SWING:
  - S (position 1 ✓)
  - W (allowed)
  - I (must be somewhere, position 3 is allowed)
  - N (allowed)
  - G (position 5 ✓)
  - All letters are from allowed set

SWING fits all constraints perfectly:
- Starts with S
- Ends with G
- Contains I (in position 3, which wasn't excluded)
- Doesn't contain any forbidden letters
- Is a common 5-letter word

Therefore, the correct next guess is SWING.
