For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

""STARE"" seems like a strong choice because it uses 5 of the top 10 most common letters (S, T, A, R, E), giving maximum coverage for potential matches in the secret word.

From the feedback on STARE:

1. S(✓) → The letter S is in the word and in the first position.
2. T(-) → T is in the word but not in the second position.
3. A(-) → A is in the word but not in the third position.
4. R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
5. E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- First letter is S.
- Word contains T and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Word does not contain R or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that includes both T and A, with T not in position 2 and A not in position 3.

Possible combinations:
- S _ _ T A
- S _ A T _
- S A _ T _
- S _ _ A T
- S T _ A _
- S T A _ _

But since A is not in position 3 and T is not in position 2, we can eliminate:
- S T A _ _ (T in position 2 is invalid)
- S _ A T _ (A in position 3 is invalid)

Looking at valid patterns:
- S _ _ T A
- S _ A T _
- S A _ T _
- S _ _ A T
- S T _ A _

Let me think of words fitting these patterns that also avoid R and E.

Some possibilities:
- SLANT (but N is common and this uses L)
- SPAT_ (but need valid word)
- SWATH (but has H)
- SALTY (but has Y and L)
- SATIN (but has I and N)
- SITAR (but has R which is excluded)
- STAIN (but has E-like structure)
- STAMP (but has P and M)

Actually, SALTY seems good:
- S A L T Y → checks:
  - Starts with S ✓
  - Contains T and A ✓
  - T not in position 2 (it's in 4) ✓
  - A not in position 3 (it's in 2) ✓
  - No R or E ✓

But let me double-check another option for better letter coverage. Another word could be SWATH:
- S W A T H → has H which might not be optimal.

SALTY seems the most straightforward valid word given constraints.
