For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like T, N, S, R, L).

After analyzing common letter frequencies in English words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us coverage of 5 different common letters that could help reveal multiple correct letters or their positions in the target word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is correct and in the right spot (1st letter).  
- T is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains T somewhere, but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-” there).
3. It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Good consonants to try next, besides T, include R, N, C, H, P, D, etc.  
For vowels we can use I, O, or U (since A and E are ruled out).

A smart next word keeps the S in place and tries new letters while placing T in a new spot.  
A word like “SPORT”:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves T to position 5 (new position).
- Adds P, R, O (all new letters, none ruled out yet).

That seems optimal for gathering more information.

This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The best strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like T, N, S, R, L).\n\nAfter analyzing common letter frequencies in English words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (very common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis combination gives us coverage of 5 different common letters that could help reveal multiple correct letters or their positions in the target word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n\n- S is correct and in the right spot (1st letter).  \n- T is in the word but in the wrong position.  \n- L, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo far we know:\n1. The word starts with S.\n2. It contains T somewhere, but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-” there).\n3. It does NOT contain L, A, or E.\n\nGood consonants to try next, besides T, include R, N, C, H, P, D, etc.  \nFor vowels we can use I, O, or U (since A and E are ruled out).\n\nA smart next word keeps the S in place and tries new letters while placing T in a new spot.  \nA word like “SPORT”:\n- Keeps S in position 1.\n- Moves T to position 5 (new position).\n- Adds P, R, O (all new letters, none ruled out yet).\n\nThat seems optimal for gathering more information.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\n1.

Summary of knowledge so far:

1. SLATE: S✓, L×, A×, T-, E×
2. SPORT: S✓, P×, O×, R✓, T✓
3. SHIRT: S✓, H×, I✓, R✓, T✓

From these three rows we can lock down the pattern:

- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: not L, P, O, H, A, E → only remaining common letters for this slot are consonants such as C, F, G, K, M, N, V, W, Y plus vowels U (I already placed below)
- Position 3: I (fixed) — from SHIRT feedback
- Position 4: R (fixed) — from SPORT feedback
- Position 5: T (fixed) — from SPORT feedback

So the pattern is S _ I R T.

Allowed letters for position 2 (must be a consonant because vowels I, A, E, O are eliminated and U rarely appears there) and still unused: C, F, G, K, M, N, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches S _ I R T.

Valid dictionary words that fit:
- SCIRT (archaic, unlikely)
- SKIRT (perfect fit)

SKIRT:
- Uses K in position 2, which is still allowed.
- All letters S, K, I, R, T have not been ruled out.
- It matches the locked pattern S _ I R T.

This should be our next guess.
