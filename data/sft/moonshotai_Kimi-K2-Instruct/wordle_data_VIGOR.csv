For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides maximum information. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. After considering options, I think ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English
- It has 2 vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- It's a valid English word

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback:

- Guess 1 (SLATE) ⇒ S, L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word.
- Guess 2 (CRONY) ⇒ C, N, Y are NOT in the word, but R and O ARE in the word (wrong position).

So far we know:
- Letters to exclude: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O (but neither is in position 2 or 3 respectively)

Next word should:
1. Use R and O in different positions than before.
2. Use only letters not yet ruled out, and common consonants/vowels that remain (like I, U, D, H, M, K, G, etc.).

Some valid letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, R, O.

Good candidates:
- CHORD → but C and D are allowed? C is excluded (x), D is okay. But H is okay. But C is out so CHORD won’t work.
- DRUM → uses D, R, U, M. R is known to be in the word (but not in position 2). This uses R in position 1 (ok), and O is not used here, but we know O must be in the word somewhere. So DRUM doesn’t contain O, so it’s invalid.
- GOURD → G, O, U, R, D. Uses O and R, both known to be in the word. Positions: O is position 2 (was in position 3 before), R is position 4 (was in position 2 before). This seems valid.

Let me verify GOURD:
- G (new), O (known), U (new), R (known), D (new).
- No letters from the excluded set {S,L,A,T,E,C,N,Y}.
- O is in position 2 (was in 3 before – ok).
- R is in position 4 (was in 2 before – ok).
- 5-letter word, valid.

Another option is HUMOR, but:
- H (new), U (new), M (new), O (known), R (known).
- Positions: O in 4 (was in 3 before), R in 5 (was in 2 before).
- Also valid, but GOURD seems slightly more common.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. After considering options, I think ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English
- It has 2 vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
- It's a valid English word

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All letters in ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) received 'x' feedback, meaning none of these letters are in the secret word at all.  
Therefore the secret word must be composed entirely of letters **not** in {S, L, A, T, E}.  

I should now pick a word using completely different letters to maximize information.  
Good candidates use common consonants and vowels besides A and E, such as O, U, I, R, N, D, C, H, M, K, etc.  
A strong second-choice word is ""CRONY"" because:
- C, R, O, N, Y – none of these were in SLATE, so they’re all new.
- It includes two vowels (O, Y) and three high-frequency consonants (C, R, N).
- It’s a valid English word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- Guess 1 (SLATE) ⇒ S, L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word.
- Guess 2 (CRONY) ⇒ C, N, Y are NOT in the word, but R and O ARE in the word (wrong position).

So far we know:
- Letters to exclude: S, L, A, T, E, C, N, Y
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O (but neither is in position 2 or 3 respectively)

Next word should:
1. Use R and O in different positions than before.
2. Use only letters not yet ruled out, and common consonants/vowels that remain (like I, U, D, H, M, K, G, etc.).

Some valid letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, R, O.

Good candidates:
- CHORD → but C and D are allowed? C is excluded (x), D is okay. But H is okay. But C is out so CHORD won’t work.
- DRUM → uses D, R, U, M. R is known to be in the word (but not in position 2). This uses R in position 1 (ok), and O is not used here, but we know O must be in the word somewhere. So DRUM doesn’t contain O, so it’s invalid.
- GOURD → G, O, U, R, D. Uses O and R, both known to be in the word. Positions: O is position 2 (was in position 3 before), R is position 4 (was in position 2 before). This seems valid.

Let me verify GOURD:
- G (new), O (known), U (new), R (known), D (new).
- No letters from the excluded set {S,L,A,T,E,C,N,Y}.
- O is in position 2 (was in 3 before – ok).
- R is in position 4 (was in 2 before – ok).
- 5-letter word, valid.

Another option is HUMOR, but:
- H (new), U (new), M (new), O (known), R (known).
- Positions: O in 4 (was in 3 before), R in 5 (was in 2 before).
- Also valid, but GOURD seems slightly more common.

I’ll go with GOURD.

- Used in word: I,G,O,R
- Available letters not yet excluded or used: B,F,H,K,M,P,Q,W,X,Z

But we know R must appear, and it already appears in positions 2 and 5 (but position 2 is I, 5 is R). Wait, no - the word structure is _ I G O R, and we know R is in position 5, so position 1 can be any allowed letter.

But looking at English words, common 5-letter words ending in ""IGOR"":
