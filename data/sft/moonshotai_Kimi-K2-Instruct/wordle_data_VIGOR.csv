For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and ideally include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the most commonly recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting several letters in the word and determining their positions or presence.

Every single letter in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) has been marked as “not in the word” (x).  
That means:
- We must avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
- We still have not tested other common consonants and vowels.  
A good next guess therefore uses letters not yet tried—especially common ones like R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word but not yet placed: R and O (each receives “-” at its guessed position)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and O.  
2. Contains none of the excluded letters (S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D).  
3. Uses fresh positions for R and O so we can test where they actually belong.

Remaining common letters that have not been excluded: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for a word with R and O plus three of these unused letters, placed so that R and O are in new positions compared with ROUND.  
One such word is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P), but it only contains R and not O.  
Another candidate is “GRIOT”: it has R and O plus three unused consonants, but we haven’t checked the dictionary validity yet.

A simpler, dictionary-valid choice is “BROCK”:
- B, R, O, C, K  
- Contains both R and O.  
- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D appear.  
- R and O are in different positions than in ROUND (positions 2 and 3 in BROCK vs. 1 and 2 in ROUND).

2. Avoid every letter already ruled out.
3. Use only letters that have never been guessed or that have only been marked “-”.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,VIGOR,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and ideally include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the most commonly recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting several letters in the word and determining their positions or presence.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Every single letter in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) has been marked as “not in the word” (x).  
That means:
- We must avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
- We still have not tested other common consonants and vowels.  
A good next guess therefore uses letters not yet tried—especially common ones like R, O, I, N, C, U, D, etc.  
The word “ROUND” is a strong candidate because it:
- contains R, O, U, N, D (none of which were in SLATE).  
- gives us two new vowels (O, U) and three common consonants (R, N, D).

<guess>ROUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word but not yet placed: R and O (each receives “-” at its guessed position)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and O.  
2. Contains none of the excluded letters (S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D).  
3. Uses fresh positions for R and O so we can test where they actually belong.

Remaining common letters that have not been excluded: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for a word with R and O plus three of these unused letters, placed so that R and O are in new positions compared with ROUND.  
One such word is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P), but it only contains R and not O.  
Another candidate is “GRIOT”: it has R and O plus three unused consonants, but we haven’t checked the dictionary validity yet.

A simpler, dictionary-valid choice is “BROCK”:
- B, R, O, C, K  
- Contains both R and O.  
- None of the letters S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D appear.  
- R and O are in different positions than in ROUND (positions 2 and 3 in BROCK vs. 1 and 2 in ROUND).

Let’s go with BROCK.

From every guess so far, the letters that are **not** in the word (x-marked) are:
S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D, B, C, K, P, X, Y

Letters that the word **must** contain (because they have received only “-” and never “x”) are:
R, O

Letters we have **never used yet** (and therefore are not yet excluded) are:
F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses both R and O.
2. Uses three letters chosen only from the still-allowed pool {F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, Z}.
3. Puts R and O in positions we have not yet tried so we can nail down their correct spots.

Looking at positional history:
- ROUND: R in 1st, O in 2nd
- BROCK: R in 2nd, O in 3rd
- PROXY: R in 2nd, O in 3rd  (same as BROCK)

We have never tried R in 3rd and O in 4th, so let’s aim for that.

Scanning the dictionary, a valid word that satisfies all constraints is **FRIGO** (though it might be obscure), **GRIOT**, **GRIOT** again, but those reuse letters or have repeated letters.  
Another valid English word is **GRIOT** – but it repeats I and T (T is excluded).  
A cleaner choice is **GRIOT** – but T is out.

Let’s pick **GRIOT** – but T is excluded.

Let’s find another: **VIGOR** – but R is at 4th, O at 5th.  
We need to make sure we have not used any excluded letters.

Checking **VIGOR**: V, I, G, O, R – none of these letters are in the exclusion list.  
R is in 4th position (never tried), O in 5th (never tried).  
This gives us new positional tests for R and O.

Therefore, **VIGOR** is a valid word under the rules.
