For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. I'll use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

Looking at letter frequency, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N are among the most common. A word like ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E which covers 5 of these high-frequency letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions (or not in the word at all).

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: I, S, E
- Letters in the word: R, A
- R and A are NOT in positions 1 and 2 respectively

Now I need a new word that:
- Contains R and A somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively)
- Does NOT contain I, S, or E
- Uses other frequent consonants and vowels (since we’ve eliminated I, S, E)

Good remaining frequent consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M  
Good remaining vowels: O, U  

I’ll try a word that has R and A in new positions and uses some of these remaining frequent letters.  
One good candidate is “TRAIN” but I can’t use I or N (N is okay).  
Another is “RATIO” but I can’t use I or O (O is okay).  
Another is “RADIO” but again I.  
“TAURO” is not a word.  
“CARON” is not a word.  
“DAUNT” has no R or A.  
“BRAND” has R and A, but A is in position 2 (forbidden).  
“GRANT” has R and A, A is in position 2 (forbidden).  
“TRAMP” has R and A, A is in position 2 (forbidden).  
“TORAN” is not a word.

“RATAN” is not a word.  
“CAROL” has R and A, A is in position 2 (forbidden).  
“CARRY” has R and A, A is in position 2 (forbidden).  

Let me think of words with R not in position 1 and A not in position 2.  
“ABORT” has A in position 1 (allowed) and R in position 3, but uses O and T.  
“ACORN” has A in position 1, R in position 3.  
“ACORN” seems valid: A (position 1, allowed), C, O, R (position 3), N.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R is in the word but not at position 1
- A is in the word but not at position 2

- A is in the word but not at position 1
- C is in the word but not at position 2
- O is in the word AND at position 3
- R is in the word but not at position 4
- N is NOT in the word

Key facts now:
Letters known to be in the word: A, C, O, R
- Positions ruled out so far:
  - A ≠ 1, 2
  - C ≠ 2
  - O is confirmed at 3
  - R ≠ 1, 4

Letters NOT in the word: I, S, E, N

Word template so far: _ _ O _ _
- A must go in position 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, so A must be 4 or 5)
- R must go in position 2, 3, or 5 (but 3 is O, so R must be 2 or 5)
- C must go in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is O, and 4 or 5 may be A/R, so C could be 1 or 4 or 5)

Possible scenarios:
- If A is at 4: then R must be at 2, C must be at 1 or 5
- If A is at 5: then R could be at 2, C could be at 1 or 4

Candidate words using remaining letters (avoiding I, S, E, N):
- C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, A at 4, then last letter must be from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, etc.) → CR_ _ _
  - CRAB? has B, but B is allowed
  - CRAG? has G
  - CRAM? has M
  - CRAP? has P
  - CRAV? not a word
  - CRAW? has W
  - CRAY? has Y
- C at 5: then word would be _ R O A C
  - Need first letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, etc.
  - BROAC? not a word
  - DROAC? not a word
- A at 5, C at 1: C _ O R A
  - CORRA? not a word
  - C R O _ A
  - Need second letter: C R O _ A → C A O R A? no, A is used
  - C H O R A? no H yet
  - C L O R A? no L yet
  - C O R A? but we need 5 letters

Most promising seems CR_ A _ or CR_ _ A

CRAB is 4 letters, need 5: CRAB_? but what fifth letter?
CRAMP? has M, P - but P is allowed
CRAMP: C R A M P → but A would be at 3 (O is there) → no

Wait, let's think differently:
Positions: _ _ O _ _
- A must be at 4 or 5
- R must be at 2 or 5
- C must be at 1, 4, or 5

Case 1: A at 4, then R must be at 2, C must be at 1 or 5
- C R O A _ → need fifth letter
  - C R O A D (valid word CROAD? no)
  - C R O A K (CROAK is valid)
- _ R O A C → R at 2, A at 4, C at 5: ? R O A C
  - Need first letter: B, D, F, etc.
  - B R O A C? not a word
  - D R O A C? not a word

Case 2: A at 5, then R could be at 2, C at 1 or 4
- C R O _ A → need fourth letter
  - C R O W A? W is allowed
  - C R O M A? M is allowed
  - C R O M A → CROMA is not standard
  - C R O C A? C is already used at 1
- _ R O C A → R at 2, C at 4, A at 5
  - Need first letter: B, D, etc.
  - B R O C A (BROCA is not a word)
  - D R O C A (DROCA is not a word)

Best valid word seems CROAK: C R O A K
Check positions:
- C: position 1 → allowed (C not yet ruled out here)
- R: position 2 → allowed (R not at 1 or 4)
- O: position 3 → confirmed ✓
- A: position 4 → allowed (A not at 1 or 2)
- K: new letter, no restrictions

CROAK uses all known letters correctly positioned and introduces K.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly at position 3.
- A is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4, so it must be 2 or 5.
- C is in the word but not at position 2, so it must be 1, 4, or 5.
- The only word fitting these constraints is CROAK, with:
  - C at 1 (allowed)
  - R at 2 (allowed)
  - O at 3 (confirmed)
  - A at 4 (allowed)
  - K is a new letter to test

- If A is at 5: then R could be at 2, C could be at 1 or 4

Candidate words using remaining letters (avoiding I, S, E, N):
- C at 1, R at 2, O at 3, A at 4, then last letter must be from remaining (B, D, F, G, H, etc.) → CR_ _ _
  - CRAB? has B, but B is allowed
  - CRAG? has G
  - CRAM? has M
  - CRAP? has P
  - CRAV? not a word
  - CRAW? has W
  - CRAY? has Y
- C at 5: then word would be _ R O A C
  - Need first letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, etc.
  - BROAC? not a word
  - DROAC? not a word
- A at 5, C at 1: C _ O R A
  - CORRA? not a word
  - C R O _ A
  - Need second letter: C R O _ A → C A O R A? no, A is used
  - C H O R A? no H yet
  - C L O R A? no L yet
  - C O R A? but we need 5 letters

Most promising seems CR_ A _ or CR_ _ A

CRAB is 4 letters, need 5: CRAB_? but what fifth letter?
CRAMP? has M, P - but P is allowed
CRAMP: C R A M P → but A would be at 3 (O is there) → no

Wait, let's think differently:
Positions: _ _ O _ _
- A must be at 4 or 5
- R must be at 2 or 5
- C must be at 1, 4, or 5

Case 1: A at 4, then R must be at 2, C must be at 1 or 5
- C R O A _ → need fifth letter
  - C R O A D (valid word CROAD? no)
  - C R O A K (CROAK is valid)
- _ R O A C → R at 2, A at 4, C at 5: ? R O A C
  - Need first letter: B, D, F, etc.
  - B R O A C? not a word
  - D R O A C? not a word

Case 2: A at 5, then R could be at 2, C at 1 or 4
- C R O _ A → need fourth letter
  - C R O W A? W is allowed
  - C R O M A? M is allowed
  - C R O M A → CROMA is not standard
  - C R O C A? C is already used at 1
- _ R O C A → R at 2, C at 4, A at 5
  - Need first letter: B, D, etc.
  - B R O C A (BROCA is not a word)
  - D R O C A (DROCA is not a word)

Best valid word seems CROAK: C R O A K
Check positions:
- C: position 1 → allowed (C not yet ruled out here)
- R: position 2 → allowed (R not at 1 or 4)
- O: position 3 → confirmed ✓
- A: position 4 → allowed (A not at 1 or 2)
- K: new letter, no restrictions

CROAK uses all known letters correctly positioned and introduces K.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly at position 3.
- A is in the word but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not at positions 1 or 4, so it must be 2 or 5.
- C is in the word but not at position 2, so it must be 1, 4, or 5.
- The only word fitting these constraints is CROAK, with:
  - C at 1 (allowed)
  - R at 2 (allowed)
  - O at 3 (confirmed)
  - A at 4 (allowed)
  - K is a new letter to test",Guess 3: CROAK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) A(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
