For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains as many of these high-frequency consonants and vowels as possible.

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE because it contains three very common consonants (C, R, N), the most common vowel (A), and the most common letter overall (E). This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

That immediately eliminates all words containing C, R, A, N.  
Since E is present but not in position 5, it must be in positions 1–4.

Next I should pick a word that:
1. Uses none of C, R, A, N.
2. Includes E placed in one of positions 1–4.
3. Introduces other high-frequency letters (T, S, L, I, O, U, D, H, G, B, M, P, F, K, etc.) to maximize information gain.

Looking at common words that fit:
- ELDER
- STEEL (but repeats E)
- SLEET
- PLEBE
- BESOM
- TEMPO (no E)
- STOLE
- GLIDE
- STOKE
- BUETS (not a valid word)

I’ll pick SLEET because it:
- Contains E in position 2 (satisfies feedback).
- Brings in S, L, T (high-frequency consonants).
- Has no C, R, A, N.

   – L is again “-”, which confirms L is in the word but NOT in position 3 either (because we already knew it wasn’t in position 2, and now it also isn’t in position 3).

So far:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- L exists but cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, D.  
- Allowed positions for L: 1 or 5.  

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E as the 4th letter.  
- L must appear exactly once, at either position 1 or 5.  
- Must not contain any of the eliminated letters.  

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Quick brainstorm for words matching pattern _ _ _ E _ with L in 1 or 5 and no banned letters:
- LO_E_ → but we need 5 letters, so LOBEL, LOBES, LOGEE, LOGES, LOGE_, etc.  
  LOBEL: contains L, B, O, E, L (two L’s; we only know one L).  
  LOGEE: L O G E E → two E’s, but we don’t know if word has more than one E.  
  Let’s avoid double letters for now.

1. Are 5-letter valid words.  
2. Have E in position 4.  
3. Have L in position 5 (so L is not in 2 or 3).  
4. Contain none of the banned letters C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, D.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,BEZEL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains as many of these high-frequency consonants and vowels as possible.

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE because it contains three very common consonants (C, R, N), the most common vowel (A), and the most common letter overall (E). This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

That immediately eliminates all words containing C, R, A, N.  
Since E is present but not in position 5, it must be in positions 1–4.

Next I should pick a word that:
1. Uses none of C, R, A, N.
2. Includes E placed in one of positions 1–4.
3. Introduces other high-frequency letters (T, S, L, I, O, U, D, H, G, B, M, P, F, K, etc.) to maximize information gain.

Looking at common words that fit:
- ELDER
- STEEL (but repeats E)
- SLEET
- PLEBE
- BESOM
- TEMPO (no E)
- STOLE
- GLIDE
- STOKE
- BUETS (not a valid word)

I’ll pick SLEET because it:
- Contains E in position 2 (satisfies feedback).
- Brings in S, L, T (high-frequency consonants).
- Has no C, R, A, N.
- Is a valid word.

Alternative: STOLE (E in position 4) or ELBOW (E in position 1).  
SLEET seems balanced.

   - L exists but is not in position 2.  
   - E exists but is not in positions 1, 2, or 3.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, L (positions where they were marked x or -).  
  Actually, L is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- No other letters are locked down yet.

Need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4.  
- Contains L (but not in position 2).  
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, S, T.  
- Uses fresh letters to gain new information.

High-frequency remaining letters: I, O, U, D, G, H, B, M, P, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Candidate words with E in position 4 and no forbidden letters:
- GLIDE → uses G, L, I, D.  
  L is in position 3 (allowed since L is not fixed to any position yet).  
  Contains no C, R, A, N, S, T.

Position 3: V x  (so V is not in the word)  
Position 4: E ✓

We only need to determine the missing third letter (position 3).  
Available letters (not yet ruled out and not used above):  
From earlier bans we eliminated C, R, A, N, S, T, F, I, D, V.  
Remaining common consonants: G, H, J, K, M, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

But… “BEGEL” isn’t a standard English word.  
Let’s double-check standard dictionaries.

The only common English 5-letter word matching the pattern B E _ E L is:

B E G E L – invalid  
B E L E L – invalid  
B E M E L – invalid  
B E P E L – invalid  
B E G E L – invalid  

Wait, there is a recognized word: B E G E L – but it’s “BEGEL” (a variant spelling of “bagel” in some dialects or Yiddish, but not standard Scrabble).

Another candidate: “BEMEL” – not recognized.

Let me re-examine the remaining consonants that were never ruled out.

We have never tested G, H, J, K, M, P, U, W, Y in position 3.

But the dictionary word fitting B E _ E L is actually none of these.  
On closer inspection, the only valid English word of this pattern is:

B E G E L – but it’s not standard.

Wait, let me check Wiktionary or Merriam-Webster:  
“BEGEL” – not listed.  
“BEHEL” – not listed.  
“BEMEL” – not listed.  
“BEPEL” – not listed.  
“BEWEL” – not listed.  
“BEGEL” – not listed.

This suggests I may have made an error earlier.  
Rechecking the feedback:

Guess 4: BEVEL → Feedback: B(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) L(✓)

So the pattern is definitely B E _ E L.

The only standard English word matching B E _ E L is actually “B E G E L” – but it’s not recognized.

I must have missed a word. Let me step back:

Search a word list for “BE*EL”:

BEZEL – but Z was never tested and we haven’t eliminated it.  
But we never saw feedback on Z yet.  
“BEZEL” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints:
- Z has never been tried, so it’s still possible.  
- All other letters B, E, L are confirmed.  
- No banned letters are used.

Therefore, the correct word must be BEZEL.

So the next (and final) guess is BEZEL.
