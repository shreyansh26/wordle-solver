For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good starting word uses many of these high-frequency letters. Some popular choices are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T) 
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""STARE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

From the latest feedback on THREW:

1. T(✓) – T is confirmed in first position.
2. H(x) – H is not in the word.
3. R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 3rd position (it was in position 3 here).
4. E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 4th position.
5. W(x) – W is not in the word.

Additional facts already gathered:
- T is fixed in position 1.
- R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it cannot be in 1, 3).
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (it cannot be in 1, 4, 5).
- Forbidden letters so far: S, A, I, D, H, W.

We need a word of the form T _ _ _ _ that includes both R and E, places R in positions 2,4, or 5, places E in positions 2,3, or 5, and uses none of the forbidden letters.

Let’s examine possible placements for R and E:

- If R is in position 2: T R _ _ _
  Then E must be in 3 or 5.
  Candidates: T R E _ _, T R _ _ E
  Examples: TREAT – but A is forbidden.
            TREND – uses N and D; D is forbidden.
            TRESS – S is forbidden.
            TROPE – O, P allowed; E is in 4, but E cannot be in 4. (invalid)
            TRUER – U allowed; E in 4 (invalid)
            TREES – S forbidden
            TREWS – W forbidden
            – no good candidate here.

- If R is in position 4: T _ _ R _
  Then E must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  Candidates: T E _ R _, T _ E R _, T _ _ R E
  Examples: T E A R S – A,S forbidden
            T E N R Y – N,Y allowed, E in 2, R in 4
            T E L R Y – no word like TELRY
            T A R R E – A forbidden
            T O R E Z – no such word
            T U R E X – no such word
            T E R R Y – E in 2, R in 3 (invalid for this branch)
            – TERRY: actually fits T _ RRY, but R must be in 4, so T _ R _ _ , not 3.

Wait, let’s try: T _ _ R E
  This would put E in 5, which is allowed for E (since E cannot be in 4 or 1, 5 is okay).
  Example: T U R K E – no
            T O R C E – no
            T I G E R – I forbidden
            T A C E R – A forbidden
            T A M E R – A forbidden
            T O M E R – no
            T E N O R – E in 2, R in 4: T E N O R
            – TENOR looks valid and uses allowed letters T,E,N,O,R, with R in 4 and E in 2.

- If R is in position 5: T _ _ _ R
  Then E must be in 2 or 3.
  Candidates: T E _ _ R, T _ E _ R
  Examples: T E N O R – same as above, but R is in 5 here. TENOR has R in 4.
            T E M P R – no
            T E C A R – A forbidden
            T E L A R – A forbidden
            T E L O R – no such word
            T E C O R – no
            T E P O R – no
            – nothing useful.

Thus, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is TENOR.
