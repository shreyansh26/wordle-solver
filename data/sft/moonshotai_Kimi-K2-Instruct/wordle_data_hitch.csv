Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the optimal strategy is to choose a word with letters that are commonly found in English 5-letter words to maximize information gain. Good starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It covers 5 distinct letters, giving us maximum information
- These are all high-frequency letters in English

All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x,” so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
This eliminates a large chunk of five-letter words, especially those containing vowels A, O, E or the consonants R, S.  

Since we still have six guesses and no vowel information, we should pick a new starter with fresh letters.  
The remaining most common consonants and vowels are:
- Vowels left: I, U  
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A good second-guess word should:
1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
2. Include several of the next most frequent letters.  
3. Remain a valid English five-letter word.

Looking at remaining common letters, “UNTIL” is a strong candidate:  
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L  
- Contains two fresh vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  
- All letters are distinct and none appear in AROSE.

Therefore, I’ll guess “UNTIL” next.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L

Letters we know ARE in the word, but we don’t know their exact positions yet:  
T (green ✓ at position 3)  
I (yellow -, somewhere else)

So our target word is _ _ T _ _ and also contains I somewhere other than position 4.

We need a five-letter word that:
- starts with letters not in {A,R,O,S,E,U,N,L}  
- has T in the 3rd position  
- contains I somewhere (not position 4)  
- uses only letters not eliminated so far (allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T which is already placed)

A quick scan of possible consonant-vowel patterns gives “KITTY” (but two Ts and two Ys, and Y may be rare). Instead, “HITTY” isn’t a common word. “BITTY” is common, but contains two Ts again.  

A better pattern is _ I T _ _ or _ _ T I _, but position 4 is excluded for I. So possible patterns:
- I _ T _ _ 
- _ I T _ _ 
- _ _ T I _ 

Let’s pick “CITIZ” – but “CITIZ” isn’t a valid word.  
“VITIC” – invalid.  
“PITHY” is valid, contains I and T, and only uses allowed letters: P, I, T, H, Y. It also puts I in position 2, which is compatible with the feedback (I is somewhere, just not position 4).

Therefore, I choose PITHY.

Check:
- P, I, T, H, Y – none are in the eliminated set.  
- T is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- I is included, and not in position 4 (matches - in earlier guess).

Good starting words typically contain common vowels and consonants. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"".\n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because:\n- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words\n- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- It covers 5 distinct letters, giving us maximum information\n- These are all high-frequency letters in English\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters from AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x,” so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  \nThis eliminates a large chunk of five-letter words, especially those containing vowels A, O, E or the consonants R, S.  \n\nSince we still have six guesses and no vowel information, we should pick a new starter with fresh letters.  \nThe remaining most common consonants and vowels are:\n- Vowels left: I, U  \n- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nA good second-guess word should:\n1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  \n2. Include several of the next most frequent letters.  \n3. Remain a valid English five-letter word.\n\nLooking at remaining common letters, “UNTIL” is a strong candidate:  \n- Letters: U, N, T, I, L  \n- Contains two fresh vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  \n- All letters are distinct and none appear in AROSE.\n\nTherefore, I’ll guess “UNTIL” next.\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\nLetters we know are NOT in the word (x):  \nA, R, O, S, E, U, N, L\n\nLetters we know ARE in the word, but we don’t know their exact positions yet:  \nT (green ✓ at position 3)  \nI (yellow -, somewhere else)\n\nSo our target word is _ _ T _ _ and also contains I somewhere other than position 4.\n\nWe need a five-letter word that:\n- starts with letters not in {A,R,O,S,E,U,N,L}  \n- has T in the 3rd position  \n- contains I somewhere (not position 4)  \n- uses only letters not eliminated so far (allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T which is already placed)\n\nA quick scan of possible consonant-vowel patterns gives “KITTY” (but two Ts and two Ys, and Y may be rare).

It also puts I in position 2, which is compatible with the feedback (I is somewhere, just not position 4).\n\nTherefore, I choose PITHY.\n\nCheck:\n- P, I, T, H, Y – none are in the eliminated set.  \n- T is in position 3 (matches ✓).  \n- I is included, and not in position 4 (matches - in earlier guess).\n\n<guess>PITHY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: PITHY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) T(✓) H(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
Current information:
1. Letters known to be completely absent: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y
2. Positions:
   - 3rd letter = T (from both UNTIL and PITHY)
   - 2nd letter = I (from PITHY feedback showing I in correct position)
   - Also, H is known to be in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ I T _ _

Letters still available (not eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus I and T already placed.

H must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 (from PITHY feedback). The possible positions for H are 1, 3, or 5. Position 3 is already T, so H must be in position 1 or 5.

The word structure: [H or other] I T [something] [H or other]

Let's consider:
- H _ I T _ _: H I T _ _
- _ I T _ H

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting these patterns. Possible candidates:
- HITCH: H I T C H
- HIT: but needs 5 letters, so HITCH is good.

Check HITCH:
- Letters: H, I, T, C, H
- All letters are allowed (not in the eliminated set)
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 3 (✓)
- H is in positions 1 and 5 - positions 1 is new so this will test H's placement.

HITCH seems perfect.
