This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: S, T, R, N, L

A popular first guess that's known to be effective is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

We now know:
- E is correct in the last position (… … … … E)
- A appears somewhere else in the word (but not position 1)
- R, O, S are not present at all

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E with an A somewhere in positions 2-4.

Good letters to test now are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.  
I also want to place the A in a new spot and try a fresh vowel like I or U.

A strong candidate is “UNTIE”:
- It ends in E (already confirmed)
- Places A in a different position (none here, so this confirms A must appear and I’ll catch it next)
- Introduces new letters U, N, T, I
- Keeps total unique letters high for maximum information

But wait: the feedback showed A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong spot. Since “UNTIE” contains no A, it won’t test the A placement—let’s instead include A in a different spot.

Better pick: “PLATE”:
- Ends with E ✓
- Tests A in position 3
- Adds P, L, T (all new)
- Reuses none of the eliminated letters R, O, S

Current confirmed information:
- The word ends in E (…E).
- Letters L, A, T are in the word and in these exact positions: _ L A T E.

So the secret word must be of the form _ L A T E.  
Only the first letter is missing.

Letters already ruled out (from earlier turns): P, R, O, S.

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with any letter not yet excluded and matches the pattern ?LATE.

Common consonants not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, etc.

Valid candidate words:
- BLATE (archaic, but valid)
- CLATE (not a standard word)
- FLATE (not a standard word)
- GLATE (not a standard word)
- SLATE (S is ruled out)
- PLATE (already used, ruled out P)

The only standard English word that fits is ""BLATE"", but it’s uncommon. A more common word is ""SLATE"", but S is already ruled out.

Wait, let me reconsider: ""CLATE"" is not valid. ""GLATE"" is not valid. ""FLATE"" is not valid. ""BLATE"" is valid but rare. There’s actually no common 5-letter word that fits ?LATE except SLATE (invalid) and PLATE (used). 

This suggests I might have misread the feedback. The feedback PLATE -> P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) means:
- P is not in the word at all (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) - position 2
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) - position 3
- T is in the word and in the correct position (✓) - position 4
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) - position 5

Thus the word is definitely _ L A T E, and we just need the first letter.

Letters not yet ruled out for position 1: all except R, O, S, P.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in LATE:
- BLATE (valid but obsolete)
- CLATE (invalid)
- ELATE (valid!)
- GLATE (invalid)
- SLATE (invalid, S ruled out)

The most common valid word is ELATE. Since E is already in position 5, it can appear elsewhere too.
