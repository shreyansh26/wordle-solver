This is the first guess, so we have no prior information. The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L, etc.

A good first guess should:
1. Use distinct common letters
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z)

Some strong first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE. Among these, ""CRANE"" is a particularly good choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).

Since A is the only confirmed letter and we know it’s not in position 2, we want a new guess that:
1. Includes A (and puts it somewhere other than position 2).
2. Avoids C, R, N, E entirely.
3. Adds other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.

Good remaining letters: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, M, P, B, K, H, G, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STOAD”:
- S, T, O, D haven’t been used.
- A is present but now in position 3 (different from position 2 in CRANE).
- Uses common consonants S and T plus vowel O to gather more information.

- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out yet
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information

- Uses common letters and keeps A in a new position

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so we have no prior information. The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like S, T, R, N, L, etc.

A good first guess should:
1. Use distinct common letters
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z)

Some strong first guesses include: SLATE, CRANE, CRISP, STARE. Among these, ""CRANE"" is a particularly good choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).

Since A is the only confirmed letter and we know it’s not in position 2, we want a new guess that:
1. Includes A (and puts it somewhere other than position 2).
2. Avoids C, R, N, E entirely.
3. Adds other common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet.

Good remaining letters: S, T, L, D, I, O, U, M, P, B, K, H, G, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “STOAD”:
- S, T, O, D haven’t been used.
- A is present but now in position 3 (different from position 2 in CRANE).
- Uses common consonants S and T plus vowel O to gather more information.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, O, D
Letter definitely IN the word: A (but it is NOT in positions 2 or 4)

So A must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3 or 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 1, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out yet
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining common vowels: I, U, (A already known)

A good candidate is “BAULK”:
- Starts with A in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces B, U, L, K – none of which have been used or disallowed
- Uses common letters and keeps A in a new position

Another option is “PLUMB” but this doesn’t use A. Since A is confirmed, we should use it.

“BAULK” seems optimal.
