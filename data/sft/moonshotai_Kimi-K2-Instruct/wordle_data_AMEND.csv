- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the maximum amount of information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often considered an excellent starting word because it contains:
- All five very common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Letters that appear frequently in English words

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities regardless of what the actual secret word is.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct 1st position.
- R is NOT in the word (x).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So we now know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. Word contains E, but E is not in position 5.
3. Word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word:
- Starting with A.
- Containing E (but not in position 5).
- Without R, O, S.

Possible positions for E: 2, 3, or 4.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with A, containing E, excluding R/O/S:
Examples: ABIDE, ALIKE, ALIVE, AGILE, AMBLE, ANGLE, APPLE (but P is repeated), etc.

""ABIDE"" is a good candidate:
- Starts with A.
- Contains E in position 5 - BUT we know E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

""ALIKE"":
- Starts with A.
- E in position 5 - invalid for same reason.

""ALIVE"":

""AGILE"":

""ACUTE"":

""ABASE"":

Wait, this shows many common words have E at the end. Let's look for words with E in positions 2,3, or 4:

""AERIE"" - has E in positions 2 and 4, but:
- Contains R - invalid (R is not in word).

""AGENT"":
- Starts with A.
- E in position 2.
- No R, O, S.
- Letters: A, G, E, N, T - all allowed.

This seems valid.

Based on the feedback, the word must start with A, contain E (but not in the last position), and cannot have R, O, or S. The word ""AGENT"" fits these constraints.
