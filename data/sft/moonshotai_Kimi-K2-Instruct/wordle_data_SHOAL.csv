This is the first guess, so there's no feedback to analyze yet. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize the information gained.
3. Uses vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SLATE"". These words cover many common letters and give good coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

From the feedback:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) — so it must be the 3rd letter: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (with O fixed at position 3)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Possible positions for A: could be 2, 4, or 5
- Possible positions for S: could be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 4, since it was originally at 4)

Good candidates for the next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position
2. Include A and S in new positions
3. Exclude R and E
4. Use new letters to test more possibilities

Possible words: SPOON (but has two O's), SOAPY (but has E in its form), SONAR (but has R and E), SOLAR (but has R and E), SALON (but has R and E), SMOKE (has E), SOUND (has R), SCOUR (has R), etc.

Looking for a word with O in 3rd, A and S elsewhere, avoiding R and E: 
- S A O _ _ → SAOL_ (but SAOLN isn't a word)
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (no)
- _ _ O A S → CHOAS (no)
- S _ O A _ → SLOAN (no)
- _ S O A _ → ?

Focusing on common patterns: 
- S _ O _ A → SPOKA (no), STOMA (but T is new), SCOLA (no)
- _ S O A _ → ? 

A practical word with O in 3rd: STONY (but has T and N, and E not present), but we need A and S.

Next best: ""SOLAN"" is close but has N and L which are new letters, but R is excluded. Actually ""SOLAN"" is a type of bird.

But to maximize information: let's try ""SALON"" but it has R in the original which is excluded. So not SALON.

""SONAR"" has R excluded.

""SOAKS"" has S repeated and K is new, but we need to place A and S.

A better candidate: ""TOAST"" has T, A, but E is excluded.

Looking for words with O in 3rd, A and S in new positions:
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (invalid)
- _ S O A _ → ?

Consider ""SCOUR"" but R excluded.

Another approach: try a word like ""COAST"" — but A is 2nd, S could be 4th, and O is 3rd. But C and T are new letters, and feedback on them would help.

""COAST"" positions:
C (new), O (✓), A (new), S (new), T (new) — it places O correctly, moves A and S to new spots, and introduces C and T.

From the combined feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)

   – A and S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – R and E are NOT in the word.

   – O is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   – A and S are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – C and T are NOT in the word.  
   – The fact that O is marked “-” here means it appears elsewhere than position 3, **contradicting** the first feedback that said O is ✓ at position 3.  
   The only resolution is that **O is definitely at position 3** (from guess 1’s ✓), so the “-” in guess 2 must be an error in the prompt. Interpreting strictly, we will rely on the ✓ from guess 1: the word has the form `_ _ O _ _` with O fixed at position 3.

Letters known:
- In word and must appear: A, S, O (O at position 3)
- NOT in word: R, E, C, T

Thus the word has the pattern:
  _ _ O _ _
with A and S somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 4, 5), and no repeats of R, E, C, T.

Possible letters left to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains both A and S exactly once (since no repeats indicated).
- Contains none of R, E, C, T.

Let’s list candidates:
- SONAR – contains R (excluded) ✗
- SOAKS – repeats S ✗
- SOLAR – contains R ✗
- SOLAN – contains N and L, valid? yes, but L might be new.
- SALON – contains N and L, but R excluded (no R here) ✓ actually valid.
- SAVOR – contains R ✗
- SPOON – repeats O ✗
- SOAPY – contains P and Y, but Y is fine, but we need both A and S — SOAPY has A but not S.
- SHOAL – has H, L, but no S.
- SWORD – contains R ✗
- STORM – contains R, T ✗
- SNOUT – contains T ✗
- SWOON – repeats O ✗
- SWORN – contains R ✗
- SCOUR – contains C, R ✗
- SLOTH – contains T ✗
- SMOKE – contains K but E excluded ✗
- SLOPE – contains E ✗
- SLOOP – repeats O ✗
- SLOOM – archaic, probably invalid.

Looking for a pattern that uses A and S in remaining slots:
- _ S O A _ → M SO A _ → MSOAK (invalid)
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (invalid)
- S _ O _ A → S _ O _ A → words like SMOGA (invalid), SKOAL (valid but has K, L)
- _ S O _ A → _ S O _ A → words like MSOGA, but need valid: MSOAK invalid.

“SKOAL” is valid but uses K and L; we have no info on them yet.  
Another candidate: “HOAGY” but no S.

Let’s try “SALON” again — it has:
  S A L O N  
  positions: S(1), A(2), L(4), O(3), N(5)
- Contains A and S exactly once.  
- No R, E, C, T.  
- O in position 3 ✓.

It seems valid and uses new letters L and N to gain information.

Hence, my next guess is SALON.

- NOT in word: R, E, C, T

Thus the word has the pattern:
  _ _ O _ _
with A and S somewhere in the remaining four slots (positions 1, 2, 4, 5), and no repeats of R, E, C, T.

Possible letters left to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains both A and S exactly once (since no repeats indicated).
- Contains none of R, E, C, T.

Let’s list candidates:
- SONAR – contains R (excluded) ✗
- SOAKS – repeats S ✗
- SOLAR – contains R ✗
- SOLAN – contains N and L, valid? yes, but L might be new.
- SALON – contains N and L, but R excluded (no R here) ✓ actually valid.
- SAVOR – contains R ✗
- SPOON – repeats O ✗
- SOAPY – contains P and Y, but Y is fine, but we need both A and S — SOAPY has A but not S.
- SHOAL – has H, L, but no S.
- SWORD – contains R ✗
- STORM – contains R, T ✗
- SNOUT – contains T ✗
- SWOON – repeats O ✗
- SWORN – contains R ✗
- SCOUR – contains C, R ✗
- SLOTH – contains T ✗
- SMOKE – contains K but E excluded ✗
- SLOPE – contains E ✗
- SLOOP – repeats O ✗
- SLOOM – archaic, probably invalid.

Looking for a pattern that uses A and S in remaining slots:
- _ S O A _ → M SO A _ → MSOAK (invalid)
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (invalid)
- S _ O _ A → S _ O _ A → words like SMOGA (invalid), SKOAL (valid but has K, L)
- _ S O _ A → _ S O _ A → words like MSOGA, but need valid: MSOAK invalid.

“SKOAL” is valid but uses K and L; we have no info on them yet.  
Another candidate: “HOAGY” but no S.

Let’s try “SALON” again — it has:
  S A L O N  
  positions: S(1), A(2), L(4), O(3), N(5)
- Contains A and S exactly once.  
- No R, E, C, T.  
- O in position 3 ✓.

It seems valid and uses new letters L and N to gain information.

Hence, my next guess is SALON.",Guess 3: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(-) O(-) N(x),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,SHOAL,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so there's no feedback to analyze yet. A good strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.
2. Avoids repeating letters to maximize the information gained.
3. Uses vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""SLATE"". These words cover many common letters and give good coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) — so it must be the 3rd letter: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (with O fixed at position 3)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Possible positions for A: could be 2, 4, or 5
- Possible positions for S: could be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 4, since it was originally at 4)

Good candidates for the next guess should:
1. Keep O in the 3rd position
2. Include A and S in new positions
3. Exclude R and E
4. Use new letters to test more possibilities

Possible words: SPOON (but has two O's), SOAPY (but has E in its form), SONAR (but has R and E), SOLAR (but has R and E), SALON (but has R and E), SMOKE (has E), SOUND (has R), SCOUR (has R), etc.

Looking for a word with O in 3rd, A and S elsewhere, avoiding R and E: 
- S A O _ _ → SAOL_ (but SAOLN isn't a word)
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (no)
- _ _ O A S → CHOAS (no)
- S _ O A _ → SLOAN (no)
- _ S O A _ → ?

Focusing on common patterns: 
- S _ O _ A → SPOKA (no), STOMA (but T is new), SCOLA (no)
- _ S O A _ → ? 

A practical word with O in 3rd: STONY (but has T and N, and E not present), but we need A and S.

Next best: ""SOLAN"" is close but has N and L which are new letters, but R is excluded. Actually ""SOLAN"" is a type of bird.

But to maximize information: let's try ""SALON"" but it has R in the original which is excluded. So not SALON.

""SONAR"" has R excluded.

""SOAKS"" has S repeated and K is new, but we need to place A and S.

A better candidate: ""TOAST"" has T, A, but E is excluded.

Looking for words with O in 3rd, A and S in new positions:
- _ A O S _ → MAOSS (invalid)
- _ S O A _ → ?

Consider ""SCOUR"" but R excluded.

Another approach: try a word like ""COAST"" — but A is 2nd, S could be 4th, and O is 3rd. But C and T are new letters, and feedback on them would help.

""COAST"" positions:
C (new), O (✓), A (new), S (new), T (new) — it places O correctly, moves A and S to new spots, and introduces C and T.

This seems like a strong second guess.

   – The fact that O is marked “-” here means it appears elsewhere than position 3, **contradicting** the first feedback that said O is ✓ at position 3.  
   The only resolution is that **O is definitely at position 3** (from guess 1’s ✓), so the “-” in guess 2 must be an error in the prompt. Interpreting strictly, we will rely on the ✓ from guess 1: the word has the form `_ _ O _ _` with O fixed at position 3.

“SKOAL” is valid but uses K and L; we have no info on them yet.

It seems valid and uses new letters L and N to gain information.

Let’s merge the new feedback with what we already know.

Known so far (after 3 guesses):

Word pattern: _ _ _ _ _  (5 letters)
Letters definitely in the word:
- S  (it is marked ✓ in guess 3, meaning it is in the word and in the correct position)
- O  (it was marked ✓ in guess 1, position 3, so O is at position 3)

Letters definitely NOT in the word (from any guess):
R, E, C, T, N  (because N was marked x in guess 3)

Letters whose status:
- A: in the word but wrong position each time.
- L: in the word but wrong position (from guess 3).
- S: correct position (from guess 3), so S is at position 1.

So we now have the pattern:

S _ O _ _

Must contain A and L somewhere, and the remaining two letters are not R,E,C,T,N.

Available positions for A and L: positions 2, 4, 5 (but we need two distinct positions for A and L among these three).

We also know:
- A has never been in position 1 or 3 or 5 (from guesses 1,2,3), so A must be at position 2 or 4.
- L has never been in position 3 or 4 or 5 (from guess 3), so L must be at position 2.

Therefore:
L is at position 2.
A must then be at position 4 or 5.

So we have:

S L O _ _

and A must be in position 4 or 5.

We have to fill position 5 or 4 with a letter that is not yet tried and is not R,E,C,T,N.

We have used S,L,O,A so far, and we need one more letter (from the unused alphabet excluding R,E,C,T,N).

Possible remaining letters (from alphabet excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid English word of the form S L O _ _ with A in either position 4 or 5.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: A at position 4 → S L O A _
   – Need a 5th letter that is valid and not forbidden: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   – Valid words: SLOAD (not a valid word), SLOAM (no), SLOAN (but N is excluded), SLOAP (no), SLOAK (no), SLOAB (no), SLOAG (no), SLOAH (no), etc. None seem valid.

Case 2: A at position 5 → S L O _ A
   – So pattern S L O _ A
   – Need a 4th letter (position 4) from remaining letters.
   – Possible valid words:
      - SLOGA (no)
      - SLOKA (no)
      - SLOMA (no)
      - SLOPA (no)
      - SLOBA (no)
      - SLODA (no)
      - SLOFA (no)
      - SLOVA (no)
      - SLOCA (invalid due to C)
      - SLOTA (invalid due to T)
      - SLOCA (invalid)
   - Check “SLOKA” is not a common word.
   - Check “SLOPA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOBA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOMA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOJA” – no.
   - Check “SLOIA” – no.
   - Check “SLOHA” – no.
   - Check “SLOPA” – no.

Hmm. Let me double-check.

Actually, we have:

Pattern: S L O _ _
or S L O _ _ with A in 4 or 5.

Is there a valid English word S L O _ _?

Yes: 
S L O W _  (but we need A somewhere)
S L O G _  (no)
S L O B _  (no)
S L O G S (no)
S L O P S (no)
S L O T S (no)
S L O S S (no)

Wait, let’s look for words S L O _ _:

- SLOTH – invalid (T and H are both allowed, but T is excluded)
- SLOWS – W is allowed, but no A
- SLOBS – B allowed, but no A
- SLOES – E is excluded
- SLOPS – P allowed, but no A
- SLOSH – H allowed, but no A
- SLOJD – no
- SLOKA – no
- SLOPY – Y allowed, but no A

Seems stuck.

Alternative check: did we misinterpret positions?

Wait, A has been in positions 1,2,3,5 across the guesses:
- Guess 1: A at 1 (marked -, so not at 1)
- Guess 2: A at 3 (marked -, so not at 3)
- Guess 3: A at 2 (marked -, so not at 2)

So A cannot be at 1,2,3,5, meaning A must be at 4.

Thus A is at position 4.

That fixes the word pattern to:

S L O A _

Now we need one more letter for position 5, not R,E,C,T,N.

So the word is S L O A _ where the blank is from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Valid English words ending in SLOA_:
- SLOAD – not a common word
- SLOAM – no
- SLOAN – N excluded
- SLOAP – no
- SLOAB – no
- SLOAG – no
- SLOAH – no
- SLOAK – no
- SLOAL – no
- SLOAM – no
- SLOAS – no
- SLOAT – T excluded
- SLOAV – no
- SLOAW – no

But there is a valid word: **SLOAN** – but N is excluded.

Next possible: **SLOAD** – not valid.

**SLOTH** – T excluded.

**SLOBS** – no A.

Wait, I must have missed. Let me list all 5-letter words matching SLOA_:

- **SLOAN** – N excluded
- **SLOAS** – not common
- **SLOAT** – T excluded
- **SLOAM** – no
- **SLOAB** – no
- **SLOAK** – no

Hmm. But **SLOAD** is actually a valid historical word (a unit of mass), though rare.

But likely the intended word is **SLOAN** but N is excluded.

Alternative: perhaps I misread feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 3: SALON → S(✓) A(-) L(-) O(-) N(x)

- S(✓) – S is in correct position, so position 1 is S.

- A(-) – A is in word but wrong position. In SALON, A was at position 2, so A is NOT at 2.

- L(-) – L is in word but wrong position. In SALON, L was at 3, so L is NOT at 3. But O is at 3 (from guess 1), so L must be at 2,4, or 5.

- O(-) – In SALON, O was at position 4, but we know O is at 3 (from guess 1), so this is consistent (O is at 3, not 4).

- N(x) – N is not in word.

So the corrected pattern:

S _ O _ _

Letters to place: A and L.

Positions available: 2, 4, 5.

A must be at 2,4, or 5, but NOT at 2 (from A(-) in guess 3, so A not at 2). So A is at 4 or 5.

L must be at 2,4, or 5, but NOT at 3 (already O), and NOT at 4 (from L(-) in guess 3, L was at 3, but that doesn't restrict 4 directly). Actually L(-) only means L is not at 3, so L can be at 2,4,5.

So possible placements:

1. A at 4, L at 2 or 5
   – S L O A _
   – S _ O A L

2. A at 5, L at 2 or 4
   – S L O _ A
   – S _ O L A

But O is at 3, so:

Option 1: S L O A _ → need 5th letter not forbidden: SLOA_ – see above, seems no valid word.

Option 2: S _ O A L → need 2nd letter not forbidden. Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Valid words: S _ O A L

- SPOAL – no
- SCOAL – C excluded
- SGOAL – no
- SBOAL – no
- SHOAL – H is allowed, and SHOAL is a valid word!

Check SHOAL:

- S H O A L
- Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)
- Contains S, A, L – all required.
- No R, E, C, T, N.
- All letters fit constraints:
   - S at 1 ✓
   - O at 3 ✓
   - A not at 2 (from guess 3 A not at 2) – here A is at 4 ✓
   - L not at 3 (from guess 3 L not at 3) – here L is at 5 ✓
   - H is new and allowed.

Thus **SHOAL** is a valid candidate that fits all constraints.

</think>

Based on the updated constraints, the word must be S _ O A L, and the only valid English word fitting is SHOAL.

<guess>SHOAL</guess>",SHOAL,"Let’s merge the new feedback with what we already know.

Known so far (after 3 guesses):

Word pattern: _ _ _ _ _  (5 letters)
Letters definitely in the word:
- S  (it is marked ✓ in guess 3, meaning it is in the word and in the correct position)
- O  (it was marked ✓ in guess 1, position 3, so O is at position 3)

Letters definitely NOT in the word (from any guess):
R, E, C, T, N  (because N was marked x in guess 3)

Letters whose status:
- A: in the word but wrong position each time.
- L: in the word but wrong position (from guess 3).
- S: correct position (from guess 3), so S is at position 1.

So we now have the pattern:

S _ O _ _

Must contain A and L somewhere, and the remaining two letters are not R,E,C,T,N.

Available positions for A and L: positions 2, 4, 5 (but we need two distinct positions for A and L among these three).

We also know:
- A has never been in position 1 or 3 or 5 (from guesses 1,2,3), so A must be at position 2 or 4.
- L has never been in position 3 or 4 or 5 (from guess 3), so L must be at position 2.

Therefore:
L is at position 2.
A must then be at position 4 or 5.

So we have:

S L O _ _

and A must be in position 4 or 5.

We have to fill position 5 or 4 with a letter that is not yet tried and is not R,E,C,T,N.

We have used S,L,O,A so far, and we need one more letter (from the unused alphabet excluding R,E,C,T,N).

Possible remaining letters (from alphabet excluding the forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a valid English word of the form S L O _ _ with A in either position 4 or 5.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: A at position 4 → S L O A _
   – Need a 5th letter that is valid and not forbidden: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
   – Valid words: SLOAD (not a valid word), SLOAM (no), SLOAN (but N is excluded), SLOAP (no), SLOAK (no), SLOAB (no), SLOAG (no), SLOAH (no), etc. None seem valid.

Case 2: A at position 5 → S L O _ A
   – So pattern S L O _ A
   – Need a 4th letter (position 4) from remaining letters.
   – Possible valid words:
      - SLOGA (no)
      - SLOKA (no)
      - SLOMA (no)
      - SLOPA (no)
      - SLOBA (no)
      - SLODA (no)
      - SLOFA (no)
      - SLOVA (no)
      - SLOCA (invalid due to C)
      - SLOTA (invalid due to T)
      - SLOCA (invalid)
   - Check “SLOKA” is not a common word.
   - Check “SLOPA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOBA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOMA” – not a word.
   - Check “SLOJA” – no.
   - Check “SLOIA” – no.
   - Check “SLOHA” – no.
   - Check “SLOPA” – no.

Hmm. Let me double-check.

Actually, we have:

Pattern: S L O _ _
or S L O _ _ with A in 4 or 5.

Is there a valid English word S L O _ _?

Yes: 
S L O W _  (but we need A somewhere)
S L O G _  (no)
S L O B _  (no)
S L O G S (no)
S L O P S (no)
S L O T S (no)
S L O S S (no)

Wait, let’s look for words S L O _ _:

- SLOTH – invalid (T and H are both allowed, but T is excluded)
- SLOWS – W is allowed, but no A
- SLOBS – B allowed, but no A
- SLOES – E is excluded
- SLOPS – P allowed, but no A
- SLOSH – H allowed, but no A
- SLOJD – no
- SLOKA – no
- SLOPY – Y allowed, but no A

Seems stuck.

Alternative check: did we misinterpret positions?

Wait, A has been in positions 1,2,3,5 across the guesses:
- Guess 1: A at 1 (marked -, so not at 1)
- Guess 2: A at 3 (marked -, so not at 3)
- Guess 3: A at 2 (marked -, so not at 2)

So A cannot be at 1,2,3,5, meaning A must be at 4.

Thus A is at position 4.

That fixes the word pattern to:

S L O A _

Now we need one more letter for position 5, not R,E,C,T,N.

So the word is S L O A _ where the blank is from B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Valid English words ending in SLOA_:
- SLOAD – not a common word
- SLOAM – no
- SLOAN – N excluded
- SLOAP – no
- SLOAB – no
- SLOAG – no
- SLOAH – no
- SLOAK – no
- SLOAL – no
- SLOAM – no
- SLOAS – no
- SLOAT – T excluded
- SLOAV – no
- SLOAW – no

But there is a valid word: **SLOAN** – but N is excluded.

Next possible: **SLOAD** – not valid.

**SLOTH** – T excluded.

**SLOBS** – no A.

Wait, I must have missed. Let me list all 5-letter words matching SLOA_:

- **SLOAN** – N excluded
- **SLOAS** – not common
- **SLOAT** – T excluded
- **SLOAM** – no
- **SLOAB** – no
- **SLOAK** – no

Hmm. But **SLOAD** is actually a valid historical word (a unit of mass), though rare.

But likely the intended word is **SLOAN** but N is excluded.

Alternative: perhaps I misread feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 3: SALON → S(✓) A(-) L(-) O(-) N(x)

- S(✓) – S is in correct position, so position 1 is S.

- A(-) – A is in word but wrong position. In SALON, A was at position 2, so A is NOT at 2.

- L(-) – L is in word but wrong position. In SALON, L was at 3, so L is NOT at 3. But O is at 3 (from guess 1), so L must be at 2,4, or 5.

- O(-) – In SALON, O was at position 4, but we know O is at 3 (from guess 1), so this is consistent (O is at 3, not 4).

- N(x) – N is not in word.

So the corrected pattern:

S _ O _ _

Letters to place: A and L.

Positions available: 2, 4, 5.

A must be at 2,4, or 5, but NOT at 2 (from A(-) in guess 3, so A not at 2). So A is at 4 or 5.

L must be at 2,4, or 5, but NOT at 3 (already O), and NOT at 4 (from L(-) in guess 3, L was at 3, but that doesn't restrict 4 directly). Actually L(-) only means L is not at 3, so L can be at 2,4,5.

So possible placements:

1. A at 4, L at 2 or 5
   – S L O A _
   – S _ O A L

2. A at 5, L at 2 or 4
   – S L O _ A
   – S _ O L A

But O is at 3, so:

Option 1: S L O A _ → need 5th letter not forbidden: SLOA_ – see above, seems no valid word.

Option 2: S _ O A L → need 2nd letter not forbidden. Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Valid words: S _ O A L

- SPOAL – no
- SCOAL – C excluded
- SGOAL – no
- SBOAL – no
- SHOAL – H is allowed, and SHOAL is a valid word!

Check SHOAL:

- S H O A L
- Positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), A(4), L(5)
- Contains S, A, L – all required.
- No R, E, C, T, N.
- All letters fit constraints:
   - S at 1 ✓
   - O at 3 ✓
   - A not at 2 (from guess 3 A not at 2) – here A is at 4 ✓
   - L not at 3 (from guess 3 L not at 3) – here L is at 5 ✓
   - H is new and allowed.

Thus **SHOAL** is a valid candidate that fits all constraints.Based on the updated constraints, the word must be S _ O A L, and the only valid English word fitting is SHOAL.",Guess 4: SHOAL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
