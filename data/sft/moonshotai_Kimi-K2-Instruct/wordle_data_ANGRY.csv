For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information I receive from the feedback. Some of the most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word. A commonly recommended starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters. Another good option could be ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word with good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is IN the word but in the wrong position (-).

So our secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We can try a new word that:
1. Keeps A but moves it to another position (positions 1,2,4,5).
2. Uses completely new letters not yet tried.

Common letters we haven’t used yet include: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that starts with A (to test position 1) and uses other fresh letters. A good candidate is “AUDIO” because:
- A is in position 1 (testing if A belongs here).
- U, D, I, O are all new letters.

Another option could be “ACORN” or “ABOUT”, but “AUDIO” has a nice spread of vowels and new consonants. I’ll go with AUDIO.

Now we know for sure:

- U, D, I, O are not in the word (x).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: R, N, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with A, using only letters not on the banned list. Possible second letters (keeping common/early-alphabet choices) might be R, N, C, M, P, B, F, G, H.

Let’s choose “ANGRY”:
- A is locked in position 1.
- N, G, R, Y have all never appeared in any previous guess, so they’re allowed.
- Also a common word.
