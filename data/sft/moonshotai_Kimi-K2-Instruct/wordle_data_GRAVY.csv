For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down the possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequently used consonants (like R, T, N, S, L)
3. No duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage

The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common ones
- 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This gives me good coverage of common letters and should provide useful feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in position 2 and correct there.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has the form _R___ with R fixed in position 2.
2. A is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).
3. The letters O, S, E are excluded entirely.
4. No duplicates from the excluded letters (O, S, E) and we already know R is used.

We need a new word that:
- Keeps R in position 2
- Includes A somewhere in positions 3-5
- Avoids O, S, E entirely
- Uses new letters not yet tested (like T, N, I, L, etc.)

Possible candidates:
- TRIAL (but E is excluded, no problem here)
- TRAIN
- TRIAD

A good starting word should have:\n1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)\n2. Frequently used consonants (like R, T, N, S, L)\n3. No duplicate letters to maximize letter coverage\n\nThe word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:\n- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - the most common ones\n- 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)\n- All unique letters\n\nThis gives me good coverage of common letters and should provide useful feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5 now).\n- R is in position 2 and correct there.\n- O is not in the word.\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n1.

Summary of constraints so far:

Known pattern: _ R A _ _
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 3 = A (✓)

Letters already ruled out:
O, S, E, T, I, N, C, K

Still available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Still available vowels: U (only remaining unused vowel)

We need to fill positions 1 and 5.
We must also place the letter A somewhere, but A is already fixed in position 3, so that is satisfied.

We have not tested:
- B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a common word that fits _ R A _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BRAVO (but includes O, which is eliminated)
- GRASP (S is eliminated)
- GRAVY (Y is still allowed, V is still allowed)
- DRAMA (but M and second A are allowed but second A would be a duplicate in position 4, which is allowed)
- BRADS (S is eliminated)
- GRAMPS (too long)
- FRANK (N and K are eliminated)
- PRANK (N and K are eliminated)
- FRAIL (I is eliminated)
- GRAIL (I is eliminated)
- BRAWL (W and L are allowed)
- DRAWL (W and L are allowed)

DRAWS: S is eliminated.
DRAWN: N is eliminated.
GRAVY: V, Y are allowed, G, R, A, V, Y.
But GRAVY is 5 letters: G R A V Y → fits _ R A _ _.
All letters are allowed so far (G, R, A, V, Y).

Another candidate: BRAVY? Not a common word.
FRAYS: S is eliminated.
FRANC: C is eliminated.

GRAVY seems the best common word fitting these constraints.

Let's verify:
- G: not yet tested, not eliminated.
- R: must be in position 2 (✓).
- A: must be in position 3 (✓).
- V: not yet tested, not eliminated.
- Y: not yet tested, not eliminated.

So GRAVY is a valid next guess.
