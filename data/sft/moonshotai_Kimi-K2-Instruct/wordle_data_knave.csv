1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes the chance of getting useful feedback. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters, and no repeats.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 3)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 5)

So we know:
- The word looks like: _ _ A _ E
- To avoid: S, L, T
- We already have E fixed at position 5 and A fixed at position 3.

Next step is to pick a word that keeps A in position 3 and E in position 5, and introduces new common letters in the other positions while avoiding S, L, T.

Good candidate letters to test next might be R, N, C, H, D, B, M, etc.

Some possible words fitting the pattern _ _ A _ E:
- CRANE (but E is correct at position 5, and N is new)
- BRAVE (but V is less common)
- DRAME (but not a standard word)
- GRADE (but G is less common, and D is new)

CRANE seems like a good choice because:
- C, R, N are common letters we haven't tested yet
- It fits the _ _ A _ E pattern perfectly
- It avoids the forbidden letters S, L, T

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,knave,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - five of the most common letters, and no repeats.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 3)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓ at position 5)

So we know:
- The word looks like: _ _ A _ E
- To avoid: S, L, T
- We already have E fixed at position 5 and A fixed at position 3.

Next step is to pick a word that keeps A in position 3 and E in position 5, and introduces new common letters in the other positions while avoiding S, L, T.

Good candidate letters to test next might be R, N, C, H, D, B, M, etc.

Some possible words fitting the pattern _ _ A _ E:
- CRANE (but E is correct at position 5, and N is new)
- BRAVE (but V is less common)
- DRAME (but not a standard word)
- GRADE (but G is less common, and D is new)

CRANE seems like a good choice because:
- C, R, N are common letters we haven't tested yet
- It fits the _ _ A _ E pattern perfectly
- It avoids the forbidden letters S, L, T

Possible positions for N: 1 or 2.

Remaining common, unused letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word of the form:

Candidate words:

- N in position 2: _ N A _ E → BNAPE? (not real), DNAPE (not real), GNADE (not real), MNARE (not real), PNAVE (not real), etc.

NAME seems valid and fits:

- A in 3, E in 5  
- Uses M and A (already fixed).

Now we have:

- From CRANE: N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- From NAIVE: N is in position 1 but marked “-” (wrong place), so N CANNOT be at position 1.
- From NAIVE: A appeared at position 3 but is now marked “-”, so A is NOT at position 3 after all.  
  (This contradicts the earlier “A(✓)” in SLATE and CRANE.  
  Re-reading: in CRANE we got A(✓) in position 3, but in NAIVE we got A(-) – this can only happen if the feedback symbols belong to their respective guesses, not to the absolute positions.  
  Actually, the feedback is per-guess: in CRANE the A was in position 3 and got ✓, so A is indeed at position 3.
