For the first guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gain

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Good starting words often include:
- A and E (most common vowels)
- R, S, T (most common consonants)
- No repeated letters

Options like STARE, CRANE, SLATE, or AROSE are all good. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us broad coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and must use only letters not yet ruled out. The remaining most-common letters we haven’t tested are T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.  
We want a fresh 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses only letters from the still-possible set

A good candidate is “UNTIE” – it ends with E and uses high-frequency letters U, N, T, I that we haven’t eliminated. (Another valid choice would be “UNTIE”’s rearrangement “UNITE”, but I’ll pick UNTIE.)

We know:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- T and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (so T is not in position 3 and I is not in position 4).
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N.

Still-available common letters (among others): C, D, L, M, P, H, Y, B, G, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both T and I, but avoids all eliminated letters and places T and I in new positions.

Possible placements for T and I (avoiding their previous positions 3 and 4, respectively):
- T could be in positions 1, 2, 4
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 3

Let’s try placing T in position 1 and I in position 2. A valid word with this pattern is T I _ _ E, and the missing letters must come from the still-allowed set. One possibility is “TITLE” (T-I-T-L-E), but T is repeated, which we should avoid to maximize information. Next viable: “TIMED” uses D, but we haven’t ruled D out yet. However, let’s choose a word that uses fresh, frequent consonants and no repeats.

A good candidate is “WHITE” (W-H-I-T-E):
- Contains T (position 4) and I (position 3), both in new positions.
- Ends with E (correct).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (W and H are still possible).
- No repeats.

But wait: in “WHITE”, I is in position 3 and T in 4. That’s acceptable because:
- Previous guess had I in position 4 (wrong), now it’s in 3 (new).
- T was in position 3, now in 4 (new).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoids rare letters like Q, X, Z
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
4. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gain

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Good starting words often include:
- A and E (most common vowels)
- R, S, T (most common consonants)
- No repeated letters

Options like STARE, CRANE, SLATE, or AROSE are all good. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us broad coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- E is in the word and in the correct (fifth) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and must use only letters not yet ruled out. The remaining most-common letters we haven’t tested are T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, H.  
We want a fresh 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses only letters from the still-possible set

A good candidate is “UNTIE” – it ends with E and uses high-frequency letters U, N, T, I that we haven’t eliminated. (Another valid choice would be “UNTIE”’s rearrangement “UNITE”, but I’ll pick UNTIE.)

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We know:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- T and I are in the word but in the wrong positions (so T is not in position 3 and I is not in position 4).
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, S, U, N.

Still-available common letters (among others): C, D, L, M, P, H, Y, B, G, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both T and I, but avoids all eliminated letters and places T and I in new positions.

Possible placements for T and I (avoiding their previous positions 3 and 4, respectively):
- T could be in positions 1, 2, 4
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 3

Let’s try placing T in position 1 and I in position 2. A valid word with this pattern is T I _ _ E, and the missing letters must come from the still-allowed set. One possibility is “TITLE” (T-I-T-L-E), but T is repeated, which we should avoid to maximize information. Next viable: “TIMED” uses D, but we haven’t ruled D out yet. However, let’s choose a word that uses fresh, frequent consonants and no repeats.

A good candidate is “WHITE” (W-H-I-T-E):
- Contains T (position 4) and I (position 3), both in new positions.
- Ends with E (correct).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (W and H are still possible).
- No repeats.

But wait: in “WHITE”, I is in position 3 and T in 4. That’s acceptable because:
- Previous guess had I in position 4 (wrong), now it’s in 3 (new).
- T was in position 3, now in 4 (new).
And all letters are still possible.

So “WHITE” is a strong next guess.

Let’s extract the exact information we have:

1. Pattern so far:

2. Letters ruled out entirely:
   A, R, O, S, U, N, W, H, M

3. Letters ruled out from positions:
   - Position 1: none yet (L is marked “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 1)
   - Position 2: none yet (I is marked “-”, but we already know I is in position 3, so this is redundant)
   - Position 3: known correct (I ✓)
   - Position 4: known correct (T ✓)
   - Position 5: known correct (E ✓)

4. Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 2:
   From common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, K, P, V, Y, etc.
   Also note that L is in the word but not in position 1 (because L in LIMIT got a “-”).  
   Therefore L must be in position 2.

So the word must be:
_ L I T E

We need a single consonant for position 1 that is still allowed.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, K, P, V, Y

Valid English words of the form ?L I T E:

- BLITE – uncommon
- CLITE – not a standard word
- ELITE – E is already fixed at the end, but E is in position 5 so it’s allowed in position 1? No, E is already used in position 5 and is not ruled out for other positions, but “ELITE” would place E in position 1, which hasn’t been ruled out. However, E at both ends is possible.
- FLITE – archaic variant of “flyte”
- GLITE – not standard
- PLITE – not standard
- SLITE – not standard
- VLITE – not standard
- YLITE – not standard

Only “elite” is a standard English word matching _ L I T E. But E is already fixed at the end; it hasn’t been ruled out for position 1, so “elite” is technically possible. However, we’ve already used E only as the final letter. If we try “elite”, the first E is new.

But looking more carefully, “elite” is indeed a valid word. Let’s confirm:

ELITE: E L I T E
- Position 1: E – not yet ruled out (only E in position 5 is confirmed)
- Position 2: L – we deduced L must be here
- Position 3: I – correct
- Position 4: T – correct
- Position 5: E – correct

Since no feedback rules out E in position 1, ELITE satisfies all constraints.
