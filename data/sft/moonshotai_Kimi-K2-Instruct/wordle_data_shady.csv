For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain frequent consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. 

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses the very common letters S, L, A, T, E
2. It covers 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

The feedback from SLATE tells us:

1. S is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
2. L is not in the word (x)
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
4. T is not in the word (x)
5. E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S.  We know A is somewhere else (not in the third spot) and that L, T, E are ruled out.

Letters still to test: we have a lot of possibilities, but we need to test new consonants.  Common letters we haven’t tried yet include R, N, C, P, M, D, B, G, H, etc.  Also, we know A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A but not in position 3
- Does not contain L, T, E

A good candidate is “SCRAN”:
- Starts with S
- A is in position 4 (valid since we know A is not in position 3)
- Tests new consonants C, R, N
- Excludes L, T, E

Another candidate is “SPANK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid (we know A is not in position 3), so this is bad.

“SHARD”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid.

“SNARE”:
- Contains E, which we know is not in the word.

“SNAKY”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAM”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAN” seems the best so far.  Another option is “SNARK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 (invalid).

Wait, ""SNARK"" has A in position 3, which is invalid.  So no.

“SPRAY”:
- A in position 4 (valid), but does it test new letters?  We already know A is in the word, and we want to test new consonants.  Also, P and R are new, Y is new vowel.  But we already know A is in word, so maybe better to test more consonants.

But ""SPRAY"" has A in position 4, which is allowed.  However, we might want to test more consonants with A in position 2 or 4.

Another option is “SANDY”:

- Tests N, D, Y
- No L, T, E

Between “SCRAN” and “SANDY”, both are good.  “SANDY” tests A in position 2, and new consonants N, D, Y.  “SCRAN” tests A in position 4, and new consonants C, R, N.  Both are valid, but let’s go with “SCRAN” because C and R are very common letters.

Based on the feedback, we know:

Good starting words often contain frequent consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. 

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses the very common letters S, L, A, T, E
2. It covers 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE tells us:

1. S is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
2. L is not in the word (x)
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
4. T is not in the word (x)
5. E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S.  We know A is somewhere else (not in the third spot) and that L, T, E are ruled out.

Letters still to test: we have a lot of possibilities, but we need to test new consonants.  Common letters we haven’t tried yet include R, N, C, P, M, D, B, G, H, etc.  Also, we know A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A but not in position 3
- Does not contain L, T, E

A good candidate is “SCRAN”:
- Starts with S
- A is in position 4 (valid since we know A is not in position 3)
- Tests new consonants C, R, N
- Excludes L, T, E

Another candidate is “SPANK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid (we know A is not in position 3), so this is bad.

“SHARD”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid.

“SNARE”:
- Contains E, which we know is not in the word.

“SNAKY”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAM”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAN” seems the best so far.  Another option is “SNARK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 (invalid).

Wait, ""SNARK"" has A in position 3, which is invalid.  So no.

“SPRAY”:
- A in position 4 (valid), but does it test new letters?  We already know A is in the word, and we want to test new consonants.  Also, P and R are new, Y is new vowel.  But we already know A is in word, so maybe better to test more consonants.

But ""SPRAY"" has A in position 4, which is allowed.  However, we might want to test more consonants with A in position 2 or 4.

“SCARF”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNARL”:
- Contains L (invalid).

“SCANT”:
- Contains T (invalid).

“SCAMP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SWARM”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SHAWN”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNACK”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNARF”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARY”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SWASH”:
- No A at all (invalid).

“SHARD”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNAKY”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SPANK”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARF”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRUB”:
- No A (invalid).

“SCRUM”:
- No A (invalid).

“SCRAN” seems to be the only word that fits:
- Starts with S
- A in position 4 (valid, not 3)
- Tests C, R, N
- No L, T, E

Another option is “SANDY”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 2 (valid)
- Tests N, D, Y
- No L, T, E

Between “SCRAN” and “SANDY”, both are good.  “SANDY” tests A in position 2, and new consonants N, D, Y.  “SCRAN” tests A in position 4, and new consonants C, R, N.  Both are valid, but let’s go with “SCRAN” because C and R are very common letters.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word starts with 'S' (S✓)
- 'A' is in the word but not in the 3rd position
- Letters L, T, E are not in the word

A good next guess is ""SCRAN"" because:
- Starts with S (confirmed)
- Contains A in the 4th position (valid since A can't be 3rd)
- Tests new common letters C, R, N
- Avoids L, T, E

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain frequent consonants like S, T, R, N, L and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. 

Considering this, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It uses the very common letters S, L, A, T, E
2. It covers 3 common vowels (A, E) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE tells us:

1. S is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
2. L is not in the word (x)
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
4. T is not in the word (x)
5. E is not in the word (x)

So the word starts with S.  We know A is somewhere else (not in the third spot) and that L, T, E are ruled out.

Letters still to test: we have a lot of possibilities, but we need to test new consonants.  Common letters we haven’t tried yet include R, N, C, P, M, D, B, G, H, etc.  Also, we know A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

We want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains A but not in position 3
- Does not contain L, T, E

A good candidate is “SCRAN”:
- Starts with S
- A is in position 4 (valid since we know A is not in position 3)
- Tests new consonants C, R, N
- Excludes L, T, E

Another candidate is “SPANK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid (we know A is not in position 3), so this is bad.

“SHARD”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 is invalid.

“SNARE”:
- Contains E, which we know is not in the word.

“SNAKY”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAM”:
- A is in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAN” seems the best so far.  Another option is “SNARK”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 3 (invalid).

Wait, ""SNARK"" has A in position 3, which is invalid.  So no.

“SPRAY”:
- A in position 4 (valid), but does it test new letters?  We already know A is in the word, and we want to test new consonants.  Also, P and R are new, Y is new vowel.  But we already know A is in word, so maybe better to test more consonants.

But ""SPRAY"" has A in position 4, which is allowed.  However, we might want to test more consonants with A in position 2 or 4.

“SCARF”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNARL”:
- Contains L (invalid).

“SCANT”:
- Contains T (invalid).

“SCAMP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SWARM”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SHAWN”:
- Starts with S, A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRAP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNACK”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNARF”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARY”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SWASH”:
- No A at all (invalid).

“SHARD”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SNAKY”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SPANK”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARP”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCARF”:
- A in position 3 (invalid).

“SCRUB”:
- No A (invalid).

“SCRUM”:
- No A (invalid).

“SCRAN” seems to be the only word that fits:
- Starts with S
- A in position 4 (valid, not 3)
- Tests C, R, N
- No L, T, E

Another option is “SANDY”:
- Starts with S
- A in position 2 (valid)
- Tests N, D, Y
- No L, T, E

Between “SCRAN” and “SANDY”, both are good.  “SANDY” tests A in position 2, and new consonants N, D, Y.  “SCRAN” tests A in position 4, and new consonants C, R, N.  Both are valid, but let’s go with “SCRAN” because C and R are very common letters.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word starts with 'S' (S✓)
- 'A' is in the word but not in the 3rd position
- Letters L, T, E are not in the word

A good next guess is ""SCRAN"" because:
- Starts with S (confirmed)
- Contains A in the 4th position (valid since A can't be 3rd)
- Tests new common letters C, R, N
- Avoids L, T, E

<guess>SCRAN</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCRAN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints (after two guesses):

1. Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
2. The only letters we know are actually in the word: S (1st position) and A (somewhere else).
3. Eliminated letters: L, T, E, C, R, N.
4. A is NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 4 (from SCRAN).  
   Therefore A must be in position 2 or 5.

5. We still need to test other common consonants (D, P, M, B, G, H, K, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U, Y).

A good third guess should:
- Keep S in the first slot.
- Put A in position 2 or 5 to confirm its location.
- Include at least two new, still-possible consonants.
- Use no eliminated letters.

Option 1: place A in position 2 →  S A _ _ _
   Candidate: “SADIO”, but D and I are fine, O is fine, but this is not a common word.
   Candidate: “SABOT” – but T is eliminated.
   Candidate: “SAMBO” – B and M are new.
   Candidate: “SAPID” – P and D are new.

Option 2: place A in position 5 →  S _ _ _ A
   Candidate: “SIGMA” – G and M are new, I is new vowel, all letters allowed.
   Candidate: “SOAKA” – not a word.
   Candidate: “SYRUP” – but A would be missing.

“SIGMA” looks best:
- Starts with S, ends with A (testing position 5 for A).
- Introduces I, G, M (all still allowed).
- No eliminated letters.

<guess>SIGMA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCRAN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x)
Guess 3: SIGMA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(x) G(x) M(x) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S correct in first position.
   - A is in the word but NOT third position.

2. SCRAN → S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x)
   - A is NOT in fourth position.

3. SIGMA → S(✓) I(x) G(x) M(x) A(-)
   - A is NOT in fifth position.

Therefore:
- Word must start with S.
- A must be in position 2 or 4.
- Letters definitely OUT: L, T, E, C, R, N, I, G, M.
- Letters still available / to test: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any vowels not yet ruled out: O, U, Y).

We want to test new letters and pin down where A is.

We need words of the form:
S A _ _ _  (A in 2nd place)  or  S _ _ A _  (A in 4th place).

Let’s look for common 5-letter English words in each pattern that use only the still-allowed letters.

Possible candidates with A in 2nd place:
- SABOT  (but T is out)
- SADHU  (D, H, U allowed)
- SAPID  (P, D allowed)
- SAPPY  (P, Y allowed)
- SATYR  (R is out)

Possible candidates with A in 4th place:
- SHAKY  (H, K, Y allowed)
- SOAKY  (O, K, Y allowed)
- SUAVE  (V allowed but E is out)
- SPASM  (M is out)

The best choices are those that test several new letters quickly:
- SHAKY tests H, K, Y and places A in position 4.
- SAPID tests P, D and places A in position 2.

Between these, SHAKY tests three new consonants (H, K, Y) and places A in position 4, giving us more information.Based on the latest feedback, A must now be in position 2 or 4 (it’s been excluded from 3 and 5), and we’ve ruled out I, G, M, C, R, N, L, T, E.  
A good next guess that places A in position 4 and tests fresh consonants is:
