For my first guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has 5 distinct letters to avoid duplicates initially
3. Contains frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words

Looking at letter frequency data for 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good starting word would use several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving us maximum information about these frequently-occurring letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R: not in the word at all (Rx)
- O: not in the word at all (Ox)
- S: not in the word at all (Sx)
- E: is in the word and in the correct (last) position (E✓)

So we now know:

2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. The word DOES contain an A, but not in position 1.

Good consonants left to test: T, L, N, C, D, M.
We need a vowel other than O; we already have E at the end and A somewhere inside.

A common pattern with A not in position 1 and ending in E is “_ A _ _ E” or “_ _ A _ E”.  
Let’s try “T” and “L” as other common consonants and put the A in position 2.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,IMAGE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has 5 distinct letters to avoid duplicates initially
3. Contains frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words

Looking at letter frequency data for 5-letter words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good starting word would use several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving us maximum information about these frequently-occurring letters and their positions.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: the letter is in the word but not in position 1 (A-)
- R: not in the word at all (Rx)
- O: not in the word at all (Ox)
- S: not in the word at all (Sx)
- E: is in the word and in the correct (last) position (E✓)

So we now know:
1. The last letter is E.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.
3. The word DOES contain an A, but not in position 1.

Good consonants left to test: T, L, N, C, D, M.
We need a vowel other than O; we already have E at the end and A somewhere inside.

A common pattern with A not in position 1 and ending in E is “_ A _ _ E” or “_ _ A _ E”.  
Let’s try “T” and “L” as other common consonants and put the A in position 2.

Candidate: TABLE  
- T: new letter  
- A: in word, now in position 2  
- B: new letter  
- L: new letter  
- E: already confirmed at position 5  

This obeys all constraints (no R, O, S; A present; E at end).

- A is somewhere in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (A- in both guesses).
- R, O, S, T, B, L are all absent (x in every appearance).
- So the mystery word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E with an A that must sit in positions 3 or 4.

Letters still available (common ones): D, N, C, G, M, H, I, U, Y, K, etc.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ E
- _ _ _ A E

Let’s choose a word that:
1. Contains A in position 3 (so we test _ _ A _ E).
2. Uses only still-allowed letters.
3. Uses new common consonants to maximize information.

A good candidate is “DANCE”:
- D: new letter
- A: must be in position 3
- N: new letter
- C: new letter
- E: already fixed in position 5

All letters (D, A, N, C) are still allowed; none of the banned letters appear.

From the cumulative feedback:

- E is locked into position 5 (✓ in every guess).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (shown as A- in all four guesses).  
  Therefore A **must** be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.  
  This is impossible unless A appears twice: once in the word (but not in positions 1-4) and once elsewhere, but with only 5 letters this can’t happen.

Re-read the symbol definitions:
- “-” means the letter is **somewhere** in the word but in the wrong position.
- Since E is confirmed at position 5, the remaining positions (1-4) must contain A exactly once.  
  But every guess has shown A- (wrong position) despite positions 1,2,3,4 each being tried: positions 1,2,3,4 have now all been marked “-” for A.

This implies **A is not actually in the word**, contradicting the feedback.  
The only resolution is that the feedback string uses the symbol positions to correspond to the **guess positions**, not necessarily implying A is in the word.

But the rules clearly say:
- ✓ : correct letter, correct position  
- - : letter in word but wrong position  
- x : letter not in word  

Thus A is indeed in the word, but none of positions 1-4 can hold it.  
That leaves **position 5** which is already occupied by E.  
This is a contradiction unless the word has 6 letters, but we’re told it’s 5 letters.

Realization: I misread the feedback positions for A.  
Looking back at the feedback strings exactly as given:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
Guess 2: TABLE → T(x) A(-) B(x) L(x) E(✓)  
Guess 3: DANCE → D(x) A(-) N(x) C(x) E(✓)  
Guess 4: MAUVE → M(-) A(-) U(x) V(x) E(✓)  

The “-” for A in each guess is tied to **that position** in the guess.  
Therefore A is **not** in position 1 (guess 1), not in position 2 (guess 2), not in position 3 (guess 3), and not in position 4 (guess 4).  
Thus A must be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.  
This is impossible, so **A is not in the word at all**, and the feedback “A(-)” must have been misread.

Re-express feedback correctly:

- Guess 1, position 1: A(-) → **A is in the word but not in position 1**
- Guess 2, position 2: A(-) → **A is in the word but not in position 2**
- Guess 3, position 2: A(-) → **A is in the word but not in position 2 (redundant)**
- Guess 4, position 2: A(-) → **A is in the word but not in position 2 (redundant)**

Thus A is in the word, **not in positions 1 or 2**, and **position 5 is E**.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- A is somewhere in positions 3 or 4
- Letters **eliminated** so far (x): R, O, S, T, B, L, D, N, C, U, V
