Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Cover vowels and common consonants
3. Avoid rare letters that might waste guesses

Some optimal starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, RAISE, or ADIEU. These cover common letters while providing good coverage. I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (common vowel)
This gives me good coverage of letters that appear in many English words.

Feedback analysis:
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

Known so far:
1. Letters NOT present: R, A, I, E.
2. Letter S is present somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. No other information is known about the remaining letters: B C D F G H J K L M N O P Q T U V W X Y Z.

Strategy:
- Choose a word that keeps the S (but moves it away from slot 5), uses none of the eliminated letters, and covers new common consonants and vowels.
- Common vowels not eliminated: O, U.
- Common consonants still available: C, D, L, N, T, etc.

A balanced candidate: “STOUT”
- Keeps S in a new position (1st) and tests the vowels O and U, plus common consonants T.
- Eliminated letters R, A, I, E are avoided.

Another valid candidate: “SNOUT”
- Also covers N and U, keeps S in 1st.

Between the two, “STOUT” uses T twice, so “SNOUT” might give more unique information. However, “STOUT” is fine too. I’ll pick “STOUT” for its slightly more diverse letters.

But to cover more distinct consonants, “SHOUT” is even better (H, O, U, T).

Actually, the letter H hasn’t been tested yet, and it’s fairly common. So:

SHOUT
- S is moved to 1st position (allowed, since slot 5 is forbidden).
- Tests new letters H, O, U, T.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, E).

That seems optimal.

Current knowledge:
- The word contains S in the 1st position (from SHOUT’s S ✓).
- The word does NOT contain: R, A, I, E, H, O, T.
- S is already correctly placed at position 1, so all future guesses must start with S.
- U is in the word but not in the 4th position (from SHOUT’s U -).
- Remaining letters to test/place: B C D F G J K L M N P Q V W X Y Z.

We need to build a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Contains U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is ruled out for U)
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated
4. Is a valid 5-letter word

Looking at common patterns and remaining letters:
- Second position candidates: C, D, L, N, P are common
- Third position: same pool
- Fourth position: same pool
- Fifth position: same pool, plus U could go here

Let’s try to maximize information by testing new common consonants while placing U in a new spot. A balanced choice:

S + U + new consonants + vowel (but only U is confirmed, so other vowels might still exist, though we’ve eliminated A, I, E, O. The only vowel left is U and Y).

Let’s pick “SUNNY”:
- Starts with S
- Contains U in position 2 (new placement)
- Uses N, Y (Y can act as vowel or consonant)
- All letters are from remaining pool (S, U, N, N, Y)

But we have to check: is N allowed? Yes, not eliminated. Y is allowed. So this is valid.

Another candidate: “SLUMP”:
- S, L, U, M, P – all uneliminated letters
- Places U in position 3
- Tests L, M, P

Between these, “SLUMP” tests more distinct consonants (L, M, P) compared to “SUNNY” (N, Y). So “SLUMP” seems better for information gain.

Wait, but we have to check if these are valid 5-letter words. Both “SLUMP” and “SUNNY” are valid.

Alternatively, “SNUCK”:
- S, N, U, C, K
- Places U in position 3
- Tests N, C, K

This is also valid.

I’ll go with “SLUMP” as it covers L and M which are common.

But actually, let me check the position constraints more carefully:
- S is fixed at position 1.
- U cannot be at position 4, so possible positions for U: 2, 3, or 5.

In “SLUMP”, U is at position 3 – allowed.
Letters: S, L, U, M, P – none are eliminated.

This seems good.

Final choice: SLUMP
