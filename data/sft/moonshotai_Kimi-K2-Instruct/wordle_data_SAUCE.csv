For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common ending letter
- E: most common vowel in English
This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback:
1. S is correct in the first position (✓)
2. E is correct in the fifth position (✓)
3. A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so A must be in positions 2, 3, or 4
4. L and T are not in the word (x)

Current known info:
- Word starts with S and ends with E
- Must contain A (but not in position 3)
- Cannot contain L or T

Possible structure: S _ A _ E or S _ _ A E

We need a new word that:
- Starts with S
- Ends with E
- Contains A in position 2 or 4
- Doesn't use L or T

Let's try ""SPACE"":
- S✓ (correct position)
- P (new letter)
- A (in word, checking position 3)
- C (new letter)
- E✓ (correct position)

This tests A in position 3, while introducing P and C which are common letters.

Current knowledge:
- Starts with S, ends with E
- Contains A (but A is not in position 3, because in SPACE it was (-))
- Contains C in position 4 (✓)
- Cannot contain L, T, P
- Pattern so far: S _ _ C E
- A must therefore be in position 2 (since it can’t be 3 and must appear)

So the word is S A _ C E.

Letters left to test for position 3: common consonants excluding L, T, P.  
Good candidates: R, N, M, B, D, G, etc.

Let’s try a common consonant like R: “SARCE” isn’t valid.  
N: “SANCE” isn’t valid.  
M: “SAMCE” – not a word.  
B: “SABCE” – no.  
D: “SADCE” – no.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with SA, ends with CE, and has no L, T, P.

Valid word: “SAUCE”.

Check:
- S✓ A✓ _ C✓ E✓
- Contains A in position 2 (finally in correct spot)
- Contains C in position 4 (✓)
- No L, T, P
