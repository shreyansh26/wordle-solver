2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E) which can quickly reveal which vowels are in the word
- It contains R and S, two very common consonants
- The letters are all distinct, giving maximum information
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

From the feedback:
- R is in the word and in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- I is in the word but not in the third position.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Known facts:
- Word pattern so far: R _ _ _ _
- Letters that are in the word (somewhere): I, S, E
- Letter that is NOT in the word: A

I need a 5-letter word starting with R that contains I, S, and E (not necessarily in that order) and does not contain A. Also, I must respect the positional exclusions:
- I cannot be in position 3
- S cannot be in position 4
- E cannot be in position 5

Some candidate words:
- RISEN: R✓, I in position 2, S in position 3, E in position 4, N in position 5. This respects all constraints: I not in 3, S not in 4, E not in 5, and no A.
- RINSE: R✓, I in position 2, N in position 3, S in position 4, E in position 5. This violates S in position 4 (from feedback S is in word but not in position 4).
- RIVEN: R✓, I in position 2, V in position 3, E in position 4, N in position 5. This looks good but we don't know if V is in the word yet. It doesn't use S, which we know is in the word.
- RITES: R✓, I in position 2, T in position 3, E in position 4, S in position 5. This violates E in position 5 (from feedback E is in word but not in position 5).

The best candidate is RISEN:
- Uses all known letters (I, S, E) plus a new letter N
- Respects all positional constraints

From the new feedback on RISEN:

R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) E(✓) N(x)

So now we know:
- R is fixed in position 1.
- I is fixed in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 3.
- E is fixed in position 4.
- N is not in the word.

Therefore the word must be: R I S E _

Any common consonant not yet used is fair game. The word could be ""RISE_"" – a quick check of common 5-letter words starting with ""RISE"" gives ""RISER"" or ""RISES"". 

""RISER"" seems like the more likely word (person who rises), but we have already used the letter R in position 1, so position 5 can be R. ""RISES"" is also possible but repeats S which is already fixed in position 3. So ""RISER"" is the only valid option here.

Therefore, the final word must be RISER.
