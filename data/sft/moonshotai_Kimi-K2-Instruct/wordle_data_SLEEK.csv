For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common letters that can help me identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. 

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (has S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (has C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (has C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (has all common vowels)

Among these, I'll choose **CRANE** because:
1. It contains the very common letters C, R, N
2. It has two vowels (A, E) which are very common
3. None of the letters repeat, giving maximum coverage
4. It's a common word that's easy to think of

This should give good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Let's break down the two pieces of feedback so far.

From CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

From SPELT:
- S is in the word and is at position 1 (✓).
- P is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word and is at position 3 (✓).
- L is in the word but NOT at position 4 (-).
- T is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

1. Word pattern: S _ E _ _
2. Letters NOT allowed: C, R, A, N, P, T
3. Letters still allowed (and useful to test): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y
4. L is in the word but not at position 4, so it must be at 2 or 5.

Let’s explore the two possibilities for L:

Option 1: L at position 2 → S L E _ _
Possible endings: BLE? DLE? GLE? etc. But BLE would be SLEB… invalid; DLE would be SLED_, so SLEDS (invalid); GLE would be SLEGS (invalid). The only common word here is SLEDS but that’s plural. Maybe not common.

Option 2: L at position 5 → S _ E _ L
Now we need two middle letters, not P, T, C, R, A, N.
Common patterns: S _ E _ L
Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Some candidate words:
- SHELF (H and F allowed) → but E is already at 3, S _ E _ L with F at 4: S H E F L → no, ""SHELF"" is 5 letters but has E at 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.
- SMELL → has L at 4 and 5, but we know L must be only once and not at 4. Invalid.
- SWELL → same issue.
- SEVEL → not a word.
- SKELL → not a word.
- SUGEL → not a word.
- SPIEL → has P (excluded) and I, E, L, but P is out.
- SNEEL → N is excluded.
- SHEEL → H, E, E, L → but E is already at 3, can't be at 2 and 4. Invalid.

Another approach: focus on the pattern S _ E _ L and think of common words that fit.

Actually, the only common word fitting S _ E _ L is:
- S + vowel/consonant + E + consonant + L

Examples:
- SWEET → T excluded, and E at 3,4 → invalid.
- SHEEL → E can't be at 2.
- SEVEL → not a word.
- SUGEL → not a word.
- SMELL → L at 4 and 5, but L can't be at 4.
  
Wait, let’s list possible middle letters that can go in positions 2 and 4 without violating constraints.

We need:
S (fixed at 1)
E (fixed at 3)
L (must be at 5)
So word is S _ E _ L

Possible letters for _ positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- S U E E L → not a word.
- S I E V L → not a word.
- S O E K L → not a word.
- S O E K L → not a word.
- S H E E L → not a word (E at 3 and 4).
- S H E B L → not a word.
- S H E D L → SHEDL? No.
- S H E F L → SHEFL? No.
- S H E G L → SHEGL? No.
- S H E I L → SHEIL? No.
- S H E K L → SHEKL? No.
- S H E M L → SHEML? No.
- S H E O L → SHEOL? Not common.
- S H E U L → SHEUL? No.
- S H E V L → SHEVL? No.
- S H E W L → SHEWL? No.
- S H E Y L → SHEYL? No.

Hmm, seems difficult. Maybe I missed some. Let me think differently: position 2 and 4 must be consonants not in {C,R,A,N,P,T}, and form a valid word.

Alternative: maybe L is at position 2, not 5. Then pattern is S L E _ _. Now need two more consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- S L E D S → but D and S are allowed, but SLED is 4 letters.
- S L E E P → P is excluded.
- S L E E T → T is excluded.
- S L E E K → K allowed.
- S L E E K → S L E E K → valid word!

""SLEEK"" fits:
- S at 1 (✓)
- L at 2 (allowed, since L is in word but not at 4)
- E at 3 (✓)
- E at 4 (but E is already at 3 - is this allowed? The feedback only said E is at 3, but didn't specify if E appears only once. However, typically Wordle allows multiple instances of a letter unless marked. The feedback was E(✓) at position 3, implying E is correct there, but doesn't preclude another E. But we don't know yet.)

But ""SLEEK"" has two E's, which might be risky if the word only has one E. But we have no info against it.

Another option: S L E D S → invalid length.
S L E D E → but E at 3 and 5, and E can't be at 5 from CRANE feedback.

Next best without double E:
S L E G S → invalid.
S L E B S → invalid.
S L E F T → T excluded.
S L E F D → invalid.
S L E F Y → invalid.

""SLEEK"" seems the only plausible candidate here, despite the double E.

Alternatively, maybe ""SMELT"" but T is excluded.

Wait, let me think of ""SHELF"":
S H E L F → but L is at 4, which was marked as wrong position for L in SPELT. So L can't be at 4. So ""SHELF"" is invalid.

Another: ""SHELL"" → L at 4 and 5, but L can't be at 4. Invalid.

""SHIELD"" → too long.

This is challenging. Let me list valid S _ E _ L words:

- SHEEL → invalid (E at 2 and 3)
- SWEEL → invalid (W at 2, E at 3, L at 5) → ""SWEEL"" not a word.
- SKEEL → invalid.
- SBEEL → invalid.

Perhaps ""SLEEK"" is the best guess despite the double E.

But let me reconsider: the feedback only confirmed E at 3 and L is in word but not at 4, S at 1. No info that E appears only once. So ""SLEEK"" is possible.

However, another angle: maybe the word is S _ E _ D. Then ""SHEET"" has T excluded. ""SHED"" is too short.

Actually, let me think of ""SMEAR"" but A and R are excluded.

Best seems ""SLEEK"" as it fits all constraints:
- S at 1 (✓)
- L at 2 (new position for L, not 4)
- E at 3 (✓)
- E at 4 (no info against it)
- K at 5 (allowed)

Thus, ""SLEEK"" is a valid next guess.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y.

Some candidate words:
- SHELF (H and F allowed) → but E is already at 3, S _ E _ L with F at 4: S H E F L → no, ""SHELF"" is 5 letters but has E at 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.
- SMELL → has L at 4 and 5, but we know L must be only once and not at 4. Invalid.
- SWELL → same issue.
- SEVEL → not a word.
- SKELL → not a word.
- SUGEL → not a word.
- SPIEL → has P (excluded) and I, E, L, but P is out.
- SNEEL → N is excluded.
- SHEEL → H, E, E, L → but E is already at 3, can't be at 2 and 4. Invalid.

Another approach: focus on the pattern S _ E _ L and think of common words that fit.

Actually, the only common word fitting S _ E _ L is:
- S + vowel/consonant + E + consonant + L

Examples:
- SWEET → T excluded, and E at 3,4 → invalid.
- SHEEL → E can't be at 2.
- SEVEL → not a word.
- SUGEL → not a word.
- SMELL → L at 4 and 5, but L can't be at 4.
  
Wait, let’s list possible middle letters that can go in positions 2 and 4 without violating constraints.

We need:
S (fixed at 1)
E (fixed at 3)
L (must be at 5)
So word is S _ E _ L

Possible letters for _ positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- S U E E L → not a word.
- S I E V L → not a word.
- S O E K L → not a word.
- S O E K L → not a word.
- S H E E L → not a word (E at 3 and 4).
- S H E B L → not a word.
- S H E D L → SHEDL? No.
- S H E F L → SHEFL? No.
- S H E G L → SHEGL? No.
- S H E I L → SHEIL? No.
- S H E K L → SHEKL? No.
- S H E M L → SHEML? No.
- S H E O L → SHEOL? Not common.
- S H E U L → SHEUL? No.
- S H E V L → SHEVL? No.
- S H E W L → SHEWL? No.
- S H E Y L → SHEYL? No.

Hmm, seems difficult. Maybe I missed some. Let me think differently: position 2 and 4 must be consonants not in {C,R,A,N,P,T}, and form a valid word.

Alternative: maybe L is at position 2, not 5. Then pattern is S L E _ _. Now need two more consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- S L E D S → but D and S are allowed, but SLED is 4 letters.
- S L E E P → P is excluded.
- S L E E T → T is excluded.
- S L E E K → K allowed.
- S L E E K → S L E E K → valid word!

""SLEEK"" fits:
- S at 1 (✓)
- L at 2 (allowed, since L is in word but not at 4)
- E at 3 (✓)
- E at 4 (but E is already at 3 - is this allowed? The feedback only said E is at 3, but didn't specify if E appears only once. However, typically Wordle allows multiple instances of a letter unless marked. The feedback was E(✓) at position 3, implying E is correct there, but doesn't preclude another E. But we don't know yet.)

But ""SLEEK"" has two E's, which might be risky if the word only has one E. But we have no info against it.

Another option: S L E D S → invalid length.
S L E D E → but E at 3 and 5, and E can't be at 5 from CRANE feedback.

Next best without double E:
S L E G S → invalid.
S L E B S → invalid.
S L E F T → T excluded.
S L E F D → invalid.
S L E F Y → invalid.

""SLEEK"" seems the only plausible candidate here, despite the double E.

Alternatively, maybe ""SMELT"" but T is excluded.

Wait, let me think of ""SHELF"":
S H E L F → but L is at 4, which was marked as wrong position for L in SPELT. So L can't be at 4. So ""SHELF"" is invalid.

Another: ""SHELL"" → L at 4 and 5, but L can't be at 4. Invalid.

""SHIELD"" → too long.

This is challenging. Let me list valid S _ E _ L words:

- SHEEL → invalid (E at 2 and 3)
- SWEEL → invalid (W at 2, E at 3, L at 5) → ""SWEEL"" not a word.
- SKEEL → invalid.
- SBEEL → invalid.

Perhaps ""SLEEK"" is the best guess despite the double E.

But let me reconsider: the feedback only confirmed E at 3 and L is in word but not at 4, S at 1. No info that E appears only once. So ""SLEEK"" is possible.

However, another angle: maybe the word is S _ E _ D. Then ""SHEET"" has T excluded. ""SHED"" is too short.

Actually, let me think of ""SMEAR"" but A and R are excluded.

Best seems ""SLEEK"" as it fits all constraints:
- S at 1 (✓)
- L at 2 (new position for L, not 4)
- E at 3 (✓)
- E at 4 (no info against it)
- K at 5 (allowed)

Thus, ""SLEEK"" is a valid next guess.
