For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and covers different positions to maximize information gain. Common starting strategies include using words with high-frequency letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

A good first guess should:
1. Include multiple vowels to test their presence/position
2. Use common consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) covering different positions
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are very common in English words

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends with E.

Known facts:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains I but not in position 3.
- It does not contain R, A, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains I somewhere (but not in position 3).
3. Does not use R, A, or S.

A word like ""TITLE"" would fit, but I want to test more new letters. ""UNTIE"" uses none of the excluded letters and has I in position 2. ""CHILE"" is another option, but I think ""UNTIE"" is better because it tests more new letters (U, N, T).

From the two feedback sets we now know:

1. Word ends with E (✓ in position 5 both times).
2. Contains I but I is NOT in position 3 or 4 (because in both RAISE and UNTIE, I got “-” for wrong position).
   So I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. Does NOT contain: R, A, S, U, T (all received “x”).
4. Contains N but not in position 2 (because N got “-” in UNTIE).

Therefore:
- Position 5: E
- One of positions 1 or 2: I
- N appears somewhere (positions 3 or 4 are still open for N)
- All other letters so far unused and not excluded

Good candidate letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

A simple, common word that fits:
- I in position 1
- N in position 3
- Common consonants in positions 2 and 4

Word: INMNE is invalid (double N), so try INGLE (but G and L are okay). Actually, let’s pick “INLET”:
- I (1) – satisfies I must be in 1 or 2
- N (3) – allowed position
- L (4) – new letter
- E (5) – confirmed
- T is excluded, but T not in INLET… wait, INLET has T, which is excluded. Oops.

Next candidate: “INNER” has two N’s and an R (excluded).

Try “INDLE” – but D and L okay, but is INDLE a word? No.

Better: “INDIE” – but two I’s and we already know I appears once.

How about “INNER” – again R is excluded.

Try “INGLE” – I N G L E.
- I in 1 – allowed
- N in 2 – but in UNTIE N got “-” in 2, so N cannot be in 2.  
So N must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s place N in position 3: _ _ N _ E
I must be in 1 or 2.  
Common word: “MINCE” – but C is allowed, M new. Check:
- M I N C E
- I in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- C and M new
- Ends with E
- No excluded letters.

Looks good.
