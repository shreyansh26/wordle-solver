For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and has a good chance of revealing information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, D

A popular starting word that incorporates these is ""ARISE"" because it uses:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters, maximizing information gain
- All letters are common in 5-letter words

This should give good feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word at all.  
R(x) – R is NOT in the word at all.  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word at all.  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word at all.

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, D, C, M, P  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A, I are out)

A balanced choice that fits these constraints is “OCEAN”, but that contains A – which is ruled out.  
Next balanced possibility: “TULIP” – but contains I.  
“UNLET” – contains N, L, T, E. Let me check:
- Letters: U, N, L, E, T  
- Contains E (pos 4, so not 5 – OK)  
- Excludes A, R, I, S – OK  
- Uses fresh common consonants T, N, L

“UNLET” seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. ARISE → A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ The word has an E somewhere, but not at position 5.  
   ⇒ No A, R, I, S anywhere.

2. UNLET → U(x) N(x) L(✓) E(-) T(x)  
   ⇒ L is in the word and already in the correct 3rd position.  
   ⇒ E is present but not in the 4th or 5th positions (from the earlier “E(-)”).  
   ⇒ No U, N, T.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ L _ _ (L is fixed at position 3).  
- E must appear once, but not at position 4 or 5 ⇒ E must be at position 1 or 2.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, I, S, U, N, T.

Remaining frequent consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O, E (E already counted once, but could it appear twice? – the feedback only guarantees at least one E, so we should assume one for now)

Let’s first try E in position 1: E _ L _ _  
We need two more consonants, none of the banned ones, and we want common ones to maximize info.  
Good consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: O (and maybe another E, but we’ll start with one).

Possible candidates:
- ELBOW – but W is often low-frequency, not ideal for a third guess.  
- ELMOP – not a word.  
- ELDOM – not valid either.  
- ELFIN – F and N: N is banned.  
- ELCID – not valid.  
- ELCHI – not valid.  
- ELGIN – G is OK, but I is banned.  
- ELKOH – not valid.  
- ELMOT – T is banned.  
- ELCOH – not valid.  

How about E in position 2: _ E L _ _  
Again two consonants needed.  
Common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  

Let’s look for real words:
- DELVE – but V is acceptable, D and V are allowed.  
- GELID – I banned.  
- HELLO – O and H are allowed, but repeated L – OK, but we want fresh letters.  
- FELON – N banned.  
- BELCH – B, C, H allowed.  
- PELOM – not a word.  
- CELLO – O is allowed, C and O are fine, and we’ve had no L feedback for duplicates.  
But CELLO is 5 letters (C-E-L-L-O). It reuses L in 4th position, but feedback so far only guarantees one L. That’s risky; we may learn less.

A better choice is DELVE:
- D, E, L, V, E – letters are all allowed except E is already known.  
- E appears in position 2, which is allowed by the feedback.  
- D, V are fresh common consonants.

So we now know:

- E must appear once, but not at position 4 or 5 ⇒ E must be at position 1 or 2.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, I, S, U, N, T.

Remaining frequent consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: O, E (E already counted once, but could it appear twice? – the feedback only guarantees at least one E, so we should assume one for now)

A better choice is DELVE:

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The letters A, R, I, S, U, N, T, D, V are NOT in the word at all.
2. E is in the word and is in the 2nd position.
3. L is in the word and is in the 3rd position.

So the pattern is: _ E L _ _

Remaining available letters (not yet ruled out):
- Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z (but J, Q, X, Z are rare in 5-letter words, so we will focus on B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y)
- Vowels: O (all other vowels A, I, U already ruled out), and E is already placed.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5. They must be from the allowed set above and form a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s list a few valid word patterns:

- B E L _ _ : BELCH, BELGA, BELIE, BELLE... but we need to avoid ruled-out letters and duplicates. Let's see:
  - BELCH: C, H allowed (C, H not ruled out yet).
  - BELGA: G allowed, A banned.
  - BELIE: I banned.
  - BELLE: duplicate L is possible, but we have no info against it, but we want fresh letters.

- H E L _ _ : HELIX (I banned), HELLO (O allowed, L duplicate), HELPS (S banned), HELMS (S banned), HELLO is possible.

- C E L _ _ : CELLO (O allowed, L duplicate), CELTS (S, T banned), CELLA (A banned).

- K E L _ _ : KELPS (S banned).

- F E L _ _ : FELON (N banned), FELLS (S banned), FELLY (Y allowed).

From these, the valid words without ruled-out letters and with allowed letters are:

- BELCH: B, E, L, C, H – all allowed (no A, R, I, S, U, N, T, D, V in BELCH)
- HELLO: H, E, L, L, O – all allowed (no banned letters, O is allowed)
- CELLO: C, E, L, L, O – allowed
- FELLY: F, E, L, L, Y – allowed

Among these, BELCH and HELLO are both good candidates. Between the two, BELCH uses fresh letters B, C, H which might give more information, while HELLO reuses L, which we already know is in the word. So BELCH is slightly better for information gain.

But wait – let’s double-check BELCH against all constraints:
- E is in position 2: B E L C H – yes, E is at 2.
- L is in position 3: yes.
- No banned letters: B, E, L, C, H – none of A, R, I, S, U, N, T, D, V are present.
- All letters are valid.

HELLO would also fit, but we’d learn less since L is already confirmed.

So BELCH is the best next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, especially vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, D

A popular starting word that incorporates these is ""ARISE"" because it uses:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No duplicate letters, maximizing information gain
- All letters are common in 5-letter words

This should give good feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.

- E is in position 2: B E L C H – yes, E is at 2.
- L is in position 3: yes.
- No banned letters: B, E, L, C, H – none of A, R, I, S, U, N, T, D, V are present.
- All letters are valid.

HELLO would also fit, but we’d learn less since L is already confirmed.

So BELCH is the best next guess.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Known pattern: _ E L _ _   (E in 2nd, L in 3rd)
2. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, I, S, U, N, T, D, V, B, C   (from all feedback)
3. From Guess 4 (BELCH):
   - H(-) ⇒ H is in the word, but not in 5th position.  
   Therefore H must occupy either 1st or 4th spot.

4. Allowed letters left for positions 1 & 4:
   - Vowels: O (only remaining)  
   - Consonants: F, G, J, K, M, P, W, Y, Z (but J, Q, X, Z are rare)
   - H must appear once (and not at 5), so it can be at 1 or 4.

Let’s list possible valid patterns:

Case 1: H at 1 → H E L _ _
   Remaining letter for 5th slot must be from allowed set (cannot be any of the banned and must form a word).
   Popular endings:  
   - H E L P _  – P available → HELP?  But needs 4th letter.  Actually pattern is HEL??  
   Real 5-letter words:  
   - HELIO (I banned)  
   - HELLO (O allowed, duplicate L acceptable)  
   - HELPS (S banned)  
   - HELVE (V banned)  
   Only HELLO fits.

Case 2: H at 4 → _ E L H _  
   Need 1st and 5th letters, both must be allowed.  
   Valid words:
   - F E L H ? – none common.  
   - G E L H ? – none.  
   - M E L H ? – none.  
   - P E L H ? – none.  
   - W E L H ? – none.  
   - Y E L H ? – none.  
   - K E L H ? – none.  
   So only HELLO works.

Therefore the only remaining valid candidate is HELLO.

(Also double-check HELLO against feedback: letters H, E, L, L, O – none of the forbidden letters are present, and it respects _ E L _ _ with the new info that H is somewhere: in HELLO, H is in 1st position, satisfying H(-) from BELCH.)
