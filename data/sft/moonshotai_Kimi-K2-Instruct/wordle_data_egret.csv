For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants effectively. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, and N. The word ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
2. These are among the most common letters in English words
3. This will give me maximum information about which letters are in the word and their positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, S.
- DOES contain R (but not in slot 2) and E (but not in slot 5).

Let’s pick a new guess that:
1. Keeps R and E (in different positions).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out (T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good word that fits these criteria is ""TIRED"":
- T and I are new, common letters.
- R is moved to slot 3 (safe, since it wasn’t in slot 2).
- E is moved to slot 2 (safe, since it wasn’t in slot 5).
- D is a new consonant that’s reasonably common.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE  
   A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   ⇒ Letters definitely **not** in the word: A, O, S  
   ⇒ Letters **in** the word but **wrong position**: R, E

2. TIRED  
   T(-) I(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)  
   ⇒ R is correctly placed in position 3.  
   ⇒ E is correctly placed in position 4.  
   ⇒ Letters **not** in the word: I, D (in addition to A, O, S from before).  
   ⇒ Letter **in** the word but **wrong position**: T (anywhere except slot 1).

Known so far:  
- Word pattern: _ _ R E _  
- Contains: R (position 3), E (position 4), T (somewhere, but not first)  
- Does **not** contain: A, O, S, I, D

Need a new 5-letter word fitting _ _ R E _ that:
- Uses T somewhere **other than** position 1.  
- Adds new common letters (B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, W, Y).

Candidate words:  
- T is allowed only in positions 2 or 5 (position 3 is R, 4 is E).  
- If T is in slot 2: A (eliminated) → invalid; I (eliminated) → invalid.  
  So T must be in slot 5 → pattern: _ _ R E T  
- Remaining slots (1 and 2) must use allowed letters. Common choices: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, W, Y.

Let’s try “BURET” – but U is ok and B, U, R, E, T:  
- R and E are already locked into positions 3 and 4.  
- T is in position 5.  
- B and U are new letters.

But “BURET” is valid. A simpler common word is “UPPER” – but P is ok (positions: U P P E R) – but R must be in position 3, so this doesn’t fit.

Best match: _ _ R E T → “BURET” is valid. Another is “CURER” but R is already in position 3. Actually “C R E _ _” is invalid since R must be third.

Wait, pattern is _ _ R E _. With T allowed in position 5 → _ _ R E T.

So word ends in R E T. Let’s think of common 5-letter words ending in RET:
- “EGRET” – but E is already in position 4, so position 1 E is ok.  
  Check: E G R E T → positions: 1=E (ok), 2=G (new), 3=R (fixed), 4=E (fixed), 5=T (allowed).  
  Letters used: E, G, R, E, T – none of the eliminated letters (A, O, S, I, D).  

This fits all constraints.
