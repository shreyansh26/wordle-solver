For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. According to frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E — five of the most common letters. This will give us valuable feedback on whether these letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → none of these letters are in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

I now need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does not use R, O, S, or E.

Common letters still available that are frequent in English: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “ADMIT”.
- A is in position 2 (still a valid spot for an “in-word but wrong-position” letter).
- Uses common consonants D, M, I, T, none of which were ruled out.

This should cover four fresh common letters while respecting the constraints.

- Letters **that are NOT in the word**: R, O, S, E, M, I, T.

Remaining common letters we can safely try: L, N, C, U, B, G, H, K, Y.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

According to frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E — five of the most common letters. This will give us valuable feedback on whether these letters are in the word and their positions.

2. Does not use R, O, S, or E.

Common letters still available that are frequent in English: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “ADMIT”.
- A is in position 2 (still a valid spot for an “in-word but wrong-position” letter).

From all feedback so far, the confirmed pattern is:

- _ A N D A

Letters that are correct:
- A in positions 2 and 5  
- N in position 3  
- D in position 4  

Letters that have been ruled out for position 1:  
B, L, P, and every letter already excluded (R, O, S, E, M, I, T, U).

Still-unused consonants for position 1: C, F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Y, Z.

A common 5-letter English word that fits _ A N D A is **HANDA** (a valid variant spelling for the surname Handa).  
H has not yet been ruled out, and all other letters match the pattern and constraints.

Therefore, HANDA is the logical final guess.
