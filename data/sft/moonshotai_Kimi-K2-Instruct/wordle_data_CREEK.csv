For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to include as many of these as possible while avoiding repetition.

Looking at classic Wordle starting words, ""SLATE"" and ""AROSE"" are popular, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (high frequency consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (high frequency consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of possible letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the two guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓, pos 2) O(x) S(x) E(- not at pos 5)
2. TRIPE → T(x) R(✓, pos 2) I(x) P(x) E(- not at pos 5)

Solid facts so far:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- It must contain the letter E, but E is NOT in position 5.
- Letters ruled out entirely: A, O, S, T, I, P
- So remaining alphabet includes all consonants except T, P, S plus vowels E (already confirmed), U, Y (sometimes) but not A, O, I.

Good candidates must therefore:
- Be 5 letters long
- Have R in position 2
- Contain E at position 1, 3, or 4
- Use only letters not yet excluded

Let’s think:
- E _ R _ _  → but R must be position 2, so impossible.
- _ R E _ _  → good possibility. Example: BREAD (but A excluded), CREAK (A excluded), DRECK (K allowed), FREAK (A excluded), GREED (but D allowed), etc.
- _ R _ E _  → also good. Example: CREME (but M allowed), CRUMB (U allowed, no E in final position), etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and puts E in position 3 or 4.
Considering ""D R E _ _"": D is still allowed, E in position 3.
A valid word: D R E A M – but A is excluded.
D R E A R – invalid (A excluded).
D R E C K – valid, but uncommon.
C R E E D – valid, uses C and D still allowed, E twice but E is confirmed. 

But we can only have one E? No restriction on duplicates.

So ""CREED"" fits:
- R at position 2
- E at positions 3 and 4 (no conflict because E simply must appear but not be at position 5)
- Letters used: C, R, E, E, D — none of which are ruled out.

Example: CREME (but M allowed), CRUMB (U allowed, no E in final position), etc.\n\nLet’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and puts E in position 3 or 4.\nConsidering ""D R E _ _"": D is still allowed, E in position 3.\nA valid word: D R E A M – but A is excluded.\nD R E A R – invalid (A excluded).\nD R E C K – valid, but uncommon.\nC R E E D – valid, uses C and D still allowed, E twice but E is confirmed. \n\nBut we can only have one E?

From the new feedback on CREED:

- C(✓)  → C is in the word and in the 1st position.
- R(✓)  → R is in the word and in the 2nd position.

- D(x)  → D is not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: C R E E _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with C R E E. The only common English word that fits is “CREEK” (C R E E K). We already know:

- Letters ruled out: A, O, S, T, I, P, D
- K has never been guessed or ruled out, so it’s still possible.

Therefore, the only possible word left is “CREEK.”
