For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  That means the A is somewhere other than position 3.

Letters we know are not in the word: C, R, N, E  
Letter we know is in the word but not where: A

Good next-step practice is to keep the confirmed letter (A) and try new, common letters in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  
Among the most frequent remaining consonants are T, S, L, P, D, M, etc.; common vowels left are I, O, U.

A balanced word that uses A (not in position 3) plus common other letters is “SLANT”:
- S, L, N (but N was already ruled out) – no good.  
Try “STAMP”: S, T, A, M, P – but P is less common.  
Try “PLANT”: P, L, A, N (again N is out).  
Try “STOMA”: S, T, O, M, A – uses A in position 5 and introduces S, T, O, M.

“STOMA” looks solid: it keeps A (new position 5), brings in S, T, O, M – all high-frequency letters that haven’t been eliminated.

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): C, R, N, E, S, O, M  
Letters that ARE in the word but we don’t yet know their positions (-): A, T

Also, we know:
- A is not in positions 3 or 5.
- T is not in position 2.

So the secret word must contain A and T and none of C, R, N, E, S, O, M.

We need a 5-letter word that fits:
- Contains both A and T.
- May contain any of the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- A must not be in pos 3 or 5.
- T must not be in pos 2.

A good candidate is “BATHY”.

From the three clues so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, O, M, B, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown (still marked “-”): T, H

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _ and must also contain T and H somewhere.

Possible remaining consonants we have not tested yet: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We now know:
- T is not in position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback) and not in position 2 (already marked “-” in Guess 2).  
- H is not in position 4 (Guess 3 feedback).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.  
2. Contains both T and H.  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s place T and H where they are allowed.

Try “DARTH”:
- A is in position 2 ✓  
- Contains T (position 4) and H (position 5).  
- Letters D, A, R, T, H – but R was already ruled out (Guess 1 feedback). So this fails.

Try “FAITH”:
- A in position 2 ✓  
- Contains T (position 4) and H (position 5).  
- Letters F, A, I, T, H – all letters not tested yet (F, I) or confirmed okay (A, T, H).  
- This seems valid. Let’s use FAITH.
