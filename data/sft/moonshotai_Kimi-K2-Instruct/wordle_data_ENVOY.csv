For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll try to use as many of these as possible in a single 5-letter word.

A good starting word is often one that:
1. Uses distinct letters (no duplicates)
2. Contains several common vowels and consonants
3. Is a valid, common 5-letter word

The word ""RAISE"" fits these criteria well - it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to start with.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. It also lacks the letters R, A, I, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps the known E, but moves it to positions 1-4.
2. Avoids R, A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters (T, N, L, O, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these is ""TENDO"" (though it’s less common). A better, more common word is ""TEND"" + a letter, but I need 5 letters. Another good candidate is ""TUNED"" (but D is already in E’s spot). 

A valid option is ""TOWER"" (but it has R, which we know isn’t in the word). ""TONED"" uses T, O, N, E, D.

""TONED"" seems good:
- T, O, N, D are new letters.
- E is moved from 5th to 4th position.

But let me double-check: R, A, I, S are excluded, so TONED fits. 

Another option is ""NOTED"" (same letters, just swapped T/N positions). Either works. I'll go with TONED.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x’s):
R, A, I, S, T, D  

Letter that IS in the word but not yet placed:
E (because it got “-” in both RAISE and TONED)

Letters that are in the word and whose positions are still open:
O (from TONED, it appeared and got a “-”, so it’s in the word but not in position 2)
N (from TONED, same “-” feedback → in word, not in position 3)

So the secret word contains {E, N, O} and does NOT contain {R, A, I, S, T, D}.  
We also know:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 3.

To make a strong next guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses the confirmed letters E, N, O exactly once each.
2. Avoids all the forbidden letters.
3. Adds new common letters (from the remaining pool: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good pattern is to keep E, N, O and add two new consonants that are still allowed and common.

Candidate letters left: L, C, G, H, M, P, U, B, F, etc.

Trying to keep it common, I’ll form a word with E, N, O plus two new consonants, e.g.,

- O N E + two others: but ONE is only 3 letters.
- C O N E + another letter → CONE doesn’t fit.
- P E N + O + another letter → P E N O ? → “PENGO” (valid but obscure).

Better: think of a word with clear letter order.  
Let me choose O in position 1, N in position 4, E in position 2 → O E _ N _.  
Need a consonant for position 3 that’s still allowed. Choosing C (common, not forbidden) and G for last slot: O E C N G → “OECNG” not a word.

Swap: O E N C _ → “OENCH” not valid.

Try N E O _ _ → common word? NE… perhaps “NEON” + 1 letter. “NEONS” has S (forbidden). “NEONS” is out.

O N E _ _ → “ONELY” has L, Y allowed; “ONELY” is a variant spelling of “only”, but usually considered valid. However, “ONLY” is 4 letters.

Next choice: “OPINE” – but I is forbidden.

“NOBLE” – B, L allowed, but D is forbidden (already gone), but “NOBLE” uses B and L which are allowed, and contains N, O, E. Let me check positions:

N O B L E  
- N in pos 1 – could be correct (no info against).
- O in pos 2 – we know O can’t be in pos 2 (from TONED feedback), so NOBLE is invalid.

Next: “PHONE” – H, P allowed, but T is forbidden (already gone) and “PHONE” has P, H, O, N, E. Let’s check:

P H O N E  
- O in pos 3 – allowed (no restriction here).  
- N in pos 4 – we know N can’t be in pos 3, but pos 4 is fine.  
- E in pos 5 – but E cannot be in pos 5 because in RAISE it was in pos 5 and got “-” meaning it’s in word but not in that spot. So E can’t be in pos 5. Thus PHONE is invalid.

Next: “HONEY” – H, Y allowed. Let’s check:

H O N E Y  
- H is allowed.  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED feedback). So HONEY is invalid.

Try “OPEN” + a letter → “OPENS” has S forbidden.  

Try making a word with O in pos 1, E in pos 3, N in pos 5 → O _ E _ N → insert allowed consonants:

O B E L N – not a word.  
O C E A N – but A is forbidden.  
O F E N _ – “OFEN” not a word.  

Try “COMET” – C, M, E, T. But T is forbidden.

Next: “GLOVE” – G, L, V allowed, but O would be in pos 2 (forbidden).  

Try “MONEY” – M, Y allowed. Check positions:

M O N E Y  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED).  

“MONET” – T forbidden.

“OUNCE” – O in pos 1, U, N, C, E. Check:

O U N C E  
- O pos 1 – allowed.  
- N pos 3 – but N cannot be in pos 3 (from TONED). So invalid.

“CONVEY” – too long.

One valid word left that uses E, N, O plus new allowed consonants without violating positions:

“BOGEN” – but B, G, N, O, E – but “BOGEN” is obscure.

Actually, let me re-examine allowed letters:

Confirmed letters to use: E, N, O  
Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, T, D  
Allowed new common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid common word: “CLONE” – but L, C are allowed, and:

C L O N E  
- C pos 1 – allowed.  
- L pos 2 – allowed.  
- O pos 3 – allowed (no restriction).  
- N pos 4 – allowed (restriction was pos 3).  
- E pos 5 – but E cannot be in pos 5 (from RAISE feedback). So invalid.

Next: “FUGUE” – U, G allowed, but has U twice? No, only once. But F, U, G, E – needs N. Not present.

“OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OZONE” – Z allowed, but O repeated, and E in pos 5 forbidden.

“UNION” – I forbidden.

“VOICE” – I, C, but I forbidden.

“COVEN” – C, V, E, N, O. Check positions:

C O V E N  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED).  

“COYEN” – obscure.

“COBEN” – not a word.

“GONER” – R forbidden.

“NOVEM” – not valid.

“PENGO” – obscure.

“PENGO” is valid but rare.

Actually, a clear common option is “HONEY” but O in pos 2 was blocked.  

Wait, let me carefully place E, N, O with no repeats and no forbidden letters.

Secret word must contain E, N, O once each, no R,A,I,S,T,D.

Possible word: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OPENS” – S forbidden.

“OWNER” – R forbidden.

“NOBLE” – O in pos 2 blocked.

“NOVEL” – O in pos 2 blocked.

It seems hard with only E, N, O plus two new consonants. Let me try:

B, L, O, N, E → “BLONE” – not a word.

F, O, N, E, Y → “FONEY” – not standard.

C, O, N, E, Y → “CONEY” – valid!

“CONEY” is a 5-letter word (meaning rabbit or Coney Island). Check constraints:

C O N E Y  
- C – allowed.  
- O – pos 2, but TONED said O is in word but not pos 2 → so O cannot be pos 2. So invalid.

Next: move O away from pos 2.

Try O in pos 3: _ _ O _ _  
E must be in pos 1-4, not 5.  
N must not be in pos 3.

Word: “PHONE” – E in pos 5 invalid.

“BOGIE” – I forbidden.

“VOICE” – I forbidden.

“BONEY” – O in pos 2 invalid.

It’s getting tricky. Let me try:

C O N E Y failed.  

“CONGE” – valid word meaning to dismiss, contains C, O, N, G, E. Check positions:

C O N G E  
- O in pos 2 – invalid.

“CONGE” invalid.

“CONGEY” – too long.

“COGNE” – not a word.

Next: “PENCE” – but no O.

We must include O, N, E. Try:

O N E _ _ → “ONELY” – not standard.

“ONERY” – dialectal, not standard.

“ONSET” – S, T forbidden.

“ONENT” – not a word.

Try N E O _ _ → “NEONS” – S forbidden.

“NEO…” – “NEONS” out.

O N E C _ – “ONEC” + B → “ONECB” no.

Let me list remaining valid 5-letter English words containing only letters from {B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} with at least E, N, O once and no R,A,I,S,T,D.

A valid candidate: “PHONE” – but E in pos 5 invalid.

“PENGO” – obscure.

“BONGE” – not a word.

“BOGEN” – rare.

Actually, “CLONE” was invalid due to E in pos 5.

Let me try moving E to pos 2:

_ E _ _ _ with O and N placed elsewhere.

Example: B E N O _ – “BENON” no.

L E N O _ – “LENOS” – S forbidden.

Next: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

Realizing I need fresh consonants, a good word is “PHONE” invalid due to E.  

But I missed “COVEN” – C, O, V, E, N. Check again:

C O V E N  
- C pos 1 – allowed.  
- O pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED feedback). So invalid.

Another: “CONEY” – same O pos 2 issue.

“NOVEL” – O pos 2 invalid.

“OVEN” + Y → “OVENY” no.

“OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OPEN” + Y → “OPENY” no.

Finally, let me try “OCEAN” replacement: “OCEAN” A forbidden.

“OCEAN” invalid.

“COYEN” – not standard.

“COVEN” – O pos 2 invalid.

“COZEN” – Z allowed, but O pos 2 invalid.

“COVEN” invalid.

“COXEN” – X allowed, O pos 2 invalid.

It appears every valid 5-letter English word with E, N, O plus allowed consonants places O in pos 2 (which is blocked) or E in pos 5 (blocked). Therefore, I must have missed a word.

Wait, the word “PENGO” is valid (5-letter, variant of “pengo” currency), uses P, E, N, G, O. Check positions:

P E N G O  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- N pos 3 – but TONED said N is in word but not pos 3 → so N cannot be pos 3. So invalid.

Next: “PONGE” – not standard.

“GONEF” – F allowed, E pos 4, O pos 2 invalid.

“GONER” – R forbidden.

“GONNE” – N doubled.

“GENOA” – A forbidden.

“GENOA” invalid.

Try “FUNGO” – F, U, N, G, O. Check:

F U N G O  
- Contains E? No, missing E → invalid.

“COGUE” – U allowed, but no N.

I must include E, N, O exactly once each, no R,A,I,S,T,D, and avoid O at pos 2 and N at pos 3, E at pos 4/5.

One valid word: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OUNCE” – N pos 3 invalid.

“OVENS” – S forbidden.

“OVEN” – too short.

After careful search, a valid word meeting all constraints is:

L E N O X – but “LENOX” is a proper noun.

“LEMON” – M allowed, positions:

L E M O N  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- O pos 4 – allowed.  
- N pos 5 – allowed (restriction was pos 3).  
- Letters used: L, E, M, O, N – all allowed, and contains E, N, O once each.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess should be “LEMON”.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word contains E, N, and O (each exactly once).
- It does NOT contain R, A, I, S, T, D.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 3.

The word “LEMON” uses:
- L and M (new common letters not yet tried).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- M is allowed.
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- N in position 5 (allowed).

<guess>LEMON</guess>",LEMON,"Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x’s):
R, A, I, S, T, D  

Letter that IS in the word but not yet placed:
E (because it got “-” in both RAISE and TONED)

Letters that are in the word and whose positions are still open:
O (from TONED, it appeared and got a “-”, so it’s in the word but not in position 2)
N (from TONED, same “-” feedback → in word, not in position 3)

So the secret word contains {E, N, O} and does NOT contain {R, A, I, S, T, D}.  
We also know:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 3.

To make a strong next guess, I want a word that:
1. Uses the confirmed letters E, N, O exactly once each.
2. Avoids all the forbidden letters.
3. Adds new common letters (from the remaining pool: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good pattern is to keep E, N, O and add two new consonants that are still allowed and common.

Candidate letters left: L, C, G, H, M, P, U, B, F, etc.

Trying to keep it common, I’ll form a word with E, N, O plus two new consonants, e.g.,

- O N E + two others: but ONE is only 3 letters.
- C O N E + another letter → CONE doesn’t fit.
- P E N + O + another letter → P E N O ? → “PENGO” (valid but obscure).

Better: think of a word with clear letter order.  
Let me choose O in position 1, N in position 4, E in position 2 → O E _ N _.  
Need a consonant for position 3 that’s still allowed. Choosing C (common, not forbidden) and G for last slot: O E C N G → “OECNG” not a word.

Swap: O E N C _ → “OENCH” not valid.

Try N E O _ _ → common word? NE… perhaps “NEON” + 1 letter. “NEONS” has S (forbidden). “NEONS” is out.

O N E _ _ → “ONELY” has L, Y allowed; “ONELY” is a variant spelling of “only”, but usually considered valid. However, “ONLY” is 4 letters.

Next choice: “OPINE” – but I is forbidden.

“NOBLE” – B, L allowed, but D is forbidden (already gone), but “NOBLE” uses B and L which are allowed, and contains N, O, E. Let me check positions:

N O B L E  
- N in pos 1 – could be correct (no info against).
- O in pos 2 – we know O can’t be in pos 2 (from TONED feedback), so NOBLE is invalid.

Next: “PHONE” – H, P allowed, but T is forbidden (already gone) and “PHONE” has P, H, O, N, E. Let’s check:

P H O N E  
- O in pos 3 – allowed (no restriction here).  
- N in pos 4 – we know N can’t be in pos 3, but pos 4 is fine.  
- E in pos 5 – but E cannot be in pos 5 because in RAISE it was in pos 5 and got “-” meaning it’s in word but not in that spot. So E can’t be in pos 5. Thus PHONE is invalid.

Next: “HONEY” – H, Y allowed. Let’s check:

H O N E Y  
- H is allowed.  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED feedback). So HONEY is invalid.

Try “OPEN” + a letter → “OPENS” has S forbidden.  

Try making a word with O in pos 1, E in pos 3, N in pos 5 → O _ E _ N → insert allowed consonants:

O B E L N – not a word.  
O C E A N – but A is forbidden.  
O F E N _ – “OFEN” not a word.  

Try “COMET” – C, M, E, T. But T is forbidden.

Next: “GLOVE” – G, L, V allowed, but O would be in pos 2 (forbidden).  

Try “MONEY” – M, Y allowed. Check positions:

M O N E Y  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED).  

“MONET” – T forbidden.

“OUNCE” – O in pos 1, U, N, C, E. Check:

O U N C E  
- O pos 1 – allowed.  
- N pos 3 – but N cannot be in pos 3 (from TONED). So invalid.

“CONVEY” – too long.

One valid word left that uses E, N, O plus new allowed consonants without violating positions:

“BOGEN” – but B, G, N, O, E – but “BOGEN” is obscure.

Actually, let me re-examine allowed letters:

Confirmed letters to use: E, N, O  
Forbidden letters: R, A, I, S, T, D  
Allowed new common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A valid common word: “CLONE” – but L, C are allowed, and:

C L O N E  
- C pos 1 – allowed.  
- L pos 2 – allowed.  
- O pos 3 – allowed (no restriction).  
- N pos 4 – allowed (restriction was pos 3).  
- E pos 5 – but E cannot be in pos 5 (from RAISE feedback). So invalid.

Next: “FUGUE” – U, G allowed, but has U twice? No, only once. But F, U, G, E – needs N. Not present.

“OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OZONE” – Z allowed, but O repeated, and E in pos 5 forbidden.

“UNION” – I forbidden.

“VOICE” – I, C, but I forbidden.

“COVEN” – C, V, E, N, O. Check positions:

C O V E N  
- O in pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED).  

“COYEN” – obscure.

“COBEN” – not a word.

“GONER” – R forbidden.

“NOVEM” – not valid.

“PENGO” – obscure.

“PENGO” is valid but rare.

Actually, a clear common option is “HONEY” but O in pos 2 was blocked.  

Wait, let me carefully place E, N, O with no repeats and no forbidden letters.

Secret word must contain E, N, O once each, no R,A,I,S,T,D.

Possible word: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OPENS” – S forbidden.

“OWNER” – R forbidden.

“NOBLE” – O in pos 2 blocked.

“NOVEL” – O in pos 2 blocked.

It seems hard with only E, N, O plus two new consonants. Let me try:

B, L, O, N, E → “BLONE” – not a word.

F, O, N, E, Y → “FONEY” – not standard.

C, O, N, E, Y → “CONEY” – valid!

“CONEY” is a 5-letter word (meaning rabbit or Coney Island). Check constraints:

C O N E Y  
- C – allowed.  
- O – pos 2, but TONED said O is in word but not pos 2 → so O cannot be pos 2. So invalid.

Next: move O away from pos 2.

Try O in pos 3: _ _ O _ _  
E must be in pos 1-4, not 5.  
N must not be in pos 3.

Word: “PHONE” – E in pos 5 invalid.

“BOGIE” – I forbidden.

“VOICE” – I forbidden.

“BONEY” – O in pos 2 invalid.

It’s getting tricky. Let me try:

C O N E Y failed.  

“CONGE” – valid word meaning to dismiss, contains C, O, N, G, E. Check positions:

C O N G E  
- O in pos 2 – invalid.

“CONGE” invalid.

“CONGEY” – too long.

“COGNE” – not a word.

Next: “PENCE” – but no O.

We must include O, N, E. Try:

O N E _ _ → “ONELY” – not standard.

“ONERY” – dialectal, not standard.

“ONSET” – S, T forbidden.

“ONENT” – not a word.

Try N E O _ _ → “NEONS” – S forbidden.

“NEO…” – “NEONS” out.

O N E C _ – “ONEC” + B → “ONECB” no.

Let me list remaining valid 5-letter English words containing only letters from {B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} with at least E, N, O once and no R,A,I,S,T,D.

A valid candidate: “PHONE” – but E in pos 5 invalid.

“PENGO” – obscure.

“BONGE” – not a word.

“BOGEN” – rare.

Actually, “CLONE” was invalid due to E in pos 5.

Let me try moving E to pos 2:

_ E _ _ _ with O and N placed elsewhere.

Example: B E N O _ – “BENON” no.

L E N O _ – “LENOS” – S forbidden.

Next: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

Realizing I need fresh consonants, a good word is “PHONE” invalid due to E.  

But I missed “COVEN” – C, O, V, E, N. Check again:

C O V E N  
- C pos 1 – allowed.  
- O pos 2 – forbidden (from TONED feedback). So invalid.

Another: “CONEY” – same O pos 2 issue.

“NOVEL” – O pos 2 invalid.

“OVEN” + Y → “OVENY” no.

“OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OPEN” + Y → “OPENY” no.

Finally, let me try “OCEAN” replacement: “OCEAN” A forbidden.

“OCEAN” invalid.

“COYEN” – not standard.

“COVEN” – O pos 2 invalid.

“COZEN” – Z allowed, but O pos 2 invalid.

“COVEN” invalid.

“COXEN” – X allowed, O pos 2 invalid.

It appears every valid 5-letter English word with E, N, O plus allowed consonants places O in pos 2 (which is blocked) or E in pos 5 (blocked). Therefore, I must have missed a word.

Wait, the word “PENGO” is valid (5-letter, variant of “pengo” currency), uses P, E, N, G, O. Check positions:

P E N G O  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- N pos 3 – but TONED said N is in word but not pos 3 → so N cannot be pos 3. So invalid.

Next: “PONGE” – not standard.

“GONEF” – F allowed, E pos 4, O pos 2 invalid.

“GONER” – R forbidden.

“GONNE” – N doubled.

“GENOA” – A forbidden.

“GENOA” invalid.

Try “FUNGO” – F, U, N, G, O. Check:

F U N G O  
- Contains E? No, missing E → invalid.

“COGUE” – U allowed, but no N.

I must include E, N, O exactly once each, no R,A,I,S,T,D, and avoid O at pos 2 and N at pos 3, E at pos 4/5.

One valid word: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OUNCE” – N pos 3 invalid.

“OVENS” – S forbidden.

“OVEN” – too short.

After careful search, a valid word meeting all constraints is:

L E N O X – but “LENOX” is a proper noun.

“LEMON” – M allowed, positions:

L E M O N  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- O pos 4 – allowed.  
- N pos 5 – allowed (restriction was pos 3).  
- Letters used: L, E, M, O, N – all allowed, and contains E, N, O once each.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess should be “LEMON”.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word contains E, N, and O (each exactly once).
- It does NOT contain R, A, I, S, T, D.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 3.

The word “LEMON” uses:
- L and M (new common letters not yet tried).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- M is allowed.
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- N in position 5 (allowed).",Guess 3: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) M(x) O(✓) N(-),FAIL

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly narrow down possible letters in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. I'll try to use as many of these as possible in a single 5-letter word.

A good starting word is often one that:
1. Uses distinct letters (no duplicates)
2. Contains several common vowels and consonants
3. Is a valid, common 5-letter word

The word ""RAISE"" fits these criteria well - it contains:
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to start with.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains E, but not in the 5th position. It also lacks the letters R, A, I, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps the known E, but moves it to positions 1-4.
2. Avoids R, A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters (T, N, L, O, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these is ""TENDO"" (though it’s less common). A better, more common word is ""TEND"" + a letter, but I need 5 letters. Another good candidate is ""TUNED"" (but D is already in E’s spot). 

A valid option is ""TOWER"" (but it has R, which we know isn’t in the word). ""TONED"" uses T, O, N, E, D.

""TONED"" seems good:
- T, O, N, D are new letters.
- E is moved from 5th to 4th position.

But let me double-check: R, A, I, S are excluded, so TONED fits. 

Another option is ""NOTED"" (same letters, just swapped T/N positions). Either works. I'll go with TONED.

Next: “PHONE” – H, P allowed, but T is forbidden (already gone) and “PHONE” has P, H, O, N, E. Let’s check:

P H O N E

“CONVEY” – too long.

One valid word left that uses E, N, O plus new allowed consonants without violating positions:

“COXEN” – X allowed, O pos 2 invalid.

It appears every valid 5-letter English word with E, N, O plus allowed consonants places O in pos 2 (which is blocked) or E in pos 5 (blocked). Therefore, I must have missed a word.

Wait, the word “PENGO” is valid (5-letter, variant of “pengo” currency), uses P, E, N, G, O. Check positions:

P E N G O  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- N pos 3 – but TONED said N is in word but not pos 3 → so N cannot be pos 3. So invalid.

Next: “PONGE” – not standard.

“GONEF” – F allowed, E pos 4, O pos 2 invalid.

“GONER” – R forbidden.

“GONNE” – N doubled.

“GENOA” – A forbidden.

“GENOA” invalid.

Try “FUNGO” – F, U, N, G, O. Check:

F U N G O  
- Contains E? No, missing E → invalid.

“COGUE” – U allowed, but no N.

I must include E, N, O exactly once each, no R,A,I,S,T,D, and avoid O at pos 2 and N at pos 3, E at pos 4/5.

One valid word: “OCEAN” – A forbidden.

“OUNCE” – N pos 3 invalid.

“OVENS” – S forbidden.

“OVEN” – too short.

After careful search, a valid word meeting all constraints is:

L E N O X – but “LENOX” is a proper noun.

“LEMON” – M allowed, positions:

L E M O N  
- E pos 2 – allowed.  
- O pos 4 – allowed.  
- N pos 5 – allowed (restriction was pos 3).  
- Letters used: L, E, M, O, N – all allowed, and contains E, N, O once each.

This fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess should be “LEMON”.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word contains E, N, and O (each exactly once).
- It does NOT contain R, A, I, S, T, D.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 3.

The word “LEMON” uses:
- L and M (new common letters not yet tried).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- M is allowed.
- O in position 4 (allowed).
- N in position 5 (allowed).
