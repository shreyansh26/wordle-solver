For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position. 

Another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains all five common vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S). However, ""SLATE"" is slightly better because 'T' is more common than 'O' in 5-letter words.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the first position (✓).  
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).  

So the word is S _ _ _ _.  
I need a 5-letter word starting with S that contains none of L, A, T, E.  
Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, etc.  
Good vowels left are I, O, U (since A and E are out).  

I’ll pick a word that mixes fresh consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A balanced choice is “SQUID” because:
- Starts with S (confirmed).  
- Uses U and I (remaining vowels).  
- Uses Q and D (new consonants).  

Let me verify: SQUID has no L, A, T, E. It’s valid and informative.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE: S (✓) at position 1, L A T E all absent.
2. SQUID: S (✓) at position 1, Q U I absent, D (✓) at position 5.

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ D
with letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, Q, U, I.

Available letters (no repeats):
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: O (only remaining vowel)

We have three unknown middle positions. We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with S
- ends with D
- uses only remaining letters (no L A T E Q U I)
- preferably uses common letters to maximize info.

Let me think of common words fitting this pattern:
- SOUND: no, has U and O but U is banned
- SWORD: W is allowed, O is allowed. Let's check letters used: S W O R D. None of the banned letters appear. This is valid.
- SCOLD: C, O, L, D. But L is banned.
- SHARD: H, A, R, D. A is banned.
- SPOOF: ends with F, not D
- SMOKE: ends with E, banned
- SPEND: ends with D, but E is banned
- SWORD seems the best candidate.

SWORD uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- W (new consonant)
- O (only remaining vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- D (position 5 ✓)

No banned letters (L,A,T,E,Q,U,I) appear in SWORD. It's a valid English word.
