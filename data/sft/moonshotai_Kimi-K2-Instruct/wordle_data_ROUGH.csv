For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word (✓ or -) and which are not (x). 

A common and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers many frequently used letters in English, including two vowels, which will help narrow down the possibilities quickly. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, we'll have a good starting point.

Every single letter in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) came back “x,” so none of those five letters are in the secret word at all.  
That immediately eliminates a huge chunk of the English lexicon and forces us to choose a word that uses none of those letters.

Next I want to test a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that haven’t been touched yet.  
Good remaining high-frequency letters are: R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

Picking a word that contains several of those:
- “ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D – none of the already-eliminated letters appear.
- “CHIMP” would use C, H, I, M, P – also safe, but slightly less common letters.
- “DROWN” uses D, R, O, W, N – but W is less common than some of the others.

“ROUND” gives us three vowels (O, U) and two very common consonants (R, N) plus D, so it’s a strong second guess.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I (since A, E, O, U are ruled out)

Common, valid five-letter words that fit ROU?? and use only allowed letters:

- ROU**T**E – but T is out  
- ROU**B**Y – unlikely  
- ROU**G**E – uncommon spelling  
- ROU**G**H is the most common remaining candidate.

Checking each letter:  
- G and H have not been tested and are allowed.  
- Word “ROUGH” is valid.

Therefore, our next guess should be that word.
