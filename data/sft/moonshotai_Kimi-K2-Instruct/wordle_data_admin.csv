For the first guess, I don't have any prior information about the secret word. Since the goal is to gather as much information as possible, I should choose a word that has common letters and a good vowel-consonant mix. This way, I can quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". However, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice since it covers high-frequency letters.

Let me go with ""SLATE"".

From the feedback on SLATE we know:
- S, L, T, and E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A.
- Does not contain S, L, T, or E.

I need to pick a word that includes A (not in position 3) and avoids S, L, T, E. I also want to test new common consonants and possibly another vowel.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R, D, I, O are all new letters.
- A is present (in position 2) and not in position 3, so it satisfies the feedback.
- No S, L, T, or E.

So I’ll go with RADIO.

Current confirmed information:

- Letters confirmed IN the word:
    – I is in position 4 (✓)
    – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (so A must be in position 5)
    – D is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (so D must be in position 1, 2)
- Remaining letters yet to be tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the pattern is:
D _ _ I A  or  _ D _ I A

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and tests new common consonants. The word “BUMPI” is invalid because I must be in position 4. Let’s try “BUMID” but that is not a valid English word. Another candidate is “MUDIA” which is not a recognized English word either. The word “MEDIA” is a valid 5-letter word, fits the pattern _ D _ I A, and contains only untested letters M and D.

Therefore, “MEDIA” is a strong next guess.

    – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (so A must be in position 5)
    – D is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (so D must be in position 1, 2)
- Remaining letters yet to be tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the pattern is:
D _ _ I A  or  _ D _ I A

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and tests new common consonants. The word “BUMPI” is invalid because I must be in position 4. Let’s try “BUMID” but that is not a valid English word. Another candidate is “MUDIA” which is not a recognized English word either. The word “MEDIA” is a valid 5-letter word, fits the pattern _ D _ I A, and contains only untested letters M and D.

Therefore, “MEDIA” is a strong next guess.",Guess 4: MEDIA -> FEEDBACK: M(-) E(x) D(-) I(✓) A(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,admin,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since the goal is to gather as much information as possible, I should choose a word that has common letters and a good vowel-consonant mix. This way, I can quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

A popular first guess in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". However, I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice since it covers high-frequency letters.

Let me go with ""SLATE"".

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE we know:
- S, L, T, and E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A.
- Does not contain S, L, T, or E.

I need to pick a word that includes A (not in position 3) and avoids S, L, T, E. I also want to test new common consonants and possibly another vowel.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R, D, I, O are all new letters.
- A is present (in position 2) and not in position 3, so it satisfies the feedback.
- No S, L, T, or E.

So I’ll go with RADIO.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, O (all marked “x”).
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong places (so far): A (must not be 3rd), D (must not be 3rd).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (4th). So positions are: _ _ _ I _.

We still need to test other common consonants (N, C, K, M, P, B, G, F, H, etc.) and the remaining vowel U, while placing A and D in new positions.

A good candidate is “CANDY”:
- C is new.
- A is present (2nd position, not 3rd – satisfies feedback).
- N is new.
- D is present (5th position, not 3rd – satisfies feedback).
- Y is new.
- The 4th letter remains I (correct).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, R, O).

So I’ll go with CANDY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:

    – D is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (so D must be in position 1, 2)
- Remaining letters yet to be tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the pattern is:
D _ _ I A  or  _ D _ I A

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and tests new common consonants. The word “BUMPI” is invalid because I must be in position 4.

Current constraints:

1. Letters NOT in word: S, L, T, E, R, O, C, Y, M (all marked x or placed incorrectly).
2. Letters confirmed IN word:
   - I is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in word but NOT positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from feedback on MEDIA: A is not in 5th).  
     This leaves only position 4, but 4 is already I, so A must be in position 3.  
     However, A was marked (-) in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 across all guesses.  
     This seems contradictory, so let me re-express A's constraints:

   - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
     But there are only 5 positions, so A cannot be in the word at all.  
     Yet A was marked (-) in SLATE, RADIO, CANDY, MEDIA, meaning A is in word but in wrong positions.  
     This suggests A must be in position 4, but 4 is already I.  
     This is impossible, so I must have misread.

   Wait, MEDIA feedback: M(-) E(x) D(-) I(✓) A(-).  
   This means:
   - M is in word but not in 1st position.
   - E is not in word (x) – already knew this.
   - D is in word but not in 3rd position.
   - I is in 4th position (✓).
   - A is in word but not in 5th position.

   So A can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are excluded).

   Let me re-list:

   - I is locked in 4th position: _ _ _ I _
   - A is in word but not positions 1,4,5 → positions 2 or 3.
   - D is in word but not positions 3,5 → positions 1 or 2.
   - M is in word but not position 1 → positions 2,3,4,5 (but 4 is I, 5 excluded if A is there).
   - Valid letters left: A, D, I, M, plus untested consonants B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

   Possible patterns:
   - D A _ I _ : but A must be 2nd or 3rd, this has A 2nd.
   - D _ A I _ : but D can't be 3rd, so A 3rd, D 1st.
   - _ D A I _ : M could be here.
   - _ A D I _ : but D can't be 3rd, this has D 3rd – invalid.

   Best candidate: D A _ I _ or D _ A I _.

   Need a 5-letter word with:
   - I in 4th
   - A in 2nd or 3rd
   - D in 1st or 2nd
   - M somewhere
   - Other letters from allowed set.

   Possible words:
   - D A M I _ : need 5th letter, must be unused. DAMIX not valid, DAMID no, DAMIA no.
   - D A N I _ : DANIX no, DANIA no.
   - D A V I D : D in 5th – invalid (D can't be 5th).
   - D A V I _ : DAVID invalid, DAVIA no.
   - D A B I D : invalid.
   - D A B I _ : DABIA no.
   - M A D I _ : M in 1st – invalid (M can't be 1st).
   - _ A D I _ : but D can't be 3rd.
   - _ D A I _ : M could be 1st: M D A I _ invalid.
   - B A D I _ : B in 1st, A 2nd, D 3rd – but D can't be 3rd. Invalid.
   - F A D I _ : same issue.
   - H A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - N A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - P A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.

   Wait, D cannot be 3rd (from CANDY: D(-) means D not in 3rd), and cannot be 5th (from MEDIA: A(-) implies A not 5th, but D wasn't restricted from 5th – checking):

   Actually, D restrictions:
   - From RADIO: D(-) – D not in 3rd.
   - From CANDY: D(-) – D not in 3rd (same).
   - From MEDIA: D(-) – D not in 3rd.
   - No feedback says D can't be 5th, so D can be 1,2,5.

   Similarly, A:
   - From SLATE: A(-) – not 3rd.
   - From RADIO: A(-) – not 2nd.
   - From CANDY: A(-) – not 2nd.
   - From MEDIA: A(-) – not 5th.
   So A must be in position 1 (but 1 never tested before), but 1 is possible.
   Wait, in SLATE: A was 3rd, marked (-), so A not 3rd.
   In RADIO: A was 2nd, marked (-), so A not 2nd.
   In CANDY: A was 2nd, marked (-), so A not 2nd.
   In MEDIA: A was 5th, marked (-), so A not 5th.
   Also, position 4 is I.
   So A must be in position 1.

   So pattern: A _ _ I _

   Now D must be in positions 2 or 5 (can't be 3rd, and 1 is A, 4 is I).

   M must be in word but not 1st (from MEDIA: M(-)), so positions 2,3,5.

   Possible words:
   - A D M I _ : need 5th letter. ADMIX valid (though rare), ADMIR not 5-letter.
   - A D _ I _ : need 3rd and 5th, e.g., A D U I _ – no.
   - A _ D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - A _ M I _ : need 2nd and 5th, e.g., A B M I _ no.
   - A _ _ I D : D 5th possible, e.g., A B U I D no.
   - A U M I D – invalid.

   Closest valid word: ADMIX (has A, D, M, I, X). X is untested.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE we know:
- S, L, T, and E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A.
- Does not contain S, L, T, or E.

I need to pick a word that includes A (not in position 3) and avoids S, L, T, E. I also want to test new common consonants and possibly another vowel.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A good candidate is “RADIO”:
- R, D, I, O are all new letters.
- A is present (in position 2) and not in position 3, so it satisfies the feedback.
- No S, L, T, or E.

So I’ll go with RADIO.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(✓) O(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we now know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, O (all marked “x”).
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong places (so far): A (must not be 3rd), D (must not be 3rd).
- I is in the word AND in the correct position (4th). So positions are: _ _ _ I _.

We still need to test other common consonants (N, C, K, M, P, B, G, F, H, etc.) and the remaining vowel U, while placing A and D in new positions.

A good candidate is “CANDY”:
- C is new.
- A is present (2nd position, not 3rd – satisfies feedback).
- N is new.
- D is present (5th position, not 3rd – satisfies feedback).
- Y is new.
- The 4th letter remains I (correct).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, R, O).

So I’ll go with CANDY.

<guess>CANDY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(✓) O(x)
Guess 3: CANDY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) N(-) D(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current confirmed information:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, O, C, Y
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
    – I is in position 4 (✓)
    – A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (so A must be in position 5)
    – D is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (so D must be in position 1, 2)
- Remaining letters yet to be tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

So the pattern is:
D _ _ I A  or  _ D _ I A

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and tests new common consonants. The word “BUMPI” is invalid because I must be in position 4. Let’s try “BUMID” but that is not a valid English word. Another candidate is “MUDIA” which is not a recognized English word either. The word “MEDIA” is a valid 5-letter word, fits the pattern _ D _ I A, and contains only untested letters M and D.

Therefore, “MEDIA” is a strong next guess.

<guess>MEDIA</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(-) I(✓) O(x)
Guess 3: CANDY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) N(-) D(-) Y(x)
Guess 4: MEDIA -> FEEDBACK: M(-) E(x) D(-) I(✓) A(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints:

1. Letters NOT in word: S, L, T, E, R, O, C, Y, M (all marked x or placed incorrectly).
2. Letters confirmed IN word:
   - I is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in word but NOT positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from feedback on MEDIA: A is not in 5th).  
     This leaves only position 4, but 4 is already I, so A must be in position 3.  
     However, A was marked (-) in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 across all guesses.  
     This seems contradictory, so let me re-express A's constraints:

   - A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
     But there are only 5 positions, so A cannot be in the word at all.  
     Yet A was marked (-) in SLATE, RADIO, CANDY, MEDIA, meaning A is in word but in wrong positions.  
     This suggests A must be in position 4, but 4 is already I.  
     This is impossible, so I must have misread.

   Wait, MEDIA feedback: M(-) E(x) D(-) I(✓) A(-).  
   This means:
   - M is in word but not in 1st position.
   - E is not in word (x) – already knew this.
   - D is in word but not in 3rd position.
   - I is in 4th position (✓).
   - A is in word but not in 5th position.

   So A can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are excluded).

   Let me re-list:

   - I is locked in 4th position: _ _ _ I _
   - A is in word but not positions 1,4,5 → positions 2 or 3.
   - D is in word but not positions 3,5 → positions 1 or 2.
   - M is in word but not position 1 → positions 2,3,4,5 (but 4 is I, 5 excluded if A is there).
   - Valid letters left: A, D, I, M, plus untested consonants B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

   Possible patterns:
   - D A _ I _ : but A must be 2nd or 3rd, this has A 2nd.
   - D _ A I _ : but D can't be 3rd, so A 3rd, D 1st.
   - _ D A I _ : M could be here.
   - _ A D I _ : but D can't be 3rd, this has D 3rd – invalid.

   Best candidate: D A _ I _ or D _ A I _.

   Need a 5-letter word with:
   - I in 4th
   - A in 2nd or 3rd
   - D in 1st or 2nd
   - M somewhere
   - Other letters from allowed set.

   Possible words:
   - D A M I _ : need 5th letter, must be unused. DAMIX not valid, DAMID no, DAMIA no.
   - D A N I _ : DANIX no, DANIA no.
   - D A V I D : D in 5th – invalid (D can't be 5th).
   - D A V I _ : DAVID invalid, DAVIA no.
   - D A B I D : invalid.
   - D A B I _ : DABIA no.
   - M A D I _ : M in 1st – invalid (M can't be 1st).
   - _ A D I _ : but D can't be 3rd.
   - _ D A I _ : M could be 1st: M D A I _ invalid.
   - B A D I _ : B in 1st, A 2nd, D 3rd – but D can't be 3rd. Invalid.
   - F A D I _ : same issue.
   - H A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - N A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - P A D I _ : D 3rd invalid.

   Wait, D cannot be 3rd (from CANDY: D(-) means D not in 3rd), and cannot be 5th (from MEDIA: A(-) implies A not 5th, but D wasn't restricted from 5th – checking):

   Actually, D restrictions:
   - From RADIO: D(-) – D not in 3rd.
   - From CANDY: D(-) – D not in 3rd (same).
   - From MEDIA: D(-) – D not in 3rd.
   - No feedback says D can't be 5th, so D can be 1,2,5.

   Similarly, A:
   - From SLATE: A(-) – not 3rd.
   - From RADIO: A(-) – not 2nd.
   - From CANDY: A(-) – not 2nd.
   - From MEDIA: A(-) – not 5th.
   So A must be in position 1 (but 1 never tested before), but 1 is possible.
   Wait, in SLATE: A was 3rd, marked (-), so A not 3rd.
   In RADIO: A was 2nd, marked (-), so A not 2nd.
   In CANDY: A was 2nd, marked (-), so A not 2nd.
   In MEDIA: A was 5th, marked (-), so A not 5th.
   Also, position 4 is I.
   So A must be in position 1.

   So pattern: A _ _ I _

   Now D must be in positions 2 or 5 (can't be 3rd, and 1 is A, 4 is I).

   M must be in word but not 1st (from MEDIA: M(-)), so positions 2,3,5.

   Possible words:
   - A D M I _ : need 5th letter. ADMIX valid (though rare), ADMIR not 5-letter.
   - A D _ I _ : need 3rd and 5th, e.g., A D U I _ – no.
   - A _ D I _ : D 3rd invalid.
   - A _ M I _ : need 2nd and 5th, e.g., A B M I _ no.
   - A _ _ I D : D 5th possible, e.g., A B U I D no.
   - A U M I D – invalid.

   Closest valid word: ADMIX (has A, D, M, I, X). X is untested.

   Let’s try ADMIX.

   Check:
   - A in 1st (new position).
   - D in 2nd (new position).
   - M in 3rd (new position, satisfies M(-) from MEDIA).
   - I in 4th (correct).
   - X new.

   ADMIX is valid English.
