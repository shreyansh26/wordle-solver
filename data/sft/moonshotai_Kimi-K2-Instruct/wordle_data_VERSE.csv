Since this is the first guess without any prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information about the secret word's composition
2. Covers vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It covers 5 unique letters with high frequency in English words
- It can quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is NOT in the word.
- I(x): I is NOT in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in position 4.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (but NOT 1).
2. S is in position 4.
3. E is in position 5.
4. A and I are not in the word.

- MOUSE (M, O, U - but we haven't tested these)
- BOUSE (B, O, U)
- TOUSE (T, O, U)

Given we haven't tested O or U yet, and needing to include R, a good guess would be ROUSE which places R in position 1 (but R can't be in position 1 - it's marked with ""-"").

Alternative: MOUSE (but no R)

- E is in position 5 (fixed)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from RAISE and PROSE)
- A, I, O, P are NOT in the word.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3 or 4.  But position 4 is S, so R must be in position 3.

Current word pattern: _ _ R S E

Letters we still need to try in positions 1 and 2 (excluding known absent letters A, I, O, P and already placed R, S, E):

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, plus vowel U.

We want a valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ R S E.

Examples: BURSE, CURSE, DORSE (but O is out), FURSE, GORSE (O out), HORSE (O out), KURSE (not valid), LURSE (not valid), MURSE (not valid), NURSE, TURSE (not common), VERSE, WORSE (O out), etc.

The most common valid ones: CURSE, NURSE, VERSE.

Choose NURSE as it includes the new vowel U which we haven't tested yet and is a common word.

Structure: N U R S E
- N and U are new letters
- R is in position 3
- S is in position 4
- E is in position 5

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

1. Uses common letters to maximize information about the secret word's composition
2. Covers vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- It covers 5 unique letters with high frequency in English words
- It can quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is NOT in the word.
- I(x): I is NOT in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in position 4.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. R is somewhere in positions 2-5 (but NOT 1).
2. S is in position 4.
3. E is in position 5.
4. A and I are not in the word.

We need a word with:
- S in position 4
- E in position 5
- R somewhere else (positions 2 or 3)
- No A or I
- 5-letter valid word

Possible structure: _ _ _ S E or _ _ R S E or _ R _ S E

Common words with S in 4th and E in 5th:
- ROUSE (but has U and O which we don't know about)
- MOUSE (M, O, U - but we haven't tested these)
- BOUSE (B, O, U)
- TOUSE (T, O, U)

Given we haven't tested O or U yet, and needing to include R, a good guess would be ROUSE which places R in position 1 (but R can't be in position 1 - it's marked with ""-"").

Alternative: MOUSE (but no R)
Alternative: TOUSE (but no R)

Wait, let's think differently. We need R somewhere in positions 2-5, but positions 4 and 5 are taken by S and E. So possible positions for R are 2 or 3.

Looking for words with structure:
- _ R _ S E
- _ _ R S E

Examples:
- BROSE (B, R, O)
- CRISE (C, R, I - but I is out)
- DROSE (D, R, O)
- PROSE (P, R, O)

PROSE fits:
- P in 1 (new letter)
- R in 2 (valid since R can't be in 1)
- O in 3 (new letter)
- S in 4 (correct)
