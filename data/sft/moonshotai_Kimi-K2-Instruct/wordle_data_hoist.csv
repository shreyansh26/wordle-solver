Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
2. Have no repeating letters to maximize information
3. Include letters that appear frequently in English words

Popular effective starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, RAISE, CRISP, ADIEU. Among these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C - common consonant
- R - very common consonant
- A - most common vowel
- N - common consonant
- E - most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in CRANE were rejected, so we now know:  
- The word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.  
- This eliminates a huge swath of English words and shifts the focus to letter sets that exclude these five.

To maximize information in the second guess we should:  
1. Choose a word that uses five completely new letters (none of C,R,A,N,E).  
2. Favor letters that are still very common in English: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, etc.  
3. Avoid any duplicates so each letter tests a new slot.

A widely recommended “second guess” after an all-gray CRANE is “SLOTH” or “LUMPS”, but “SLOTH” is preferred because it includes S, L, O, T, H, all of which are frequent and none of which were in CRANE.  That gives us a fresh set of consonants and the vowel O.

So: S, L, O, T, H.

From the two guesses we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, L  
Letters known to be in the word (but position unknown): S, O, T, H  
Positions ruled out:
- S is **not** in position 1  
- O is **not** in position 3  
- T is **not** in position 4  
- H is **not** in position 5  

So the secret word is made up solely of the letters S, O, T, H plus one more unknown letter (since we have only four confirmed letters and we need five).  
The only vowels left that haven’t been tried yet are I and U (plus Y if we allow semi-vowels).  
A good next step is to pick a word that keeps the four known letters S, O, T, H and adds one new letter that we haven’t used yet.  
Possible new letters to try: I, U, D, P, M, etc.  
A word that uses S, O, T, H and one new letter is “SHOUT” (S, H, O, U, T).  
- It keeps the known letters S, O, T, H.  
- It introduces a new vowel U, which has not been tested yet.  
- It also reuses S, O, T, H in different positions to help pinpoint their correct locations.

Current information:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, E, L, U.
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: S, H, O.
3. One letter is known to be in the word and in the correct position: T at position 5.
   So the word ends in T: _ _ _ _ T.

The known letters S, H, O must appear somewhere in the first four positions.
We need two more consonants to complete the set (since we already have three of the five letters: S, H, O, and T).
We have not tested yet: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Ends in T.
- Uses the letters S, H, O in new positions.
- Introduces two new letters that we haven't tested yet.

Possible candidates: 
- POSHT (but O is already known, S, H, T are known, P and O are in it, but O is already known)
- DHOST (D and O are in it, but O is already known, D is new)
- GHOST (G and H are in it, but H is already known, G is new)

GHOST uses G (new), H (known), O (known), S (known), T (correct position). This seems like a good guess because:
- It keeps T in position 5.
- It uses S, H, O in different positions to test their correct locations.
- It introduces G, a common letter we haven't tested yet.

The pattern is ** _ _ _ _ T **.  
We must place S, H, O in the first four slots and need one more new letter.  
A straightforward candidate is **GHOST**, which:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no information about the secret word, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that can help us quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
2. Have no repeating letters to maximize information
3. Include letters that appear frequently in English words

Popular effective starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, RAISE, CRISP, ADIEU. Among these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C - common consonant
- R - very common consonant
- A - most common vowel
- N - common consonant
- E - most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE were rejected, so we now know:  
- The word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.  
- This eliminates a huge swath of English words and shifts the focus to letter sets that exclude these five.

To maximize information in the second guess we should:  
1. Choose a word that uses five completely new letters (none of C,R,A,N,E).  
2. Favor letters that are still very common in English: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, etc.  
3. Avoid any duplicates so each letter tests a new slot.

A widely recommended “second guess” after an all-gray CRANE is “SLOTH” or “LUMPS”, but “SLOTH” is preferred because it includes S, L, O, T, H, all of which are frequent and none of which were in CRANE.  That gives us a fresh set of consonants and the vowel O.

So: S, L, O, T, H.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, L  
Letters known to be in the word (but position unknown): S, O, T, H  
Positions ruled out:
- S is **not** in position 1  
- O is **not** in position 3  
- T is **not** in position 4  
- H is **not** in position 5  

So the secret word is made up solely of the letters S, O, T, H plus one more unknown letter (since we have only four confirmed letters and we need five).  
The only vowels left that haven’t been tried yet are I and U (plus Y if we allow semi-vowels).  
A good next step is to pick a word that keeps the four known letters S, O, T, H and adds one new letter that we haven’t used yet.  
Possible new letters to try: I, U, D, P, M, etc.  
A word that uses S, O, T, H and one new letter is “SHOUT” (S, H, O, U, T).  
- It keeps the known letters S, O, T, H.  
- It introduces a new vowel U, which has not been tested yet.  
- It also reuses S, O, T, H in different positions to help pinpoint their correct locations.  
This seems like a very informative next guess.
