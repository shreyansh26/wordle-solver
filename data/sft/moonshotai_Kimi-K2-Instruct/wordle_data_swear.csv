For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should contain frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, and E—five very common letters that appear in many English words.

From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in the first position  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in the second position  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word at all  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in the fifth position  

So we know:
- Letters we have: R, A, S, E
- Letter we must avoid: I
- R is not in position 1, A not in 2, S not in 4, E not in 5

Let’s try placing R somewhere other than 1, A somewhere other than 2, S somewhere other than 4, and E somewhere other than 5. A good candidate is “EARSH” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another option is “ASTER” – valid word, and:

A is not in position 2 – here it’s in position 1 ✔  
R is not in position 1 – here it’s in position 5 ✔  
S is not in position 4 – here it’s in position 2 ✔  
E is not in position 5 – here it’s in position 4 ✔  

So “ASTER” seems to satisfy all constraints and uses the known letters plus T, a common consonant.

From feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, E  
- Letters known NOT in the word: I, T  
- Positional constraints:
  – R is in the word and now known to be in position 5 (from R✓ in ASTER)  
  – A is not in positions 1 or 2  
  – S is not in positions 2 or 4

Current pattern so far: _ _ _ _ R  
We still need to place A, S, E (and possibly one more consonant).

Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in R that use A, S, E and a new consonant, respecting the positional bans.

Try “SABER”:

- A in position 2 (was not in position 2 in RAISE, so allowed)
- B is a new consonant
- E in position 4 (allowed, not banned at 4)
- R in position 5 (matches known R✓)

Check positions:
- A not in position 2 in RAISE (it was there, hence A(-)), so A in position 2 is now forbidden.  
  Oops, that makes “SABER” invalid.

Next candidate: “SAFER”:

Let’s update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word:  
- R (now known to be in position 5 from ASTER)  
- S (now known to be in position 1 from SCARE)  
- A, E (both must still appear somewhere, but not where previously ruled out)  

Letters we know are NOT in the word: I, T, C  

Positional bans so far (positions 1-5):

1  2  3  4  5  
S(✓) – S is locked here, so no ban needed.  
R(✓) – locked at 5, so no ban needed.  

A: cannot be in positions 2 (from RAISE) or 3 (from SCARE)  
E: cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both earlier guesses)  

Therefore:

Position 1: must be S  
Position 5: must be R  

We still need to place A and E in positions 2, 3, 4, but:

- A must avoid positions 2 & 3 → only position 4 is left for A.  
- E must avoid positions 4 & 5 → positions 2 or 3 are left for E.  

That leaves one remaining slot (either 2 or 3) to fill with a new letter.  
We have used: S, R, A, E.  Missing letter must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding I, T, C).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern becomes:  
S _ _ A R   with E needing to go in 2 or 3.

Option 1: S E _ A R → remaining letter must go in position 3.  
Option 2: S _ E A R → remaining letter must go in position 2.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting either pattern.

Option 1: S E _ A R  
Common letters for the blank: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Let’s try S E ? A R:

- SEFAR – not a word

- S D E A R – “SDEAR” – not a word

- S L E A R – “SLEAR” – not a word  
- S M E A R – “SMEAR” – valid word  
- S N E A R – “SNEAR” – archaic, rare  
- S P E A R – “SPEAR” – valid word  

So possible candidates:  
SEGAR, SHEAR, SMEAR, SPEAR.

Among these, “SPEAR” is the most common and uses P, a letter not yet tried.  
Let’s check constraints for SPEAR:  
S(1) ✓, P(2), E(3), A(4), R(5)  

Check bans:  
- A not in 2 or 3 – here it’s in 4 ✔

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,swear,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should contain frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, and E—five very common letters that appear in many English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in the first position  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in the second position  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word at all  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in the fifth position  

So we know:
- Letters we have: R, A, S, E
- Letter we must avoid: I
- R is not in position 1, A not in 2, S not in 4, E not in 5

Let’s try placing R somewhere other than 1, A somewhere other than 2, S somewhere other than 4, and E somewhere other than 5. A good candidate is “EARSH” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another option is “ASTER” – valid word, and:

A is not in position 2 – here it’s in position 1 ✔  
R is not in position 1 – here it’s in position 5 ✔  
S is not in position 4 – here it’s in position 2 ✔  
E is not in position 5 – here it’s in position 4 ✔  

So “ASTER” seems to satisfy all constraints and uses the known letters plus T, a common consonant.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, E  
- Letters known NOT in the word: I, T  
- Positional constraints:
  – R is in the word and now known to be in position 5 (from R✓ in ASTER)  
  – A is not in positions 1 or 2  
  – S is not in positions 2 or 4  
  – E is not in positions 4 or 5 (it was - in both rounds)

Current pattern so far: _ _ _ _ R  
We still need to place A, S, E (and possibly one more consonant).

We have to avoid I and T.

Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in R that use A, S, E and a new consonant, respecting the positional bans.

Try “SABER”:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (was not in position 2 in RAISE, so allowed)
- B is a new consonant
- E in position 4 (allowed, not banned at 4)
- R in position 5 (matches known R✓)

Check positions:
- A not in position 2 in RAISE (it was there, hence A(-)), so A in position 2 is now forbidden.  
  Oops, that makes “SABER” invalid.

Next candidate: “SAFER”:
- S (1) ok
- A (2) — same problem: A was in position 2 in RAISE → forbidden.  

Try “SCARE”:
- S (1) ok
- C (new letter)
- A (3) ok (not banned there)
- R (5) ok
- E (4) ok (not banned at 4)  

Constraints check:
- A never used in position 3 before → allowed.  
- S never used in position 1 before → allowed.  
- E never used in position 4 before → allowed.  
- R in 5 is already confirmed.  

“SCARE” looks valid and covers all required letters plus a new consonant C.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good starting word should contain frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE"" are popular choices because they cover common letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes R, A, I, S, and E—five very common letters that appear in many English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in the first position  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in the second position  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word at all  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in the fifth position  

So we know:
- Letters we have: R, A, S, E
- Letter we must avoid: I
- R is not in position 1, A not in 2, S not in 4, E not in 5

Let’s try placing R somewhere other than 1, A somewhere other than 2, S somewhere other than 4, and E somewhere other than 5. A good candidate is “EARSH” (but that’s not a valid English word). Another option is “ASTER” – valid word, and:

A is not in position 2 – here it’s in position 1 ✔  
R is not in position 1 – here it’s in position 5 ✔  
S is not in position 4 – here it’s in position 2 ✔  
E is not in position 5 – here it’s in position 4 ✔  

So “ASTER” seems to satisfy all constraints and uses the known letters plus T, a common consonant.

<guess>ASTER</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ASTER -> FEEDBACK: A(-) S(-) T(x) E(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, E  
- Letters known NOT in the word: I, T  
- Positional constraints:
  – R is in the word and now known to be in position 5 (from R✓ in ASTER)  
  – A is not in positions 1 or 2  
  – S is not in positions 2 or 4  
  – E is not in positions 4 or 5 (it was - in both rounds)

Current pattern so far: _ _ _ _ R  
We still need to place A, S, E (and possibly one more consonant).

We have to avoid I and T.

Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in R that use A, S, E and a new consonant, respecting the positional bans.

Try “SABER”:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (was not in position 2 in RAISE, so allowed)
- B is a new consonant
- E in position 4 (allowed, not banned at 4)
- R in position 5 (matches known R✓)

Check positions:
- A not in position 2 in RAISE (it was there, hence A(-)), so A in position 2 is now forbidden.  
  Oops, that makes “SABER” invalid.

Next candidate: “SAFER”:
- S (1) ok
- A (2) — same problem: A was in position 2 in RAISE → forbidden.  

Try “SCARE”:
- S (1) ok
- C (new letter)
- A (3) ok (not banned there)
- R (5) ok
- E (4) ok (not banned at 4)  

Constraints check:
- A never used in position 3 before → allowed.  
- S never used in position 1 before → allowed.  
- E never used in position 4 before → allowed.  
- R in 5 is already confirmed.  

“SCARE” looks valid and covers all required letters plus a new consonant C.

<guess>SCARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: ASTER -> FEEDBACK: A(-) S(-) T(x) E(-) R(✓)
Guess 3: SCARE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word:  
- R (now known to be in position 5 from ASTER)  
- S (now known to be in position 1 from SCARE)  
- A, E (both must still appear somewhere, but not where previously ruled out)  

Letters we know are NOT in the word: I, T, C  

Positional bans so far (positions 1-5):

1  2  3  4  5  
S(✓) – S is locked here, so no ban needed.  
R(✓) – locked at 5, so no ban needed.  

A: cannot be in positions 2 (from RAISE) or 3 (from SCARE)  
E: cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both earlier guesses)  

Therefore:

Position 1: must be S  
Position 5: must be R  

We still need to place A and E in positions 2, 3, 4, but:

- A must avoid positions 2 & 3 → only position 4 is left for A.  
- E must avoid positions 4 & 5 → positions 2 or 3 are left for E.  

That leaves one remaining slot (either 2 or 3) to fill with a new letter.  
We have used: S, R, A, E.  Missing letter must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding I, T, C).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern becomes:  
S _ _ A R   with E needing to go in 2 or 3.

Option 1: S E _ A R → remaining letter must go in position 3.  
Option 2: S _ E A R → remaining letter must go in position 2.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting either pattern.

Option 1: S E _ A R  
Common letters for the blank: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Let’s try S E ? A R:  
- SEGAR – valid (a cigar)  
- SEDAR – not a common word  
- SEFAR – not a word  
- SEMAR – not a word  
- SENAR – not a word  
- SEPAR – not a word  
- SESAR – not a word  
Only “SEGAR” seems valid.

Option 2: S _ E A R  
- S B E A R – “SBEAR” – not a word  
- S D E A R – “SDEAR” – not a word  
- S G E A R – “SGEAR” – not a word  
- S H E A R – “SHEAR” – valid word  
- S L E A R – “SLEAR” – not a word  
- S M E A R – “SMEAR” – valid word  
- S N E A R – “SNEAR” – archaic, rare  
- S P E A R – “SPEAR” – valid word  

So possible candidates:  
SEGAR, SHEAR, SMEAR, SPEAR.

Among these, “SPEAR” is the most common and uses P, a letter not yet tried.  
Let’s check constraints for SPEAR:  
S(1) ✓, P(2), E(3), A(4), R(5)  

Check bans:  
- A not in 2 or 3 – here it’s in 4 ✔  
- E not in 4 or 5 – here it’s in 3 ✔  
- S is in 1 ✔  
- R is in 5 ✔  
- No I, T, C present ✔  

“SPEAR” fits all constraints.

After SHEAR we have:

S (✓) 1st position  
H (x) — H is NOT in the word  
E (✓) 3rd position  
A (✓) 4th position  
R (✓) 5th position  

Therefore the only open slot is position 2, and the only remaining letter must be chosen from consonants not yet ruled out:  
Letters already excluded: I, T, C, P, H  
Letters still allowed in position 2: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S _ E A R.

Scanning the dictionary, the only common word that fits is SMEAR (but M hasn’t been excluded).  
However, we only have one un-tried common letter left: M.  

Let’s test SMEAR.  It satisfies every positional requirement.
