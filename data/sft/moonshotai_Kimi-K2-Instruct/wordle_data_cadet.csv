For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. After considering various options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains A and E somewhere other than positions 3 and 5 respectively.
3. Does NOT contain R or N.

Since A and E must be in positions 2, 4, or 5, and C is already fixed in position 1, let's look for five-letter words that start with C, have A and E somewhere, and exclude R and N.

Candidate letters: C (fixed), A, E, and three more consonants not including R or N – common ones left are S, T, L, M, P, etc.

Good second guesses might be ""CESTA"" (but it has T and S which are fine), or ""CLAVE"" (but L and V are fine). However, ""CESTA"" would put E in position 2 and A in position 4 – both allowed by the feedback.

But let me think of a better word that places A and E in different positions. ""CABLE"" has B (allowed), A in 2, E in 5 – but E was originally in 5 and marked wrong, so E can't be in 5. So ""CABLE"" is invalid.

Next option: ""CHASE"" – S and H are fine, A in 3 (but A was in 3 before and marked wrong, so no). 

""CADET"" – D and T are fine, A in 2, E in 4. This seems valid: C is fixed, A not in 3, E not in 5, no R or N.
