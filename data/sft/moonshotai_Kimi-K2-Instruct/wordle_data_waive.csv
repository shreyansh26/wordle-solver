Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to guide us, we should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common letters in English 5-letter words to quickly rule in or out many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L.

Several classic first guesses include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, or even AUDIO (though AUDIO lacks some consonants). Among these, STARE covers S, T, A, R, E - which are all very common letters. 

Let's go with STARE as our first guess since it's strategically strong.

From the feedback:
- S, T, R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).
- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

So the mystery word has:
• Letters known so far: A, E (with E fixed at position 5)
• Letters not in the word: S, T, R
• Position constraints: A cannot be 2nd; E is 5th.

We need a new guess that:
- keeps E in the 5th slot
- keeps A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- avoids S, T, R

Good common consonants left are N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc.

A word that satisfies these rules: PLANE
- P, L, N – none of S,T,R
- A in 3rd place (so not 2nd)
- E in 5th place

Let me check quickly: does PLANE violate anything?
- No S,T,R – good
- A is in the word and not 2nd – good
- E is in 5th – good

So PLANE looks like a strong next guess.

Current facts:
- Letters OUT: S, T, R, P, L, N  
- Letters IN: A (somewhere except 2nd), E (fixed at 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E, contains A but not at 2nd, and uses only the letters that have not been ruled out.

Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Valid vowels: A, E (E already fixed), I, O, U

Constraints:
- Position 5 = E
- A must appear once in positions 1, 3, or 4
- No S, T, R, P, L, N

Candidate words:
- CABE? No, A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAGE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- FAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- GAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- MACE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- WAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.

- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, P, L, N)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to guide us, we should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common letters in English 5-letter words to quickly rule in or out many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L.

Several classic first guesses include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, or even AUDIO (though AUDIO lacks some consonants). Among these, STARE covers S, T, A, R, E - which are all very common letters. 

Let's go with STARE as our first guess since it's strategically strong.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, T, R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).
- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

So the mystery word has:
• Letters known so far: A, E (with E fixed at position 5)
• Letters not in the word: S, T, R
• Position constraints: A cannot be 2nd; E is 5th.

We need a new guess that:
- keeps E in the 5th slot
- keeps A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- avoids S, T, R

Good common consonants left are N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc.

A word that satisfies these rules: PLANE
- P, L, N – none of S,T,R
- A in 3rd place (so not 2nd)
- E in 5th place

Let me check quickly: does PLANE violate anything?
- No S,T,R – good
- A is in the word and not 2nd – good
- E is in 5th – good

So PLANE looks like a strong next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:
- Letters OUT: S, T, R, P, L, N  
- Letters IN: A (somewhere except 2nd), E (fixed at 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E, contains A but not at 2nd, and uses only the letters that have not been ruled out.

Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Valid vowels: A, E (E already fixed), I, O, U

Constraints:
- Position 5 = E
- A must appear once in positions 1, 3, or 4
- No S, T, R, P, L, N

Candidate words:
- CABE? No, A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAGE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- FAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- GAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- MACE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- WAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.

We need A in 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

- ABODE? Has B and D which are still allowed, and A is 1st, E is 5th. Uses O and D – both still possible.
- ADORE? A 1st, D still allowed, O and R – but R is already x’d out. So ADORE is invalid.
- ABOVE? B, V still allowed, A 1st, E 5th. Looks good.

So ABOVE satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains A in 1st position (allowed)
- Uses only B, V, O, E which haven’t been ruled out
- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, P, L, N)

Therefore, ABOVE is a solid next guess.

Let’s update what we now know.

Letters ruled OUT so far:  
S, T, R, P, L, N, B, O, H

Letters confirmed IN:
- V is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)  
- E is also somewhere else (because HEAVE’s first E got “-”, meaning it’s elsewhere)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from STARE, PLANE, ABOVE, HEAVE feedback)
  ⇒ the only remaining spot for A is position 3 … but ABOVE and HEAVE both had A in 3 and still got “-”, so actually A is NOT in 3 either  
  ⇒ the only remaining spot for A is position 4 … but V is already fixed there.  
  This seems impossible unless I’ve miscounted.

Wait: HEAVE feedback: E(-) means “letter E is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position”.  
The 5th position is already known to be E, so that’s fine; E is indeed elsewhere (namely position 5).  
A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
Combining all earlier A feedback:
- Not in 1 (ABOVE)
- Not in 2 (STARE)
- Not in 3 (HEAVE)
- Not in 4 (ABOVE & HEAVE: 4=V)
- Not in 5 (known to be E)

That leaves NO place for A, which can’t be.  
Interpretation error: the “-” feedback only says the letter is somewhere but not in THAT exact position; it doesn’t forbid other positions.  
So A is allowed in 3rd even if earlier guesses had it there and got “-”.

Re-summarize positions:

Known pattern: _ _ _ V E  
Confirmed letters: V(4), E(5)  
Confirmed letters also somewhere: A, extra E  
So word has two E’s and one A, pattern: _ _ A V E  or  _ A _ V E  or A _ _ V E  
But A cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and from HEAVE we know A is not in 3 either (because A(-) in 3rd slot of HEAVE).  
Therefore A must be in 1 or 2.

Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus A, E, V already present).

We need a 5-letter word ending with AVE, with an extra E somewhere among positions 1 or 2, and containing A only in 1 or 2.

Possible candidates:
- LEAVE: L is out
- GRAVE: R, G? R out
- CRAVE: C, R? R out
- BRAVE: B, R out
- WEAVE: W, but only one E
- DWEAVE: too long
- PEAVE: not a word

D(allowed), E(allowed), A(allowed), V(allowed), E(allowed)  
Positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E  
- A is in 3rd: but HEAVE’s A(-) indicates A is NOT in 3rd. So 3rd can’t be A.

Next pattern: A must be in 2nd, extra E in 1st or 2nd.
But 5th is already E, so word is: _ A _ V E with another E somewhere.

Option: E A _ V E → E A _ V E
Only 5-letter word: EAGER? No, ends VE, not AVE.  
EAVES? S is out.  
EAVEN? N out.  

Another pattern: _ E A V E  
Word: REAVE: R is out  
FEAVE? Not a word  
MEAVE? Not a word  
PEAVE? Not a word  

Valid word: LEAVE – but L is out.  
Next: GLEAVE? Too long  
PEAVE? Not a word  

Real valid word: CEASE? But doesn’t fit _ _ _ V E  
Backtrack: perhaps the extra E is only at 5, and A not at 3, so pattern must be A _ _ V E or _ A _ V E, using letters not ruled out.

Try _ A _ V E:
- C A V E? 4 letters  
- G A V E? 4 letters  
- M A V E? 4 letters  
- D A V E? 4 letters  

5-letter words:
- C A V E R: but ends R  
- G A V E L: ends L (out)  
- M A V E N: ends N (out)  
- S A V E S: S out  

Next possibility: A E _ V E  
Word: A E R V E: R out  
A E G V E: not in dictionary  

Another word: A M E V E: not valid  

The only remaining candidate that meets known constraints is:
M A D V E? Not valid  
Actually valid 5-letter word fitting _ _ _ V E with allowed letters and including A:  
D A U V E? No  
Finally, a recognized word: D A V E Y? Not standard  

Let me list 5-letter words ending in AVE with allowed letters:
- DEAVE (archaic but valid) – but A is 3rd, forbidden by HEAVE feedback  
- CRAVE – R out  
- SLAVE – S, L out  
- GRAVE – R out  
- BRAVE – B, R out  
- LEAVE – L out  
- WEAVE – W, E, A, V, E – W allowed, A is 2nd, which is allowed (no prior – forbidding A in 2nd).  
  Earlier feedback: STARE A(-) at 2nd means A is not in 2nd.  
  So A cannot be 2nd.  
Thus A must be 1st, pattern A _ _ V E.

Only word: A G A V E? Contains A twice? Need only one A  
A C A V E? A twice  
A D A V E? A twice  
A C V E? Not 5 letters  

Real word: A G A V E – plant, valid word  
Letters: A, G, A, V, E – A appears twice.  
But feedback only required “A” to be in the word, not count.  
However, prior feedback never ruled out double A.  

Available letters: G is allowed.  
So AGAVE fits all constraints:
- positions: A(1), G(2), A(3), V(4), E(5)  
- A is in word, not in 2nd (per STARE) – OK, it’s 1st & 3rd  
- V(4), E(5) fixed  
- No banned letters (S,T,R,P,L,N,B,O,H)  

Therefore AGAVE is the only viable candidate left.

<guess>AGAVE</guess>",AGAVE,"Let’s update what we now know.

Letters ruled OUT so far:  
S, T, R, P, L, N, B, O, H

Letters confirmed IN:
- V is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)  
- E is also somewhere else (because HEAVE’s first E got “-”, meaning it’s elsewhere)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from STARE, PLANE, ABOVE, HEAVE feedback)
  ⇒ the only remaining spot for A is position 3 … but ABOVE and HEAVE both had A in 3 and still got “-”, so actually A is NOT in 3 either  
  ⇒ the only remaining spot for A is position 4 … but V is already fixed there.  
  This seems impossible unless I’ve miscounted.

Wait: HEAVE feedback: E(-) means “letter E is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position”.  
The 5th position is already known to be E, so that’s fine; E is indeed elsewhere (namely position 5).  
A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
Combining all earlier A feedback:
- Not in 1 (ABOVE)
- Not in 2 (STARE)
- Not in 3 (HEAVE)
- Not in 4 (ABOVE & HEAVE: 4=V)
- Not in 5 (known to be E)

That leaves NO place for A, which can’t be.  
Interpretation error: the “-” feedback only says the letter is somewhere but not in THAT exact position; it doesn’t forbid other positions.  
So A is allowed in 3rd even if earlier guesses had it there and got “-”.

Re-summarize positions:

Known pattern: _ _ _ V E  
Confirmed letters: V(4), E(5)  
Confirmed letters also somewhere: A, extra E  
So word has two E’s and one A, pattern: _ _ A V E  or  _ A _ V E  or A _ _ V E  
But A cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and from HEAVE we know A is not in 3 either (because A(-) in 3rd slot of HEAVE).  
Therefore A must be in 1 or 2.

Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (plus A, E, V already present).

We need a 5-letter word ending with AVE, with an extra E somewhere among positions 1 or 2, and containing A only in 1 or 2.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,waive,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to guide us, we should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means picking a word with common letters in English 5-letter words to quickly rule in or out many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants like S, T, R, N, L.

Several classic first guesses include: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, or even AUDIO (though AUDIO lacks some consonants). Among these, STARE covers S, T, A, R, E - which are all very common letters. 

Let's go with STARE as our first guess since it's strategically strong.

<guess>STARE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, T, R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (-).
- E is in the word and in the 5th position (✓).

So the mystery word has:
• Letters known so far: A, E (with E fixed at position 5)
• Letters not in the word: S, T, R
• Position constraints: A cannot be 2nd; E is 5th.

We need a new guess that:
- keeps E in the 5th slot
- keeps A somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- avoids S, T, R

Good common consonants left are N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc.

A word that satisfies these rules: PLANE
- P, L, N – none of S,T,R
- A in 3rd place (so not 2nd)
- E in 5th place

Let me check quickly: does PLANE violate anything?
- No S,T,R – good
- A is in the word and not 2nd – good
- E is in 5th – good

So PLANE looks like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PLANE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current facts:
- Letters OUT: S, T, R, P, L, N  
- Letters IN: A (somewhere except 2nd), E (fixed at 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E, contains A but not at 2nd, and uses only the letters that have not been ruled out.

Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Valid vowels: A, E (E already fixed), I, O, U

Constraints:
- Position 5 = E
- A must appear once in positions 1, 3, or 4
- No S, T, R, P, L, N

Candidate words:
- CABE? No, A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAGE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- CAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- FAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- GAME? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- MACE? A is 2nd – forbidden.
- WAKE? A is 2nd – forbidden.

We need A in 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

- ABODE? Has B and D which are still allowed, and A is 1st, E is 5th. Uses O and D – both still possible.
- ADORE? A 1st, D still allowed, O and R – but R is already x’d out. So ADORE is invalid.
- ABOVE? B, V still allowed, A 1st, E 5th. Looks good.

So ABOVE satisfies all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains A in 1st position (allowed)
- Uses only B, V, O, E which haven’t been ruled out
- No forbidden letters (S, T, R, P, L, N)

Therefore, ABOVE is a solid next guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
1. Letters OUT: S, T, R, P, L, N, B, O
2. Letters IN and their positions:
   - V is in position 4
   - E is in position 5
   - A is somewhere but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from ABOVE feedback: A(-) means it's not position 1)
   - So A must be in position 3
3. Therefore, the pattern is: _ _ A V E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Available letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are already placed or ruled out)

Possible combinations:
- First letter: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, W
- Second letter: Same as above, plus I, U (but must be valid 5-letter words)

Looking for common words matching _ _ A V E:
- CAVE: but C and A are allowed, but does it fit? C A V E - but we need 5 letters, so C A V E is only 4
- GAVE: same issue
- HAVEN: but N is out
- MAVEN: M, A, V, E, N - but N is out
- RAVEN: R is out
- WAVES: S is out
- CHAVE: not a word
- FAVOR: O is out
- DAVEN: N is out
- JAVEL: L is out

Let me think of valid 5-letter words ending with AVE:
- GLAVE: Not common
- SLAVE: S and L are out
- CLAVE: C, L - L is out
- CRAVES: too long
- HEAVE: H, E, A, V, E - but A is at 3rd, E at 5th, V at 4th - this fits the pattern _ _ A V E! 
  Positions: H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5)
  Check letters:
  - H: not yet ruled out
  - E: already known to be in position 5, but can appear elsewhere
  - A: must be at 3 - yes
  - V: at 4 - yes
  - E: at 5 - yes

HEAVE uses only letters not yet ruled out (H, E, A, V), and fits the pattern.

Let’s take stock of everything we now know.

Letters OUT so far:  
S, T, R, P, L, N, B, O, H, G

Letters confirmed IN and their positions:
- V is fixed in position 4 (✓)
- E is fixed in position 5 (✓)
- E also appears somewhere else (because HEAVE’s 2nd letter got “-”, meaning another E exists)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?  
  – STARE: A(-) ⇒ not 2nd  
  – PLANE: A(-) ⇒ not 2nd  
  – ABOVE: A(-) ⇒ not 1st  
  – HEAVE: A(-) ⇒ not 3rd  
  – AGAVE: A(-) ⇒ not 1st & 3rd  
  – V is 4th, E is 5th ⇒ A has **no legal place left**, yet feedback says it is in the word.  
  The only way this is possible is if A appears exactly in position **3** and every earlier “A(-)” was simply telling us “not in the spot you just tried.”  
  There is no contradiction: each “-” only removes one specific slot; none of them collectively forbade 3rd.  
  Therefore **A is in 3rd position**.

So the pattern is: _ _ A V E

Extra E: because HEAVE had an extra “E(-)”, we need **two E’s**.  
One E is in 5th; the other must be in 1st or 2nd.

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
C, D, F, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We now need a 5-letter word of the form  
[allowed letter][allowed letter]A V E  
with the first two letters including one additional E.

Possible patterns:
1. E _ A V E  
2. _ E A V E

Valid dictionary words satisfying this:

- E A V E? 4 letters  
- D E A V E? Not a word  
- F E A V E? Not a word  
- C E A V E? Not a word  
- M E A V E? Not a word  
- W E A V E? W is allowed, E is allowed → **WEAVE**  
  Letters: W(allowed), E(allowed), A(allowed), V(✓), E(✓)  
  All constraints met.

Therefore WEAVE is the unique, fully compliant candidate.
