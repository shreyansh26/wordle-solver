For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The word should include letters that are frequently used in English 5-letter words. 

A good strategy is to use words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:

R(x) – R is not in the word at all.  
A(-) – A is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.  
I(x), S(x), E(x) – I, S, and E are not in the word.

So the secret word:
-contains an A, but not at position 2.
-does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

I should pick a new guess that:
1. Keeps testing for the position of A (possible slots 1,3,4,5).
2. Introduces new, high-frequency consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and vowels (O, U).
3. Does not reuse R, I, S, E.

A good candidate is “ADOPT”:
- A is in a different position (1).
- Includes frequent letters D, O, P, T.
- Avoids the excluded letters.

Another candidate is “ADULT”, but L and T are both tried here while still keeping A in a new spot.  
Among these, “ADOPT” feels slightly better because O and P are also common.

I’ll go with ADOPT.

Let's condense the deductions from the three guesses:

Known facts  
1. The word must contain A, O, N, M (each gave “-” at least once, so every one of these letters is somewhere in the word).  
2. None of these four letters may sit in the positions they occupied in earlier guesses:
   - A cannot be in 2 (RAISE) or 1 (ADOPT) or 2 (MANGO).  
   - O cannot be in 3 (ADOPT) or 5 (MANGO).  
   - N cannot be in 3 (MANGO).  
   - M cannot be in 1 (MANGO).  
3. Excluded letters so far: R, I, S, E, D, P, T, G.

Positions we still have free (with constraints)  
1: cannot be A, cannot be M  
2: cannot be A, cannot be O, cannot be N  
3: cannot be O, cannot be N  
4: no restriction yet  
5: cannot be O  

We need a five-letter word that uses exactly the multiset {A, M, N, O} plus one more allowed letter.  
The only other consonants we have not ruled out (from high-frequency English letters) are B, C, F, H, J, K, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick scan of common English words that can be formed from A, M, N, O plus one such consonant, while respecting the positional bans, leads us to:

- A, M, N, O, C → “MACON”  
- A, M, N, O, Y → “MAYON” (not in common dictionaries)  
- A, M, N, O, L → “MANOL” (not common)  
- A, M, N, O, U → “MOUNA” (not common)  
- A, M, N, O, F → “FOMAN” (not common)  

“MACON” is the only common U.S.-English five-letter word from that set, and it satisfies:
- Uses A, M, N, O plus C (all allowed).  
- A is in position 2 – but that was already ruled out by RAISE and MANGO (A cannot be in 2).  
Oops!  MACON puts A in position 2, which is banned.

Next candidate that fits positional constraints:  
“COMAN” – but that’s not a standard English word.

Another valid pattern: put the A in 4 and O in 2, N in 5, M in 3, and the extra letter in 1.  
That would look like: X O M A N  
The only frequent consonant left that forms a word is C:  
“COMAN” (still not standard).

Let’s try A in 3, O in 2, N in 5, M in 4, extra letter in 1:  
X O A M N → “FOAMN” (nope).

Actually a better fit is to place A in 4, O in 1, N in 3, M in 5, and a new consonant in 2:  
O ? A N M – but we need a real five-letter word.

The only practical common word left is “ANOMY” – but Y is sometimes treated as a vowel and is acceptable.  
Positions: A (1) – but A cannot be in 1 (banned by ADOPT).  So that’s out.

Re-checking the valid set, the word “MAYON” isn’t standard, but “MACON” is disallowed by the positional ban on A-2.  
The next dictionary-valid possibility is “MONAL” (a type of bird), but again it’s obscure.

Short-circuit the search: the intersection of the positional constraints plus the mandatory letters {A, M, N, O} essentially leaves only one common English word that fits:  
“MONAL” (but L is allowed and hasn’t been ruled out).  
However, MONAL is obscure.

Another scan: The only other common 5-letter word containing A, M, N, O plus one extra letter, without any letter in its banned position, is “MANGO” – already played.

That suggests I missed an easier combination:  
A in 4, O in 2, N in 1, M in 5, extra consonant in 3:  
N O ? A M – “NOYAM” (not a word).

Let me list every permutation with the letters A, M, N, O plus one extra consonant, checking against positional bans.

Permutation:  
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
A cannot be in 1 or 2.  
O cannot be in 3 or 5.  
N cannot be in 3.  
M cannot be in 1.

Try “ANCON” – contains C, but A is in 1 (banned).  
Try “NOMAD” – D is banned.  
Try “WOMAN” – uses W, and positions:  
1: W (allowed)  
2: O (allowed – only banned from 3, 5)  
3: M (allowed – only banned from 1)  
4: A (allowed – only banned from 1, 2)  
5: N (allowed – only banned from 3)  

“WOMAN” uses exactly the required letters {W, O, M, A, N} and violates no positional bans:
- A is in 4 (OK).  
- O is in 2 (OK).  
- N is in 5 (OK).  
- M is in 3 (OK).  
- W is new and allowed.

Therefore, the best next guess is “WOMAN”.
