For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A good strategy is to include vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it uses the five most common letters in English words. However, I think ""SLATE"" is also excellent - it has S, L, A, T, E which covers common consonants and a vowel. Another strong option is ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, N which are fairly common, plus A and E. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

- Possible positions for N: 1 or 2.
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (but if N is in 1, R could be 1 or 3 or 4, etc.)

Let me think of words ending in E with R and N, avoiding C, A, T, O:
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try placing N in position 1 and R in position 3:
N _ R _ E → NURLE? Not a word.
N _ _ R E → NIGRE? Doesn't exist.
N _ R _ E → NERVE - yes! N E R V E

Check:
- N in position 1 (allowed, wasn't in position 3 or 4)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed - wasn't in positions 2 or 5)
- V is new
- E in position 5 (correct)

Also consider:
R _ N _ E → RINSE - but S and I could work.
But NERVE seems better as it uses N in position 1 and R in position 3, which haven't been ruled out.The feedback tells us:
- E is correct in position 5.
- R and N are in the word, but R is not in positions 2 or 5, and N is not in positions 3 or 4.
- The letters C, A, T, O are not in the word.

A word that fits is NERVE:
- N is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- V is a new letter
- E is already fixed in position 5.

Let's extract the new constraints from the latest feedback (NERVE → N(✓) E(-) R(✓) V(x) E(✓)):

- N is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- R is now confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓) (already known).
- V is not in the word (x).
- The letter E was marked (-) in position 2, but this is consistent with E being in position 5 (the feedback means it's not in position 2).

So the current pattern is: N _ R _ E, where the blanks must not contain any of the letters already ruled out (C, A, T, O, V).

Possible letters for the remaining positions (2 and 4) from the unused alphabet (excluding C, A, T, O, V): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Position 2 can be any of these letters, and position 4 can be any of these letters. We need to find a valid 5-letter word that matches N _ R _ E.

Let me list possible combinations:
- N B R _ E → NBRIE (not a word)
- N B R B E → NBRBE (not a word)
- N D R _ E → NDRIE (not a word)
- N D R D E → NDRDE (not a word)
- N F R _ E → NFRIE (not a word)
- N F R F E → NFRFE (not a word)
- N G R _ E → NGRIE (not a word)
- N G R G E → NGRGE (not a word)
- N H R _ E → NHRIE (not a word)
- N H R H E → NHRHE (not a word)

- N W R W E → NWRWE (not a word)
- N Y R _ E → NYRIE (not a word)
- N Y R Y E → NYRYE (not a word)

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Maybe I need to consider other possibilities where the second and fourth letters are different.

Let me try:
- N _ R _ E with different letters:
  - N I R D E → NIRDE (not a word)
  - N I R K E → NIRKE (not a word)
  - N S R I E → NSRIE (not a word)
  - N D R I E → NDRIE (not a word)

  - N K R I E → NKRIE (not a word)
  - N U R I E → NURIE (not a word)
  - N W R I E → NWRIE (not a word)
  - N Y R I E → NYRIE (not a word)

Still nothing. Let me check if there are any actual English words that fit N _ R _ E. Some possible words:
- NURSE: N U R S E → This fits the pattern N _ R _ E.
  - N is in position 1 (✓)
  - U is allowed (not ruled out)
  - R is in position 3 (✓)
  - S is allowed (not ruled out)
  - E is in position 5 (✓)
  - It doesn't contain any of the forbidden letters (C, A, T, O, V).

""NURSE"" seems to be a valid guess that fits all the constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- N is in position 1.
- R is in position 3.
- E is in position 5.
- Cannot contain C, A, T, O, V.

The word must be N _ R _ E. A valid English word fitting this pattern is ""NURSE"".
