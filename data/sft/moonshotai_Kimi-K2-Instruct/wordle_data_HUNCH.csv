For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to get good coverage. A classic strong opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good feedback about which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

None of the letters A, R, O, S, or E appear in the secret word at all.  
So we can immediately rule out those five very common letters.

To maximize fresh information, I’ll build a word that uses as many of these remaining high-frequency letters as possible.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”.  
It contains U, N, T, I, L — all still in play and all relatively common, giving us five new letters to test in one shot.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:
- Letters **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
- Letters that *are* in the word, but in **wrong positions**: U, N

We still have these common letters unused: C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

Since U and N are in the word but not in positions 1 & 2 respectively, I should try placing them elsewhere. I’ll pick a word that re-uses U and N in new positions while introducing fresh letters that are still possible.

A good candidate is “PUNCH”:
- Contains both U and N in different positions (U in 3, N in 2).
- Uses entirely new letters P, C, H that haven’t been tested.
