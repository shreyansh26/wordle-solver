Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good opening word typically includes frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

However, since we have no previous feedback, any equally common 5-letter word would work. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common letters.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

From Guess 2 (UNITS) we learned:
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must appear in positions 2-5).
- N, I, T are NOT in the word.
- S is confirmed in the 5th position (S is last letter).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S and the word must contain U somewhere in positions 2-4.

Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, N, I, T
Available letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing U in positions 2-4, using only available letters.

Possible structure: [consonant] U [consonant] [consonant] S or [consonant] [consonant] U [consonant] S or [consonant] [consonant] [consonant] U S.

Looking for common words:
- ""DUKES"" – but K and E are allowed? E is eliminated, so no.
- ""PULPS"" – P, U, L, P, S – all allowed.
- ""MUSKS"" – M, U, S, K, S – but double S and S is already last, seems unlikely.
- ""BULKS"" – B, U, L, K, S – all allowed.
- ""LUMPS"" – L, U, M, P, S – all allowed.

Let’s tabulate everything we know from the three guesses.

Known positions (✓):
- 2nd letter = U
- 5th letter = S

Absolute non-letters (x in any position):
A, R, O, E, N, I, T, L, P

Letters still allowed to appear:
B C D F G H J K Q V W X Y Z
plus the already-confirmed U and S.

Letters whose position is still unknown but must appear somewhere:
- M (from LUMPS: M was “-” – in the word but not in 3rd position)

Therefore the word looks like: _ U _ _ S and must contain M somewhere other than position 3.

Possible skeletons:
- M U _ _ S  (M in 1st)
- _ U M _ S  (M in 3rd – forbidden, so discard)
- _ U _ M S  (M in 4th)

So the only viable patterns are:
1. M U _ _ S
2. _ U _ M S

Quick scan of common English 5-letter words fitting these patterns with only allowed letters:

1. M U _ _ S
   - M U C K S  (valid word, letters C, K allowed)
   - M U D S ?    needs another letter; MUD…S but no common word
   - M U F F S (invalid – double F not ruled out, but not common)
   - M U C K S is the most plausible here.

2. _ U _ M S
   - B U M P S – B, U, M, P, S: but P is eliminated.
   - C U M I N S – I is eliminated.
   - G U M M S – double M allowed, but not common.
   - D U M P S – again P is banned.
   - F U M E S – E banned.

Hence the only real candidate that survives all constraints is “MUCKS”.

Let’s verify:
Letters: M, U, C, K, S – none are in the banned list, and positions:
- 1: M (new position, allowed)
- 2: U (✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good opening word typically includes frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

However, since we have no previous feedback, any equally common 5-letter word would work. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- S is present, but not in the last position (since it was the 4th letter in AROSE).
- The remaining letters A, R, O, E are all absent.

Next guess should:
1. Include S in a different position (to seek the ✓).
2. Use entirely new letters (since A,R,O,E are ruled out and S is already used).
3. Use very common consonants/vowels not yet tried, e.g., T, I, N, L, U, D.

A strong candidate is “UNITS”:
- It uses S in a new position (5th).
- It contains U, N, I, T, all of which are frequent and unused so far.
- It has no ruled-out letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) we learned:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

From Guess 2 (UNITS) we learned:
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must appear in positions 2-5).
- N, I, T are NOT in the word.
- S is confirmed in the 5th position (S is last letter).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S and the word must contain U somewhere in positions 2-4.

Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, N, I, T
Available letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing U in positions 2-4, using only available letters.

Possible structure: [consonant] U [consonant] [consonant] S or [consonant] [consonant] U [consonant] S or [consonant] [consonant] [consonant] U S.

Looking for common words:
- ""DUKES"" – but K and E are allowed? E is eliminated, so no.
- ""PULPS"" – P, U, L, P, S – all allowed.
- ""MUSKS"" – M, U, S, K, S – but double S and S is already last, seems unlikely.
- ""BULKS"" – B, U, L, K, S – all allowed.
- ""LUMPS"" – L, U, M, P, S – all allowed.
- ""GULPS"" – G, U, L, P, S – all allowed.

Going with ""LUMPS"" as it uses common remaining letters and fits the pattern.

- M U C H S – valid (slang plural of “muches” or “much”) but more importantly “MUCHS” is actually a rare plural form, yet the common dictionary word is “MUCH” (4 letters) so this seems shaky.
