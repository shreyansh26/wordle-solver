Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Uses no repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, etc. I'll go with a word that has three very common consonants and two common vowels: the word ""STORE"". This gives me:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common)
- O (vowel)
- R (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This should provide good coverage of common letters and help eliminate many possibilities early.

From the feedback:
- S, T, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

That leaves us with only the letter **O** confirmed in the word, and it cannot be in the 3rd position. We need to pick a word that:
- Uses O in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- Avoids S, T, R, E entirely.

Good consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: A, I, U (plus O already known).

A strong next guess would use O in a new slot plus high-frequency remaining letters. Let’s try:
- Put O in the 2nd position.
- Use common consonants like C, L, M, N, P.
- Add another vowel like A or I to diversify.

Candidate: “COBIA” or “PONIC.” Both avoid forbidden letters and place O in a new spot. I’ll pick **COBIA** because it places O in position 2 and uses common remaining letters (C, B, I, A).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters in the English language
2. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Uses no repeated letters to maximize information gain

Popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, etc. I'll go with a word that has three very common consonants and two common vowels: the word ""STORE"". This gives me:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common)
- O (vowel)
- R (very common)
- E (most common letter)

This should provide good coverage of common letters and help eliminate many possibilities early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) R(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, T, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).

That leaves us with only the letter **O** confirmed in the word, and it cannot be in the 3rd position. We need to pick a word that:
- Uses O in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- Avoids S, T, R, E entirely.

Good consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: A, I, U (plus O already known).

A strong next guess would use O in a new slot plus high-frequency remaining letters. Let’s try:
- Put O in the 2nd position.
- Use common consonants like C, L, M, N, P.
- Add another vowel like A or I to diversify.

Candidate: “COBIA” or “PONIC.” Both avoid forbidden letters and place O in a new spot. I’ll pick **COBIA** because it places O in position 2 and uses common remaining letters (C, B, I, A).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we now know:

- Letters not in the word: S, T, R, E, C, B, I, A  
- Letter O is in the word and is in position 2 (because the feedback for COBIA was “O(✓)”).  
  Therefore the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters:  
Consonants: D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: U (only vowel left that hasn’t been eliminated)

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 2.  
2. Use only unused letters.  
3. Use frequent remaining letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters: D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U.

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “FOUND”:
- F, U, N, D have not been eliminated.  
- Keeps O in position 2.  
- All letters are still possible.

Let’s consolidate the clues after four guesses.

Known facts  
1. Pattern: _ O _ L Y  (positions 2, 4, 5 are O, L, Y respectively)  
2. Letter D is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.  
   That leaves only position 1 or 4 for D.  
   However, position 4 is already L, so D **must** be in position 1.  
   ⇒ The word starts with D.

Therefore the hidden word has the exact mask: D O _ L Y

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet minus all letters marked ‘x’ so far):  
H, M, P, V, W, K, J, Q, X, Z.  
We need a single consonant for position 3 that is still unused.

Looking at common English 5-letter words that fit “DO_LY”, the only everyday word is “DOHLY” (rare) and “DOPPLY” (too long).  
The simplest, most common dictionary word fitting D O _ L Y is **DOLLY** (where the third letter is another L).  
Yet we must check: L has not been ruled out for position 3 — it was only confirmed in position 4, and no duplicate-letter restriction is known.  
“DOLLY” uses only still-allowed letters: D, O, L, L, Y.

Hence “DOLLY” satisfies every current constraint.
