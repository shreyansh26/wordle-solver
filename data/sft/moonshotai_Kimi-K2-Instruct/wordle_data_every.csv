For the first guess, we want a word that is likely to provide maximum information - ideally covering common letters in diverse positions. According to frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc. 

A good strategy is to:
1. Include 3-4 vowels (A, E, I, O, U) since vowels appear in most words
2. Include very common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain
4. Choose letters that appear in diverse positions across common words

The word ""AROSE"" meets these criteria well:
- Contains 4 vowels: A, O, E
- Contains the very common consonant S
- All letters are distinct
- Letters A, R, S, O, E are among the top 10 most common in 5-letter words

- A(x) – A is **not** in the word at all.

- S(x) – S is **not** in the word.

2. The letters **A, O, S** are absent.
3. We have only two letters confirmed so far, so we need to test other common letters while avoiding A, O, S.

- Introduce other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U) that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid the eliminated letters A, O, S.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIL"":
- Contains U (a vowel not yet tested), N, T, I, L.
- Places E in a new position (though this word doesn’t have E – let’s revise).

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have very strong constraints:

1. Pattern so far: E _ _ R Y  (positions 1-5 respectively)
   - E is fixed in 1st position.
   - R is fixed in 4th position.
   - Y is fixed in 5th position.

2. Eliminated letters: A, N, O, S, T (from feedback).

3. We still need letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet (except the eliminated ones).

Possible letters left for positions 2 and 3 (common ones):
Vowels: I, U
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We want a common word that fits E _ _ R Y and uses remaining letters.

Candidate stems:
- E B B R Y → “EBBRY” (not a word)
- E M I R Y → “EMIRY” (not a word)
- E L D R Y → “ELDRY” (not a word)
- E M E R Y → “EMERY” (valid 5-letter word meaning abrasive powder)
- E B O R Y → “EBORY” (invalid, O eliminated)
- E D I R Y → “EDIRY” (invalid)

“EMERY” fits: E ✓, M, E (repeats but allowed), R ✓, Y ✓.  
Letters used: E, M, R, Y – none of the eliminated ones.  
Word exists and is common.

Thus, the logical next guess is “EMERY”.

From all feedback so far:

1. Positions that are **locked**:
   - 1st letter: E (✓ in every guess where it appears in 1st place)
   - 4th letter: R (✓ in ENTRY and EMERY)
   - 5th letter: Y (✓ in ENTRY and EMERY)

   So the pattern so far is: E _ _ R Y

2. Eliminated letters (cannot appear anywhere):
   - From AROSE: A, O, S
   - From ENTRY: N, T
   - From EMERY: M

   Eliminated set: {A, M, N, O, S, T}

3. We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining alphabet:
   Vowels available: I, U (E already used)
   Consonants available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

4. We want a common 5-letter word that matches E _ _ R Y.

   Scanning possibilities:
   - E B B R Y → invalid
   - E C C R Y → invalid
   - E L D R Y → invalid
   - E V E R Y → ""EVERY"" (valid)
   - E D G R Y → invalid
   - E L I R Y → invalid
   - E C I R Y → invalid
   - E G G R Y → invalid

   ""EVERY"" fits perfectly: E(✓), V, E(✓), R(✓), Y(✓). The letter V hasn't been tested yet and is not eliminated. The word ""EVERY"" is common and valid.
