For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to help eliminate many possibilities early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these letters as possible to maximize information gained.

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T)

I'll choose ""STARE"" because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (S, T, A, R, E)
2. It has two vowels (A, E) which are often in words
3. The consonants S, T, R are all very common
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback for STARE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E
- Does NOT contain S, T, or R
- A is NOT in position 3
- E is NOT in position 5

Remaining common letters to test: L, N, O, I, C, D, U, Y, F, M, P, etc.

I want a word that uses:
- The known letters A and E (in new positions)
- New, still-common letters to maximize information

A good candidate is ""PANEL"":
- Uses A (position 2, new vs. position 3 before)
- Uses E (position 5, new vs. position 5 before... wait, E is not allowed in position 5 from feedback)
  
Oops - E cannot be in position 5. Let me pick ""PEACH"":
- Uses E (position 2, safe)
- Uses A (position 3... but A was in position 3 before and is wrong - bad)
  
Better: ""BEACH"":
- Uses E (position 2)
- Uses A (position 4 - new position)
- Introduces B, C, H as new letters
- All letters are distinct from excluded S, T, R

But ""BEACH"" has H which is less common. A better choice might be ""MEALY"":
- Uses E (position 2)
- Uses A (position 3 - but A was in position 3 before - bad)
  
Let me try ""LANCE"":

""LEAN"" is only 4 letters - need 5.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. STARE – S, T, R are out; A is in the word but not in position 3; E is in the word but not in position 5.  
2. OCEAN – O, C are out; N and A are in the correct positions (4 and 5 respectively); E is in the word but not in position 3.

So the current word form is: _ _ _ _ A
and we also have:
- N is in position 4
- E is somewhere among positions 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is already N, so 1 or 2)
- A is in position 5
- Letters still unused but not ruled out include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
- Place E in either position 1 or 2
- Use new common letters to test quickly
- Fit the pattern _ _ _ N A

Possible patterns:  
- E _ _ N A  
- _ E _ N A

Good candidates: HENNA (invalid double N), PENNA (same), BEGAN (E in position 2), MEDNA (invalid), FELNA (invalid), etc.

“BEGAN” fits:
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- B, G are new and common
- _ E _ N A pattern matches positions 2, 4, 5 correctly

So I will play BEGAN.
