- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good mix of common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The ideal first word should contain frequently used vowels and consonants without repeating any letters. Some good options include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of the alphabet in just one guess.

Summary from the two guesses:

1. Position 5 is E (✓ both times).
2. A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
3. R, O, S, T, B are NOT in the word at all.
4. L is in the word but is NOT in position 4.

Therefore:
- Word ends with E.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since position 5 is E, A must be in position 3 or 4.
- L must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

_ _ _ A E  (L could be 1, 2, or 3)

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, H, C, M, F, K, W, Y, V, P, etc.

Pick a candidate that fits the pattern and uses fresh common letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

I want to pick a word that uses new common consonants and keeps A somewhere after position 1, ending with E. Good candidates: ""TABLE"", ""CAKE"", ""WAFER"", etc. The word must be 5 letters, end with E, and avoid R, O, S.

We now have the full pattern confirmed:

G L A _ E

with the remaining 4th position letters ruled-out so far: R, O, S, T, B, F, M, P, N, D.

The only common consonant left for position 4 is K, and “GLAKE” is not a valid English word. The only real word that fits is:

CLAVE – but C has not been excluded yet and it fits the pattern C L A V E.

However, V is still allowed and has not been tested yet. Let me check if there are other possible letters. We have used G, L, A, E correctly, so the only remaining spot is position 4. The only remaining common letters are C, K, H, W, Y, V, I, U.

Looking at valid English words: “GLAVE” is archaic, “CLAVE” is valid, and uses C and V which have not been ruled out.

So the correct guess is:

CLAVE
</think>

The pattern is now **G L A _ E**, and the only still-allowed letter for position 4 that forms a standard English word is **K**, giving **GLAKE** (but that is not a valid word). The only valid word left is **CLAVE**, using the still-allowed letters **C** and **V**.
