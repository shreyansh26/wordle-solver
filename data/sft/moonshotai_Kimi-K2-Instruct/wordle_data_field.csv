- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I'll choose a word that uses common letters and covers different positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
This should give us good coverage to deduce letters in the secret word.

Let’s list what we now know from both guesses:

1. Absent letters: A, R, O, S, N  
2. Present letters: I (in position 2), E (somewhere except position 4 or 5), D (in position 5)  
3. Letter L appears but is in the wrong position (so L is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1).

Current partial pattern:
_ I _ _ D

We still need three more letters:
- One of them must be L, but not in slot 1.
- One of them must be E, but not in slot 4 or 5.
- All other letters must come from the unused alphabet (avoiding A,R,O,S,N).

Possible positions for E: slots 1 or 3 (slot 2 is already I, slot 4 and 5 are excluded).  
Possible positions for L: slots 2,3,4 (but slot 2 is I), so slots 3 or 4.

Let me try to place E in slot 3 and L in slot 4:

Pattern so far: _ I E L D → but this would put L in slot 4, which is allowed.
The only missing letter is slot 1.

We need a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common starting consonant that hasn’t been used is T.

Word: T I E L D → but TIELD is not a valid English word.

Next, let’s try E in slot 1 and L in slot 3:

Pattern: E I L _ D → need a consonant for slot 4 that isn’t forbidden.  
Option: E I L M D – but EILMD isn’t a word.

Try slot 4 with a valid letter. The word must be valid.

Instead, let’s use E in slot 3 and L in slot 3 is impossible, so let’s try L in slot 4 again and a different consonant in slot 1.

Consider F: F I E L D → FIELD is a valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints:
- Uses I in slot 2 (✓)
- Uses E in slot 3 (allowed, not 4 or 5) (✓)
- Uses D in slot 5 (✓)
- Uses L in slot 4 (allowed, not slot 1) (✓)
- No forbidden letters (A,R,O,S,N)

This satisfies all constraints.
