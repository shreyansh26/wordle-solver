Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Uses 5 distinct letters
- Is a valid English word

This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on ""AROSE"":
- O is in the correct position (position 3 is correct)
- A, R, S, E are all absent from the word in any position.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters to exclude: A, R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- No A, R, S, E

Good consonants to try next include D, N, T, L, C, M, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left are I, U, Y (since A and E are excluded, and O is fixed in place).

Possible patterns: C, D, N, T, etc. in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

A strong second guess candidate is ""DONUT"":
- O is in position 3 (matches feedback)
- Uses N, T, U (all not excluded)
- Uses D (not excluded)
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, S, E)
- Common word with distinct letters

Another good choice could be ""POINT"" but it contains I and N, T which are good letters.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. From AROSE:
   – O is in the correct spot (position 3).  
   – A, R, S, E are NOT in the word anywhere.

2. From DONUT:
   – D, U, T are NOT in the word.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know from AROSE that it **is** in position 3).  
     That means the feedback for DONUT is telling us something about the repeated O in position 3: the marker “-” only implies “elsewhere” **when the letter appears elsewhere**.  
     Since O already appears exactly once in position 3, this feedback is a bit ambiguous, but we can safely treat it as re-affirming that O is **only** in position 3.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the confirmed facts are:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _  
- Exclude: A, R, S, E, D, U, T  
- N must be somewhere other than position 4.

Possible remaining high-frequency consonants we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Vowels left: I, Y.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.  
- Uses N (which we now know is in the word).  
- Avoids all excluded letters.  
- Tries fresh, common consonants.

A good candidate is “HONEY”:
   – H, N, Y are new high-frequency letters.  
   – N is in position 2, satisfying “not in position 4”.  
   – No forbidden letters appear.

Alternative quick checks:  
- “MONEY” would also work, but MONEY uses M and N (both allowed).  
- “HONEY” seems slightly more balanced.

Let’s tabulate what we now know for certain.

1. Forbidden letters (never appear anywhere):  
   A, R, S, E, D, U, T, H, Y

2. About O:  
   – From AROSE: O is in the **correct** position 3.  
   – From DONUT & HONEY: the “-” on O only means the **other** O’s in those words are not correct, which is compatible with O being fixed at position 3.  
   Therefore: pattern is _ _ O _ _

3. About N:  
   – From both DONUT and HONEY we received “N(-)”, so N is **in the word**, but NOT in position 4 (DONUT) and NOT in position 3 (HONEY).  
   Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 5.

4. We still need two more letters, chosen only from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding every forbidden letter above.

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (only)

We must fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with: N plus three other allowed letters while ensuring N is in 1, 2, or 5.

A good next candidate should:
- Put N in one of the three allowed positions.  
- Use fresh, common remaining letters.  
- Not reuse any forbidden letter.

Possible word skeletons:
- N _ O _ _  (N in pos 1)  
- _ N O _ _  (N in pos 2)  
- _ _ O _ N  (N in pos 5)

Let’s test “BLOCK” – but K is allowed and L, O, C, K are all allowed?  
No, C is allowed, L is allowed, O is fixed, K is allowed, B is allowed.  
But we need 5 letters.  
Wait, let’s list valid letters again: B, C, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Z.

Pick:
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: N (allowed here)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: I (only remaining vowel)  
- Position 5: K  

Forms the word “B N O I K” → “BONIK” – but that’s not an English word.  
Try “B N O M B” – uses B twice, not allowed.  
Instead: “C L O C K” – uses C twice. Not allowed.  
Try “P I N O L” – but N must be in 1,2,5 and I must fit.

A valid English word is “PINKO” but that ends in O, conflicting with fixed O in pos 3.

Re-evaluate:  
We want a standard word.

Let’s try N in position 5:  
_ _ O _ N  
Possible common word: “C L O C K” – again C twice.  
“F L O C K” – F, L, O, C, K – all allowed, ends with K not N.  
“B L O C K” – same issue.

Try N in position 2:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- Uses 5 distinct letters
- Is a valid English word

This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""AROSE"":
- O is in the correct position (position 3 is correct)
- A, R, S, E are all absent from the word in any position.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters to exclude: A, R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- No A, R, S, E

Good consonants to try next include D, N, T, L, C, M, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left are I, U, Y (since A and E are excluded, and O is fixed in place).

Possible patterns: C, D, N, T, etc. in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

A strong second guess candidate is ""DONUT"":
- O is in position 3 (matches feedback)
- Uses N, T, U (all not excluded)
- Uses D (not excluded)
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, S, E)
- Common word with distinct letters

Another good choice could be ""POINT"" but it contains I and N, T which are good letters.
Let's try ""DONUT"" as it seems very promising.

<guess>DONUT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DONUT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two previous guesses we know:

1. From AROSE:
   – O is in the correct spot (position 3).  
   – A, R, S, E are NOT in the word anywhere.

2. From DONUT:
   – D, U, T are NOT in the word.  
   – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know from AROSE that it **is** in position 3).  
     That means the feedback for DONUT is telling us something about the repeated O in position 3: the marker “-” only implies “elsewhere” **when the letter appears elsewhere**.  
     Since O already appears exactly once in position 3, this feedback is a bit ambiguous, but we can safely treat it as re-affirming that O is **only** in position 3.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the confirmed facts are:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _  
- Exclude: A, R, S, E, D, U, T  
- N must be somewhere other than position 4.

Possible remaining high-frequency consonants we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Vowels left: I, Y.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.  
- Uses N (which we now know is in the word).  
- Avoids all excluded letters.  
- Tries fresh, common consonants.

A good candidate is “HONEY”:
   – H, N, Y are new high-frequency letters.  
   – N is in position 2, satisfying “not in position 4”.  
   – No forbidden letters appear.

Alternative quick checks:  
- “MONEY” would also work, but MONEY uses M and N (both allowed).  
- “HONEY” seems slightly more balanced.

Hence, my next guess:

We still need two more letters, chosen only from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding every forbidden letter above.\n\nRemaining consonants: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z  \nRemaining vowels: I (only)\n\nWe must fill positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with: N plus three other allowed letters while ensuring N is in 1, 2, or 5.\n\nA good next candidate should:\n- Put N in one of the three allowed positions.  \n- Use fresh, common remaining letters.  \n- Not reuse any forbidden letter.\n\nPossible word skeletons:\n- N _ O _ _  (N in pos 1)  \n- _ N O _ _  (N in pos 2)  \n- _ _ O _ N  (N in pos 5)\n\nLet’s test “BLOCK” – but K is allowed and L, O, C, K are all allowed?  \nNo, C is allowed, L is allowed, O is fixed, K is allowed, B is allowed.  \nBut we need 5 letters.  \nWait, let’s list valid letters again: B, C, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Z.\n\nPick:\n- Position 1: B  \n- Position 2: N (allowed here)  \n- Position 3: O (fixed)  \n- Position 4: I (only remaining vowel)  \n- Position 5: K  \n\nForms the word “B N O I K” → “BONIK” – but that’s not an English word.  \nTry “B N O M B” – uses B twice, not allowed.  \nInstead: “C L O C K” – uses C twice. Not allowed.  \nTry “P I N O L” – but N must be in 1,2,5 and I must fit.\n\nA valid English word is “PINKO” but that ends in O, conflicting with fixed O in pos 3.\n\nRe-evaluate:  \nWe want a standard word.\n\nLet’s try N in position 5:  \n_ _ O _ N  \nPossible common word: “C L O C K” – again C twice.  \n“F L O C K” – F, L, O, C, K – all allowed, ends with K not N.  \n“B L O C K” – same issue.\n\nTry N in position 2:  \n_ N O _ _  \nCommon word: “B N O …” – nothing.  \n“P N O …” – no.  \n“V N O …” – no.\n\nTry N in position 1:  \nN _ O _ _  \nWith allowed letters: N, B, I, G, K → “N B O I K” – not a word.\n\nRealize we missed “CLOWN” but W and N are allowed.  \nCheck: C, L, O, W, N – all allowed, pattern _ _ O _ N.  \nYes! C, L, O, W, N are all from the allowed set, N is in position 5, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the next good guess is:\n\nC L O W N → “CLOWN”\n\n<guess>CLOWN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: DONUT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) N(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: HONEY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(-) N(-) E(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: CLOWN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s extract every hard fact from all feedback:

1. Forbidden letters (never appear):  
   A, R, S, E, D, U, T, H, Y, C → 10 letters gone.

2. Positional certainties from CLOWN:  
   L(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)  
   This means the secret word is exactly:
        _  L  O  W  N

3. The only missing letter is the first one.  
   It must be a single letter from the still-allowed set:  
   B, F, G, I, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z  (plus the vowel I).

4. We need a common English word that fits:
   X L O W N  – no such word  
   Q L O W N  – no  
   F L O W N  – invalid (only 4 letters)  
   G L O W N  – invalid  
   B L O W N – not a 5-letter word meaning anything relevant  
   M L O W N – no  
   P L O W N – no  
   V L O W N – no  
   K L O W N – no  
   Only I among vowels remains.

5. “I” is allowed and forms the legitimate 5-letter English word:
   I L O W N

Check:  
Letters: I, L, O, W, N – none are forbidden, and it matches the positional locks.

Thus the unique remaining possibility is “ILOWN”, but that isn’t a standard spelling.  
Wait – the correct spelling is “I L O W N” but that’s not an English word.

Realisation: I mis-read “BLOWN” – “BLOWN” is 5 letters and perfectly valid and its first letter B is still allowed.  
Let me re-check:

Allowed first letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, V  
Common English words ending in “LOWN”:
- BLOWN  (past participle of blow)  
- FLOWN  (past participle of fly)  
- GLOWN  (archaic past of glow, but still dictionary)  
- CLOWN already tried and C is banned  
- SLOWN – S is banned  
- PLOWN – variant spelling of ploughed, valid

So legitimate candidates are BLOWN, FLOWN, GLOWN, PLOWN.  
Among these, the most common everyday word is BLOWN.

Therefore the next and (given the positional locks) final logical guess is:

B L O W N
