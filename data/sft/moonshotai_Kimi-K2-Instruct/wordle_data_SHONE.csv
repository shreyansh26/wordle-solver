### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage to quickly narrow down possibilities regardless of what the actual word is.

From Guess 1 (SLATE) we know:
- S is correct in the first position (✓).
- E is correct in the last position (✓).
- L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).

So our target word has the form: S _ _ _ E with no L, A, or T.

We need 3 more letters that:
1. Are not L, A, or T.
2. Fit in positions 2, 3, and 4.

Common remaining consonants and vowels: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, K, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “SHINE”:
- S (✓) and E (✓) already match.
- H, I, N are not excluded.
This tests H, I, N in positions 2, 3, 4.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 1: S (confirmed)
- Position 2: H (confirmed)  
- Position 3: I is not in the word (from SHINE feedback: I(x))
- Position 4: N (confirmed)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)

So the target word must be of the exact form: S H _ N E, and the missing letter (position 3) cannot be I (and we already know from earlier that it also cannot be L, A, or T).

The remaining candidates for the third letter are all other letters except S, H, I, N, E, L, A, T.

Let’s list some possibilities: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common letters that appear in position 3 of 5-letter words are C, D, G, K, M, O, P, R, etc.

A common and valid 5-letter word that fits S H _ N E is SHONE (meaning past tense of shine).

It uses O for the third letter, which is unexcluded.

So let’s guess SHONE.
