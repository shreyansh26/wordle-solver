For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Current constraints after two guesses:

1. Word ends with E.
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I.
3. Letters definitely IN the word: U, N, E.
   - U is in the word and NOT in position 1 (because in UNTIE it was marked ✓, meaning correct letter but not necessarily correct position; however, since UNTIE had U as the first letter and it was marked ✓, it means U is in the word but is NOT in the first position. Wait, no—actually, the feedback symbols are:
     - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
     - - : the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
     - x : the letter is not in the word.
   Re-reading the rules and the feedback:
   - UNTIE feedback: U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
   This means:
   - U is in the word and is in the correct position (position 1).
   - N is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
   - T is not in the word.
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word has the form: U N _ _ E, and the missing letters (positions 3 and 4) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, T, I.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: none (A, O, I are out; E and U are already used).

So positions 3 and 4 must be consonants, and the word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with UN and ending with E.

Let me think of such words:
- UNCLE: U N C L E – fits the pattern. C and L have not been tested yet.
- UNDUE: but D and U are already used (U is in position 1), and E is in position 5, but this would repeat U which is allowed, but UNDUE has U as the third letter which is not ruled out, but we have no info on D. However, UNDUE is a valid word.
- UNITE: but I is ruled out, so no.
- UNION: but O is ruled out and it ends with N, not E.
- UNSEE: but S is ruled out, so no.
- UNMET: ends with T which is ruled out.
- UNPEG: ends with G, not E.

- The best candidate is UNCLE, as it fits U N _ _ E and uses two new letters C and L.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,undue,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback recap:  
A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(x) – R is not in the word.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in the final position.  

Therefore, the secret word ends in E and does **not** contain A, R, O, or S.  
Letters still worth testing: the remaining vowels I, U, and common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Aiming to test several new letters quickly while respecting the fixed E in position 5, a good second guess is “UNTIE”.  
- It keeps the confirmed E in the last spot.  
- It introduces five fresh letters (U, N, T, I) that have not been ruled out.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current constraints after two guesses:

1. Word ends with E.
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I.
3. Letters definitely IN the word: U, N, E.
   - U is in the word and NOT in position 1 (because in UNTIE it was marked ✓, meaning correct letter but not necessarily correct position; however, since UNTIE had U as the first letter and it was marked ✓, it means U is in the word but is NOT in the first position. Wait, no—actually, the feedback symbols are:
     - ✓ : the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
     - - : the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
     - x : the letter is not in the word.
   Re-reading the rules and the feedback:
   - UNTIE feedback: U(✓) N(✓) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
   This means:
   - U is in the word and is in the correct position (position 1).
   - N is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
   - T is not in the word.
   - I is not in the word.
   - E is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word has the form: U N _ _ E, and the missing letters (positions 3 and 4) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, O, S, T, I.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: none (A, O, I are out; E and U are already used).

So positions 3 and 4 must be consonants, and the word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with UN and ending with E.

Let me think of such words:
- UNCLE: U N C L E – fits the pattern. C and L have not been tested yet.
- UNDUE: but D and U are already used (U is in position 1), and E is in position 5, but this would repeat U which is allowed, but UNDUE has U as the third letter which is not ruled out, but we have no info on D. However, UNDUE is a valid word.
- UNITE: but I is ruled out, so no.
- UNION: but O is ruled out and it ends with N, not E.
- UNSEE: but S is ruled out, so no.
- UNMET: ends with T which is ruled out.
- UNPEG: ends with G, not E.
- UNKEPT: too long.
- The best candidate is UNCLE, as it fits U N _ _ E and uses two new letters C and L.
