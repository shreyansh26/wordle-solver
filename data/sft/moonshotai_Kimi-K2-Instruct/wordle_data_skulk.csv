For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that includes common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L) to test their presence
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain

One of the most popular and mathematically optimal starting words is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequently used in English words
- This maximizes the chance of getting matches or partial matches

Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback tells us:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the 4th position, since that’s where it was last time)
2. Avoids A, R, O, E
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, U, D, H, C, M, etc.

A word like “SPLIT” would be good because:

- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses common consonants P, L, T
- Uses vowel I (which wasn’t tested yet)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that includes common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L) to test their presence
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain

One of the most popular and mathematically optimal starting words is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequently used in English words
- This maximizes the chance of getting matches or partial matches

Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback tells us:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the 4th position, since that’s where it was last time)
2. Avoids A, R, O, E
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, U, D, H, C, M, etc.

A word like “SPLIT” would be good because:
- It uses S (not in the 4th position)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses common consonants P, L, T
- Uses vowel I (which wasn’t tested yet)

Let’s go with SPLIT.

Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SPLIT:

S(✓) – S is in the word and now in the correct first position.
P(x) – P is not in the word.
L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must go elsewhere: 2, 4, or 5).
I(x) – I is not in the word.
T(x) – T is not in the word.

So we now know:

- The word starts with S.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, T (plus any others we didn’t test yet but can avoid for now).
- L is in the word but not in position 3.

Remaining common letters we haven’t ruled out and might use: C, D, G, H, K, M, N, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing L (but not in position 3), and avoiding the letters we’ve ruled out.

Possible candidates: SULKY, SLUNG, SLUNK, SCALY, SCULY (but not all are valid), etc.

“SLUNG” seems like a good guess:
- Starts with S (✓).
- Contains L (not in position 3 – here it’s in position 2).
- Uses U, N, G – all untested so far.
- Avoids all letters we’ve ruled out.

- Contains L, but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 4 or 5.
- Contains K, but not in position 4 → must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, E, P, I, T, N, G, Y.

Possible structure:
S _ _ _ _
U must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be in 2).
L must be in positions 4 or 5.
K must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try placing L in position 4 and K in position 2:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,skulk,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that includes common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L) to test their presence
3. Avoid letters that are less common (like Q, X, Z) to maximize information gain

One of the most popular and mathematically optimal starting words is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, O, E)
- It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequently used in English words
- This maximizes the chance of getting matches or partial matches

Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced in terms of vowel/consonant distribution. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (AROSE) the feedback tells us:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the 4th position, since that’s where it was last time)
2. Avoids A, R, O, E
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information

Common remaining letters: T, N, L, I, U, D, H, C, M, etc.

A word like “SPLIT” would be good because:
- It uses S (not in the 4th position)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses common consonants P, L, T
- Uses vowel I (which wasn’t tested yet)

Let’s go with SPLIT.

<guess>SPLIT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on SPLIT:

S(✓) – S is in the word and now in the correct first position.
P(x) – P is not in the word.
L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must go elsewhere: 2, 4, or 5).
I(x) – I is not in the word.
T(x) – T is not in the word.

So we now know:

- The word starts with S.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, P, I, T (plus any others we didn’t test yet but can avoid for now).
- L is in the word but not in position 3.

Remaining common letters we haven’t ruled out and might use: C, D, G, H, K, M, N, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing L (but not in position 3), and avoiding the letters we’ve ruled out.

Possible candidates: SULKY, SLUNG, SLUNK, SCALY, SCULY (but not all are valid), etc.

“SLUNG” seems like a good guess:
- Starts with S (✓).
- Contains L (not in position 3 – here it’s in position 2).
- Uses U, N, G – all untested so far.
- Avoids all letters we’ve ruled out.

Let’s go with SLUNG.

<guess>SLUNG</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: SLUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) U(✓) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:

- Word structure: S _ _ _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (position 1), U (somewhere in positions 2–5)
- Letters in word but misplaced: L (cannot be in position 2 or 3)
- Letters excluded: A, R, O, E, P, I, T, N, G

So far we have:
S _ _ _ _
U must appear somewhere
L must appear somewhere but not at positions 2 or 3
Remaining allowed letters from the alphabet: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z plus the repeat letters we haven't used.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing both U and L, with L not in positions 2 or 3.

Possible positions:
- L could be in position 4 or 5
- U could be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not conflicting with L)

After scanning common words, “SCULY” isn’t valid, “SHULY” isn’t common, but “SULKY” is a valid word and fits:
- S (position 1) ✓
- U (position 2) ✓
- L (position 3) ✗ – but wait, this conflicts with L(-) from SLUNG where L was in position 2 and failed, meaning L cannot be in position 2 but doesn’t rule out position 3 (from SLUNG feedback, L was in position 2 and failed, but in SLUNG L was in position 2, so we only know L is not in position 2). Actually re-reading the feedback for SLUNG: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2. So L is allowed in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Wait let's re-examine the SLUNG feedback:
SLUNG -> S(✓) L(-) U(✓) N(x) G(x)
- L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2
- So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5

Therefore, L can be in position 3 (contrary to my initial thought). My earlier misinterpretation was incorrect - the (-) only tells us it's not in the current position (position 2 in SLUNG), but doesn't restrict other positions.

So possible structures:
S U L _ _
S U _ L _
S U _ _ L
S _ U L _
S _ _ U L
etc.

Looking for valid words:
- SULKY: S U L K Y – contains U, L (position 3), and K, Y which are untested
- SULKY is valid and uses new letters (K, Y)

This seems like a good next guess to test positions for L and U and introduce new letters.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let me carefully re-examine the feedback so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
- S is somewhere in the word (but not in position 1 at that time).

Guess 2: SPLIT → S(✓) P(x) L(-) I(x) T(x)  
- S is confirmed in position 1.  
- L is in the word, but not in position 3.

Guess 3: SLUNG → S(✓) L(-) U(✓) N(x) G(x)  
- S is confirmed in position 1.  
- L is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- U is in the word, but its position is not yet confirmed.

Guess 4: SULKY → S(✓) U(-) L(-) K(-) Y(x)  
- S is confirmed in position 1.  
- U is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- L is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.  
- K is in the word, but not in position 4.  
- Y is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Word starts with S (position 1).
- Contains U, but not in position 2.
- Contains L, but not in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 4 or 5.
- Contains K, but not in position 4 → must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, E, P, I, T, N, G, Y.

Possible structure:
S _ _ _ _
U must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it cannot be in 2).
L must be in positions 4 or 5.
K must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try placing L in position 4 and K in position 2:
- S K _ L _
Then U must fit into position 3 or 5. If U goes into position 3:
- S K U L _

However, the feedback also shows:

- The last letter is **not** L (L(-)).
