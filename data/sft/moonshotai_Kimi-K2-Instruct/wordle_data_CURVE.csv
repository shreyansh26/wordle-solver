For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that tests common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to pick a word that includes common vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes the common vowels A and E, and the consonants S, L, T which are frequently used in English words. This should help narrow down possible letters and their positions efficiently.

From the feedback:
- The only letter that is in the word is E, and it is in the 5th position.
- All other tested letters (S, L, A, T) are NOT in the word.

So the word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

Next I should pick a word that:
1. Keeps E in the 5th spot.
2. Introduces new common consonants (avoiding S, L, T) and vowels (avoiding A).
3. Common remaining consonants to test: N, R, C, B, D, M, P, H, G, etc.
4. Remaining vowels to test: I, O, U.

I’ll try a word that uses several of these remaining common letters, especially those that can combine well with E at the end. ""CHORE"" is a good choice because it tests C, H, O, R, E and keeps E in the 5th position.

4. The letters S, L, A, T, H, O are all absent.

Possible candidates:
- CRIME – uses C, R, I, M, E – R in position 2.  All letters allowed and not yet eliminated.
- CURVE – but U is untested and R in position 3, and V is untested.
- CREPE – but P is untested and E repeats, which could be allowed but gives less new info.
- CRIED – D is untested and I is untested.

The word CRIME seems best because it puts R in position 2 (allowed), introduces new common consonants M and vowel I, and fits all constraints.
