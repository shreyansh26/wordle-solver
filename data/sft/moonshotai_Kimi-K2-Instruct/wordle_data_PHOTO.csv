For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters that can give maximum information.

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that combines several of these.

The word ""AROSE"" is excellent for a first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) - helping identify vowels quickly
2. It contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x): S is not in the word.

- It definitely does **not** contain A, R, S, or E.

2. Does not contain A, R, S, or E.

I’ll try to pick another word with common letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, M, C, B, F, G, H, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y.

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P: new consonant
- O: matches the known 3rd letter ✓
- I: new vowel
- N: common consonant
- T: common consonant
- Does not contain A, R, S, or E.

Another candidate could be ""CLOUD"", but L is less common than N/T. ""POINT"" seems better.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
– O is in the word and correctly in the 3rd position.

Guess 2: POINT → P(✓) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)  
– P is in the word but NOT in the 1st position.  
– O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (contradiction with Guess 1).  
But Guess 1 already told us O is in the 3rd position, so “-” is impossible there.  
Therefore, the feedback must mean the letters’ relation to the actual secret word, not their positions in the guess. Re-reading the rules:  
✓ = correct letter and correct position  
-  = correct letter but wrong position  
x  = letter not in the word

Reconcile:

Guess 1: AROSE  
– A(x) R(x) S(x) E(x) → those four letters are absent.  
– O(✓) → letter O is present and is in position 3.

Guess 2: POINT  
– P(✓) → P is present and is in position 1.  
– O(-) → O is present but NOT in position 3 (but this conflicts with Guess 1’s O(✓) at position 3).  
This is impossible unless there is an error in interpretation.

Wait: the feedback on POINT must be read letter-by-letter against the secret word’s letters in the same positions:

P(✓) → 1st letter of secret word is P.  
O(-) → 2nd letter of secret word has O but not in 2nd position.  
I(x) → 3rd letter is NOT I.  
N(x) → 4th letter is NOT N.  
T(-) → 5th letter has T but not in 5th position.

Combining with Guess 1:
- O(✓) at position 3 in AROSE implies the 3rd letter of the secret word is O.

So now we have:
- Position 1: P  
- Position 3: O  
- The secret word contains T somewhere other than the 5th position.  
- Secret word does NOT contain A, R, S, E, I, N.

Remaining letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus possibly others.

We need a 5-letter word:
P _ O _ _
with T somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5), and no banned letters.

Possible patterns:
- P T O _ _
