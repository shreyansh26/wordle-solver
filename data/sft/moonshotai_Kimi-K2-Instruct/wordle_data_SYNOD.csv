For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting some hits or near-hits. This is a common strategy in Wordle-like games. A good starting word typically contains:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, N, L)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

Some popular high-information starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong mix of common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) without repeating letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter N, but N is NOT in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
- We still have no placement for N, and we have four positions left to explore.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Uses N in a different position (not 4).
2. Avoids the eliminated letters C, R, A, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

- B and L are common consonants not yet tested.
- O is a new vowel (since A and E are out).
- N is placed in position 3 this time.

From all the feedback so far:

1. CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   – Eliminates C, R, A, E entirely.
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. BLOND: B(x) L(x) O(-) N(-) D(✓)
   – Eliminates B and L.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.
   – N is in the word but not in position 4 (confirms earlier).
   – D is in position 5 exactly.

So we now know:
- Word ends with D (position 5).
- Contains N and O, but:
  – N can’t be in position 4.
  – O can’t be in position 3.
- Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, E, B, L.

Available letters: all others except the six above.
Good next step: pick a word that:
  – Has D in position 5 (fixed).
  – Uses N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5—but 5 is D, so 1, 2, or 3).
  – Uses O somewhere except position 3.
  – Brings in new common consonants/vowels.

Candidate words:
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D – O in position 2, N in 4 (forbidden) – N can’t be in 4, so eliminate.
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D – N in 4 again – eliminate.
- MOUND: same problem.
- POUND: same problem.
- HOUND: same problem.
- SOUND: same problem.
- MINDS: ends with S, not D – eliminate.
- WINDY: ends with Y – eliminate.
- SANDY: ends with Y – eliminate.
- DONGS: ends with S – eliminate.
- SONGS: ends with S – eliminate.

Shift N earlier:
- NODDY: D in 5, N in 1, O in 2 – satisfies constraints (D in 5, N not in 4, O not in 3).
  – Uses two D’s, but we only know one D is required; still valid because the game allows repeated letters unless feedback says otherwise.
  – Introduces Y, a common ending letter.

Check simpler: N, O, D constraints. NODDY fits nicely.

Hence NODDY seems like the best next guess under current constraints.

- NODDY: D in 5, N in 1, O in 2 – satisfies constraints (D in 5, N not in 4, O not in 3).
  – Uses two D’s, but we only know one D is required; still valid because the game allows repeated letters unless feedback says otherwise.
  – Introduces Y, a common ending letter.

Check simpler: N, O, D constraints. NODDY fits nicely.

Hence NODDY seems like the best next guess under current constraints.

Let's carefully update what we now know after the third guess.

Previous eliminations:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, B, L.

From Guess 2 (BLOND) we had: O(-) and N(-), meaning O and N are in the word but NOT in positions 3 and 4 respectively, and D(✓) in position 5.

From Guess 3 (NODDY) we have:
- N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D(-) for BOTH D's → D is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (we already knew D is in position 5, so these two D's are extra and not part of the target word).
- Y(-) → Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So updated constraints:
1. Word ends with D (position 5).
2. Contains N, O, and Y.
3. N cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
4. O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
5. Y cannot be in position 5 (but position 5 is D, so Y must be in positions 1-4).

Possible positions for N, O, Y with D fixed at 5:
- N can be in 2, 3, or 5. But 5 is D, so 2 or 3.
- O can be in 1, 4, or 5. 5 is D, so 1 or 4.
- Y can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Also, we have not yet tested letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z. Among these, common letters are F, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, T, U, W.

Let's find a word that:
- Ends with D.
- Uses N, O, Y exactly once each (since duplicate D's were rejected).
- Meets all positional constraints.

Possible candidates:
- Y in 1, O in 4, N in 2 or 3:
  - Y _ N _ D → Y O N _ D? But O cannot be in 2 or 3, so this doesn't work.
  - Y _ _ N D → Y _ _ N D: O must be in 1 or 4. 1 is Y, 4 is N (invalid), so no.
- Y in 2:
  - _ Y _ _ D: O and N must fit in 1,3,4 with constraints.
    - O cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 4.
    - N cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2 or 3. 2 is Y, so 3.
    So: O or 1 or 4, N in 3.
    Possible: O Y N _ D → but O cannot be in 2 (it's in 1), N in 3, _ in 4.
    So: O Y N _ D → need letter for 4, not yet tested common ones.
    Try O Y N _ D → ""OYNSD"" – not a word.
    ""OYNGD"" – not valid.
    Maybe ""HYMNS"" – ends with S, not D.
    Re-evaluate.

Better systematic approach: list valid positions:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed: _ _ _ _ D

Letters to place: N, O, Y plus one more (since 5 letters total and we have 3 known letters).

Possible arrangements:
- O in 1, then N and Y in 2,3,4 with N not in 4.
  - O N Y _ D: N in 2, Y in 3, _ in 4. Need a letter for 4.
    Common letters untested: S, T, etc.
    ""ONYSD"" – invalid.
    ""ONYMD"" – not a word.
    ""ONK Y D"" – not valid.
  
- O in 4, then N and Y in 1,2,3 with N not in 1 or 4.
  - N cannot be in 1 or 4, so N in 2 or 3.
  - O in 4.
  - Y can be in 1,2,3.
  - Need one more letter (since N, O, Y, D account for 4 letters).
  
Let's try:
- N in 2, Y in 1 or 3, O in 4:
  - Y N O _ D: but O is in 4 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), Y in 1 (allowed). Need a letter for 3.
    ""YNO_D"": need valid word. ""YNOLD"" – no.
    ""YNOTD"" – no.
  
- N in 3, Y in 1 or 2, O in 4:
  - Y _ N O D:
    ""Y _ N O D"": need valid word.
    ""YUNOD"" – no.
    ""YPNOD"" – no.
    ""YSNOD"" – no.
  
  - _ Y N O D:
    ""H Y N O D"" – ""HYNOD"" – not a word.
    ""S Y N O D"" – ""SYNOD"" – valid word!

Check ""SYNOD"":
- S, Y, N, O, D.
- Ends with D.
- N in 3 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- O in 4 (allowed, not 2 or 3).
- Y in 2 (allowed).
- Uses S, which hasn't been tested yet.

So ""SYNOD"" fits all constraints.
