- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.
3. Uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (like A, E) and consonants (like T, R, S, L, N). One such word is ""STARE"" - it contains:
- S, T, R (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeating letters
This should give us good coverage to interpret the feedback.
