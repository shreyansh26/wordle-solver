Since this is the first guess, I don't have any previous feedback to consider. The goal is to pick a word that can help maximize information about the secret word. A good first guess should use common letters and ideally cover a variety of vowels and consonants. 

Some common first guesses include words like:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:
1. It includes frequently occurring letters (S, T, E)
2. It has both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T)
3. It avoids repeating any letters, maximizing coverage

3. Avoid all ruled-out letters.

Good possibilities:

  - Word contains T (but not in 4th pos)  
  - Word does NOT contain L, A, E

Guess 2: TRUST → T(-)  R(x)  U(x)  S(✓)  T(✓)
  - T is NOT in 1st position (confirms it can be in 2-5, but we already knew 4th was excluded)  
  - S is in 5th position (✓)  
  - Word does NOT contain R, U

Current known facts:
- Letter set so far: {S, T}
- S is in 5th position  
- T must be in 2nd or 3rd position (cannot be 1st or 4th)  
- Letters definitely absent: L, A, E, R, U

Next guess should:
1. Place S at 5 and T at 2 or 3.
2. Use common remaining consonants (N, D, H, M, G, C, etc.) and common vowels (I, O).
3. Avoid all ruled-out letters.

Candidate forms:
  _ T _ _ S   or   _ _ T _ S

Good possibilities:
- STINT (T at 2, but I is allowed; checks: no banned letters)  
- STOIC (T at 3, O and I allowed; but O and C are fine)  
- STINT seems slightly better because it reuses T in 2nd, which is allowed.

STINT contains S, T, I, N – all still possible. No banned letters appear. T in 2nd, S in 5th – both fit constraints.

Therefore, choose STINT.

Let's consolidate every constraint:

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (must be in position 5, confirmed by TRUST)
- T (must appear exactly once, and not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4; therefore T must be in position 5 … but S is already in position 5)

This is a contradiction: two different letters cannot both occupy the 5th position. The only logical resolution is that T does NOT appear elsewhere in the word (feedback for TRUST said T(✓) in position 5), meaning the word has only one T (at 5) and the earlier “T(-)” in TRUST’s 1st position merely confirmed T is elsewhere (position 5).  
So the actual constraints are:

1. S is in position 5.  
2. T is in position 5 (but that conflicts with S).  
Wait — the feedback symbols are per-guess, not cumulative.  
Re-reading:  
TRUST feedback: T(-) R(x) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)  
The first T of TRUST got “-” (letter in word but wrong position), while the last T of TRUST got “✓” (correct position).  
Therefore, the word has two T’s: one in position 5 (from TRUST) and one more T somewhere else.  
But position 5 already has S (✓), so position 5 cannot be T. This implies my earlier conclusion was wrong.

Let’s re-parse carefully:

- TRUST positions:  
  1: T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 1  
  2: R(x) → R not in word  
  3: U(x) → U not in word  
  4: S(✓)  → S is in the word and IS in position 4  
  5: T(✓)  → T is in the word and IS in position 5  

So the word structure is: _ _ _ S T
And it must also contain another T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (because T cannot be in 1st and we already have T in 5th).

Next guess must:
- End with ST  
- Have another T in 2nd or 3rd  
- Not use L, A, E, R, U, N (ruling out many options)  
- Remaining possible letters among I, O, D, H, C, M, etc.

Candidate pattern: T _ T S T is impossible (5 letters).  
Valid patterns:  
  _ T _ S T  (T in 2nd, another letter in 3rd)  
  _ _ T S T  (T in 3rd, another letter in 2nd)

Considering remaining letters: I, O, D, H, C, M, G, P, etc.  
- MOTST → invalid  
- COTST → invalid  
- DITST → invalid  

Real words:
- HOTST → not a word  
- DITST → not a word  
- BITST → not a word  
- CITST → not a word  
- HITST → not a word  

Ah – we need a real 5-letter English word that ends “ST” and has a “T” in position 2 or 3 and uses only allowed letters.

Looking at actual dictionary:  
- “TITST” – not a word  
- “TUTST” – not a word  
- “TOTST” – not a word  

This suggests our deductions may still miss something.  
Let’s re-verify: positions are 1-5.  
We know:  
- S must be in position 4 (from TRUST feedback 4: S(✓))  
- T must be in position 5 (from TRUST feedback 5: T(✓))  
And there must be another T somewhere in 2nd or 3rd.

A real word of form _ T _ S T or _ _ T S T.

Actual English word: “TITST” no, “TUTST” no, “TOAST” has A, ruled out.  
“TESTT” – no.  

Wait — maybe the word is “TASTE”, but A and E are banned.  
“TOAST” banned.  
“TRIST” has R banned.  

Possible real word: “TITST” doesn’t exist, so perhaps “TUTST” doesn’t either.  
We must have made an error.  

Re-examine:  
TRUST feedback 4: S(✓) implies S is in 4th.  
TRUST feedback 5: T(✓) implies T is in 5th.  
Thus word is _ _ _ S T.

We also know from TRUST feedback 1: T(-) means T is present but not in 1st — which is already satisfied because T is at 5th. This does not require a second T.

Therefore, the word has exactly one T (at 5th) and S at 4th, and no second T is implied.  
My earlier confusion arose from misinterpreting the duplicate T in TRUST.  
So constraints simplify to:

Word pattern: _ _ _ S T  
Letters definitely absent: L, A, E, R, U, N  
Available letters: I, O, D, H, C, M, G, P, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ST” with S in 4 and T in 5, and letters 1-3 from remaining pool.

Real candidates:
- HOIST → has O, I; but S is 4th and T 5th, and letters allowed.  
- FOIST → F not yet ruled out.  
- MOIST → M, O, I allowed.  
- POIST → not a word.  
- HOIST is valid.

Check HOIST:  
H, O, I, S, T. No banned letters. S at 4, T at 5.  
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, guess HOIST.

- S (must be in position 5, confirmed by TRUST)
- T (must appear exactly once, and not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4; therefore T must be in position 5 … but S is already in position 5)

This is a contradiction: two different letters cannot both occupy the 5th position. The only logical resolution is that T does NOT appear elsewhere in the word (feedback for TRUST said T(✓) in position 5), meaning the word has only one T (at 5) and the earlier “T(-)” in TRUST’s 1st position merely confirmed T is elsewhere (position 5).  
So the actual constraints are:

1. S is in position 5.  
2. T is in position 5 (but that conflicts with S).  
Wait — the feedback symbols are per-guess, not cumulative.  
Re-reading:  
TRUST feedback: T(-) R(x) U(x) S(✓) T(✓)  
The first T of TRUST got “-” (letter in word but wrong position), while the last T of TRUST got “✓” (correct position).  
Therefore, the word has two T’s: one in position 5 (from TRUST) and one more T somewhere else.  
But position 5 already has S (✓), so position 5 cannot be T. This implies my earlier conclusion was wrong.

Let’s re-parse carefully:

- TRUST positions:  
  1: T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 1  
  2: R(x) → R not in word  
  3: U(x) → U not in word  
  4: S(✓)  → S is in the word and IS in position 4  
  5: T(✓)  → T is in the word and IS in position 5  

So the word structure is: _ _ _ S T
And it must also contain another T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (because T cannot be in 1st and we already have T in 5th).

- “TOTST” – not a word  

This suggests our deductions may still miss something.  
Let’s re-verify: positions are 1-5.  
We know:  
- S must be in position 4 (from TRUST feedback 4: S(✓))  
- T must be in position 5 (from TRUST feedback 5: T(✓))  
And there must be another T somewhere in 2nd or 3rd.

A real word of form _ T _ S T or _ _ T S T.

Actual English word: “TITST” no, “TUTST” no, “TOAST” has A, ruled out.  
“TESTT” – no.  

Wait — maybe the word is “TASTE”, but A and E are banned.  
“TOAST” banned.  
“TRIST” has R banned.  

Possible real word: “TITST” doesn’t exist, so perhaps “TUTST” doesn’t either.  
We must have made an error.  

Re-examine:  
TRUST feedback 4: S(✓) implies S is in 4th.  
TRUST feedback 5: T(✓) implies T is in 5th.  
Thus word is _ _ _ S T.

We also know from TRUST feedback 1: T(-) means T is present but not in 1st — which is already satisfied because T is at 5th. This does not require a second T.

Therefore, the word has exactly one T (at 5th) and S at 4th, and no second T is implied.  
My earlier confusion arose from misinterpreting the duplicate T in TRUST.  
So constraints simplify to:

Word pattern: _ _ _ S T  
Letters definitely absent: L, A, E, R, U, N  
Available letters: I, O, D, H, C, M, G, P, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ST” with S in 4 and T in 5, and letters 1-3 from remaining pool.

Real candidates:
- HOIST → has O, I; but S is 4th and T 5th, and letters allowed.  
- FOIST → F not yet ruled out.  
- MOIST → M, O, I allowed.  
- POIST → not a word.  
- HOIST is valid.

Check HOIST:  
H, O, I, S, T. No banned letters. S at 4, T at 5.  
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, guess HOIST.
