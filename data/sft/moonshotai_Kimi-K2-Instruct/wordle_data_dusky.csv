For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it includes:
- Common vowels: A, I, E
- Common consonants: R, S
These letters appear frequently in English words, so this guess should provide useful feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, E are NOT in the word (all marked x)  
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (marked -)

So the secret word contains:
- The letter S  
- Does NOT contain R, A, I, E  

Since vowels A, I, E are ruled out, the only remaining common vowel is O or U.  
We also know S is present but not in position 4.  
Good consonants to try next (avoiding R, A, I, E) are N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.  
Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps S in a new position (e.g., position 1 or 3)  
- Introduces a new vowel (O or U)  
- Adds common consonants not yet tested  

A good choice is “SOUND”:
- S moves to position 1 (valid since it can’t be in 4)

From the two guesses we have the following constraints:

1. Letters **not** in the word: R, A, I, E, O, N  
2. Letters **in** the word (but positions unknown): S, U, D  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is NOT in positions 1, 4  
   - U is NOT in position 3  
   - D is NOT in position 5  

We now have 3 of the 5 letters: S, U, D.  
The remaining two letters must be from the unused consonant pool that we have not ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We want a common word that uses S, U, D plus two new consonants from that pool, while respecting the positional restrictions.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words yields “DUSTY”:
- D is in position 1 (not previously excluded)  
- U is in position 2 (not excluded)  
- S is in position 3 (not previously excluded)  
- T and Y are new letters we have not tested.  

This satisfies all constraints and should give us maximal information about which additional letters are present and where S, U, D might sit.

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 5 (✓ indicates it is in the word but in a wrong position; however, Y is marked ✓ and is already in the only remaining position it could occupy, so this must be a mis-marking—likely it should be (-) or (x). Re-reading: the feedback says D(✓) U(✓) S(✓) T(x) Y(✓). This is impossible because if D, U, S are already locked in positions 1, 2, 3, then Y must be in position 4 or 5. But it can’t be in position 5 because position 5 is the only remaining spot for Y, and ✓ means correct position. The only way this makes sense is that positions 1, 2, 3 are correct (DUS), and the last two letters must be filled. Since Y is marked ✓, this must mean Y is in position 4 or 5, but since position 5 is the only remaining spot yet to be filled, Y must be in position 5. Therefore the word must be DUS _ Y. The missing letter is position 4. We know from earlier feedback that letters not in the word include: R, A, I, E, O, N, T. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. The word must be DUS _ Y. Common 5-letter words matching this: DUSKY. Let’s check DUSKY: D U S K Y. K is a new letter and fits.

Thus, the word is likely DUSKY.
