For my first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information. A good starting word in Wordle should have common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. 

A strong starting word should also contain a good mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, I'll go with **SLATE** because it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This combination should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.

- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

1. Includes the letter E (and places it somewhere other than the 5th spot).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain.

- C, R, M are common consonants not yet ruled out.
- I is another frequent vowel.

A good starting word in Wordle should have common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Based on letter frequency analysis, the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. \n\nA strong starting word should also contain a good mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular and effective starting words include:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n\nAmong these, I'll go with **SLATE** because it contains three very common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T).

Summarizing everything we now know after three guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   S, L, A, T, C, R, M, B

2. Fixed letter:
   Position 3 = I  (from CRIME feedback)

3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   E (now confirmed in BEGIN feedback as ✓ in position 2)
   G (from BEGIN feedback: G(-) → letter exists but position 3 is already I, so G must be elsewhere)
   N (from BEGIN feedback: N(-) → letter exists but not in position 5)
   E is now locked in position 2

So the word pattern so far:
_ E I _ _

Letters still available for positions 1, 4, 5:
   From most common remaining letters: D, F, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   And we must include G and N somewhere (because they are in the word).

Known constraints:
- G must appear in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3)
- N must appear in position 1, 4 (cannot be in 5, because in BEGIN it was N(-) in position 5)

Quick enumeration of possible patterns:
- _ E I _ _ with G and N somewhere.
A plausible common word: NEIGH
But N is at position 1 and G at position 4, fitting all constraints:
   N (allowed, position 1)
   E (confirmed at position 2)
   I (confirmed at position 3)
   G (must appear, now placed at position 4)
   H (allowed, position 5)

No forbidden letters are used. Let's try NEIGH.
