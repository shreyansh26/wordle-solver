Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Good starting words typically have common vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word. Some popular strategic starter words include CRANE, SLATE, or AUDIO, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers several vowels and consonants that appear in many English words.

From the feedback we now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D

- U is not in position 3

Common remaining consonants and vowels: C, G, H, I, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that uses R and U in new positions while introducing fresh consonants/vowels is ""CRUMP"":

- R is now in position 2 (allowed).
- U is now in position 3 (allowed, since we only know it is NOT in position 3 in ROUND).

This should give maximal information on the next turn.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common consonants and vowels that were not in SLATE.  
A good strategic choice would use letters like R, O, I, N, C, U, M, etc.  
One such candidate is “ROUND”, which includes R, O, U, N, D — none of which were in SLATE and which together give good coverage of common English letters.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: R and U (both currently in position 0 and 2 respectively)

So the secret word contains the letters R and U, but:
- R is not in position 1
- U is not in position 3

We still need to find the other three letters, none of which can be any of the 8 excluded letters above.

Common remaining consonants and vowels: C, G, H, I, M, P, Y, etc.

A word that uses R and U in new positions while introducing fresh consonants/vowels is ""CRUMP"":
- C, M, P are new, plausible letters.
- R is now in position 2 (allowed).
- U is now in position 3 (allowed, since we only know it is NOT in position 3 in ROUND).

This should give maximal information on the next turn.

- U: cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (wrong-positioned in ROUND and CRUMP)  
- M: cannot be in position 4 (wrong-positioned in CRUMP)

Step 3: Identify remaining candidate letters  
Viable letters not yet ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the required letters R and U.

Step 4: Find a valid 5-letter word containing both R and U with the positional constraints above

Candidate: “FURRY”  
- Letters: F, U, R, R, Y – none are in the excluded list.  
- R appears in positions 3 and 4 (both are allowed positions so far).  
- U appears in position 2, which is allowed because we only know U is not in positions 2 or 3 of ROUND/CRUMP mappings; here we’re placing it in position 2 of a new word, and that is not yet ruled out.  

“FURRY” satisfies constraints and uses fresh letters.

From the feedback so far:

Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, O, N, D, C, P, F  
They cannot appear anywhere in the word.

Letters known to be in the word and their current positions:
- U is in position 2 (3rd letter) – ✓
- R is in position 3 (4th letter) – ✓
- Y is in position 4 (5th letter) – ✓

Remaining positions to fill: positions 1 and 2 (indices 0 and 1) with letters not yet used.

Additional constraints:
- R is also wrong-positioned in position 2 in CRUMP – so R cannot be in position 2.
- R is already fixed in position 3, so this mainly tells us R cannot be elsewhere.
- U is locked in position 2.
- Y is locked in position 4.
- No other constraints on positions 1 and 2 yet.

Available letters (not excluded): B, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus R, U, Y (but R, U, Y are already placed).

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2. Common 5-letter words fitting the pattern:
- _ _ U R Y

Looking through common 5-letter words ending in 'URRY' (since U is 3rd, R 4th, Y 5th):
- HURRY: H and U are possible, but U is already known to be in position 2.
- BURRY: B is a possible starting letter.
- GURRY: G is possible.
- WURRY: W is possible.

'BURRY' seems like the most common word among these. Let's check:
- B: not excluded
- U: in position 2 – ✓
- R: in position 3 – ✓
- R: in position 4 – ✓ (but we already have R as correct in position 3, so this might be an issue if only one R exists. However, the feedback shows R in position 3 is correct, and the second R is marked '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has exactly one R (since the second R is marked wrong position), but 'BURRY' has two Rs which might conflict. This suggests 'BURRY' is invalid because it would require two Rs.

Looking back at the feedback for FURRY:
F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
This implies:
- First R in position 3 is correct.
- Second R in position 4 is wrong position, meaning there's only one R in the word (since the second R would have to be somewhere else, but position 4 is already marked ✓ for Y, so this is conflicting).

This suggests the word actually has only one R, positioned at 3, and the second R in FURRY is extra. Therefore, the word structure is:
_ _ U R Y with no second R.

So possible words:
- HURRY: but this has two Rs, so invalid.
- BURRY: same issue.
- GURRY: same.
- WURRY: same.

This implies the word must be _ _ U R Y with only one R at position 3. Therefore, the letters are:
position 1: ?
position 2: ?
position 3: U
position 4: R
position 5: Y
with positions 1 and 2 being new letters not yet used.

Available letters for positions 1 and 2: B, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words of the form [letter][letter]URY:
- BUGRY: not a word.
- HUGRY: not a word.
- VUGRY: not a word.
- BIGRY: not a word.
- WIGRY: not a word.
- JURY: only 4 letters.
- QUIRY: not a word.
- VIBGY: not a word.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine FURRY feedback:
F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
The second R is marked '-' which means it's in the word but not in position 4. Since position 3 already has R as ✓, this implies the word has at least two Rs: one in position 3 and one somewhere else. But position 5 is Y, so the second R must be in position 1 or 2.

But U is in position 2, so the second R must be in position 1. Therefore, the word structure is R _ U R Y.

Is ""RURRY"" a valid word? No, it's not in standard English dictionaries.

This suggests an inconsistency. Re-reading the feedback carefully:
In CRUMP: C(x) R(-) U(-) M(-) P(x)
- R is in word, wrong position (not 2)
- U is in word, wrong position (not 2)
- M is in word, wrong position (not 4)

In FURRY: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)
- U is in correct position 2
- First R is in correct position 3
- Second R is in word but wrong position (not 4)
- Y is in correct position 4

This implies the word has:
- position 2: U
- position 3: R
- position 4: Y
- and at least one more R elsewhere (but position 1 is the only remaining spot)

So the word must be R U R Y _. But this is 5 letters: R U R Y _, needing one more letter. However, position 5 is Y (from FURRY feedback), so the word would be R U R Y _. This seems impossible as it's 4 letters plus an unknown.

Wait, positions are 0-based or 1-based? Let's clarify indexing:

Assume positions are 1-5:
FURRY: F(1)=x, U(2)=✓, R(3)=✓, R(4)=-, Y(5)=✓
So:
- letter 2: U
- letter 3: R
- letter 5: Y
- letter 4 must have an R (from R(-)), but position 4 is already taken by R in FURRY which is marked '-', meaning R is not in position 4. This is contradictory.

This suggests the word must have exactly one R at position 3, and the second R in FURRY is a duplicate letter not actually in the word. Therefore, the word structure is _ _ U R Y with letters 1 and 2 to be determined.

Given this, and that 'HURRY' etc. have extra Rs, perhaps the word is 'HURRY' but with only one R, which seems impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the word is 'JURY' but it's 4 letters.

This indicates my earlier assumption may be off. Let me re-express the feedback:

In FURRY:
F(1)=x, U(2)=✓, R(3)=✓, R(4)=-, Y(5)=✓
This implies:
- U is correctly placed at position 2
- R is correctly placed at position 3
- R is also in the word but not at position 4
- Y is correctly placed at position 5

This is impossible because position 3 already has R, and position 4 cannot have R, so the word cannot have another R. This suggests the word has only one R at position 3, and the second R in FURRY is simply not in the word (but feedback says R is in word). This is confusing.

Re-interpreting the feedback: when a letter appears twice in a guess and the word has only one instance, the duplicate is marked x or - appropriately. Here, since R is correctly at position 3, the second R in FURRY should likely be marked x (not in word) rather than -. The feedback given seems inconsistent.

Given the feedback as stated, the only possible interpretation is that the word has R at 3 and another R elsewhere (but positions 1,2,4,5 are partially filled). The only possible word fitting _ _ U R Y with an extra R is R U R Y _, but this is 4 letters plus an unknown, and no standard word fits.

This suggests the most likely intended word is ""HURRY"" despite the apparent inconsistency, or there may be an error in feedback interpretation. Proceeding with the closest valid word that fits the known correct letters:

Known:
- position 2: U
- position 3: R
- position 5: Y
- positions 1 and 4 to fill
- no S,L,A,T,E,O,N,D,C,P,F

Possible words:
- B U R R Y: but has extra R at 4 which conflicts with R(-) in FURRY
- G U R R Y: same issue
- H U R R Y: same issue

Given this, the feedback may imply the word is ""MURKY"":
Let's check if ""MURKY"" fits all feedback:

Letters known not to be in word: S,L,A,T,E,O,N,D,C,P,F
""MURKY"": M,U,R,K,Y
- M: not excluded
- U: in word
- R: in word
- K: not excluded
- Y: in word

Check positions:
- M is new
- U needs to be at position 2: yes in MURKY
- R at position 3: yes in MURKY
- K is new
- Y at position 5: yes in MURKY

Check past feedback:
- In ROUND: R(-) at position 1 – MURKY has R at 3, so this is correct
- In CRUMP: R(-) at position 2 – MURKY has R at 3, correct
- U(-) at position 3 in CRUMP – MURKY has U at 2, so this is correct
- M(-) at position 4 – MURKY has M at 1, correct
- In FURRY: F(x), U(✓), R(✓), R(-), Y(✓) – MURKY has U at 2, R at 3, Y at 5, and no second R, so the R(-) at position 4 is consistent (no R there)

Therefore, ""MURKY"" satisfies all feedback.
