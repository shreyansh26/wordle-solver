For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities at once. The top starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away and narrowing down future guesses efficiently.

From the first guess:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → it must appear somewhere that is NOT the last position.

So the hidden word:
- contains the letter E somewhere other than position 5.
- does NOT contain S, L, A, T at all.

A good second guess should:
1. keep the confirmed letter E (and move it to a new spot),
2. introduce other common consonants and vowels that we haven’t tested yet,
3. avoid the eliminated letters S, L, A, T.

Possible letters still “live”: E, plus common ones like R, N, I, O, C, H, U, D, M, G, P, etc.

A strong starting candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R haven’t been tested.
- E is moved from position 5 to position 4, satisfying its “wrong position” clue.
- Every letter is unique, maximizing information.

Let’s lock in CHORE.

1. Uses E exactly once (could be E or another E in a different spot).
2. Contains none of the eliminated letters.
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

- Add 3-4 fresh consonants plus possibly I or U.

From the feedback:

- Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, F, M, D  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word, but wrong positions:  
  – E (was in positions 4, 4, and 5; must be in 1, 2, or 3)  
  – U (was in position 2; must be 1, 3, 4, or 5)

Allowed letters we haven’t tried yet: B, G, I, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, J  
Common, still-legal letters: B, G, I, N, P, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both E and U.  
2. Places E in 1, 2, or 3.  
3. Places U somewhere other than 2.  
4. Uses only the untested letters above.

Possible patterns (E and U positions):
E _ U _ _  (E1, U3)  
E U _ _ _  (E1, U2) → invalid (U already proven wrong at 2)  
_ E U _ _  (E2, U3)  
_ _ E U _  (E3, U4)  
_ _ _ E U  (E4, U5) → invalid (E wrong at 4)  
U E _ _ _  (U1, E2) → legal  
U _ E _ _  (U1, E3) → legal  
etc.

Scanning legal combinations:

- E1 U3: needs letters at 2,4,5 from {B,G,I,N,P,V,W,Y}.  
  Example: E B U N Y → “EBUNY” (not valid English).  
  E P U N G → “EPUNG” (invalid).  
  E B U N G → “EBUNG” (invalid).

- E2 U1: U at 1, E at 2.  
  Example: U N E P G → “UNEPG” (invalid).  
  U P E N G → “UPENG” (invalid).

- E2 U3: _ E U _ _  
  Example: V E U N Y → “VEUNY” (invalid).  
  N E U P Y → “NEUPY” (invalid).

- E3 U1: U _ E _ _  
  Example: U N E P Y → “UNE PY” (invalid).  
  U P E N G → “UPENG” (invalid).

- E3 U4: _ _ E U _  
  Example: B I N E U → “BINEU” (invalid).  
  P I N E U → “PINEU” (invalid).

- E3 U5: _ _ E _ U

- E2 U3: Y E U N G → “YEUNG” (invalid).

- E2 U4: _ E _ U _  
  Example: N E V U G → “NEVUG” (invalid).

Let’s try “EBUNG” (invalid).  
“EBING” (invalid).  
“EBINY” (invalid).  
“ENYBU” (invalid).

At this point it’s clear brute-force scanning is inefficient.  
A better approach is to search a 5-letter word list for words that:
- Contain both E and U.
- Do not contain any of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, F, M, D).
- Do not have U in position 2, and E not in 4 or 5.

Quick scan of common words:
- **ENNUI** – contains N, N, U, I. No D, S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, F, M. But has double N and I, which are allowed.  
  Letters: E N N U I  
  Positions: E1, N2, N3, U4, I5  
  – E is in 1 (legal).  
  – U is in 4 (legal).  
  – No forbidden letters.  

“ENNUI” fits all constraints.
