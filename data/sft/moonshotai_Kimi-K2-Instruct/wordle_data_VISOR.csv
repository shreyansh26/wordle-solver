As this is the very first guess with no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a strong starting word that maximizes the amount of information gained. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to get more feedback on different letters
3. Include a good mix of vowels and consonants

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter English words, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y

A very popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it uses:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) covering the most common vowels
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also very common
- No repeating letters
- Can form many other words through letter rearrangement

This gives us the maximum chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and provides good information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: - → in the word but not in position 3
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word must contain R, O, and S somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain A or E.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the confirmed letters (R, O, S) but in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet
3. Avoid A and E

Possible new letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, U, Y, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that moves R, O, S to new spots and adds two new high-frequency untested consonants. A strong candidate is “TRIOS”:
- T: new letter, high frequency
- R: moves from position 2 to 1
- I: new vowel (only remaining common vowel not yet used)
- O: moves from position 3 to 4
- S: moves from position 4 to 5

This tests two new letters (T and I) and re-positions R, O, S to rule out more possibilities.

From both guesses:

Confirmed letters that must be in the word:
- R (positions 2 and 1 are wrong for it)
- O (position 4 is correct)
- S (positions 4 and 5 are wrong for it)
- I (position 3 is wrong for it)

Forbidden letters: A, E, T.

Positions:
1: not R (from TRIOS) and not T
2: not R (from AROSE) and not I (from TRIOS)
3: not O (already fixed at 4) and not I (from TRIOS)
4: fixed as O
5: not S (from both guesses) and not E

Therefore:
- Word contains R, S, I, O (with O locked at 4).
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3 or 5, but 5 is open (only S is ruled out there).
- S cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- I cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5.

Possible positions:
1: I or S
2: S (since I is ruled out here)
3: R or S
4: O
5: R or I

But we have to place R, S, I and two more new letters (since we have only 5 letters and already have R,S,I,O).

We need two more distinct letters from the unused common set: N, L, C, U, Y, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try constructing a word that satisfies:
- O at position 4
- R not at 1,2
- S not at 4,5
- I not at 2,3

A good candidate is “SIRON”:
- S: position 1 (allowed)
- I: position 2 (but wait, position 2 is not allowed for I, since I is - in TRIOS position 2)
Oops, no: in TRIOS, I was at position 3, and feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3. But position 2 was R in TRIOS and R was -, so R cannot be at 2. Position 2 can be I, S, etc.

But we have to place R somewhere. Let’s think differently: since O is at 4, and we have R, S, I to place in positions 1,2,3,5 with constraints.

- R cannot be at 1 or 2 → must be at 3 or 5
- S cannot be at 4 or 5 → must be at 1,2,3
- I cannot be at 2 or 3 → must be at 1 or 5

Let’s try “S” at 1, ""I"" at 5, then ""R"" must be at 3. That gives S _ R O I, but we need one more letter for position 2 (from unused: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.). ""S C R O I"" is invalid (C before R), but ""S C R O I"" isn’t a word. 

Another approach: R at 5, then positions 1,2,3 must be S, I, and one new letter. Let’s try:
- 1: S
- 2: new letter
- 3: I (but I cannot be at 3, since TRIOS had I at 3 and it was -)
No, I cannot be at 3.

Alternative: R at 3, then I must be at 1 or 5, S must be at 1 or 2.

Option 1: I at 1, S at 2 → I S _ O _, but 3 must be R → I S R O _, need 5th letter (new, unused like N) → ISR O N → “ISR” isn’t a valid start. Maybe “IRON S” but that’s not 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:

Given O at 4, and letters R,S,I must appear, with constraints:
- R not at 1,2 → 3 or 5
- S not at 4,5 → 1,2,3
- I not at 2,3 → 1 or 5

Case 1: R at 3
Then:
- S must be 1 or 2
- I must be 1 or 5
- Positions:
  1: S or I
  2: if 1 is S, then 2 is new letter; if 1 is I, then 2 is S
  3: R
  4: O
  5: if 1 is S, then I can be 5; if 1 is I, then 5 is new letter

Subcase 1.1: R at 3, S at 1, I at 5 → S _ R O I → need 2nd letter (new, common: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.)
“S N R O I” – not a word
“S L R O I” – not a word
“S C R O I” – not a word
“S U R O I” – not a word

Subcase 1.2: R at 3, I at 1, S at 2 → I S R O _ → need 5th letter (new) → “ISR O N” – “ISR” is not a valid start, but “IRONS” is a word.

Check if “IRONS” fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, S, I
- O at 4: yes (I R O N S – O is 3, not 4) Oops, no: O must be at 4 in “IRONS” it’s at 3. So invalid.

Case 2: R at 5
Then:
- S must be 1,2,3
- I must be 1 (cannot be 5 since R is there)
So:
1: I
2: new letter
3: S
4: O
5: R
→ I _ S O R → need 2nd letter (new, common) → “I N S O R” – not a word
“I C S O R” – not
“I L S O R” – not
“I M S O R” – not
“I P S O R” – not

Alternative: 1: S, 2: I, 3: new, 4: O, 5: R → S I _ O R → need 3rd letter → “S I N O R” – “SINOR” not a word
“S I L O R” – not
“S I C O R” – not

Another idea: maybe the word uses another consonant. Let’s try “ROSIN”:
- R: position 1 (was - in TRIOS position 1, so R cannot be 1) – invalid.

“ORISON” is 6 letters.

“ROINS” – not a word.

“RIOTS” – but T is forbidden.

“ROSIN” is 5 letters:
- R:1 – but R cannot be 1 (from TRIOS)
- O:2 – but O must be at 4
- S:3
- I:4
- N:5
But O must be at 4, so invalid.

Let me re-examine constraints carefully:

Letters to place: R, S, I, O (fixed at 4), plus one more new letter (since we have 5 slots and already 4 letters).

Thus word has 5 letters, includes R,S,I,O, and one new letter.

Positions:
1: not R (from TRIOS), not T
2: not R (from AROSE), not I (from TRIOS I at 3 was -, but I at 2 could be allowed unless TRIOS had I at 2 – but TRIOS had I at 3)
Wait, in TRIOS, I was at 3, feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3, but can be elsewhere.

Similarly, R was at 1 in TRIOS and feedback was -, so R cannot be at 1.
R was at 2 in AROSE and feedback was -, so R cannot be at 2.
Thus R must be at 3 or 5.

O is at 4.

S was at 4 in AROSE (x), at 5 in TRIOS (x), so S cannot be at 4 or 5 → must be at 1,2,3.

I was at 3 in TRIOS and feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3 → must be at 1,2,5.

Now, possible positions:

Let’s list possibilities for R at 3 or 5.

Option A: R at 3
Then:
- S must be at 1 or 2
- I must be at 1 or 5
- One new letter to place

Suboption A1: R at 3, S at 1, I at 5
Pattern: S _ R O I
Need 2nd letter (new, common: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.)
“S N R O I” – not a word
“S L R O I” – not
“S C R O I” – not
“S U R O I” – not
“S M R O I” – not

Suboption A2: R at 3, I at 1, S at 2
Pattern: I S R O _
Need 5th letter (new) → “I S R O N” – “ISR” is not a valid start; “ISR” is not a word.

Option B: R at 5
Then:
- S must be at 1,2,3
- I must be at 1,2 (cannot be 5)
- One new letter

Suboption B1: R at 5, S at 1, I at 2
Pattern: S I _ O R
Need 3rd letter (new) → “S I N O R” – “SINOR” not a word
“S I C O R” – “SICOR” not
“S I L O R” – “SILOR” not
“S I M O R” – “SIMOR” not

Suboption B2: R at 5, S at 2, I at 1
Pattern: I S _ O R
Same as above, 3rd letter new → “I S N O R” – not a word

Suboption B3: R at 5, S at 3, I at 1 or 2
- I at 1: I _ S O R → need 2nd letter → “I N S O R” – not
- I at 2: _ I S O R → need 1st letter → “N I S O R” – “NISOR” not a word

This seems problematic. Maybe the word uses another vowel not used yet (U, Y).

Let’s try “SURFY” – but lacks O.

Wait, we must use O at 4, R, S, I, plus one more.

Alternative approach: maybe the additional letter is another vowel, like U.

Let’s try:

R at 5, O at 4, need to place S, I, and one more letter.

Pattern: _ _ _ O R with S and I in 1,2,3

Possible:
- S at 1, I at 2 → S I _ O R → “S I N O R” – not
- S at 1, I at 3 → S _ I O R → “S N I O R” – not
- S at 2, I at 1 → I S _ O R → same as before
- S at 2, I at 3 → _ S I O R → “N S I O R” – not
- S at 3, I at 1 → I _ S O R → same
- S at 3, I at 2 → _ I S O R → same

This suggests that maybe “SIRON” or similar isn’t working. Perhaps the additional letter is D, M, P, etc.

But none seem to fit. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is “S O R R I” – but repeats R, which is unlikely.

Realization: the word must contain exactly R, S, I, O plus one more distinct letter, with O at 4.

Thus letters are R,S,I,O,X, with positions:
1: not R, T
2: not R
3: not O (fixed at 4), not I (from TRIOS), not S (if S is at 3 then I must be at 1 or 2, but 2 cannot be I if S is not at 1,2)
This is getting messy.

A simpler next guess is to place O at 4, and try common patterns. Let’s try “FRISK” – but lacks O.

“FROST” – lacks I and S is at 5 (forbidden).

“FORIS” – not a word.

</think>

<guess>VISOR</guess>",VISOR,"From both guesses:

Confirmed letters that must be in the word:
- R (positions 2 and 1 are wrong for it)
- O (position 4 is correct)
- S (positions 4 and 5 are wrong for it)
- I (position 3 is wrong for it)

Forbidden letters: A, E, T.

Positions:
1: not R (from TRIOS) and not T
2: not R (from AROSE) and not I (from TRIOS)
3: not O (already fixed at 4) and not I (from TRIOS)
4: fixed as O
5: not S (from both guesses) and not E

Therefore:
- Word contains R, S, I, O (with O locked at 4).
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be in 3 or 5, but 5 is open (only S is ruled out there).
- S cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- I cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5.

Possible positions:
1: I or S
2: S (since I is ruled out here)
3: R or S
4: O
5: R or I

But we have to place R, S, I and two more new letters (since we have only 5 letters and already have R,S,I,O).

We need two more distinct letters from the unused common set: N, L, C, U, Y, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try constructing a word that satisfies:
- O at position 4
- R not at 1,2
- S not at 4,5
- I not at 2,3

A good candidate is “SIRON”:
- S: position 1 (allowed)
- I: position 2 (but wait, position 2 is not allowed for I, since I is - in TRIOS position 2)
Oops, no: in TRIOS, I was at position 3, and feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3. But position 2 was R in TRIOS and R was -, so R cannot be at 2. Position 2 can be I, S, etc.

But we have to place R somewhere. Let’s think differently: since O is at 4, and we have R, S, I to place in positions 1,2,3,5 with constraints.

- R cannot be at 1 or 2 → must be at 3 or 5
- S cannot be at 4 or 5 → must be at 1,2,3
- I cannot be at 2 or 3 → must be at 1 or 5

Let’s try “S” at 1, ""I"" at 5, then ""R"" must be at 3. That gives S _ R O I, but we need one more letter for position 2 (from unused: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.). ""S C R O I"" is invalid (C before R), but ""S C R O I"" isn’t a word. 

Another approach: R at 5, then positions 1,2,3 must be S, I, and one new letter. Let’s try:
- 1: S
- 2: new letter
- 3: I (but I cannot be at 3, since TRIOS had I at 3 and it was -)
No, I cannot be at 3.

Alternative: R at 3, then I must be at 1 or 5, S must be at 1 or 2.

Option 1: I at 1, S at 2 → I S _ O _, but 3 must be R → I S R O _, need 5th letter (new, unused like N) → ISR O N → “ISR” isn’t a valid start. Maybe “IRON S” but that’s not 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:

Given O at 4, and letters R,S,I must appear, with constraints:
- R not at 1,2 → 3 or 5
- S not at 4,5 → 1,2,3
- I not at 2,3 → 1 or 5

Case 1: R at 3
Then:
- S must be 1 or 2
- I must be 1 or 5
- Positions:
  1: S or I
  2: if 1 is S, then 2 is new letter; if 1 is I, then 2 is S
  3: R
  4: O
  5: if 1 is S, then I can be 5; if 1 is I, then 5 is new letter

Subcase 1.1: R at 3, S at 1, I at 5 → S _ R O I → need 2nd letter (new, common: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.)
“S N R O I” – not a word
“S L R O I” – not a word
“S C R O I” – not a word
“S U R O I” – not a word

Subcase 1.2: R at 3, I at 1, S at 2 → I S R O _ → need 5th letter (new) → “ISR O N” – “ISR” is not a valid start, but “IRONS” is a word.

Check if “IRONS” fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, S, I
- O at 4: yes (I R O N S – O is 3, not 4) Oops, no: O must be at 4 in “IRONS” it’s at 3. So invalid.

Case 2: R at 5
Then:
- S must be 1,2,3
- I must be 1 (cannot be 5 since R is there)
So:
1: I
2: new letter
3: S
4: O
5: R
→ I _ S O R → need 2nd letter (new, common) → “I N S O R” – not a word
“I C S O R” – not
“I L S O R” – not
“I M S O R” – not
“I P S O R” – not

Alternative: 1: S, 2: I, 3: new, 4: O, 5: R → S I _ O R → need 3rd letter → “S I N O R” – “SINOR” not a word
“S I L O R” – not
“S I C O R” – not

Another idea: maybe the word uses another consonant. Let’s try “ROSIN”:
- R: position 1 (was - in TRIOS position 1, so R cannot be 1) – invalid.

“ORISON” is 6 letters.

“ROINS” – not a word.

“RIOTS” – but T is forbidden.

“ROSIN” is 5 letters:
- R:1 – but R cannot be 1 (from TRIOS)
- O:2 – but O must be at 4
- S:3
- I:4
- N:5
But O must be at 4, so invalid.

Let me re-examine constraints carefully:

Letters to place: R, S, I, O (fixed at 4), plus one more new letter (since we have 5 slots and already 4 letters).

Thus word has 5 letters, includes R,S,I,O, and one new letter.

Positions:
1: not R (from TRIOS), not T
2: not R (from AROSE), not I (from TRIOS I at 3 was -, but I at 2 could be allowed unless TRIOS had I at 2 – but TRIOS had I at 3)
Wait, in TRIOS, I was at 3, feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3, but can be elsewhere.

Similarly, R was at 1 in TRIOS and feedback was -, so R cannot be at 1.
R was at 2 in AROSE and feedback was -, so R cannot be at 2.
Thus R must be at 3 or 5.

O is at 4.

S was at 4 in AROSE (x), at 5 in TRIOS (x), so S cannot be at 4 or 5 → must be at 1,2,3.

I was at 3 in TRIOS and feedback was -, so I cannot be at 3 → must be at 1,2,5.

Now, possible positions:

Let’s list possibilities for R at 3 or 5.

Option A: R at 3
Then:
- S must be at 1 or 2
- I must be at 1 or 5
- One new letter to place

Suboption A1: R at 3, S at 1, I at 5
Pattern: S _ R O I
Need 2nd letter (new, common: N, L, C, U, Y, etc.)
“S N R O I” – not a word
“S L R O I” – not
“S C R O I” – not
“S U R O I” – not
“S M R O I” – not

Suboption A2: R at 3, I at 1, S at 2
Pattern: I S R O _
Need 5th letter (new) → “I S R O N” – “ISR” is not a valid start; “ISR” is not a word.

Option B: R at 5
Then:
- S must be at 1,2,3
- I must be at 1,2 (cannot be 5)
- One new letter

Suboption B1: R at 5, S at 1, I at 2
Pattern: S I _ O R
Need 3rd letter (new) → “S I N O R” – “SINOR” not a word
“S I C O R” – “SICOR” not
“S I L O R” – “SILOR” not
“S I M O R” – “SIMOR” not

Suboption B2: R at 5, S at 2, I at 1
Pattern: I S _ O R
Same as above, 3rd letter new → “I S N O R” – not a word

Suboption B3: R at 5, S at 3, I at 1 or 2
- I at 1: I _ S O R → need 2nd letter → “I N S O R” – not
- I at 2: _ I S O R → need 1st letter → “N I S O R” – “NISOR” not a word

This seems problematic. Maybe the word uses another vowel not used yet (U, Y).

Let’s try “SURFY” – but lacks O.

Wait, we must use O at 4, R, S, I, plus one more.

Alternative approach: maybe the additional letter is another vowel, like U.

Let’s try:

R at 5, O at 4, need to place S, I, and one more letter.

Pattern: _ _ _ O R with S and I in 1,2,3

Possible:
- S at 1, I at 2 → S I _ O R → “S I N O R” – not
- S at 1, I at 3 → S _ I O R → “S N I O R” – not
- S at 2, I at 1 → I S _ O R → same as before
- S at 2, I at 3 → _ S I O R → “N S I O R” – not
- S at 3, I at 1 → I _ S O R → same
- S at 3, I at 2 → _ I S O R → same

This suggests that maybe “SIRON” or similar isn’t working. Perhaps the additional letter is D, M, P, etc.

But none seem to fit. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is “S O R R I” – but repeats R, which is unlikely.

Realization: the word must contain exactly R, S, I, O plus one more distinct letter, with O at 4.

Thus letters are R,S,I,O,X, with positions:
1: not R, T
2: not R
3: not O (fixed at 4), not I (from TRIOS), not S (if S is at 3 then I must be at 1 or 2, but 2 cannot be I if S is not at 1,2)
This is getting messy.
