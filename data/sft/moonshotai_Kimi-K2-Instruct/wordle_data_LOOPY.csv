For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate multiple possibilities at once. A good strategy is to start with a word that contains frequently used letters in the English language, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - covering the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, which is efficient for narrowing down possibilities.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good strategy is to start with a word that contains frequently used letters in the English language, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - covering the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, which is efficient for narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on arose:

- A(x): 'A' is NOT in the word.
- R(x): 'R' is NOT in the word.
- O(✓): 'O' is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S(x): 'S' is NOT in the word.
- E(x): 'E' is NOT in the word.

Thus the word must contain an 'O' in the 3rd position and cannot contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ )
2. does not use A, R, S, or E.

We can try a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good next step is to test consonants like T, L, N, D, or B and vowels like I or U.

A possible word that fits these conditions: ""POINT"" – but it has an I and N, and the O is in the correct position. However ""POINT"" has an 'I' in the 2nd position, which is okay (O is 3rd). But we want a word with O in the 3rd position only.

Correct structure: _ _ O _ _

Let me think of a word: ""CLOUD"" – but it has 'U' and 'D' which are new letters, and O is in the 3rd position. Also, it avoids A, R, S, E.

Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" – but it has 'B', 'L', 'C', 'K', and O in 3rd. Avoids A, R, S, E.

Another: ""FLOCK"" – but similar letters.

Another: ""TOUGH"" – but O is in 3rd position, and it has T, U, G, H.

But we want to maximize new letters. ""CLOUD"" has C, L, U, D – all new letters we haven't tested yet.

I'll go with ""CLOUD"".

We need a 5-letter word:

Let’s condense what we know after four guesses.

2. Letters ruled out so far  
   A, R, S, E, C, U, D, N, B, H

3. Letters still on the table  
   - L must be in the word (from the first few guesses) but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in both cloud and nobly, and “-” twice in holly).  
     Therefore L **must** be in position 1.

4. Letters we still need to test  
   We have positions 2 and 4 left to fill.  
   Allowed consonants we haven’t tried: F, G, K, M, P, T, W, etc.  
   Allowed vowel left: I

5. So the word must look like  
   L ? O ? Y

   where the two “?” are from the still-allowed letters and they cannot be any of the ruled-out letters.

6. Possible real words that fit L ? O ? Y  
   - LOOBY – but B is already out  
   - LOOPY – P is still allowed  
   - LOFTY – T and F are still allowed  
   - LOOKY – K is still allowed  
   - LOAMY – M is still allowed  

   The cleanest, common word that introduces two new still-allowed letters is **LOFTY** (L O F T Y):

   – F and T are fresh letters we haven’t used yet, both still allowed.

   Allowed consonants we haven’t tried: F, G, K, M, P, T, W, etc.  
   Allowed vowel left: I

5. So the word must look like  
   L ? O ? Y

   where the two “?” are from the still-allowed letters and they cannot be any of the ruled-out letters.

6. Possible real words that fit L ? O ? Y  
   - LOOBY – but B is already out  
   - LOOPY – P is still allowed  
   - LOFTY – T and F are still allowed  
   - LOOKY – K is still allowed  
   - LOAMY – M is still allowed  

   The cleanest, common word that introduces two new still-allowed letters is **LOFTY** (L O F T Y):  
   – L in position 1 (required)  
   – F and T are fresh letters we haven’t used yet, both still allowed.",Guess 5: lofty -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(x) Y(✓),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,LOOPY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate multiple possibilities at once. A good strategy is to start with a word that contains frequently used letters in the English language, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent starting choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - covering the most common vowels
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, which is efficient for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on arose:

- A(x): 'A' is NOT in the word.
- R(x): 'R' is NOT in the word.
- O(✓): 'O' is in the word and in the correct (3rd) position.
- S(x): 'S' is NOT in the word.
- E(x): 'E' is NOT in the word.

Thus the word must contain an 'O' in the 3rd position and cannot contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ )
2. does not use A, R, S, or E.

We can try a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels. A good next step is to test consonants like T, L, N, D, or B and vowels like I or U.

A possible word that fits these conditions: ""POINT"" – but it has an I and N, and the O is in the correct position. However ""POINT"" has an 'I' in the 2nd position, which is okay (O is 3rd). But we want a word with O in the 3rd position only.

Correct structure: _ _ O _ _

Let me think of a word: ""CLOUD"" – but it has 'U' and 'D' which are new letters, and O is in the 3rd position. Also, it avoids A, R, S, E.

Another candidate: ""BLOCK"" – but it has 'B', 'L', 'C', 'K', and O in 3rd. Avoids A, R, S, E.

Another: ""FLOCK"" – but similar letters.

Another: ""TOUGH"" – but O is in 3rd position, and it has T, U, G, H.

But we want to maximize new letters. ""CLOUD"" has C, L, U, D – all new letters we haven't tested yet.

I'll go with ""CLOUD"".

<guess>cloud</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds so far we know:

1. The word is of the form _ _ O _ _ (O is fixed in position 3).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, C, U, D.
3. Letter L is in the word, but not in position 2.

Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out)  
Remaining common consonants to test: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Contains L somewhere (positions 1, 4 or 5)
- Excludes A, R, S, E, C, U, D
- Introduces new letters.

Let’s list candidates:
- F L O W N → L is in position 2 (disallowed)  
- B L O N K → L is in position 2 (disallowed)  
- F L O W K → same issue  
- G L O B Y → L in position 2  
- P L O T S → S is excluded  
- M L O P … not a word  
- B O L T S → S excluded  
- N O B L Y → N O B L Y has L in 4th position (valid) and O in 3rd, uses new letters N, B, Y.

So “nobly” fits:
- _ _ O _ _  (O in 3rd)
- Contains L in 4th (allowed)
- Uses new letters N, B, Y
- Avoids all disallowed letters.

Next guess: nobly

Guess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: nobly -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) B(x) L(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the three rounds we have:

1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _  (O locked in position 3)
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, C, U, D, N, B
3. Letters in the word but not yet placed:
   - L (must go in position 1,4 or 5)  
   - Y (must go in position 5, because that’s where it got the ✓)
4. Therefore the word looks like: _ _ O _ Y with L still to place in position 1 or 4.

Remaining unused consonants to test: F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, etc.  
Remaining unused vowel: I.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching:
- _ _ O _ Y
- Contains L in position 1 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- F L O W Y → L in 2 (disallowed)  
- G L O W Y → same  
- P L O W Y → same  
- H O L L Y → L in 4th, H and I not yet used, but we already have Y in 5th, word fits pattern _ _ O L Y  
- M O L L Y → same pattern  
- T O L L Y → same pattern  

Among these, “holly” is a real word that fits:
- H O L L Y → positions 1-5: H(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓)  
  – O and Y are correct and placed.  
  – L appears twice; the first L is in the required 4th position.  
  – Uses new letters H, L.

So “holly” satisfies every constraint.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s condense what we know after four guesses.

1. Position pattern  
   _ _ O _ Y  (O and Y are in the correct spots: positions 3 and 5).

2. Letters ruled out so far  
   A, R, S, E, C, U, D, N, B, H

3. Letters still on the table  
   - L must be in the word (from the first few guesses) but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in both cloud and nobly, and “-” twice in holly).  
     Therefore L **must** be in position 1.

4. Letters we still need to test  
   We have positions 2 and 4 left to fill.  
   Allowed consonants we haven’t tried: F, G, K, M, P, T, W, etc.  
   Allowed vowel left: I

5. So the word must look like  
   L ? O ? Y

   where the two “?” are from the still-allowed letters and they cannot be any of the ruled-out letters.

6. Possible real words that fit L ? O ? Y  
   - LOOBY – but B is already out  
   - LOOPY – P is still allowed  
   - LOFTY – T and F are still allowed  
   - LOOKY – K is still allowed  
   - LOAMY – M is still allowed  

   The cleanest, common word that introduces two new still-allowed letters is **LOFTY** (L O F T Y):

   – F and T are fresh letters we haven’t used yet, both still allowed.

Current constraints after five guesses:

1. Fixed pattern:

2. Letters ruled out so far:  
   A, R, S, E, C, U, D, N, B, H, F, T

3. Remaining letters we have not placed:  
   Positions 2 and 4 must be chosen from the still-allowed letters:  
   G, I, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z – plus the vowel I, the only still-untried vowel.

4. Candidate 5-letter English words of the form L _ O _ Y that avoid every banned letter and use only still-allowed letters:

   - L I O N Y – no; N is banned.  
   - L I O D Y – D banned.  
   - L I O G Y – “logy” is 4 letters; no.  
   - L I O M Y – not a word.  
   - L I O V Y – not a word.  
   - L I O K Y – “liky” not a word.  
   - L I O P Y – not a word.  
   - L I O W Y – not a word.  
   - L I O X Y – not a word.  
   - L I O Z Y – not a word.  
   - L G O I Y – wrong pattern.  
   - L K O I Y – not a word.  
   - L G O G Y – double G, but G is still allowed; “loggy” is 5 letters but banned T and F aren’t involved; yet the correct pattern is L _ O _ Y so “loggy” is 5 letters but is L O G G Y – that still fits the pattern and uses only still-allowed letters G.

Wait, let me check:  
“loggy” (meaning dull or heavy) is a valid 5-letter English word.  
Letters: L, O, G, G, Y  
- L (✓) – correct position 1  
- O (✓) – correct position 3  
- Y (✓) – correct position 5  
- G – not yet ruled out  
- G – same  

No banned letters used. Therefore “loggy” is the only remaining candidate that fits every constraint.

Final check:
- Banned letters not present: A, R, S, E, C, U, D, N, B, H, F, T  
- Pattern L _ O _ Y satisfied by L O G G Y  
- Both G’s are allowed.

Hence the next and final guess is:
