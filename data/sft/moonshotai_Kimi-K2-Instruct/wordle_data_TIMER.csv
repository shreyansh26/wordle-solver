Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback yet, the best strategy is to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. This typically means using common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. A good first guess often includes common vowels and consonants.

Common starting guesses include words like:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the word.

Let me interpret the feedback from the first guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.

The remaining letters to consider are typically consonants and other vowels. Since E and R are confirmed, we should focus on positions for them. E cannot be in position 5, and R cannot be in position 2. 

Good next words would use different letters not yet tested (avoiding A, O, S) and place E and R in new positions. Possible candidates:
- TIRED (but S is out, so maybe TIRED but has D at end)
- ENTER (but has N, T, E, R - but E appears twice, might not be optimal)
- MERIT (but has M, E, R, I, T - uses new letters I and T)

I'll choose ""MERIT"" as it:
- Uses new letters M, I, T (not in AROSE)
- Places E in position 2 (was in position 5 before, now wrong position)
- Places R in position 3 (was in position 2 before, now wrong position)
- Avoids all the eliminated letters (A, O, S)

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R and E are in the word but in wrong positions.

From Guess 2 (MERIT):
- M, E, R, I, T are all in the word but in wrong positions.

This tells us two key things:
1. Every letter in MERIT (M, E, R, I, T) is somewhere in the word, just not in their tested positions.
2. Therefore, the secret word is a permutation of the five letters M, E, R, I, T.

We need to rearrange M, E, R, I, T so that:
- E is not in position 5 (from AROSE feedback)
- R is not in position 2 (from AROSE feedback)
- M is not in position 1
- E is not in position 2
- R is not in position 3
- I is not in position 4
- T is not in position 5

Let’s list valid permutations of MERIT that satisfy these constraints:
- E cannot be at 5 → possible E positions: 1, 2, 3, 4
- R cannot be at 2 or 3 → possible R positions: 1, 4, 5
- M cannot be at 1 → possible M positions: 2, 3, 4, 5
- T cannot be at 5 → possible T positions: 1, 2, 3, 4
- I cannot be at 4 → possible I positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

A valid permutation is TIMER:
- T at 1 (allowed)
- I at 2 (allowed)
- M at 3 (allowed)
- E at 4 (E was at 5 before, now allowed)
- R at 5 (R was at 2 and 3 before, now allowed)

Check constraints:
- E not at 5: ✓ (it's at 4)
- R not at 2 or 3: ✓ (it's at 5)
- M not at 1: ✓ (it's at 3)
- E not at 2: ✓ (it's at 4)
- R not at 3: ✓ (it's at 5)
- I not at 4: ✓ (it's at 2)
- T not at 5: ✓ (it's at 1)

Thus, TIMER is a valid next guess.
