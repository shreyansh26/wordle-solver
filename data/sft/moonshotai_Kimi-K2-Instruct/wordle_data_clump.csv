2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and avoids rare ones to quickly narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of common vowels and consonants, and no repeated letters. Classic choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is often considered optimal because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S = x (not in word)
- L = ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A, T, E = x (all not in word)

So we know:
- The secret word has form _ L _ _ _
- Letters S, A, T, E are not in the word
- We still need to test common consonants and remaining vowels (O, I, U, Y, etc.)

Good next guess would test new common letters while keeping L in position 2. Word like ""FLICK"" would test F, I, C, K - but C/K might be too similar. ""BLOOM"" tests B, O, O, M - but repeats O. ""CLIMB"" tests C, I, M, B - also good. 

""FLING"" is better because:
- Tests F, I, N, G
- No repeated letters
- Keeps L in position 2
- Uses common remaining letters
- Short simple word structure

Feedback summary so far:

1. SLATE → _ L _ _ _ ; letters out: S, A, T, E
2. FLING → _ L _ _ _ ; letters out: F, I, N, G
3. PLUMB → P(-) L(✓) U(✓) M(✓) B(x)

Interpretation:
- Pattern still _ L _ _ _
- L fixed at position 2
- Letters now **in** the word (but wrong positions): P, U, M
- Letter B is **not** in the word
- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, H, K, O, R, V, W, Y
- Vowels still possible: O, U (U already found, but can appear again? Yes, feedback only said U is in word, not how many)
- Need to rearrange P, U, M into remaining positions 1, 4, 5, possibly with new letters

Possible arrangements:
- P must go in 1, 4, or 5
- U must go in 1, 4, or 5
- M must go in 1, 4, or 5
- No repeats unless word has doubles (unlikely with these letters)

Let's test possible combinations:
- P _ L U M → PLUM_ but B was out and we've tried PLUMB
- _ L U M P → CLUMP (C not yet tested)
- _ L P U M → ?
- M _ L U P → ?
- U _ L P M → ?

Best candidate that uses P, U, M, L and a new untested letter: ""CLUMP"" uses C (new), L (fixed), U, M, P (in word but wrong positions). Checks:
- C: new letter
- L: fixed at 2 ✓
- U: known in word, now testing at 3
- M: known in word, now testing at 4
- P: known in word, now testing at 5

But wait, PLUMB had P at position 1 as ""-"", so P can't be at 1. CLUMP would put P at 5. Let's verify:
- CLUMP would test:
  - C (new)
  - L (position 2 ✓)
  - U (in word, new position 3)
  - M (in word, new position 4)
  - P (in word, new position 5)

This seems valid as it tests new positions for known letters and introduces C.

Alternative: ""ULCER"" but uses E (already out), and R not yet tested but seems less optimal.

Hence, CLUMP is the best next guess.
