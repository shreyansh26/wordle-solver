Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. Good starting words in Wordle typically contain common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word. Popular starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ROATE (covers R, O, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two high-frequency consonants (C, R, N). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

   - D and T are not in the word

So the pattern now looks like: C A _ E _
Letters we still need to find: positions 3 and 5.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, N, D, T.

Common remaining consonants that fit: L, S, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
We also need to consider whether the remaining positions use any other vowels (I, U, O) or Y.

Possible 5-letter words matching C A _ E _:
- C A M E L  – L is common, fits pattern
- C A P E R  – but R is excluded
- C A G E Y  – Y can end a word
- C A P E D  – D is excluded
- C A V E S  – S is allowed, but 5-letter word needs to end with a valid letter
- C A K E D  – D excluded
- C A K E S  – S is allowed
- C A M E O  – O could be last letter
- C A P E S  – S is allowed
- C A G E D  – D excluded

So the pattern now looks like: C A _ E _
Letters we still need to find: positions 3 and 5.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, N, D, T.

Common remaining consonants that fit: L, S, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
We also need to consider whether the remaining positions use any other vowels (I, U, O) or Y.

Possible 5-letter words matching C A _ E _:
- C A M E L  – L is common, fits pattern
- C A P E R  – but R is excluded
- C A G E Y  – Y can end a word
- C A P E D  – D is excluded
- C A V E S  – S is allowed, but 5-letter word needs to end with a valid letter
- C A K E D  – D excluded
- C A K E S  – S is allowed
- C A M E O  – O could be last letter
- C A P E S  – S is allowed
- C A G E D  – D excluded
- C A B E R  – R excluded

From these, CAMEL, CAGES, CAMEO, CAKES, CAPES all fit the pattern and letter restrictions. 
CAMEL seems like a strong candidate as it uses common letters and hasn't tested M or L yet.

Let’s go with CAMEL.

Letters already ruled out entirely: R, N, D, T, L.

Remaining unused common consonants (and vowels) that could fit in position 5:
Common letters left: S, Y, K, P, B, G, etc.

Possible 5-letter words starting with “CAME” and ending with a single letter not in our exclusion list:
- CAMES – plural of “came” (a lead strip in stained glass) – but S is often plural
- CAMEO – but O is a vowel we haven’t tested
- CAMEK – not a valid word
- CAMEB – not a valid word
- CAMEG – not a valid word

Valid dictionary words starting with “CAME” and ending with a single letter:
- CAMES (valid, though rare)
- CAMEO (valid)

CAMEO is a more common word so it’s the safer choice.
