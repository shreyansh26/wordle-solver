For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that includes common letters and maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers common consonants and vowels
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - covers many vowels
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers common consonants and a vowel
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) - covers common letters

Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter) (✓)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word, but not necessarily in 5th position (✓)

So, we now know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains: E (not necessarily at position 5), R (fixed at position 2)
- Does not contain: C, A, N

Letters we have ruled out: C, A, N. We know E appears at least once, and R is in position 2. We need to find a word that fits _ R _ _ _ and has E somewhere (but not necessarily at the end).

Good letters to try next: T, L, S, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I'll consider words like:
- TREAD (but E is at position 4, which is okay since E is in word but position unknown)
- FRESH (but H is generally less common)
- BREAD (B, R, E, A, D - but A is ruled out)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common)
- PRIZE (P, R, I, Z, E - but Z is less common)
- GREAT (G, R, E, A, T - but A is ruled out)

Actually, since we know positions 1,3,4,5 are unknown but E is somewhere and A is out, let's think of words with R in 2nd and E elsewhere.

Possible candidates:
- TREND (T, R, E, N, D - but N is ruled out)
- FREAK (F, R, E, A, K - A is out)
- PRESS (P, R, E, S, S - but S is repeated)
- DRECK (D, R, E, C, K - C is out)
- BREAD (A is out)

Looking for better options:
- BRIEF (B, R, I, E, F)
- FRIED (F, R, I, E, D)
- TRIBE (T, R, I, B, E) - but E is at 5th position which is allowed since feedback only said E is in word, not position
- GRIPE (G, R, I, P, E)

Among these, ""TRIBE"" seems good as it includes common letters (T, I, B) and E at the end is acceptable since feedback only confirmed E is in the word (not its position).

But actually, since E could be anywhere, let's go with ""TRIBE"" as it covers T, I, B as new letters and confirms E's position.

Wait, ""TRIBE"" has E at position 5, and we know from CRANE that E is in the word (could be position 5 or elsewhere). Since CRANE had E at 5 and got ✓, that means E is in word but position 5 is uncertain (since ✓ means letter is in word, not necessarily correct position). Actually, looking back at the feedback legend:
- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
So in CRANE, E(✓) means E is in the word AND in the 5th position. So the word ends with E.

Therefore, pattern is: _ R _ _ E and contains no C, A, N.

Now possible words:
- T R _ _ E:
  - TRIPE (but P is okay)
  - TRIBE
  - TRUCE (but C is out)
  - TROPE (but O is okay)
- F R _ _ E:
  - FROZE (Z is less common)
  - FRISE (but S is okay)
- B R _ _ E:
  - BRISE (but S is okay)
  - BRIDE (D is okay)
  - BRIEF
  - BRINE (but N is out)
- D R _ _ E:
  - DRIBE (not a word)
  - DRIVE (V is okay)
  - DROVE (O is okay)

""TRIBE"" seems like the best choice here as it uses T, I, B which are all new letters and common.

But actually, ""TRIBE"" has E at position 5, which matches our deduction that E must be at position 5 (from CRANE's E(✓)). So ""TRIBE"" fits perfectly.

However, let me re-examine: CRANE's E(✓) means E is in position 5. So word ends with E.

Thus, pattern is definitely _ R _ _ E, with no C, A, N.

Good candidates:
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E)
- PRIDE (P, R, I, D, E)
- TRIBE (T, R, I, B, E)
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E)
- FRISE (but S is okay, but less common)

""BRIDE"" seems good as B, I, D are common letters.

After checking, ""BRIDE"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- _ R _ _ E pattern
- No C, A, N
- Includes E at 5th position (confirmed by ✓ in CRANE)
- Good mix of new letters (B, I, D)
</think>

From the feedback:
- R is correctly in position 2
- E is correctly in position 5
- C, A, N are not in the word

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E

A good next guess would be ""BRIDE"" as it fits this pattern and introduces new common letters (B, I, D).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R I _ E  (R, I, E are all in the correct positions)
2. Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, B, D

So every remaining blank (positions 1 and 4) must be filled by a letter that is:
- Not already excluded (C, A, N, B, D)
- Does not repeat any letter already placed (R, I, E)

We need to pick two more distinct letters.

Common consonants still available: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Common vowels still available: O, U (since A is out, E and I are already used)

Position 4 is the fourth letter of a five-letter word and is often a consonant, so let’s concentrate on consonants first.

Likely candidates to test:
- F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T

We want a valid English word that fits the pattern  _ R I _ E.

Possible words:
- FRISE (but S is okay, but FRISE is a bit obscure)  
- GRIPE (G, P)  
- PRISE (P, S)  
- TRIPE (T, P)  
- GRIME (but M is okay, but GRIME has G, M)  
- PRIZE (but Z is okay, but PRIZE has P, Z)  
- TRITE (but T is repeated)  
- WRITE (W, T)  
- FRIZE (but Z is okay, but FRIZE is obscure)  

The most common and valid words are:

Among these, TRIPE is a fairly common word, and uses T and P which are both common letters that give good coverage.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,PRIME,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that includes common letters and maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers common consonants and vowels
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - covers many vowels
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) - covers common consonants and a vowel
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) - covers common letters

Among these, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E) that appear frequently in 5-letter words. This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter) (✓)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word, but not necessarily in 5th position (✓)

So, we now know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains: E (not necessarily at position 5), R (fixed at position 2)
- Does not contain: C, A, N

Letters we have ruled out: C, A, N. We know E appears at least once, and R is in position 2. We need to find a word that fits _ R _ _ _ and has E somewhere (but not necessarily at the end).

Good letters to try next: T, L, S, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I'll consider words like:
- TREAD (but E is at position 4, which is okay since E is in word but position unknown)
- FRESH (but H is generally less common)
- BREAD (B, R, E, A, D - but A is ruled out)
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E - but V is less common)
- PRIZE (P, R, I, Z, E - but Z is less common)
- GREAT (G, R, E, A, T - but A is ruled out)

Actually, since we know positions 1,3,4,5 are unknown but E is somewhere and A is out, let's think of words with R in 2nd and E elsewhere.

Possible candidates:
- TREND (T, R, E, N, D - but N is ruled out)
- FREAK (F, R, E, A, K - A is out)
- PRESS (P, R, E, S, S - but S is repeated)
- DRECK (D, R, E, C, K - C is out)
- BREAD (A is out)

Looking for better options:
- BRIEF (B, R, I, E, F)
- FRIED (F, R, I, E, D)
- TRIBE (T, R, I, B, E) - but E is at 5th position which is allowed since feedback only said E is in word, not position
- GRIPE (G, R, I, P, E)

Among these, ""TRIBE"" seems good as it includes common letters (T, I, B) and E at the end is acceptable since feedback only confirmed E is in the word (not its position).

But actually, since E could be anywhere, let's go with ""TRIBE"" as it covers T, I, B as new letters and confirms E's position.

Wait, ""TRIBE"" has E at position 5, and we know from CRANE that E is in the word (could be position 5 or elsewhere). Since CRANE had E at 5 and got ✓, that means E is in word but position 5 is uncertain (since ✓ means letter is in word, not necessarily correct position). Actually, looking back at the feedback legend:
- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
So in CRANE, E(✓) means E is in the word AND in the 5th position. So the word ends with E.

Therefore, pattern is: _ R _ _ E and contains no C, A, N.

Now possible words:
- T R _ _ E:
  - TRIPE (but P is okay)
  - TRIBE
  - TRUCE (but C is out)
  - TROPE (but O is okay)
- F R _ _ E:
  - FROZE (Z is less common)
  - FRISE (but S is okay)
- B R _ _ E:
  - BRISE (but S is okay)
  - BRIDE (D is okay)
  - BRIEF
  - BRINE (but N is out)
- D R _ _ E:
  - DRIBE (not a word)
  - DRIVE (V is okay)
  - DROVE (O is okay)

""TRIBE"" seems like the best choice here as it uses T, I, B which are all new letters and common.

But actually, ""TRIBE"" has E at position 5, which matches our deduction that E must be at position 5 (from CRANE's E(✓)). So ""TRIBE"" fits perfectly.

However, let me re-examine: CRANE's E(✓) means E is in position 5. So word ends with E.

Thus, pattern is definitely _ R _ _ E, with no C, A, N.

Good candidates:
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E)
- PRIDE (P, R, I, D, E)
- TRIBE (T, R, I, B, E)
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E)
- FRISE (but S is okay, but less common)

""BRIDE"" seems good as B, I, D are common letters.

After checking, ""BRIDE"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints:
- _ R _ _ E pattern
- No C, A, N
- Includes E at 5th position (confirmed by ✓ in CRANE)
- Good mix of new letters (B, I, D)From the feedback:
- R is correctly in position 2
- E is correctly in position 5
- C, A, N are not in the word

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E

A good next guess would be ""BRIDE"" as it fits this pattern and introduces new common letters (B, I, D).

Common consonants still available: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Common vowels still available: O, U (since A is out, E and I are already used)

Likely candidates to test:
- F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T

We want a valid English word that fits the pattern  _ R I _ E.

- P is in the word but is NOT in position 4; therefore P must be in position 1.

So the word must be P R I _ E, but we already know the fourth letter cannot be any of C, A, N, B, D, T.

What single letter in position 4 yields a valid 5-letter word when combined with P R I _ E?

Remaining alphabet (excluding the disallowed letters):
F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid English words:
- PRIZE  (Z in position 4)
- PRIME  (M in position 4)
- PRISE  (S in position 4)  – but S wasn’t tested yet; we only ruled out T, C, A, N…
- PRIDE, PRIME, PRIZE, PRIME, PRIME… but PRIME (M) looks good.

Wait, let me double-check PRIME:
- P R I M E
- M has not been ruled out (only B, C, D, N, T, A are out)
- The word fits _ R I _ E and introduces M as a new letter.

PRIZE also works, but Z is less common; PRIME is more common.

Therefore, PRIME is the logical next guess.
