For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information
3. Contains vowels and common consonants

Some good starting words based on letter frequency analysis are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These all contain the very common letter 'E' and a mix of other high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

The feedback from SLATE shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word at all. This is very useful information - it eliminates a large portion of possible words.

Now I need to choose a new word that:
1. Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, or E
2. Uses other common letters that weren't in the first guess
3. Still covers a good range of high-frequency letters

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters in English, strong candidates would include: R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Some good options:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) - covers 5 new common letters
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) - no S/L/A/T/E
- DUMPY (D, U, M, P, Y) - good consonant coverage

Extracting the new information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P, U, N  
- Letters confirmed in the word:
  – R (somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2)
  – O (in position 2)
  – D (somewhere, but not in position 5)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ _ _  
with R and D still to place, and no other letters from the banned list allowed.

Remaining common letters that are still legal:
B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R and D.

We need a 5-letter word that
1. Has O in position 2,
2. Contains exactly one R and one D,
3. Places R in positions 3, 4, or 5,
4. Places D somewhere other than position 5,
5. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible forms:

- _ O D R _
- _ O _ R D
- _ O _ D R
- _ O D _ R
- _ O R _ D  (but D is not allowed in slot 5 so we’d need another letter after D)

Let’s try words that fit these forms using still-allowed letters.

Example real words:
- BORDY  (B, O, R, D, Y) – but Y is allowed
- FORDY  (F, O, R, D, Y)
- GORDY  (G, O, R, D, Y)

All of these:
- Have O in position 2,
- Include R and D,
- Do not use any banned letters,
- Place R and D in allowed positions.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,WORDY,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Has no repeating letters to maximize information
3. Contains vowels and common consonants

Some good starting words based on letter frequency analysis are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

These all contain the very common letter 'E' and a mix of other high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from SLATE shows that none of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word at all. This is very useful information - it eliminates a large portion of possible words.

Now I need to choose a new word that:
1. Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, or E
2. Uses other common letters that weren't in the first guess
3. Still covers a good range of high-frequency letters

Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters in English, strong candidates would include: R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y.

Some good options:
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D) - covers 5 new common letters
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P) - no S/L/A/T/E
- DUMPY (D, U, M, P, Y) - good consonant coverage

I'll go with ""CRIMP"" as it uses C, R, I, M, P - all common letters that weren't in the first guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P
- Letter R is in the word, but it is NOT in the second position (because feedback for CRIMP showed R in the wrong position: R(-) means it exists but is not in slot 2).

That leaves us with the following available letters:
B D F G H J K N O Q U V W X Y Z plus the known letter R

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Must contain R exactly once
2. Must not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P
3. Must place R in a position other than #2

Good remaining high-frequency letters: R, O, U, N, D, G, H, K, Y etc.

Let’s pick a word that places R in a new spot and uses other still-possible common letters.  
A few possibilities:
- ROUND – but O and U are allowed, N and D are allowed, R is allowed and put in position 1
- HOUND – H, O, U, N, D
- GROUN – G, R, O, U, N (but R is in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong)

ROUND keeps R in the first position (new spot) and uses common letters.

So I choose ROUND.
