For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter coverage to maximize information gain. The optimal starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are: ""ADIEU"" (but uses U which is less common), ""SLATE"" (good consonants and vowels), ""CRANE"" (good letters), or ""AROSE"" (covers A,O,S,E,R). 

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- L, T are common consonants
- A, E are the two most common vowels
- This combination gives good coverage across different letter positions

This should help me quickly identify which of these very common letters are in the word and their correct positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is not in the word (x)  
- L is not in the word (x)  
- A is in the word and is correctly placed at position 3 (✓)  
- T is not in the word (x)  
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- Letters to avoid so far: S, L, T, E  
- We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (R, N, C, B, etc.)

A good second guess should:
1. Keep A fixed in position 3  
2. Introduce new, high-value letters not yet tested  
3. Still aim to cover common letters

I like “CRANK”:
- It keeps A in the third slot  
- Tests C, R, N, K (all frequent, none ruled out)  
- Uses no disallowed letters

Other options like “BRAIN”, “DRAIN”, or “GRAIN” would also work, but I’ll go with “CRANK” first.

Current known facts:
- Pattern: _ R A _ _  (R is 2nd, A is 3rd)
- N is in the word but not in position 4
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, C, K

We still need to test vowels we haven’t placed yet (I, O, U) and other common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P).  
The word structure forces N to appear somewhere other than position 4, so the only other possible slot is the 5th (…R A _ N doesn’t fit because N can’t be 4th).  
However, I’d rather not lock N into position 5 yet; first let’s test more letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the R A sequence in positions 2–3
2. Try new consonants in positions 1, 4, 5
3. Try any remaining vowels in positions 1, 4, 5

A word that satisfies this and uses all-new letters is “BRAIN”:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter coverage to maximize information gain. The optimal starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are: ""ADIEU"" (but uses U which is less common), ""SLATE"" (good consonants and vowels), ""CRANE"" (good letters), or ""AROSE"" (covers A,O,S,E,R). 

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid first choice because:
- S is very common in English words
- L, T are common consonants
- A, E are the two most common vowels
- This combination gives good coverage across different letter positions

This should help me quickly identify which of these very common letters are in the word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is not in the word (x)  
- L is not in the word (x)  
- A is in the word and is correctly placed at position 3 (✓)  
- T is not in the word (x)  
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- Letters to avoid so far: S, L, T, E  
- We still need to test other vowels (I, O, U) and common consonants (R, N, C, B, etc.)

A good second guess should:
1. Keep A fixed in position 3  
2. Introduce new, high-value letters not yet tested  
3. Still aim to cover common letters

I like “CRANK”:
- It keeps A in the third slot  
- Tests C, R, N, K (all frequent, none ruled out)  
- Uses no disallowed letters

Other options like “BRAIN”, “DRAIN”, or “GRAIN” would also work, but I’ll go with “CRANK” first.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current known facts:
- Pattern: _ R A _ _  (R is 2nd, A is 3rd)
- N is in the word but not in position 4
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, C, K

We still need to test vowels we haven’t placed yet (I, O, U) and other common consonants (B, D, F, G, H, M, P).  
The word structure forces N to appear somewhere other than position 4, so the only other possible slot is the 5th (…R A _ N doesn’t fit because N can’t be 4th).  
However, I’d rather not lock N into position 5 yet; first let’s test more letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the R A sequence in positions 2–3
2. Try new consonants in positions 1, 4, 5
3. Try any remaining vowels in positions 1, 4, 5

A word that satisfies this and uses all-new letters is “BRAIN”:
- B (new consonant) at 1
- R (fixed) at 2
- A (fixed) at 3
- I (new vowel) at 4
- N (known in word) at 5

This uses B, I, N, all of which are either new or known to be in the word, and avoids every disallowed letter.
