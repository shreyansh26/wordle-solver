For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some top choices include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- SOARE (covers S, O, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T). This gives good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).

So the secret word is _ _ A _ _ with none of S, L, T, E appearing anywhere.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and avoids S, L, T, E. Good consonants to test now are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc. Vowels left to test are I, O, U.

I’ll choose ""BRAIN"":
- B is common and not yet ruled out.
- R is a high-frequency consonant.
- A is fixed in the 3rd slot.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some top choices include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- SOARE (covers S, O, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T). This gives good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).

So the secret word is _ _ A _ _ with none of S, L, T, E appearing anywhere.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that has A in the 3rd position and avoids S, L, T, E. Good consonants to test now are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc. Vowels left to test are I, O, U.

I’ll choose ""BRAIN"":
- B is common and not yet ruled out.
- R is a high-frequency consonant.
- A is fixed in the 3rd slot.
- I is another vowel to test.
- N is another common consonant.

This gives us the pattern B R A I N, satisfying all constraints.

Letters still allowed for the first position: any consonant not in the eliminated set.

We need a 5-letter word that ends in R A N K and starts with a consonant that is NOT S, L, T, B, C.

Look at common first letters for _ R A N K:
- FRANK (F not eliminated)
- DRANK (D not eliminated)
- PRANK (P not eliminated)
- GRANK (not a word)
- TRANK (T is eliminated)
- HRANK (H not eliminated, but not a word)

Among these, FRANK is the most common English word. Check: 
- F not used yet.
- R A N K positions are fixed by feedback.

Thus, the only remaining possibility is FRANK.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the secret word is of the form _ R A N K and the first letter is NOT any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, B, I, C, F.

Still-available consonants for that first slot include:
D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and the vowels, but we know the first letter must be a consonant to make a real word).

Common 5-letter English words ending in RANK:
- DRANK
- PRANK
- GRANK (not a valid word)
- HRANK (not a valid word)
- etc.

DRANK is the only valid English word left that fits the pattern and uses an allowed first letter (D not yet ruled out).

Therefore, DRANK is the logical next guess.

We now have a locked-in pattern:

- Positions 2-5: R A N K  
- Position 1 must be a consonant that has **not** yet been tested.

Letters already eliminated for position 1: S, L, T, E, B, I, C, F, D.

Still-allowed consonants that can start an English word ending in RANK:
G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

The only common dictionary word among these is **PRANK**, but P was never eliminated, and we haven’t tried it yet. However, “prank” is already a word we considered earlier and skipped because we started with D first. Since P hasn’t been ruled out, P R A N K is the next candidate.

Therefore, the remaining valid guess is PRANK.
