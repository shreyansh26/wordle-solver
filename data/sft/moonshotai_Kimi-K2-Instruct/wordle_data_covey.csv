For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, particularly vowels and common consonants. A good strategy is to use words that contain the most frequently used letters in English without repeating any letters.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - which helps identify vowels in the word
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English words

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains the letters O and E (each exactly once so far).
- The word does not contain A, R, S.
- O is not in slot 3, E is not in slot 5.

We still have 6 consonants and 3 vowels to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y plus the confirmed O and E.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in different positions (since we know they’re in the word but not yet where).
2. Uses fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, S.

A strong candidate is “ointment” but that’s 8 letters. Among 5-letter words, “input” and “open” are too short. The word “pivot” has O in slot 2 and uses P, I, V, T (all untested). However, V is slightly less common. “point” uses P, I, N, T and places O in slot 2. Another good option is “opine” but it repeats E in slot 5 which we know is invalid. “temple” is 6 letters. The best 5-letter word fitting all constraints seems to be “point”.

But we must make sure O is not in slot 3 (already satisfied) and E must appear somewhere not slot 5, so let’s include E too. Actually, “point” lacks E. A better word is “opine” but invalidates E in slot 5. Next option: “poet” – too short. “pelon” – obscure. Actually, let’s use “toney”: T, O, N, E, Y – places O in slot 2, E in slot 4, and tests T, N, Y.

But Y is a semi-vowel; perhaps use “toner” but R is ruled out. “doney” – uncommon. “hotel” – has T, E, L plus O, H. That uses O in slot 2, E in slot 4, and introduces H, L, T – all common and untested.

Therefore, “hotel” is a strong next guess.

We still need three unique letters (positions 1, 3, 5) chosen from the remaining untested, common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

To maximize information, pick a word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.  
- Uses three new, common letters for positions 1, 3, 5.  

A good candidate is “COVER”:  
- C, V, R.  
But R is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “WOKEN” – but K is acceptable, yet N is common.  
However, O and E slots are fixed, so “WOKEN” has O in 2, E in 4, but N is in 5, and we need position 3.

- 2nd letter: O (fixed)  
- 3rd letter: any allowed  
- 4th letter: E (fixed)  
- 5th letter: any allowed  

A common word fitting this is “BONEY” – but Y is semi-vowel, and N is tested here.  
“CONED” – but D is okay, N is okay.  
“CODEN” – not a word.  
“PONED” – not standard.  
“DOGIE” – but I is okay.  
“MOXIE” – but X is less common.

A safe, common word: “CONES” – but S is ruled out.  
“COVEN” – V is okay, N okay.  
“COVEN” is valid.

Let me check: C, O, V, E, N.  
- O is in position 2 (matches).  
- E is in position 4 (matches).  
- C, V, N are new, common letters.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,covey,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, particularly vowels and common consonants. A good strategy is to use words that contain the most frequently used letters in English without repeating any letters.

Some excellent starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) - which helps identify vowels in the word
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English words

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is somewhere in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains the letters O and E (each exactly once so far).
- The word does not contain A, R, S.
- O is not in slot 3, E is not in slot 5.

We still have 6 consonants and 3 vowels to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y plus the confirmed O and E.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in different positions (since we know they’re in the word but not yet where).
2. Uses fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, S.

A strong candidate is “ointment” but that’s 8 letters. Among 5-letter words, “input” and “open” are too short. The word “pivot” has O in slot 2 and uses P, I, V, T (all untested). However, V is slightly less common. “point” uses P, I, N, T and places O in slot 2. Another good option is “opine” but it repeats E in slot 5 which we know is invalid. “temple” is 6 letters. The best 5-letter word fitting all constraints seems to be “point”.

But we must make sure O is not in slot 3 (already satisfied) and E must appear somewhere not slot 5, so let’s include E too. Actually, “point” lacks E. A better word is “opine” but invalidates E in slot 5. Next option: “poet” – too short. “pelon” – obscure. Actually, let’s use “toney”: T, O, N, E, Y – places O in slot 2, E in slot 4, and tests T, N, Y.

But Y is a semi-vowel; perhaps use “toner” but R is ruled out. “doney” – uncommon. “hotel” – has T, E, L plus O, H. That uses O in slot 2, E in slot 4, and introduces H, L, T – all common and untested.

Therefore, “hotel” is a strong next guess.

<guess>hotel</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: hotel -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
→ Contains O and E  
→ Does NOT contain A, R, S  

Guess 2: hotel  
H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(x)  

Combining everything:
- O is in the word and is now known to be in position 2.  
- E is in the word and is now known to be in position 4.  
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, H, T, L.  

Filled-in pattern so far:  
_ O _ E _

We still need three unique letters (positions 1, 3, 5) chosen from the remaining untested, common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

To maximize information, pick a word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.  
- Uses three new, common letters for positions 1, 3, 5.  

A good candidate is “COVER”:  
- C, V, R.  
But R is already ruled out.

Next candidate: “WOKEN” – but K is acceptable, yet N is common.  
However, O and E slots are fixed, so “WOKEN” has O in 2, E in 4, but N is in 5, and we need position 3.

Actually, let’s construct directly:  
Pattern: _ O _ E _

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting:  
- 1st letter: any allowed (B, C, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y)  
- 2nd letter: O (fixed)  
- 3rd letter: any allowed  
- 4th letter: E (fixed)  
- 5th letter: any allowed  

A common word fitting this is “BONEY” – but Y is semi-vowel, and N is tested here.  
“CONED” – but D is okay, N is okay.  
“CODEN” – not a word.  
“PONED” – not standard.  
“DOGIE” – but I is okay.  
“MOXIE” – but X is less common.

A safe, common word: “CONES” – but S is ruled out.  
“COVEN” – V is okay, N okay.  
“COVEN” is valid.

Let me check: C, O, V, E, N.  
- O is in position 2 (matches).  
- E is in position 4 (matches).  
- C, V, N are new, common letters.  
- No ruled-out letters are used.  

Therefore, “COVEN” is a strong third guess.

Let’s list everything we know so far.

From the three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   – Not in word: A, R, S

2. hotel → H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(x)

   – Not in word: H, T, L

3. COVEN → C(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓) N(x)
   – C is in position 1 (✓)
   – O is in position 2 (✓) – already known
   – V is in position 3 (✓)
   – E is in position 4 (✓) – already known
   – N is not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is:

The only slot left is position 5.  
Letters that have been ruled out: A, R, S, H, T, L, N  
Letters already used in the word: C, O, V, E
