For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting hits. A good starting strategy is to use a word that includes frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular first guess because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. It also has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all **not in the word** (x).
- Only E is in the word but **wrong position** (-).

So we need a word that:
1. Definitely contains E.
2. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S.
3. Uses fresh letters to test new consonants and vowels.

Common letters left to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, Y, M, H, etc.
A good option is “UNSET” because:
- It includes E (already known to be in the word).
- It avoids R, A, I, S.
- Tests new vowels U and consonants N, S, T. (Wait—S was already ruled out by the feedback! I need a different choice.)

Let me pick “TUNED” instead:
- Contains E (required).
- Avoids R, A, I, S.
- Tests T, U, N, D.

Alternative: “MUTED” also fits, but “TUNED” feels slightly more common. I’ll go with TUNED.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: R, A, I, S, T, U, N, D, G, L, B.
2. Letter E IS in the word and is correctly placed at position 5 (✓).
3. Letter O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-); it must therefore appear in positions 1, 2 or 3.

So the word ends in …E and must contain at least one O elsewhere.

Available letters (those never ruled out): C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, which we already know is present).

To test new positions for O and probe fresh consonants, I’ll choose a word that:
- keeps E fixed in slot 5,
- places O in slot 1 (a new position for it),
- uses three fresh consonants from the still-allowed set.

A convenient choice is “CHOKE”:
- C, H, K have not been tested yet.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting hits. A good starting strategy is to use a word that includes frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. The word ""RAISE"" is a popular first guess because it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. It also has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, I, S are all **not in the word** (x).
- Only E is in the word but **wrong position** (-).

So we need a word that:
1. Definitely contains E.
2. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S.
3. Uses fresh letters to test new consonants and vowels.

Common letters left to try: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, Y, M, H, etc.
A good option is “UNSET” because:
- It includes E (already known to be in the word).
- It avoids R, A, I, S.
- Tests new vowels U and consonants N, S, T. (Wait—S was already ruled out by the feedback! I need a different choice.)

Let me pick “TUNED” instead:
- Contains E (required).
- Avoids R, A, I, S.
- Tests T, U, N, D.

Alternative: “MUTED” also fits, but “TUNED” feels slightly more common. I’ll go with TUNED.

- The **only** letter confirmed in the word is E, and it is in the **fifth (last) position**.

Therefore the word looks like:
_ _ _ _ E

We have 5 tries left.  
We need three consonants and one vowel in positions 1-4, using only letters not yet eliminated.

Letters still available (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The vowels left: O (since A, I, U have been ruled out).  
We can try to use one O plus consonants.

A balanced word that uses a mix of fresh common consonants and the remaining vowel O is “GLOBE”:
- G, L, B are common consonants not yet tested.
- O is the only fresh vowel left besides E.
- It ends in E, satisfying the final position requirement.

From the latest feedback:
- C, O, and E are now all confirmed as correct letters in their exact positions.
- So the word is C O _ _ E.
- Letters ruled out entirely so far: R, A, I, S, T, U, N, D, G, L, B, H, K, M, P.

Still-allowed letters (unused and not eliminated):
F, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two consonants to occupy positions 3 and 4.  
Among the remaining letters, the two most common are F and V.

A valid, common-looking word that fits is:
C O F V E  → but that’s not an English word.
C O V F E  → not a word.
C O F F E  → not 5 letters.
C O V E Y  → spelled COVEY (but ends in Y).
C O Z E N  → ends in N (already ruled out).
C O V E R  → ends in R (already ruled out).
C O P E R  → P and R ruled out.
C O M E T  → M and T ruled out.
C O V E T  → T ruled out.
C O V E N  → N ruled out.

Actually, scanning the small set of remaining letters, the only remaining possible English 5-letter word that matches C O _ _ E and uses only still-allowed letters is:

C O V E Y  (but Y is available and not yet ruled out; COVEY is a valid word meaning a small flock of birds).

However, the feedback from COMPE already showed E is **not** in position 4 (-), so position 4 must be a consonant and E must stay in position 5. Therefore:

C O _ _ E  
Positions 3 and 4 must be filled from {F, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

There is exactly one valid English word left: C O Z E Y.  
“Cozey” is an alternate spelling of “cozy” and is listed in some dictionaries as valid.

But let’s double-check:
- COZEY – 5 letters, ends in EY, and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

So I will submit COZEY.
