For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with a high frequency of common letters. This helps eliminate many possibilities early. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words. 

A good starter word should cover as many of these common letters as possible. Some popular choices include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

- I is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position.
- The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So far we have:

Guess 1: ARISE
Feedback: A(x) R(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Meaning: I is in the word but NOT in position 3; A, R, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: POINT
Feedback: P(x) O(✓) I(-) N(x) T(-)
Meaning: 
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I is still in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 5; it could be in 1, 3 or 4.
- P and N are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Position 2 is definitely O.
- Word must contain I and T somewhere, but:
  - I ≠ position 3
  - T ≠ position 5
- Letters NOT used so far that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known I, O, T.

Let’s build a word:
- Position 2 = O.
- We need to place I and T in remaining positions 1,3,4,5 while respecting:
  - I ≠ 3
  - T ≠ 5

Possible placements that satisfy both:
Option A:
- I in 1, T in 3 or 4.
Option B:
- I in 4, T in 3 (since T can’t be 5 and I can’t be 3).  

We should also pick fresh consonants for the other spots to maximize information. Let’s try Option B:
- Position 1: let’s try L (common, not yet ruled out)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: let’s try K (fresh consonant)

That gives the word LOTIK. However, LOTIK does not appear to be a valid English word. Let’s try another combination.

Option A:
- I in 1
- O in 2
- T in 3
- Need two more consonants. Let’s use L and M.

That would be IOTLM – not a word.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: H

That forms the word BOTIH – again, not valid.

Better word that fits:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
But I cannot be in position 3 (from earlier feedback: I ≠ 3).

Alternative:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I → invalid (I ≠ 3)
So must avoid I in 3.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T

Hmm, let’s pick a real one: “LOTIC” is a real word (meaning relating to flowing water), but it has I in position 4 and T in position 3. That satisfies all constraints:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from feedback)

- O in 2
- T in 3
- Need two more consonants. Let’s use L and M.

That would be IOTLM – not a word.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: H

That forms the word BOTIH – again, not valid.

Better word that fits:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
But I cannot be in position 3 (from earlier feedback: I ≠ 3).

Alternative:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I → invalid (I ≠ 3)
So must avoid I in 3.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

Forms the valid word COTIL – but “COTIL” is not an English word.

Hmm, let’s pick a real one: “LOTIC” is a real word (meaning relating to flowing water), but it has I in position 4 and T in position 3. That satisfies all constraints:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from feedback)
- I is in position 4 (not 3)
- T is in position 3 (not 5)
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

LOTIC is valid. Let’s go with that.

From the latest feedback:

LOTIC → L(x) O(✓) T(✓) I(✓) C(x)

This tells us:

1. O is in the word and already in the correct position (2nd letter).
2. T is in the word and already in the correct position (3rd letter).
3. I is in the word and already in the correct position (4th letter).
4. L and C are not in the word.

So the known pattern is: _ O T I _

We need to find the first and fifth letters. From all previous feedback, letters already ruled out are: A, R, S, E, P, N, L, C.

Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters (first and fifth) that haven't been used yet. A common strategy is to pick high-frequency letters first. Among the remaining, D, B, G, H, K, M, U are relatively high-frequency.

Let's try D and H: possible words could be ""DOTIH"" (invalid), ""HOTID"" (invalid), etc. 

Looking for valid English words that fit _ O T I _:

- HOTIC (invalid)
- BOTIC (invalid)
- GOTIM (invalid)
- MOTIF (M, O, T, I, F)
  - M hasn't been used
  - F hasn't been used
  - Valid English word.

So ""MOTIF"" fits the pattern perfectly: _ O T I F, with M as the first letter and F as the fifth, both letters not yet ruled out.
