Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that incorporates common letters to maximize information gained. I'll use a word with frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words, particularly focusing on vowels and common consonants.

Good starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A balanced word that covers these bases well is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which of these letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, and O are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word ends with “S” ( _ _ _ _ S )
2. Word contains “E” somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
3. Word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Consonants we haven’t ruled out yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: E, I, U, Y (since A and O are out)

A good next guess would:
- Keep S in position 5
- Use E somewhere else
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried.

A strong candidate is “TIDES”:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains E in position 4 (which we know is wrong, but we’re just testing letters)
- Introduces T, I, D which haven’t been tested
- Uses all valid letters based on previous feedback

Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

1. Guess 1: AROSE  
   Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
   – Word ends in S.  
   – Word contains E, but not in position 5.  
   – Letters A, R, O are NOT in the word.

2. Guess 2: TIDES  
   Feedback: T(-) I(x) D(x) E(-) S(-)  
   – S was already locked in position 5, so the dash there just confirms it’s correct.  
   – E is NOT in position 4.  
   – T, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
- Contains: E (somewhere in positions 1-3)  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, D, T  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E, U, Y (since A, O, I already excluded)

We want a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A simple structure is E _ _ _ S or _ E _ _ S or _ _ E _ S.

Let’s pick one that introduces a cluster of new common consonants.  
Example: FLEES – but E appears twice and we don’t know if double-E is allowed.  
Safer single-E choice: N E X U S – but X and U are a bit less common; also U appears in position 4, which is fine since we haven’t eliminated U.

Another: M E L O S – but O is eliminated.  
Another: C H E E S – double E again.

How about “LUMES”?  
U is okay (not eliminated), L, M, E, S all okay. Pattern: L U M E S.  
But E is in position 4, which we know is NOT allowed (from TIDES feedback).

Next: “MULES”  
M U L E S – E is in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BUNES” – U is okay, B, N, E, S okay, E in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BENES” – E is in 2 (allowed) and 4 (invalid), same issue.

Next: “PULES” – same E-4 problem.

Let’s try E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E, U, Y

Example: B E G U S – but G and U are okay, yet we’d prefer more common letters.

Simpler: N E W S plus another letter – wait, 5 letters.  
N E W S ?  
Need another letter – N E W S + ? – doesn’t fit.

Let’s just pick: B E N C H – ends in H, not S.

Let’s go with “LENSE” – no, ends in E.

How about “M E N S A” – but A eliminated and ends in A.

Let’s try “P U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

Hmm, we need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
Pick common consonants: E B L U S – but U is okay, B, L okay.  
“EBLUS” – no, not a valid word.

Valid English word: “E B O L S” – O eliminated.

Valid word: “E M U L S” – no, not a word.

Let’s use a word list in head: common 5-letter words ending in S with E somewhere 1-3, avoiding eliminated letters.

“F U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

“C O M E S” – O eliminated.

“G U E S S” – S twice, but E is in 2 (allowed), word ends in S, no eliminated letters.  
“GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S.  
– G: not eliminated.  
– U: not eliminated.  
– E: allowed in position 2.  
– S: allowed twice, and position 5 is correct.  
Only eliminated letters we have are A, R, O, I, D, T – none are in GUESS.

So “GUESS” satisfies all constraints.

Vowels left: E, I, U, Y (since A and O are out)

A good next guess would:
- Keep S in position 5
- Use E somewhere else
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried.

A strong candidate is “TIDES”:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains E in position 4 (which we know is wrong, but we’re just testing letters)
- Introduces T, I, D which haven’t been tested
- Uses all valid letters based on previous feedback

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: TIDES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) D(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

1. Guess 1: AROSE  
   Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
   – Word ends in S.  
   – Word contains E, but not in position 5.  
   – Letters A, R, O are NOT in the word.

2. Guess 2: TIDES  
   Feedback: T(-) I(x) D(x) E(-) S(-)  
   – S was already locked in position 5, so the dash there just confirms it’s correct.  
   – E is NOT in position 4.  
   – T, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
- Contains: E (somewhere in positions 1-3)  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, D, T  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E, U, Y (since A, O, I already excluded)

We want a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A simple structure is E _ _ _ S or _ E _ _ S or _ _ E _ S.

Let’s pick one that introduces a cluster of new common consonants.  
Example: FLEES – but E appears twice and we don’t know if double-E is allowed.  
Safer single-E choice: N E X U S – but X and U are a bit less common; also U appears in position 4, which is fine since we haven’t eliminated U.

Another: M E L O S – but O is eliminated.  
Another: C H E E S – double E again.

How about “LUMES”?  
U is okay (not eliminated), L, M, E, S all okay. Pattern: L U M E S.  
But E is in position 4, which we know is NOT allowed (from TIDES feedback).

Next: “MULES”  
M U L E S – E is in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BUNES” – U is okay, B, N, E, S okay, E in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BENES” – E is in 2 (allowed) and 4 (invalid), same issue.

Next: “PULES” – same E-4 problem.

Let’s try E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E, U, Y

Example: B E G U S – but G and U are okay, yet we’d prefer more common letters.

Simpler: N E W S plus another letter – wait, 5 letters.  
N E W S ?  
Need another letter – N E W S + ? – doesn’t fit.

Let’s just pick: B E N C H – ends in H, not S.

Let’s go with “LENSE” – no, ends in E.

How about “M E N S A” – but A eliminated and ends in A.

Let’s try “P U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

Hmm, we need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
Pick common consonants: E B L U S – but U is okay, B, L okay.  
“EBLUS” – no, not a valid word.

Valid English word: “E B O L S” – O eliminated.

Valid word: “E M U L S” – no, not a word.

Let’s use a word list in head: common 5-letter words ending in S with E somewhere 1-3, avoiding eliminated letters.

“F U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

“C O M E S” – O eliminated.

“G U E S S” – S twice, but E is in 2 (allowed), word ends in S, no eliminated letters.  
“GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S.  
– G: not eliminated.  
– U: not eliminated.  
– E: allowed in position 2.  
– S: allowed twice, and position 5 is correct.  
Only eliminated letters we have are A, R, O, I, D, T – none are in GUESS.

So “GUESS” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s lock that in.

Let’s parse the newest feedback:

Guess 3: GUESS  
Feedback: G(x) U(x) E(✓) S(✓) S(-)

Breaking it down:
- Position 1: G is NOT in the word.
- Position 2: U is NOT in the word.
- Position 3: E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓).
- Position 4: S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  This is the second time we’ve seen an S in the word (earlier feedback told us position 5 is definitely S, so this S in position 4 must be a second S somewhere else).
- Position 5: S is correct (✓) – but we already knew that from Guess 1.

So far:
- Word ends with S (position 5).
- Word has E in position 3: _ _ E _ S
- Word must contain at least one more S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (because the last feedback shows an S in position 4 is present but in the wrong place, and we also have the final S).
- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (already placed at position 3), Y (since A, O, I, U are out)

We need a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Has E in position 3.
3. Contains at least one more S in positions 1, 2, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ S (S in position 1 and 5)
- _ S E _ S (S in position 2 and 5)
- _ _ E S S (S in position 4 and 5, which would make the second S adjacent to the final S)

Let’s test these:

1. S _ E _ S:  
   Example: S P E C S – but C is allowed, but is “SPECS” valid? Yes, it’s a word.  
   Check letters: S, P, E, C, S – none are in the eliminated list.

2. _ S E _ S:  
   Example: C S E N S – but “CSENS” is not a word.  
   Example: P S E U S – U eliminated.  
   Hard to find English words like this.

3. _ _ E S S:  
   Example: L E S S – too short.  
   Example: C L E S S – not a word.  
   Example: B L E S S – yes, “BLESS” is a word.  
   Letters: B, L, E, S, S – none eliminated.

Between “SPECS” and “BLESS,” both fit, but “BLESS” has the double S at the end, which directly satisfies the S in position 4 being present (as the fourth letter is S and the fifth is also S). This seems more straightforward.

Let’s confirm:  
Pattern: _ _ E S S  
Letters: B, L, E, S, S – all allowed.  
No eliminated letters (A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U absent).  
This is a valid guess.

- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, D, T  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E, U, Y (since A, O, I already excluded)

We want a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A simple structure is E _ _ _ S or _ E _ _ S or _ _ E _ S.

Let’s pick one that introduces a cluster of new common consonants.  
Example: FLEES – but E appears twice and we don’t know if double-E is allowed.  
Safer single-E choice: N E X U S – but X and U are a bit less common; also U appears in position 4, which is fine since we haven’t eliminated U.

Another: M E L O S – but O is eliminated.  
Another: C H E E S – double E again.

How about “LUMES”?  
U is okay (not eliminated), L, M, E, S all okay. Pattern: L U M E S.

Next: “MULES”  
M U L E S – E is in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BUNES” – U is okay, B, N, E, S okay, E in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BENES” – E is in 2 (allowed) and 4 (invalid), same issue.

Next: “PULES” – same E-4 problem.

Let’s try E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E, U, Y

Example: B E G U S – but G and U are okay, yet we’d prefer more common letters.

Simpler: N E W S plus another letter – wait, 5 letters.  
N E W S ?  
Need another letter – N E W S + ? – doesn’t fit.

Let’s just pick: B E N C H – ends in H, not S.

Let’s go with “LENSE” – no, ends in E.

How about “M E N S A” – but A eliminated and ends in A.

Let’s try “P U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

Hmm, we need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
Pick common consonants: E B L U S – but U is okay, B, L okay.  
“EBLUS” – no, not a valid word.

Valid English word: “E B O L S” – O eliminated.

Valid word: “E M U L S” – no, not a word.

Let’s use a word list in head: common 5-letter words ending in S with E somewhere 1-3, avoiding eliminated letters.

“F U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

“C O M E S” – O eliminated.

“G U E S S” – S twice, but E is in 2 (allowed), word ends in S, no eliminated letters.  
“GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S.  
– G: not eliminated.

– E: allowed in position 2.  
– S: allowed twice, and position 5 is correct.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s parse the newest feedback:

Guess 3: GUESS  
Feedback: G(x) U(x) E(✓) S(✓) S(-)

Breaking it down:
- Position 1: G is NOT in the word.
- Position 2: U is NOT in the word.
- Position 3: E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓).
- Position 4: S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  This is the second time we’ve seen an S in the word (earlier feedback told us position 5 is definitely S, so this S in position 4 must be a second S somewhere else).
- Position 5: S is correct (✓) – but we already knew that from Guess 1.

So far:
- Word ends with S (position 5).
- Word has E in position 3: _ _ E _ S
- Word must contain at least one more S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (because the last feedback shows an S in position 4 is present but in the wrong place, and we also have the final S).
- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (already placed at position 3), Y (since A, O, I, U are out)

We need a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Has E in position 3.
3. Contains at least one more S in positions 1, 2, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ S (S in position 1 and 5)
- _ S E _ S (S in position 2 and 5)
- _ _ E S S (S in position 4 and 5, which would make the second S adjacent to the final S)

Let’s test these:

1. S _ E _ S:  
   Example: S P E C S – but C is allowed, but is “SPECS” valid? Yes, it’s a word.  
   Check letters: S, P, E, C, S – none are in the eliminated list.

2. _ S E _ S:  
   Example: C S E N S – but “CSENS” is not a word.  
   Example: P S E U S – U eliminated.  
   Hard to find English words like this.

3. _ _ E S S:  
   Example: L E S S – too short.  
   Example: C L E S S – not a word.  
   Example: B L E S S – yes, “BLESS” is a word.  
   Letters: B, L, E, S, S – none eliminated.

Between “SPECS” and “BLESS,” both fit, but “BLESS” has the double S at the end, which directly satisfies the S in position 4 being present (as the fourth letter is S and the fifth is also S). This seems more straightforward.

Let’s confirm:  
Pattern: _ _ E S S  
Letters: B, L, E, S, S – all allowed.  
No eliminated letters (A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U absent).  
This is a valid guess.

Let’s extract every constraint we now have:

1. Word ends with S (position 5 confirmed ✓).
2. E is fixed in position 3: _ _ E _ S.
3. There is at least one more S somewhere else (because position 4’s S in BLESS was marked ✓, meaning it is present somewhere, and we already have position 5 locked).
4. Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U, B, L.

Remaining consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: Y (only vowel left, since A, E, I, O, U are covered or ruled out)

We therefore need a 5-letter word with pattern:
_ _ E _ S

and containing at least one more S in positions 1 or 2.

The only remaining vowel is Y, so positions 1 and 2 must each be a consonant or possibly S.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ S   (S in 1 and 5)
- _ S E _ S   (S in 2 and 5)

Also, since we have no vowel left except Y, and Y is the only vowel sound we can insert, the middle letter could use Y, but E is already fixed in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words ending in …ES with an S at the start or second place, using only allowed letters.

Examples:
- S K E E S – but E is already fixed in 3; we’d need _ _ E _ S and we can’t have E in 4 (from TIDES feedback: E not in 4). So E in 4 is invalid. Therefore S K E E S is invalid because it places E in 4.
- S P E C S – C allowed? Yes, C not ruled out. Letters: S P E C S. All letters (S, P, E, C) are not in the eliminated list.  

Check constraints:
- Ends in S ✓
- E in 3 ✓
- Contains S in 1 and 5 (so second S present) ✓
- No eliminated letters (A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U, B, L absent) ✓

Therefore SPECS fits perfectly.

I'll use a word with frequently appearing letters in English 5-letter words, particularly focusing on vowels and common consonants.

Good starting words typically contain:
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A balanced word that covers these bases well is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which of these letters are in the secret word.

2. Word contains “E” somewhere, but not in the 5th position.
3. Word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Consonants we haven’t ruled out yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: E, I, U, Y (since A and O are out)

A good next guess would:
- Keep S in position 5
- Use E somewhere else
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried.

A strong candidate is “TIDES”:
- Ends with S ✓
- Contains E in position 4 (which we know is wrong, but we’re just testing letters)
- Introduces T, I, D which haven’t been tested

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

1. Guess 1: AROSE  
   Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)  
   – Word ends in S.  
   – Word contains E, but not in position 5.  
   – Letters A, R, O are NOT in the word.

2. Guess 2: TIDES  
   Feedback: T(-) I(x) D(x) E(-) S(-)  
   – S was already locked in position 5, so the dash there just confirms it’s correct.  
   – E is NOT in position 4.  
   – T, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ S  
- Contains: E (somewhere in positions 1-3)  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, I, D, T  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so it must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E, U, Y (since A, O, I already excluded)

We want a word that:
- Ends in S.  
- Contains E in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A simple structure is E _ _ _ S or _ E _ _ S or _ _ E _ S.

Let’s pick one that introduces a cluster of new common consonants.  
Example: FLEES – but E appears twice and we don’t know if double-E is allowed.  
Safer single-E choice: N E X U S – but X and U are a bit less common; also U appears in position 4, which is fine since we haven’t eliminated U.

Another: M E L O S – but O is eliminated.  
Another: C H E E S – double E again.

How about “LUMES”?  
U is okay (not eliminated), L, M, E, S all okay. Pattern: L U M E S.  
But E is in position 4, which we know is NOT allowed (from TIDES feedback).

Next: “MULES”  
M U L E S – E is in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BUNES” – U is okay, B, N, E, S okay, E in position 4 (invalid).

Next: “BENES” – E is in 2 (allowed) and 4 (invalid), same issue.

Next: “PULES” – same E-4 problem.

Let’s try E in position 2: _ E _ _ S  
Consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: E, U, Y

Example: B E G U S – but G and U are okay, yet we’d prefer more common letters.

Simpler: N E W S plus another letter – wait, 5 letters.  
N E W S ?  
Need another letter – N E W S + ? – doesn’t fit.

Let’s just pick: B E N C H – ends in H, not S.

Let’s go with “LENSE” – no, ends in E.

How about “M E N S A” – but A eliminated and ends in A.

Let’s try “P U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

Hmm, we need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Try E in position 1: E _ _ _ S  
Pick common consonants: E B L U S – but U is okay, B, L okay.  
“EBLUS” – no, not a valid word.

Valid English word: “E B O L S” – O eliminated.

Valid word: “E M U L S” – no, not a word.

Let’s use a word list in head: common 5-letter words ending in S with E somewhere 1-3, avoiding eliminated letters.

“F U N E S” – E in 4 (invalid).

“C O M E S” – O eliminated.

“G U E S S” – S twice, but E is in 2 (allowed), word ends in S, no eliminated letters.  
“GUESS” – G, U, E, S, S.  
– G: not eliminated.  
– U: not eliminated.  
– E: allowed in position 2.  
– S: allowed twice, and position 5 is correct.  
Only eliminated letters we have are A, R, O, I, D, T – none are in GUESS.

So “GUESS” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s lock that in.

- Position 4: S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  This is the second time we’ve seen an S in the word (earlier feedback told us position 5 is definitely S, so this S in position 4 must be a second S somewhere else).
- Position 5: S is correct (✓) – but we already knew that from Guess 1.

So far:
- Word ends with S (position 5).
- Word has E in position 3: _ _ E _ S
- Word must contain at least one more S somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (because the last feedback shows an S in position 4 is present but in the wrong place, and we also have the final S).
- Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (already placed at position 3), Y (since A, O, I, U are out)

We need a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Has E in position 3.
3. Contains at least one more S in positions 1, 2, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not eliminated.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ S (S in position 1 and 5)
- _ S E _ S (S in position 2 and 5)
- _ _ E S S (S in position 4 and 5, which would make the second S adjacent to the final S)

Let’s test these:

1. S _ E _ S:  
   Example: S P E C S – but C is allowed, but is “SPECS” valid? Yes, it’s a word.  
   Check letters: S, P, E, C, S – none are in the eliminated list.

2. _ S E _ S:  
   Example: C S E N S – but “CSENS” is not a word.  
   Example: P S E U S – U eliminated.  
   Hard to find English words like this.

3. _ _ E S S:  
   Example: L E S S – too short.  
   Example: C L E S S – not a word.  
   Example: B L E S S – yes, “BLESS” is a word.  
   Letters: B, L, E, S, S – none eliminated.

Between “SPECS” and “BLESS,” both fit, but “BLESS” has the double S at the end, which directly satisfies the S in position 4 being present (as the fourth letter is S and the fifth is also S). This seems more straightforward.

Let’s confirm:  
Pattern: _ _ E S S  
Letters: B, L, E, S, S – all allowed.  
No eliminated letters (A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U absent).  
This is a valid guess.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s extract every constraint we now have:

1. Word ends with S (position 5 confirmed ✓).
2. E is fixed in position 3: _ _ E _ S.
3. There is at least one more S somewhere else (because position 4’s S in BLESS was marked ✓, meaning it is present somewhere, and we already have position 5 locked).
4. Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U, B, L.

Remaining consonants: C, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: Y (only vowel left, since A, E, I, O, U are covered or ruled out)

We therefore need a 5-letter word with pattern:
_ _ E _ S

and containing at least one more S in positions 1 or 2.

The only remaining vowel is Y, so positions 1 and 2 must each be a consonant or possibly S.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ S   (S in 1 and 5)
- _ S E _ S   (S in 2 and 5)

Also, since we have no vowel left except Y, and Y is the only vowel sound we can insert, the middle letter could use Y, but E is already fixed in position 3.

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words ending in …ES with an S at the start or second place, using only allowed letters.

Examples:
- S K E E S – but E is already fixed in 3; we’d need _ _ E _ S and we can’t have E in 4 (from TIDES feedback: E not in 4). So E in 4 is invalid. Therefore S K E E S is invalid because it places E in 4.
- S P E C S – C allowed? Yes, C not ruled out. Letters: S P E C S. All letters (S, P, E, C) are not in the eliminated list.  

Check constraints:
- Ends in S ✓
- E in 3 ✓
- Contains S in 1 and 5 (so second S present) ✓
- No eliminated letters (A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U, B, L absent) ✓

Therefore SPECS fits perfectly.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Position 5 must be S (✓ from Guess 1).
2. Position 3 must be E (✓ from Guess 3/4/5).
   So the pattern is _ _ E _ S.
3. We also know there is at least one more S somewhere else (because every guess that had an S in positions 1-4 received a “-” or “✓”, indicating its presence in the word, and position 5 is already S).
4. Eliminated letters so far:
   A, R, O, I, D, T, G, U, B, L, P, C
   (from the “x” marks in prior feedback).
5. Remaining usable consonants: F, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
6. Only usable vowel left: Y (all others are ruled out or already placed).

Therefore the two unknown positions (1 and 2) must be filled with consonants or S, and position 4 must be a consonant or S.  We need at least one additional S besides the final S.

The simplest pattern that satisfies:
- An S in position 1 and position 5: S _ E _ S
- The blank positions (2 and 4) must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants.

Looking at the remaining list, the commonest single consonants we haven’t tried are F, H, K, M, N, W, Y.  
Pick position 2 and 4 to be different allowed consonants, and keep an S at the start and end.

The only remaining English word that fits:
S H E E S  – but E in position 4 is not allowed (TIDES feedback said E cannot be in 4).
S Y E N S – not a word.
S N E W S – N, E, W, S all still allowed, pattern S _ E _ S, letters not eliminated.

So “SNEWS” is a valid English plural form of “snew” (archaic past of snow, but more importantly it’s in Scrabble/Wordle lexicons).
