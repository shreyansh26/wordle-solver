- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information from the feedback. I'll use the word ""CRANE"" because it includes several of the most frequent letters in English (E, A, R, N, C) and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1 → word starts with C
- R, A, N are not in the word at all
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
1. C _ _ _ _ (first letter fixed)
2. No R, A, N anywhere
3. E appears somewhere in positions 1-4

Next word should:
- Keep C in position 1
- Include E in a new position (2-4)
- Avoid R, A, N
- Use other common consonants to test additional letters

Good candidate: “CLOVE”
- Starts with C
- Places E in position 4 (new spot)
- Uses L, O, V (all untested, common letters)
- Avoids R, A, N

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. First letter is C (fixed in position 1).
2. Letters R, A, N, L, O, V are NOT in the word at all.
3. Letter E is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4 or 5.

Remaining usable letters (common ones):
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, T, W, Y, …  
Vowels: E, I, U (E must be used somewhere in positions 2-4)

Structure so far:
C _ _ _ _
E must appear in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try a word that
- puts E in position 2,
- uses other common consonants,
- avoids all eliminated letters.

Candidate: C E P T I
Check letters: C, E, P, T, I — none have been ruled out except for positions of E.

So: “CEPTI” is invalid (not a real word).

Next candidate: “CHEST”
- C in position 1 ✓
- E in position 2 (new spot) ✓
- H, S, T not yet eliminated ✓
- Letters used: C, H, E, S, T — none are R,A,N,L,O,V ✓

This is a valid English word and fits all constraints.
