Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to efficiently narrow down possibilities. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are often in 5-letter words
3. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
4. It's a valid English word

This should provide good coverage for the first guess and help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Interpreting the new feedback:

1. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
   - U, N, D are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D.

Positions still possible:
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from AROSE and SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND).

We need a valid 5-letter word using:
- Exactly the letters O and S (each appears once).
- Three new letters from the remaining pool (avoiding the banned set).
- Putting O and S in allowed spots.

Looking at remaining common letters, good candidates are: T, L, C, M, P, I, Y, G, etc.

Let’s build a word that places O and S in new safe positions and fills the rest with fresh common letters. One convenient word is STOIC:
- S (position 2) – allowed (not 1 or 4).
- T (position 1) – new, common.
- O (position 3) – allowed (not 2 or 3, but wait: AROSE said O not in 3, and SOUND said O not in 2, so 1,4,5 for O are allowed; 3 is still banned from AROSE). Oops, that would put O in 3, which is still blocked.

Let’s correct that: O must avoid positions 2 and 3, so possible positions for O are 1, 4, 5. S must avoid positions 1 and 4, so possible positions for S are 2, 3, 5.

How about a word where O is in position 4 and S is in position 2, plus three new letters? Example: TOSYL? Not a common word.

Instead, let’s try FOCUS (but U is banned). Next, try a word like COILS (but O would be in position 2 again). 

A better candidate is POSIT:
- P, I, T are new.
- O in position 2 is still banned (from SOUND).

Another candidate: MOIST:
- O in position 3 is banned (from AROSE).

Another candidate: STOIC fails (O in 3). 

Next candidate: CLOPS (but P, L, C are new; check positions: O in 3 is banned).

Next candidate: SOOTY – but O appears twice and Y might be less common.

Better is MOSSY – but S is used twice and N is banned.

Let’s try a simpler word: POSIT doesn’t work. 

How about SPIKY – but I is ok, K is ok, but O is missing.

Need to include both O and S exactly once each.

Correct word must contain O and S, each once, in allowed positions.

Let’s list possible positions:
O can be 1,4,5
S can be 2,3,5

Pick O in 4, S in 2: _ S _ O _
Fill remaining with new letters: T, I, L, etc.

Word: T S I O _ → need one more letter. TSIO? Not valid.

Alternative: O in 1, S in 3: O _ S _ _
Candidate: OSTIA – but A is banned.

O in 1, S in 2: O S _ _ _
Candidate: OSTIN – but N is banned.

O in 1, S in 5: O _ _ _ S
Candidate: OPIKS – but P,I,K,S ok; is OPIKS valid? No.

O in 4, S in 5: _ _ _ O S
Candidate: C L A M O S – too long.

Another: MISO? – too short.

Another: FISCO – F,I,S,C,O; valid word FISCO?
FISCO is not a standard 5-letter word.

Another: CISCO – C,I,S,C,O; valid? CISCO is.

But C,I,S,C,O – has C twice, S once, O in 4, S in 3; C,I ok; valid word CISCO.

But does it contain S and O once? Yes, but C twice is ok.

But we need new letters, C is ok.

So CISCO:
- C: new, ok
- I: new, ok
- S: in 3 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5; 3 is allowed)
- C: ok
- O: in 4 – allowed (O can be in 1,4,5; 4 is allowed)

And no banned letters.

Thus, CISCO is a valid guess.

- O in position 2 is still banned (from SOUND).

Another candidate: MOIST:
- O in position 3 is banned (from AROSE).

Another candidate: STOIC fails (O in 3). 

Next candidate: CLOPS (but P, L, C are new; check positions: O in 3 is banned).

Next candidate: SOOTY – but O appears twice and Y might be less common.

Better is MOSSY – but S is used twice and N is banned.

Let’s try a simpler word: POSIT doesn’t work. 

How about SPIKY – but I is ok, K is ok, but O is missing.

Need to include both O and S exactly once each.

Correct word must contain O and S, each once, in allowed positions.

Let’s list possible positions:
O can be 1,4,5
S can be 2,3,5

Pick O in 4, S in 2: _ S _ O _
Fill remaining with new letters: T, I, L, etc.

Word: T S I O _ → need one more letter. TSIO? Not valid.

Alternative: O in 1, S in 3: O _ S _ _

Candidate: PISOS – S appears twice.

Another: DISCO – D banned.

Another: MISO? – too short.

Another: FISCO – F,I,S,C,O; valid word FISCO?
FISCO is not a standard 5-letter word.

Another: CISCO – C,I,S,C,O; valid? CISCO is.

But C,I,S,C,O – has C twice, S once, O in 4, S in 3; C,I ok; valid word CISCO.

But does it contain S and O once? Yes, but C twice is ok.

But we need new letters, C is ok.

So CISCO:
- C: new, ok
- I: new, ok
- S: in 3 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5; 3 is allowed)
- C: ok
- O: in 4 – allowed (O can be in 1,4,5; 4 is allowed)

And no banned letters.

Thus, CISCO is a valid guess.

<think>Re-checking:
Letters banned: A, R, E, U, N, D.
Letters in word: O, S.
Positions:
O must be 1,4,5.
S must be 2,3,5.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,KIOSK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to efficiently narrow down possibilities. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are often in 5-letter words
3. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
4. It's a valid English word

This should provide good coverage for the first guess and help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (✓).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- Contains O and S somewhere, but O ≠ 3rd and S ≠ 4th.

Next, we want a word that:
- Keeps O and S but places them in new positions.
- Uses fresh letters (avoiding A, R, E).
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, Y, etc.

Candidate pattern: _ _ _ _ _
We know O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
We know S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try a word that places O in 2nd and S in 1st, plus three new letters, e.g., SOUND:
- S (1st), O (2nd), U, N, D – none contain A, R, E, and all are common.

Check: SOUND is 5 letters, valid, and meets constraints.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the new feedback:

1. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
   - U, N, D are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D.

Positions still possible:
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from AROSE and SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND).

We need a valid 5-letter word using:
- Exactly the letters O and S (each appears once).
- Three new letters from the remaining pool (avoiding the banned set).
- Putting O and S in allowed spots.

Looking at remaining common letters, good candidates are: T, L, C, M, P, I, Y, G, etc.

Let’s build a word that places O and S in new safe positions and fills the rest with fresh common letters. One convenient word is STOIC:
- S (position 2) – allowed (not 1 or 4).
- T (position 1) – new, common.
- O (position 3) – allowed (not 2 or 3, but wait: AROSE said O not in 3, and SOUND said O not in 2, so 1,4,5 for O are allowed; 3 is still banned from AROSE). Oops, that would put O in 3, which is still blocked.

Let’s correct that: O must avoid positions 2 and 3, so possible positions for O are 1, 4, 5. S must avoid positions 1 and 4, so possible positions for S are 2, 3, 5.

How about a word where O is in position 4 and S is in position 2, plus three new letters? Example: TOSYL? Not a common word.

Instead, let’s try FOCUS (but U is banned). Next, try a word like COILS (but O would be in position 2 again). 

A better candidate is POSIT:
- P, I, T are new.
- O in position 2 is still banned (from SOUND).

Another candidate: MOIST:
- O in position 3 is banned (from AROSE).

Another candidate: STOIC fails (O in 3). 

Next candidate: CLOPS (but P, L, C are new; check positions: O in 3 is banned).

Next candidate: SOOTY – but O appears twice and Y might be less common.

Better is MOSSY – but S is used twice and N is banned.

Let’s try a simpler word: POSIT doesn’t work. 

How about SPIKY – but I is ok, K is ok, but O is missing.

So CISCO:
- C: new, ok

- S: in 3 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5; 3 is allowed)
- C: ok

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,KIOSK,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the amount of information gained from the feedback. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters to efficiently narrow down possibilities. 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are often in 5-letter words
3. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
4. It's a valid English word

This should provide good coverage for the first guess and help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (✓).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- Contains O and S somewhere, but O ≠ 3rd and S ≠ 4th.

Next, we want a word that:
- Keeps O and S but places them in new positions.
- Uses fresh letters (avoiding A, R, E).
- Uses other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, Y, etc.

Candidate pattern: _ _ _ _ _
We know O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
We know S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try a word that places O in 2nd and S in 1st, plus three new letters, e.g., SOUND:
- S (1st), O (2nd), U, N, D – none contain A, R, E, and all are common.

Check: SOUND is 5 letters, valid, and meets constraints.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the new feedback:

1. SOUND → S(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word, but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but NOT in position 2.
   - U, N, D are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D.

Positions still possible:
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from AROSE and SOUND).
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND).

We need a valid 5-letter word using:
- Exactly the letters O and S (each appears once).
- Three new letters from the remaining pool (avoiding the banned set).
- Putting O and S in allowed spots.

Looking at remaining common letters, good candidates are: T, L, C, M, P, I, Y, G, etc.

Let’s build a word that places O and S in new safe positions and fills the rest with fresh common letters. One convenient word is STOIC:
- S (position 2) – allowed (not 1 or 4).
- T (position 1) – new, common.
- O (position 3) – allowed (not 2 or 3, but wait: AROSE said O not in 3, and SOUND said O not in 2, so 1,4,5 for O are allowed; 3 is still banned from AROSE). Oops, that would put O in 3, which is still blocked.

Let’s correct that: O must avoid positions 2 and 3, so possible positions for O are 1, 4, 5. S must avoid positions 1 and 4, so possible positions for S are 2, 3, 5.

How about a word where O is in position 4 and S is in position 2, plus three new letters? Example: TOSYL? Not a common word.

Instead, let’s try FOCUS (but U is banned). Next, try a word like COILS (but O would be in position 2 again). 

A better candidate is POSIT:
- P, I, T are new.
- O in position 2 is still banned (from SOUND).

Another candidate: MOIST:
- O in position 3 is banned (from AROSE).

Another candidate: STOIC fails (O in 3). 

Next candidate: CLOPS (but P, L, C are new; check positions: O in 3 is banned).

Next candidate: SOOTY – but O appears twice and Y might be less common.

Better is MOSSY – but S is used twice and N is banned.

Let’s try a simpler word: POSIT doesn’t work. 

How about SPIKY – but I is ok, K is ok, but O is missing.

Need to include both O and S exactly once each.

Correct word must contain O and S, each once, in allowed positions.

Let’s list possible positions:
O can be 1,4,5
S can be 2,3,5

Pick O in 4, S in 2: _ S _ O _
Fill remaining with new letters: T, I, L, etc.

Word: T S I O _ → need one more letter. TSIO? Not valid.

Alternative: O in 1, S in 3: O _ S _ _
Candidate: OSTIA – but A is banned.

O in 1, S in 2: O S _ _ _
Candidate: OSTIN – but N is banned.

O in 1, S in 5: O _ _ _ S
Candidate: OPIKS – but P,I,K,S ok; is OPIKS valid? No.

O in 4, S in 5: _ _ _ O S
Candidate: C L A M O S – too long.

Another: MISO? – too short.

Another: FISCO – F,I,S,C,O; valid word FISCO?
FISCO is not a standard 5-letter word.

Another: CISCO – C,I,S,C,O; valid? CISCO is.

But C,I,S,C,O – has C twice, S once, O in 4, S in 3; C,I ok; valid word CISCO.

But does it contain S and O once? Yes, but C twice is ok.

But we need new letters, C is ok.

So CISCO:
- C: new, ok
- I: new, ok
- S: in 3 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5; 3 is allowed)
- C: ok
- O: in 4 – allowed (O can be in 1,4,5; 4 is allowed)

And no banned letters.

Thus, CISCO is a valid guess.

From the new feedback:

- K is in the word and in the correct 1st position.
- I is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- L is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- S is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Current knowledge:
Letters not in word: A, R, E, U, N, D, C, L
Letters confirmed at specific positions:
1st: K
2nd: I
Letters confirmed in word (but unknown positions): O, S

Positions still open:
3rd, 4th, 5th (but 4th cannot be O and 5th cannot be S)

We need a word that:
- Starts with K I _ _ _
- Contains O and S exactly once each (since they appeared only once so far)
- O must be in positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 4)
- S must be in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 5)
- Uses only letters not banned: can use B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, S

Let's list valid placements:
- O can be 3 or 5
- S can be 3 or 4
But they must fit together in KI _ _ _

Case 1: O in 3 → K I O _ _

Need 5th letter not banned and not used yet: can be B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Valid word: K I O S _ → KIOSK is a word (KIOSK uses K twice, but K is allowed)

Check: KIOSK
- Letters: K, I, O, S, K - K appears twice, which is allowed
- Positions:
  - K 1st ✓
  - I 2nd ✓
  - O in 3rd (allowed)
  - S in 4th (allowed)
  - K in 5th (no restriction, K is allowed)
- All letters are allowed
- No banned letters

This fits all constraints.

Case 2: O in 5 → K I _ _ O
Then S must be in 3 or 4
- S in 3 → K I S _ O → need 4th letter: K I S B O, K I S G O, etc. - no valid word
- S in 4 → K I _ S O → K I B S O, K I G S O, etc. - no valid word

Thus, the only valid word fitting constraints is KIOSK.
