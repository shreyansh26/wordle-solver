For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains commonly used letters in English and gives good coverage to narrow down possibilities. A strategic first guess often includes vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, N, L.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is excellent because it has:
- S: very common starting consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

Another good option is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels right away and the common letters R and S, giving me good information about the secret word's composition.

- R placed at position 2 → but we just saw O is at 2.  
Wait, P R O W L has R at position 2, which is still forbidden (feedback said R not in position 2 in AROSE).  

Try R in position 3:  
_ O R _ _  
Candidate: F O R T Y – but Y is uncommon and T not yet excluded.  
Candidate: M O R P H – H not excluded.  
But to maximize new information, let’s pick a word with R in position 3 and bring in new consonants.

Good choice: F O R G E – but E is excluded.  
Next: M O R A L – A is excluded.  
Next: C O R K Y – K allowed, letters C, K, Y.

Let’s choose C O R K Y.

Wait, let’s double-check allowed letters for CORKY:  
C, O, R, K, Y – none of them are in the excluded list.  
R is in position 3, which has never been ruled out.  
This will test C, K, Y and keep O in place.

So the guess will be CORKY.

Consolidating all feedback:

1. Letters **not** in the word: A, S, E, U, N, D, K, Y  
2. Fixed positions:  
   - Position 1: C (✓)  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
3. R is **in** the word, but **not** in positions 1, 2, 3.  
   ⇒ R must be in position 4 or 5.  
4. Pattern so far: C O _ _ _ with R in slot 4 or 5.

Possible remaining consonants (not yet eliminated):  
B, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

Vowels left: I (only vowel not yet used or eliminated).

Let’s test R in position 4 first: C O _ R _  
- Need a valid 3rd letter and a 5th letter from the allowed set.  

List of valid 5-letter words matching C O _ R _ with allowed letters:
COPRA – but A is excluded.  
COBRA – A is excluded.  
COGAR – A excluded.  
COMER – E excluded.  
CORER – E excluded.  
COHOR – not a word.  
COBIR – not a word.  
COGIR – not a word.  
COLIR – not a word.  
COMIR – not a word.  
COPIR – not a word.  
COVIR – not a word.  
COWRY – Y excluded.  
COFIR – not a word.  
COHIR – not a word.  

None of these seem valid.  
Next: R in position 5: C O _ _ R  
Valid words?  
COPPR – no.  
COGAR – no.  
COMAR – no.  
COBAR – no.  
COVIR – no.  
COHIR – no.  
COPIR – no.  
COGIR – no.  
COLAR – no.  
COGAR – no.  

Actually, let’s check a dictionary or word list for C O _ _ R.  
Valid ones: COLOR, COWER, COMER (but E excluded), COPER (E excluded).  
COLOR: L and R – allowed.  
COWER: W, E – E excluded.  

So COLOR seems valid: C, O, L, O, R – O is allowed to repeat? The original word is 5-letter but no restriction on repeats stated. However, O is already in position 2, and no info against another O.  

But let’s check: letters in COLOR: C, O, L, O, R.  
- C and O already fixed in positions 1 and 2.  
- L is allowed.  
- R is allowed (position 5).  

COLOR fits: C O L O R.  

But is there a word without repeating O? COPRA is invalid (A excluded), COBRA (A excluded).  
Next valid word: C O W R Y – but Y excluded.  

Another approach: C O _ _ _ with R in 4 or 5, and test new consonants.  
Let’s try C O L D R – D excluded.  
C O M E R – E excluded.  
C O M B R – not a word.  
C O H E R – E excluded.  

It seems the most plausible valid word fitting constraints is COLOR.  

However, let’s verify:  
- C(✓) O(✓) L O R.  
- R is in position 5, which is allowed (not excluded).  
- All letters C, O, L, R are not in the excluded list.  
- No excluded letters used.  

Thus, COLOR is the best next guess.
