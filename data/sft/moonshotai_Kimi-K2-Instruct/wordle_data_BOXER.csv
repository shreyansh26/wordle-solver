For the first guess in Wordle, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- SLANT
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is very commonly recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter and consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter and consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in positions where they're likely to appear.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all “x”: not in the word at all.
- E is “-”: the letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the word:
- Contains an E somewhere other than the last spot.
- Definitely does not contain S, L, A, T.

I want a new guess that uses none of S, L, A, T, keeps E somewhere else, and still hits other common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is “CRANE”:
- C, R, N aren’t eliminated yet.
- Uses A, but A was already excluded.  
Oops—ignore that.

Next: “BRINE”
- B, R, I, N, E  
- None of S, L, A, T appear.  
- E is in the 5th spot, but the feedback said E isn’t in the 5th spot.  
Oops again.

Shift E earlier: “NERDY”
N, E, R, D, Y – none of S, L, A, T, and E is in position 2 instead of 5.  
But “NERDY” is a bit vowel-light.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- SLANT
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

Looking at these, ""SLATE"" is very commonly recommended because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter and consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter and consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in positions where they're likely to appear.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all “x”: not in the word at all.
- E is “-”: the letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the word:
- Contains an E somewhere other than the last spot.
- Definitely does not contain S, L, A, T.

I want a new guess that uses none of S, L, A, T, keeps E somewhere else, and still hits other common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is “CRANE”:
- C, R, N aren’t eliminated yet.
- Uses A, but A was already excluded.  
Oops—ignore that.

Next: “BRINE”
- B, R, I, N, E  
- None of S, L, A, T appear.  
- E is in the 5th spot, but the feedback said E isn’t in the 5th spot.  
Oops again.

Shift E earlier: “NERDY”
N, E, R, D, Y – none of S, L, A, T, and E is in position 2 instead of 5.  
But “NERDY” is a bit vowel-light.

Let’s try “DINER”
D, I, N, E, R – good common consonants, includes E not in the 5th spot, avoids S, L, A, T.

Guess 3: HOMER -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. Forbidden letters (not in the word): S, L, A, T, D, I, N, H, M  
   Remaining alphabet: B, C, F, G, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus E and R already placed)

2. Confirmed positions:
   - O must be in position 2 (from HOMER feedback)
   - E must be in position 4
   - R must be in position 5

So the pattern is: _ O _ E R

We need three new letters for positions 1 and 3 (position 2, 4, 5 are locked).  
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, K, P, V, W  

Let’s try to pick a frequent consonant pair: C for first letter, K for third letter gives “C O C K E R” (but that’s 6 letters) – oops, no.  
Let’s try “P O K E R”:
- P: new and allowed
- O: correct in position 2
- K: new and allowed
- E: correct in position 4
- R: correct in position 5
And none of the forbidden letters are used.

  (from all guesses so far)
- Remaining usable letters: B, C, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a consonant for position 1 and another consonant for position 3, chosen only from the remaining letters.

Common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, V, W, Y  
Let’s pick two that haven’t been used yet and are frequent enough.  
“C” and “F” are good candidates.

Possible word: C O F E R → “COFER” isn’t a valid English word.  
Next: C O V E R → “COVER” is a valid 5-letter word, uses only allowed letters, and matches the pattern.

Check positions:
1: C (allowed)
2: O (fixed)
3: V (allowed)
4: E (fixed)
5: R (fixed)

All letters not in the forbidden list.

We now know the exact pattern:  
_ O _ E R  

and we have eliminated every consonant we’ve tried in positions 1 and 3.

Forbidden letters so far (not in the word at all):  
S, L, A, T, D, I, N, H, M, P, K, C, V

Remaining available consonants for positions 1 & 3:  
B, F, G, J, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Among these, the most common English letters are B, F, G, W, Y.  
We need two different consonants, one for position 1 and one for position 3.

Possible valid five-letter words fitting _ O _ E R with allowed letters:
- B O G E R  → valid
- B O F E R  → invalid (no such word)
- F O B E R  → invalid
- G O B E R  → valid

- G O F E R  → valid
- B O Y E R  → invalid
- Y O B E R  → invalid

All valid options left:
BOGER, GOBER, BOWER, GOFER

Let’s pick one. Any of these satisfies the constraints; “BOGER” is a valid word and tests B and G.
