This is the first guess, so I have no information about the secret word. I need to pick a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should use common letters that appear frequently in English words, while avoiding rare letters like Q, X, or Z. 

Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" because they contain many common vowels and consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)

   - Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R, O, E.

2. TOWER → T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters known NOT to appear: T, W (and previously A, S).
   - Letters confirmed IN THE WORD and in the RIGHT positions: O in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5.

So the target word has the pattern:
- _ O _ E R

Letters still available (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern “_ O _ E R” and only uses letters that have not been excluded. Testing common words quickly reveals several candidates: HOMER, ROPER, LOWER (but W is excluded), COPER, COWER (W excluded), etc.

The most common remaining word fitting “_ O _ E R” is HOMER (H-O-M-E-R). Let’s confirm:
- Letters used: H, O, M, E, R – none of A, S, T, W are used, so they are allowed.
- Pattern matches _ O _ E R.

Therefore HOMER is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>This is the first guess, so I have no information about the secret word. I need to pick a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should use common letters that appear frequently in English words, while avoiding rare letters like Q, X, or Z. 

Some popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" because they contain many common vowels and consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains the letters R, O, E somewhere in other positions, and definitely does not contain A or S.  
I need a word that uses R, O, E plus two other new letters.  
A good next guess often includes consonants and vowels not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, U).

A word that re-uses R, O, E while introducing fresh common letters is “TOWER”:
- T, W are new letters.
- R, O, E are reused in different positions.

Let me check that TOWER is 5 letters and valid – yes it is.

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters known NOT to appear: A, S.
   - Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R, O, E.

2. TOWER → T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters known NOT to appear: T, W (and previously A, S).
   - Letters confirmed IN THE WORD and in the RIGHT positions: O in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5.

So the target word has the pattern:
- _ O _ E R

Letters still available (common ones not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern “_ O _ E R” and only uses letters that have not been excluded. Testing common words quickly reveals several candidates: HOMER, ROPER, LOWER (but W is excluded), COPER, COWER (W excluded), etc.

The most common remaining word fitting “_ O _ E R” is HOMER (H-O-M-E-R). Let’s confirm:
- Letters used: H, O, M, E, R – none of A, S, T, W are used, so they are allowed.

I need to pick a 5-letter word that will give me the most useful information possible. A good first guess should use common letters that appear frequently in English words, while avoiding rare letters like Q, X, or Z. \n\nSome popular first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"" because they contain many common vowels and consonants. I\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because it covers three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.\n- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo the word contains the letters R, O, E somewhere in other positions, and definitely does not contain A or S.  \nI need a word that uses R, O, E plus two other new letters.  \nA good next guess often includes consonants and vowels not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, U).\n\nA word that re-uses R, O, E while introducing fresh common letters is “TOWER”:\n- T, W are new letters.\n- R, O, E are reused in different positions.\n\nLet me check that TOWER is 5 letters and valid – yes it is.\n\n<guess>TOWER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two pieces of feedback:\n\n1.

Feedback summary after 5 guesses:

Pattern locked:
  _  O  _  E  R   (positions 2,4,5 confirmed as O, E, R)

Letters now **known NOT** to appear anywhere:
A, S, T, W, H, M, G, N, C, D

Remaining usable letters (for positions 1 and 3):
Consonants: B, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U  (but none are needed because positions 2,4,5 are fixed)

Looking for common English words that fit **X O Y E R** and use only allowed letters.

Quick scan:
- B O V E R   → B and V allowed
- B O Y E R   → B and Y allowed
- F O Y E R   → F and Y allowed
- P O K E R   → P and K allowed
- L O V E R   → L and V allowed

All of these are valid; we just need one.  
Among them, “POKER” uses P and K, neither of which has been tested yet, so it’s as good as any.

(If POKER is wrong, the next would be LOVER, etc.)
