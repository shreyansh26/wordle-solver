For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word often includes common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
- It includes 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps determine which vowels are in the word
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S) which helps identify consonant positions
- All letters are very common in English words
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give us good feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is correct and in the first position.
- O(✓) – O is correct and in the third position.
- E(✓) – E is correct and in the fifth position.
- R(x) and S(x) – R and S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A, has O in position 3, and ends with E.
- Does NOT contain R or S.
- The second and fourth letters can be anything except R or S.

Looking for common words fitting A _ O _ E without R or S:
- ALOVE – but ""alove"" isn't a standard word.
- ABOVE – B and V haven't been tested; no R/S; valid word.
- ANODE – N and D haven't been tested; no R/S; valid word.
- ANOLE – L hasn't been tested; no R/S; but ""anole"" is less common.

""ABOVE"" seems the best next choice: uses new letters B and V, fits the pattern, and is a common word.

From both rounds we know:

Pattern so far: A _ O _ E  
Letters eliminated: R, S, B, V

So the missing letters (positions 2 and 4) must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding R, S, B, V.

Looking at common English letters left, good candidates for the two blanks are consonants like N, T, D, L, M, etc. and we have no information about them yet.

Some 5-letter words that fit A _ O _ E and use letters NOT yet ruled out:

- ANODE – uses N and D (both still possible)
- ALONE – uses L and N
- ATONE – uses T and N
- AMOLE – uses M and L

Among these, ANODE is a solid choice because N and D haven’t been tested yet and they are fairly common letters.
