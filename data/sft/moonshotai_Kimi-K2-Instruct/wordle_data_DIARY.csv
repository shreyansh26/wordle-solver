For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are often recommended because they include multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Let's go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
1. Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
2. DOES contain A and R, but not in their initial positions (A not 1st, R not 2nd).

Good next-word choices should:
- Retain A and R in new spots.
- Introduce new letters that haven’t been tried yet (like U, I, T, N, D…).
- Avoid O, S, E.

A strong follow-up is “TRAIN”:
- It places A in position 3 (different from 1).
- Places R in position 2 (different from 2, but since feedback says “R is in word but not 2nd,” this still gives info).
- Adds new letters T, I, N that weren’t in AROSE.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We now know the word looks like: D _ A _ _ (positions 1 and 3 fixed).
2. Letters that must appear: R and I (from earlier feedback they were marked “-”, so they are in the word but in wrong positions).
   - From guess 3:
     – R is not in position 2 (still “-”), so R must be in position 4 or 5.
     – I is not in position 4 (still “-”), so I must be in position 2 or 5.
3. Letters we have already ruled out completely: O, S, E, T, N, L.
4. Remaining unused letters that are legal: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.
5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - starts with D, has A in position 3,
   - contains both R and I,
   - does not use any banned letters,
   - puts R in position 4 or 5,
   - puts I in position 2 or 5 (and not overlapping the place where R must go).

Let’s list possibilities:

- If R is in position 4 and I in position 2: D I A R _
  – We need a 5th letter that is allowed (not banned).  
  – Allowed choices among unused letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.
  – “DIARB” is not a valid word.
  – “DIARC” isn’t valid.
  – “DIARY” – that is a valid English word and uses Y, which is allowed.

- If R is in position 5 and I in position 2: D I A _ R
  – We would need a 4th letter.  
  – “DIAKR” is not a word, “DIAVR” is not a word, etc.  
  – No common word fits.

- If R is in position 5 and I in position 5 – impossible (overlap).

Therefore the only viable candidate is DIARY.

Let’s double-check:
- Letters: D(✓), I, A(✓), R, Y – all legal and none of the banned letters used.
- Positions: D _ A _ _ → D I A R Y fits.
- R is now in position 4 (never tried there).
- I is now in position 2 (never tried there).
