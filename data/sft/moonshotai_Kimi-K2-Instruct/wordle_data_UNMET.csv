For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good starting word should contain common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strategic first guess would use several of these high-frequency letters.

After considering common starting words, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- It has three vowels (A, O, E) which will help identify vowel positions
- It has two very common consonants (R, S) in key positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x) → none of these letters are in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not at position 5 (so E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4)

Next, I should pick a word that:
1. Includes E in one of the first four positions
2. Avoids A,R,O,S
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.)

A good candidate is ""UNTIE"" because it:
- Has E in position 4 (satisfies the E requirement)
- Uses U, N, T, I which are all common and haven't been ruled out
- Avoids all letters we know aren't in the word

Alternative strong choices could be ""UNTIL"", ""INLET"", or ""ELBOW"", but ""UNTIE"" seems better since it places E in position 4 while testing fresh letters.

Updated constraints after both guesses:

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (UNTIE):
- U is in position 1 and is correct.
- N is in position 2 and is correct.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current word skeleton:
Position 1: U (✓)
Position 2: N (✓)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ? (cannot be E)

Also:
- T must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 3 and positions 1–2 are fixed).
- E must be in positions 3 or 4 (since 1–2 are fixed and 5 is out).

Letters still available (excluding A, R, O, S, I and using U, N already placed):
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: E (must be used), and possibly others if E is in 3 or 4.

Since T is in the word and must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 3 or 4, we have two cases:
Case 1: E in 3, T in 4 or 5 → U N E _ _ or U N E T _
Case 2: T in 4, E in 4 → impossible (conflict), so only Case 1.

Thus:
- If E is in 3, T must be in 4 or 5.
- If E is in 4, T must be in 5.

Let’s explore E in 3 and T in 4: U N E T _
Then position 5 must be a consonant (not A, R, O, S, I, U, N, E, T). Possible candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. Common ones: B, C, D, L, M, P.

Let’s try U N E T _ with a common consonant like B, D, L, M, P. For example, U N E T B is not a word, U N E T D is not, U N E T L is not, U N E T M is not, but U N E T P is ""UNETP"" (invalid). Hmm, no common word. 

Next, E in 3 and T in 5: U N E _ T
Position 4 must be a consonant. Common words: U N E V T (invalid), U N E X T (invalid), U N E C T (invalid), U N E D T (invalid). The only plausible word here is U N E X T (""UNEXT""), but that’s not valid.

Wait, let’s reconsider E in 4 and T in 5: U N _ E T
Position 3 must be a consonant. Common words: U N D E T (invalid), U N C E T (invalid), U N D E T (invalid), U N L E T (invalid), U N G E T (invalid), U N J E T (invalid). The only valid word here is U N D E T (invalid) or U N L E T (invalid).

Hmm, seems E in 3 and T in 4 or 5 isn’t yielding words. Maybe T is in 5 and E is in 4: U N _ E T. Valid word: U N D E T (invalid), U N C E T (invalid), U N L E T (invalid), U N B E T (invalid), U N P E T (invalid), U N M E T (invalid), U N K E T (invalid), U N G E T (invalid), U N W E T (invalid).

Looking at valid English words starting with UN, common ones are: UNMET, UNSET, UNBET (invalid), UNLET (invalid), UNDET (invalid), UNGET (invalid), UNWET (invalid). The only valid word seems UNMET.

UNMET:
- U N M E T
Check constraints:
- U in 1 (✓), N in 2 (✓), E in 4 (must be in word, not in 5, ✓), T in 5 (must be in word, not in 3, ✓), M is new and allowed.
