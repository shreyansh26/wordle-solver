For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and good letter coverage to maximize information gain. Research shows that the best starting words typically use the most frequent letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C). 

A strong strategic choice is a word that contains:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) - preferably 2-3 of them
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc., I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving excellent coverage of high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word at all (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has no A or O.
- It must contain R, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (R-2nd, S-4th, E-5th).

Because R, S, and E must appear somewhere in the word, I will look for a word that:
- Keeps R, S, E
- Places them in new positions (not 2, 4, 5 respectively)
- Uses only letters we have not ruled out (no A or O)
- Adds two new letters (preferably common ones) to maximize information

Let’s pick a word that moves R, S, E to new positions and adds T and I, two high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T (new letter)
- R (in word but now in 2nd position, different from original 2nd)
- I (new letter)
- E (now in 4th position, different from original 5th)
- S (now in 5th position, different from original 4th)

This satisfies all constraints and tests two new letters.

We now have two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(-)

From these we can deduce:

- Letters ruled out entirely: A, O, T
- Letters that must be in the word (they all got at least a “-” once):
  – R (but not in position 2)
  – S (but not in positions 4 or 5)
  – E (and it is now known to be in position 4, because it was “✓” in TRIES)

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

We still need to place R and S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 while respecting their exclusions.

Good untested high-frequency letters left: N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, M, P, K, etc.

To keep coverage broad, let’s introduce two new common consonants: N and D.

A pattern that fits:
- R wants to be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th
- S wants to be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- E is fixed in 4th
- We still need one more letter.

A candidate that satisfies:
  – R in 1st
  – S in 2nd
  – N in 3rd
  – E in 4th
  – D in 5th

Gives “R S N E D” → RSNED (not a valid word)

Swap R and S:
  – S in 1st
  – R in 2nd
  – N in 3rd
  – E in 4th
  – D in 5th

- E (but position 3 conflicts with E at 4) — invalid.
