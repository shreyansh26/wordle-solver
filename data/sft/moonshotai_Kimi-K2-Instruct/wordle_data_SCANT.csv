For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Good starting words often include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and popular consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common first letter in English words)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Alternative good choices could be ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""SLATE"" is a strong choice for the first guess.

From the feedback:

- S is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 3.
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4).
- L and E are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The word pattern is: S _ A _ _
- T must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it cannot be in position 4).
- We must avoid L and E entirely.
- We should also avoid using any letters already confirmed not present (L, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in the third position.
3. Contains T somewhere (but not in position 4).
4. Does not contain L or E.

Possible words fitting this: 
- S M A R T
- S P A R T
- S C A R T (though CART is 4 letters, SCART could work but is uncommon)
- S T A R K
- S T A I R (but A is already in position 3, and I is new)
- S W A R T

Looking at these, ""SMART"" seems like a strong candidate because:
- S(✓) _ A(✓) _ T (placing T in position 5)
- It introduces new common letters M and R which could help narrow down future possibilities.

From the new feedback on SMART:

- S (position 1) ✓ still correct

- T (position 5) ✓ now correct
- M and R are not in the word at all.

Current known pattern: S _ A _ T

Letters we must avoid: L, E, M, R

Known letters we still need: none new (S, A, T are all placed), but we need to fill positions 2 and 4.

Vowels left that haven’t been ruled out: I, O, U, Y  
Consonants left that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in position 3
- Ends with T
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- S P A R T → R is out
- S C A R T → R is out
- S H A R T → R is out
- S T A I R → T is already in position 5, can’t be in 2
- S C A L T → L is out
- S P A N T → SPANT doesn’t exist
- S C A P T → SCAPT is not a word
- S W A P T → SWAPT is not a word
- S C A N T → SCANT is a real word (meaning barely sufficient)
- S P A N T → Not a word
- S K A N T → Not a word
- S H A N T → SHANT is archaic, but valid (short for ""shall not"")

Between SCANT and SHANT, SCANT is the more common word.

Let’s check SCANT:
- S C A N T
- Uses allowed letters (no L, E, M, R)
- Fits pattern S _ A _ T
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

This seems like the best next guess.
