For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that includes common letters and avoids duplicates. Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants to quickly identify or eliminate key letters. Popular choices include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but since we have no prior information, any high-frequency letter combination is good. I'll go with SLATE as it covers common letters S, L, A, T, E.

From the feedback:

- S(✓) → the first letter is S and is in the correct position.
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- Word starts with S.
- No L, A, T, or E in any position.
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, using 4 other unique letters not including L, A, T, or E.

Good next candidates would include common consonants and vowels not yet tried. Since we eliminated A and E, possible vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants to try next could be R, N, C, H, D, etc.

A strong next word would be ""SOUND"" - it starts with S, uses O and U as new vowels, and introduces N and D as new consonants, none of which were in the previous guess.

""SOUND"" fits:

- No L, A, T, E

A common pattern with S-O-_-_-Y could include C, H, I, K, M, P.

Good candidate: ""SOCKY"" – but ""socky"" is uncommon.
""SOGGY"" – G is possible.
""SOAPY"" – contains A, already ruled out.
""SOCKY"" – uses C, K, which are still possible.
""H"" is also still possible – ""SOHY?"" no.
""M"" – ""SOMMY"" not a word.
""P"" – ""SOPPY"" – uses P twice, still valid word.

""SOPPY"" is valid, uses P and P, both allowed, and will confirm P.

Another idea: ""SOCKY"" is valid, but less common.
""SOPPY"" is more common and uses P (twice) and confirms P.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants to quickly identify or eliminate key letters. Popular choices include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU, but since we have no prior information, any high-frequency letter combination is good. I'll go with SLATE as it covers common letters S, L, A, T, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

- S(✓) → the first letter is S and is in the correct position.
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).

So we know:
- Word starts with S.
- No L, A, T, or E in any position.
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, using 4 other unique letters not including L, A, T, or E.

Good next candidates would include common consonants and vowels not yet tried. Since we eliminated A and E, possible vowels left are I, O, U. Consonants to try next could be R, N, C, H, D, etc.

A strong next word would be ""SOUND"" - it starts with S, uses O and U as new vowels, and introduces N and D as new consonants, none of which were in the previous guess.

""SOUND"" fits:
- Starts with S (correct position)
- No L, A, T, E
- Uses common letters likely to appear in many words

Letters still available to try (common ones): R, I, C, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

We have _SO _ _ to fill.  
We need three more letters, none of which are U, N, D, L, A, T, E.

Candidate consonants and vowels left: R, I, C, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next word should introduce several new letters quickly.  
Let’s try “SORRY” – it keeps the S & O we already know are correct and brings in R, R, Y.  
It’s a valid word and will give us feedback on R and Y.

Alternative check: no forbidden letters (L, A, T, E, U, N, D) appear.
