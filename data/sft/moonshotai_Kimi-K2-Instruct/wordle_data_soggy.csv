For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of hitting letters that might be in the secret word. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This should give me good initial coverage of the alphabet and help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

The feedback tells us:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word contains both O and S, but not A, R, or E.

Next I want a guess that:
1. Puts O and/or S into new positions to confirm where they can go.
2. Avoids A, R, E completely.
3. Introduces fresh letters to maximize information.

A simple word that meets these criteria is ""CLOUD"":
- C and L are new letters.
- O and S are not present, but CLOUD contains O in position 2 and U in position 4, which is fine since we’re just testing new letters and placement.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S (position 1), O (position 2)  
Letters whose status is still unknown: the remaining 18 letters, but we already have S and O locked in.

So the word shape so far is:  
S  O  _  _  _

We still need to discover the last three letters.  
Because U, N, D, A, R, E are out, possible remaining consonants and vowels are: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels I, sometimes Y).

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
1. Keeps S and O in their confirmed positions 1 and 2.
2. Uses three new letters we haven’t tested yet, preferably common ones.

A good candidate: SOLID  
- S at 1 (confirmed ✓)  
- O at 2 (confirmed ✓)  
- L, I, D are new letters.  
  – D is already known to be absent, but L and I are new.  
Actually D was marked x (not in word), so SOLID would use D again – that’s inefficient.

Replace D with another letter that is still unknown and common.  
Let’s try: SOCKS  
- S at 1, O at 2 (meet constraints)  
- C, K, S are new (but we already know S is in the word).  
The repeated S in position 5 is okay, but we don’t learn much new.

Better: SOILS  
- S O _ _ _ pattern kept.  
- I, L, S are tested.  
Again S repeats.

Best choice is to pick a word with three completely fresh letters for positions 3-5 while keeping S and O fixed.  
Let’s pick: SOBIC  
- B, I, C are fresh.  
But I’m not sure SOBIC is a valid English word.  

A valid word: SONIC – but N was already excluded.

Check dictionary: valid words starting SO… that avoid A R E U N D.  
Valid 5-letter words starting SO and using only fresh letters include:  
SOFTY, SOFIA, SOLID (but D excluded), SOLVE (V still allowed), SOGGY, SOILS, SOJAS, SOKES, SOLFA, SOLON, SOLUS, SOMAN, SORGO, SORBI, SORUS, SOTOL, SOUPY, SOVOK, etc.

Among these, SOFTY uses F, T, Y – all fresh letters and valid.

1. Keeps S and O in their confirmed positions 1 and 2.
2. Uses three new letters we haven’t tested yet, preferably common ones.

A good candidate: SOLID  
- S at 1 (confirmed ✓)  
- O at 2 (confirmed ✓)  
- L, I, D are new letters.  
  – D is already known to be absent, but L and I are new.  
Actually D was marked x (not in word), so SOLID would use D again – that’s inefficient.

Replace D with another letter that is still unknown and common.  
Let’s try: SOCKS  
- S at 1, O at 2 (meet constraints)  
- C, K, S are new (but we already know S is in the word).  
The repeated S in position 5 is okay, but we don’t learn much new.

Better: SOILS  
- S O _ _ _ pattern kept.  
- I, L, S are tested.  
Again S repeats.

Best choice is to pick a word with three completely fresh letters for positions 3-5 while keeping S and O fixed.  
Let’s pick: SOBIC  
- B, I, C are fresh.  
But I’m not sure SOBIC is a valid English word.  

A valid word: SONIC – but N was already excluded.

Check dictionary: valid words starting SO… that avoid A R E U N D.  
Valid 5-letter words starting SO and using only fresh letters include:  
SOFTY, SOFIA, SOLID (but D excluded), SOLVE (V still allowed), SOGGY, SOILS, SOJAS, SOKES, SOLFA, SOLON, SOLUS, SOMAN, SORGO, SORBI, SORUS, SOTOL, SOUPY, SOVOK, etc.

Among these, SOFTY uses F, T, Y – all fresh letters and valid.

So I’ll go with SOFTY.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of hitting letters that might be in the secret word. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This should give me good initial coverage of the alphabet and help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word contains both O and S, but not A, R, or E.

Next I want a guess that:
1. Puts O and/or S into new positions to confirm where they can go.
2. Avoids A, R, E completely.
3. Introduces fresh letters to maximize information.

A simple word that meets these criteria is ""CLOUD"":
- C and L are new letters.
- O and S are not present, but CLOUD contains O in position 2 and U in position 4, which is fine since we’re just testing new letters and placement.
However, CLOUD doesn’t contain S, so it won’t help confirm S’s position.

A better choice: ""STOIC""
- S is in position 1 (new spot for S)
- T, I, C are new letters
- O is in position 3 (new spot for O)

This seems good.

Another option: ""SOUND""
- S in position 1 (new for S)
- O in position 2 (new for O)
- U, N, D are new letters

Between STOIC and SOUND, SOUND seems slightly better because it tests more common letters (U, N, D) and both S and O in new positions.

I’ll go with SOUND.

We still need to discover the last three letters.

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4, and they must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 letters already ruled out).

Available (common) letters:  
B, C, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Of these, let’s pick two that frequently occur in the middle of 5-letter words.  
Common middle digraphs: CK, CK, MP, MB, GH, etc.

A quick scan for valid English words that are  
S O [consonant] [consonant] Y  
and use only the still-allowed letters:

- SOCKY – C and K are both still allowed. SOCKY is a recognized variant spelling (“socky” = of socks) and is accepted in most Scrabble dictionaries.
- SOGGY – but G appears only once and we don’t know it’s allowed or not, but G isn’t ruled out. However, it’s a repeat letter (G twice) – not ideal for gaining new information.
- SOBKY – not a valid word.
- SOPPY – P is still allowed, but P appears twice – again not ideal.
- SOCMY – not valid.

Between the realistic options, SOCKY is the cleanest test because it introduces two new letters (C and K) that we haven’t tried yet.

Therefore, my next guess is SOCKY.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,soggy,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of hitting letters that might be in the secret word. Common starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 very common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This should give me good initial coverage of the alphabet and help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback tells us:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so it must occur in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4
- E is not in the word (x)

So the word contains both O and S, but not A, R, or E.

Next I want a guess that:
1. Puts O and/or S into new positions to confirm where they can go.
2. Avoids A, R, E completely.
3. Introduces fresh letters to maximize information.

A simple word that meets these criteria is ""CLOUD"":
- C and L are new letters.
- O and S are not present, but CLOUD contains O in position 2 and U in position 4, which is fine since we’re just testing new letters and placement.
However, CLOUD doesn’t contain S, so it won’t help confirm S’s position.

A better choice: ""STOIC""
- S is in position 1 (new spot for S)
- T, I, C are new letters
- O is in position 3 (new spot for O)

This seems good.

Another option: ""SOUND""
- S in position 1 (new for S)
- O in position 2 (new for O)
- U, N, D are new letters

Between STOIC and SOUND, SOUND seems slightly better because it tests more common letters (U, N, D) and both S and O in new positions.

I’ll go with SOUND.

<guess>SOUND</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S (position 1), O (position 2)  
Letters whose status is still unknown: the remaining 18 letters, but we already have S and O locked in.

So the word shape so far is:  
S  O  _  _  _

We still need to discover the last three letters.  
Because U, N, D, A, R, E are out, possible remaining consonants and vowels are: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and vowels I, sometimes Y).

To maximize information, I’ll choose a word that:
1. Keeps S and O in their confirmed positions 1 and 2.
2. Uses three new letters we haven’t tested yet, preferably common ones.

A good candidate: SOLID  
- S at 1 (confirmed ✓)  
- O at 2 (confirmed ✓)  
- L, I, D are new letters.  
  – D is already known to be absent, but L and I are new.  
Actually D was marked x (not in word), so SOLID would use D again – that’s inefficient.

Replace D with another letter that is still unknown and common.  
Let’s try: SOCKS  
- S at 1, O at 2 (meet constraints)  
- C, K, S are new (but we already know S is in the word).  
The repeated S in position 5 is okay, but we don’t learn much new.

Better: SOILS  
- S O _ _ _ pattern kept.  
- I, L, S are tested.  
Again S repeats.

Best choice is to pick a word with three completely fresh letters for positions 3-5 while keeping S and O fixed.  
Let’s pick: SOBIC  
- B, I, C are fresh.  
But I’m not sure SOBIC is a valid English word.  

A valid word: SONIC – but N was already excluded.

Check dictionary: valid words starting SO… that avoid A R E U N D.  
Valid 5-letter words starting SO and using only fresh letters include:  
SOFTY, SOFIA, SOLID (but D excluded), SOLVE (V still allowed), SOGGY, SOILS, SOJAS, SOKES, SOLFA, SOLON, SOLUS, SOMAN, SORGO, SORBI, SORUS, SOTOL, SOUPY, SOVOK, etc.

Among these, SOFTY uses F, T, Y – all fresh letters and valid.

So I’ll go with SOFTY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback:

Known letters and positions:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Known absent letters: A, R, E, U, N, D, F, T

So the word pattern is: S O _ _ Y

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining alphabet, excluding the 8 letters already ruled out. The remaining letters that are common in 5-letter words include B, C, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, etc.

I’ll aim for a word that:
1. Keeps S, O, Y in their confirmed positions (1, 2, 5).
2. Uses two new, common letters for positions 3 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- SOBLY – but B and L are new, yet SOBLY is uncommon.
- SOGGY – G is new, but G repeats and G was not tested yet. Also G could be valid.
- SOILY – I and L are new, and SOILY is a valid word.

SOILY is a valid English word and uses I and L, both untested.

We still need two letters for positions 3 and 4, and they must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 letters already ruled out).

Available (common) letters:  
B, C, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Of these, let’s pick two that frequently occur in the middle of 5-letter words.  
Common middle digraphs: CK, CK, MP, MB, GH, etc.

A quick scan for valid English words that are  
S O [consonant] [consonant] Y

- SOCKY – C and K are both still allowed. SOCKY is a recognized variant spelling (“socky” = of socks) and is accepted in most Scrabble dictionaries.
- SOGGY – but G appears only once and we don’t know it’s allowed or not, but G isn’t ruled out. However, it’s a repeat letter (G twice) – not ideal for gaining new information.
- SOBKY – not a valid word.
- SOPPY – P is still allowed, but P appears twice – again not ideal.
- SOCMY – not valid.

Between the realistic options, SOCKY is the cleanest test because it introduces two new letters (C and K) that we haven’t tried yet.

Therefore, my next guess is SOCKY.
