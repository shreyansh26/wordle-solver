For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to quickly gather information about the secret word. The optimal strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the target word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that includes several of these. 

A good first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S

This word gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word and will provide useful feedback regardless of what the actual word is.

None of A, R, O, S, E appear in the target word at all.  
That eliminates many common vowels and consonants.

From all feedback:

Known letters and positions:
- 5th letter is Y (✓)
- 2nd letter is I (✓)
- 3rd letter is L (✓)

Known letters not yet placed:
- I is already locked at 2, so no extra I to place.

Letters still banned (x in any position): A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M.

Remaining high-frequency consonants we haven’t tested: C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word matching pattern: _ I L _ Y, using only allowed letters.

Easy consonants left for positions 1 and 4:
D, G, H, K, P, V, W, C, etc.

Quick scan: DILLY? – but L is already in 3rd, double L allowed, yet Y appears twice in one word? Not possible.  
Try W I L D Y – but D at 4, Y at 5. “WILDY” isn’t a valid English word.

Next possibility: P I L C H – no, needs 5 letters ending Y.

Valid word fitting: “W I L C Y” – invalid.

Valid dictionary word: “B I L G Y” – but B and G not yet ruled out, and it fits pattern _ I L _ Y.

Actually, “BILGY” is acceptable (archaic but in dictionaries).

However, to maximize new info, we can also try “P I L C H” – no Y.

Better idea: use C and D.  
“C I L D Y” – not a word.

“D I L L Y” – double L, still valid word.  
Check: D I L L Y → letters D, I, L, L, Y – all allowed, pattern D I L _ Y, but L repeats and we already know L goes at 3. So word would be D I L L Y.

Wait: positions are: 1:D, 2:I (✓), 3:L (✓), 4:L, 5:Y (✓).  
The third position is already L, and fourth can be another L, making D I L L Y – “dilly” is indeed a 5-letter word.

But to avoid double L and test new consonants, perhaps better to try H I L D Y – but “hildy” isn’t a recognized word.

Another candidate: “V I L D Y” – invalid.

Let’s instead try “C I L D Y” – invalid.

Another valid word: “P I L L Y” – again double L.

The simplest valid English word that fits _ I L _ Y without reusing banned letters is “DILLY”.

It uses D (new consonant) and double L is allowed.

So we’ll go with “DILLY”.

<guess>DILLY</guess>",DILLY,"From all feedback:

Known letters and positions:
- 5th letter is Y (✓)
- 2nd letter is I (✓)
- 3rd letter is L (✓)

Known letters not yet placed:
- I is already locked at 2, so no extra I to place.

Letters still banned (x in any position): A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, F, M.

Remaining high-frequency consonants we haven’t tested: C, D, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word matching pattern: _ I L _ Y, using only allowed letters.

Easy consonants left for positions 1 and 4:
D, G, H, K, P, V, W, C, etc.

Quick scan: DILLY? – but L is already in 3rd, double L allowed, yet Y appears twice in one word? Not possible.  
Try W I L D Y – but D at 4, Y at 5. “WILDY” isn’t a valid English word.

Next possibility: P I L C H – no, needs 5 letters ending Y.

Valid word fitting: “W I L C Y” – invalid.

Valid dictionary word: “B I L G Y” – but B and G not yet ruled out, and it fits pattern _ I L _ Y.

Actually, “BILGY” is acceptable (archaic but in dictionaries).

However, to maximize new info, we can also try “P I L C H” – no Y.

Better idea: use C and D.  
“C I L D Y” – not a word.

“D I L L Y” – double L, still valid word.  
Check: D I L L Y → letters D, I, L, L, Y – all allowed, pattern D I L _ Y, but L repeats and we already know L goes at 3. So word would be D I L L Y.
