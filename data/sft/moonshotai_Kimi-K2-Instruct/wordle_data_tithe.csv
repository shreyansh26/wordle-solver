Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that covers common letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. To maximize the information gained from this first guess, I should pick a word that uses several of these common letters.

Looking at these letters, a good combination that forms a valid 5-letter word would be ""AROSE"" - it includes 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word.

From the first-guess feedback:
- A, R, O, S are all absent.
- E is present and in the correct position (last letter).

Since E is locked in at position 5, I need a five-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B.  
To learn as much as possible, I’ll pick a word that uses several fresh letters: T, I, N, E, M → the valid word is “INMET” (but this isn’t a common English word).  
A common word that uses fresh letters and fits the constraints is “INLET” (I, N, L, E, T).

Check letters used: I, N, L, E, T – none of A, R, O, S appear, and E is correctly placed last.

Current information:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, L, T.
- Letters we now know ARE in the word but are NOT in their current positions: I (from INLET), E (but E is already locked at position 5, so the feedback “E(-)” simply confirms E is in the word, which we already knew).

So the hidden word ends in E and must contain I somewhere in positions 1-4, and must avoid A,R,O,S,N,L,T.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t used yet: C, D, U, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I, and only using the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- PIECE – contains I and ends in E, but uses C which is allowed.
- MIDGE – contains I and ends in E, avoids forbidden letters.
- CHIME – contains I and ends in E, uses C,H,M which are allowed.
- HUMID – ends in D, not E, so invalid.
- BIBLE – ends in E, uses B,I,L (but L is forbidden), so invalid.
- GIMME – ends in E, uses G,I,M,M,E – no forbidden letters.

From these, “GIMME” seems a good choice: it introduces G and M, keeps I active, and ends in confirmed E.

However, let’s double-check: forbidden letters are A,R,O,S,N,L,T. GIMME uses G,I,M,M,E – none of the forbidden letters appear. This is valid.

So far:
- The hidden word is _ _ _ _ E.
- Letters definitely absent (x): A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, M.
- Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed (-): I and H.

We now need a 5-letter word that
1. ends with E;
2. contains both I and H somewhere in positions 1-4 (because they are in the word but not yet placed);
3. uses none of the forbidden letters A, R, O, S, N, L, T, C, M.

Allowed remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the already-known I and H).

- BIDIE – no.
- HIKED – ends in D, not E.
- PIECE – uses C (forbidden).
- HINGE – uses N and G, but N is forbidden.
- WHILE – uses L (forbidden).
- PIXIE – uses X, but ends in E; X is allowed, but P and I are allowed; let’s check letters: P, I, X, I, E – none of the forbidden letters appear. This is valid.
- GIMME – uses M (forbidden).
- BIKIE – uses B, I, K, I, E – valid.
- HIKIE – uses H, I, K, I, E – valid.

Among these, “WHILE” uses W (allowed), but L is forbidden.
“PIXIE” uses P, I, X, I, E – no forbidden letters.
“BIKIE” uses B, I, K, I, E – no forbidden letters.

But “HIKIE” is a good option because it places H and I in new positions and adds K.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,tithe,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

- A, R, O, S are all absent.
- E is present and in the correct position (last letter).

Since E is locked in at position 5, I need a five-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining high-frequency consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, B.  
To learn as much as possible, I’ll pick a word that uses several fresh letters: T, I, N, E, M → the valid word is “INMET” (but this isn’t a common English word).  
A common word that uses fresh letters and fits the constraints is “INLET” (I, N, L, E, T).

Check letters used: I, N, L, E, T – none of A, R, O, S appear, and E is correctly placed last.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Current information:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, L, T.
- Letters we now know ARE in the word but are NOT in their current positions: I (from INLET), E (but E is already locked at position 5, so the feedback “E(-)” simply confirms E is in the word, which we already knew).

So the hidden word ends in E and must contain I somewhere in positions 1-4, and must avoid A,R,O,S,N,L,T.

Remaining high-frequency letters we haven’t used yet: C, D, U, M, P, H, B, G, K, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing I, and only using the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- PIECE – contains I and ends in E, but uses C which is allowed.
- MIDGE – contains I and ends in E, avoids forbidden letters.
- CHIME – contains I and ends in E, uses C,H,M which are allowed.
- HUMID – ends in D, not E, so invalid.
- BIBLE – ends in E, uses B,I,L (but L is forbidden), so invalid.
- GIMME – ends in E, uses G,I,M,M,E – no forbidden letters.

From these, “GIMME” seems a good choice: it introduces G and M, keeps I active, and ends in confirmed E.

However, let’s double-check: forbidden letters are A,R,O,S,N,L,T. GIMME uses G,I,M,M,E – none of the forbidden letters appear. This is valid.

But I want to maximize new information: “CHIME” uses C, H, M, I, E – all new letters (except E already known), and gives us three fresh consonants.

Let’s go with CHIME.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word ends in E (positions 1-4 letters unknown, position 5 is E).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, M, P, X.
- Letters known to be in the word: I and H.
- From PIXIE feedback:
  – I is present and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
  – H is still somewhere in the word but not yet placed (-).
  – X and P are absent.

So the template is: _ I _ _ E
We also know H must appear once among positions 1,3,4 (since it can’t be repeated and must appear exactly once).

Available letters (excluding all forbidden): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word ending in E, with I in slot 2, and containing H once in slot 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. H I _ _ E
2. _ I H _ E
3. _ I _ H E

Check English lexicon:
- HI _ _ E: HIKED (but ends in D), HINGE (N forbidden), HINIE (ends in E, but N forbidden) – none valid.
- _ I H _ E: BIHED (not a word), DIHED (not a word), FIHED (not a word), GIHED (not a word).
- _ I _ H E: common word “BIBLE” uses L (forbidden), “DITHE” not a word, “FIFTH” ends in H (not E), “GIGHE” not a word, “WITHE” is valid.

“WITHE” is an English word meaning a flexible twig or branch. It fits: W I T H E.
Check letters: W, I, T, H, E – T was previously forbidden (from INLET feedback), because INLET had T(-) which means T is in the word but in the wrong place. Wait, no – INLET feedback was T(-), which means T is in the word but not in position 5. But we don’t know if T is in the word or not. Actually, the feedback T(-) meant “T is in the word but not in that position”, but from CHIME feedback, T never appeared, so we don’t have info that T is forbidden. However, from INLET feedback, T was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word, but in another position.

Wait, let me re-examine feedback carefully:
- INLET: I(-), N(x), L(x), E(-), T(-)
  – I(-): I is in the word but not in position 1.
  – T(-): T is in the word but not in position 5.
- CHIME: C(x), H(-), I(-), M(x), E(✓)
  – H(-): H is in the word but not in position 2.
  – I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- PIXIE: P(x), I(✓), X(x), I(-), E(✓)
  – I(✓): I is in position 2 (matches).

So combining:
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by PIXIE).
- H must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- T must be in the word (from INLET T(-)), and not in position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is I), so 1, 3, 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, N, L, C, M, P, X.
- Word template: _ I _ _ E with H and T appearing once each in positions 1,3,4.

Possible arrangements:
1. H I T _ E
   – HIT_E: no common word (HITE is obsolete).
2. H I _ T E
   – HI_T_E: “HITTE” not valid.
3. T I H _ E
   – TI_H_E: “TITHE” – a valid word meaning a tenth part, especially in religious context.
4. T I _ H E
   – TI_HE: “TITHE” again (same as above).
5. _ I H T E
   – _IHTE: no valid word.
6. _ I T H E
   – _ITHE: “WITHE” is valid but doesn’t use T.

Only valid common word fitting is “TITHE”.

Check letters: T, I, T, H, E – T appears twice. This is allowed unless Wordle disallows repeats; standard Wordle allows repeats unless proven otherwise. Also, letters used: T, I, H, E – none of the forbidden letters.

Therefore, “TITHE” is the best next guess.

<guess>TITHE</guess>",TITHE,"Current confirmed facts:
- Word ends in E (positions 1-4 letters unknown, position 5 is E).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, M, P, X.
- Letters known to be in the word: I and H.
- From PIXIE feedback:
  – I is present and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
  – H is still somewhere in the word but not yet placed (-).
  – X and P are absent.

So the template is: _ I _ _ E
We also know H must appear once among positions 1,3,4 (since it can’t be repeated and must appear exactly once).

Available letters (excluding all forbidden): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word ending in E, with I in slot 2, and containing H once in slot 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. H I _ _ E
2. _ I H _ E
3. _ I _ H E

Check English lexicon:
- HI _ _ E: HIKED (but ends in D), HINGE (N forbidden), HINIE (ends in E, but N forbidden) – none valid.
- _ I H _ E: BIHED (not a word), DIHED (not a word), FIHED (not a word), GIHED (not a word).
- _ I _ H E: common word “BIBLE” uses L (forbidden), “DITHE” not a word, “FIFTH” ends in H (not E), “GIGHE” not a word, “WITHE” is valid.

“WITHE” is an English word meaning a flexible twig or branch. It fits: W I T H E.
Check letters: W, I, T, H, E – T was previously forbidden (from INLET feedback), because INLET had T(-) which means T is in the word but in the wrong place. Wait, no – INLET feedback was T(-), which means T is in the word but not in position 5. But we don’t know if T is in the word or not. Actually, the feedback T(-) meant “T is in the word but not in that position”, but from CHIME feedback, T never appeared, so we don’t have info that T is forbidden. However, from INLET feedback, T was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word, but in another position.

Wait, let me re-examine feedback carefully:
- INLET: I(-), N(x), L(x), E(-), T(-)
  – I(-): I is in the word but not in position 1.
  – T(-): T is in the word but not in position 5.
- CHIME: C(x), H(-), I(-), M(x), E(✓)
  – H(-): H is in the word but not in position 2.
  – I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- PIXIE: P(x), I(✓), X(x), I(-), E(✓)
  – I(✓): I is in position 2 (matches).

So combining:
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by PIXIE).
- H must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- T must be in the word (from INLET T(-)), and not in position 5. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is I), so 1, 3, 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, N, L, C, M, P, X.
- Word template: _ I _ _ E with H and T appearing once each in positions 1,3,4.
