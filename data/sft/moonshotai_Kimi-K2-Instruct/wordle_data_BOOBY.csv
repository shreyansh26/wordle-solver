For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Doesn't repeat any letters to maximize information gain
3. Has a good mix of vowels and consonants

The most common letters in English are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are unique
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- It allows us to test multiple common letter combinations at once

This should give us valuable information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Common English words fitting that pattern: BOFFY (not a word), BOHBY (not a word), BOKEY (not a word), BOMBY (not a word), BOVBY (not a word), BOWBY (not a word).

The only real dictionary word that matches is “BOBBY,” but B was already confirmed in position 1, so the second B would be a repeat of an already-placed letter. Another valid word is “BOOMY,” but M hasn’t been eliminated yet and we’re down to limited options.

Looking again, “BOOMY” is valid and uses M, which is still in play. Let’s test it.
