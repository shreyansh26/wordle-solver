For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters in the English language and also helps eliminate multiple possibilities at once. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to maximize information gain. 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repeating any, giving us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE we learned:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- definitely contains S
- does not contain A, R, O, E
- S is not in the 4th position

Remaining useful common letters not yet eliminated: T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, K, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Uses the known S (and places it in a different spot than position 4)
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoids any of the letters already eliminated (A, R, O, E)

Good options could be: STING, SLING, SNUG, SOUND (but O is out), STUNT, SLUMP, etc. “STING” uses S plus very common letters T, I, N, G and has S in position 1 instead of 4, so it gives us new information efficiently.

From the feedback so far:

- AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

  – S is in the word but not at position 4.

- STING → S(✓) T(x) I(x) N(✓) G(✓)  
  – S is in the correct first position.  
  – T and I are NOT in the word.  
  – N is in the word but NOT at position 4 (it sits at 4 in STING but still got “✓”, so it must be in the correct spot; therefore N is in position 4).  
  – G is in the word but NOT at position 5 (it sits at 5 in STING and got “✓”, so G must be in position 5).

This tells us the secret word pattern is:

S _ _ N G

From the new feedback on SLUNG:

S(✓) L(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(✓)

This tells us:

1. S is correct in position 1 (already known).
2. L is NOT in the word.
3. U is correct in position 3.
4. N is correct in position 4 (already known from STING feedback).
5. G is correct in position 5 (already known from STING feedback).

So the current known pattern is:

S _ U N G

We need to find the second letter. Possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, Y, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ U N G, the most obvious candidates are:

- SCUNG (not a valid word)
- SPUNG (not a valid word)
- SHUNG (not a valid word)
- SWUNG (valid English word)

""SWUNG"" fits perfectly with the pattern S _ U N G and uses W in the second position, which hasn't been eliminated yet.
