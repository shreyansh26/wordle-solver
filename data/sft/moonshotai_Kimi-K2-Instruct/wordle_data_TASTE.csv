For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and provides good coverage to maximize information. The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these common letters without repeating any, so each letter gives us unique information. Some excellent starting words include:
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words, containing three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word is _ A _ _ E in form.
- It contains S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- It does not contain R or I.
- We still need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

Common letters not yet ruled out for those three blanks: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since S is definitely in the word, I should try placing it in one of the remaining positions. I'll put S in position 1 first to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""SAUTE"":
- S in position 1 (testing if S works here)
- A in position 2 (already confirmed)
- U in position 3 (new vowel)
- T in position 4 (common consonant)

This tests S in position 1, introduces new letters U and T, and keeps confirmed letters in place.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these common letters without repeating any, so each letter gives us unique information. Some excellent starting words include:
- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E
- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words, containing three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x): R is not in the word.

- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word is _ A _ _ E in form.
- It contains S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- It does not contain R or I.
- We still need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

Common letters not yet ruled out for those three blanks: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since S is definitely in the word, I should try placing it in one of the remaining positions. I'll put S in position 1 first to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""SAUTE"":
- S in position 1 (testing if S works here)
- A in position 2 (already confirmed)
- U in position 3 (new vowel)
- T in position 4 (common consonant)
- E in position 5 (already confirmed)

This tests S in position 1, introduces new letters U and T, and keeps confirmed letters in place.

The most common letters in 5-letter English words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. \n\nA good strategy is to use a word that contains many of these common letters without repeating any, so each letter gives us unique information. Some excellent starting words include:\n- ""RAISE"" - uses R, A, I, S, E\n- ""AROSE"" - uses A, R, O, S, E\n- ""SLATE"" - uses S, L, A, T, E\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it\'s widely considered one of the best starting words, containing three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R(x): R is not in the word.\n- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- I(x): I is not in the word.\n- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo we know:\n- The word is _ A _ _ E in form.\n- It contains S somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n- It does not contain R or I.\n- We still need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.\n\nCommon letters not yet ruled out for those three blanks: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Since S is definitely in the word, I should try placing it in one of the remaining positions.

We now know the word is of the form _ A S T E, and the first letter has already been ruled out as R, C, H, and P.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit _ A S T E are:
- BASTE
- WASTE
- FASTE (invalid)
- MASTE (invalid)
- GASTE (invalid)
- VASTE (invalid)

Only two legal options remain: BASTE and WASTE.  
Since B is earlier in the alphabet and BASTE is the more common word, we’ll try it first.
