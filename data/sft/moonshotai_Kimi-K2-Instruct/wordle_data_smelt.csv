1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal first guess in Wordle is typically a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequent vowels and consonants like A, E, T, R, S, N, etc. 

Good first guesses include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- SLANT
- CRATE
- ROAST

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly popular because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all (x).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So:
1. The word does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
2. It DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E somewhere (not last letter)
- Excludes C, R, A, N

From all feedback so far:

1. Known placements:
   - S ✓ _ _ _ _ (position 1)
   - _ _ E ✓ _ _ (position 3)
   - _ _ _ _ T ✓ (position 5)

   Word pattern: S _ E _ T

2. Letters known to be present but misplaced:
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (from SLEPT feedback).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   C, R, A, N, O, K, P.

4. Letters already used or ruled out for unknown spots:
   - Position 2 cannot be L (because L is misplaced and must go elsewhere), and cannot be any of the “x” letters.
   - Position 4 is still open, but must avoid the forbidden letters.

We need a 5-letter word fitting S _ E _ T where:
- Position 2 ≠ L, and is not any of C,R,A,N,O,K,P.
- Position 4 is not any of the forbidden letters.

Letters still available for positions 2 and 4 include: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, W, Y, etc. (excluding the forbidden ones).

Also, the letter L must appear somewhere in the word, but it cannot be in position 2. The only remaining slots are position 4, since positions 1,3,5 are already taken by S, E, T.

Therefore, L must go in position 4.

This fixes the word as: S _ E L T

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word of the form S ? E L T where the second letter is allowed (not any forbidden letter).

Possible second letters (not in forbidden set): B, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, W, Y.

Among these, “I” is common and forms the valid word “SIELT”? – No, “SIELT” is not a recognized English word. 

Check common valid words that fit: “SHELT” – no. “SWELT” – no. “SMELT” – yes! “SMELT” is a valid English word (past tense of smell, or a type of fish).

Also, check constraints:
- S ✓ _ _ _ _ ✓
- _ _ E ✓ _ _ ✓
- _ _ _ _ T ✓
- L in position 4 (not in position 2) – satisfies L(-) feedback.
- Contains no forbidden letters (C,R,A,N,O,K,P) – satisfied.

Thus, “SMELT” fits all constraints.
