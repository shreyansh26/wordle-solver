moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,DROSS,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to gather maximum information. The most common letters in English words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Considering this, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives us a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and helps eliminate many possibilities.

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter distribution for initial information gathering.

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we know:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → must be in 2nd place
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → must be in 3rd place
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → must be in 4th place
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the word structure is: _ R O S _

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits R O S in positions 2-4. Let’s list possibilities:
- CROSS
- FROST
- BROWS
- DROPS
- GROMS (not valid)
- PROSS
- TROMS (invalid)

Valid candidates: CROSS, FROST, BROWS, DROPS, PROSS. Among these, ""CROSS"" is common and uses a new consonant (C) which could help narrow down the first letter.

Another check: no A or E, so remaining vowels are I, U, Y. None fit here, so first and last letters must be consonants.
