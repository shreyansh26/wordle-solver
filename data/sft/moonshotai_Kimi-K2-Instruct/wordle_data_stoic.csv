For the first guess, I want to choose a word that can help eliminate many possibilities by using common letters. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular starting guesses because they contain common letters. 

Looking at ""AROSE"":
- A, R, O, S, E are all very common letters in 5-letter words.
- It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 consonants (R, S), which is a good balance.
- This can help quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word.

This seems like a strong first guess to start narrowing down possibilities.

Letters we still need to place: T plus any new ones we haven’t tried from the remaining common alphabet (e.g., L, C, P, I, Y, H, D, G, etc.).

Candidate letters for positions 2 and 4:
- T must be in 2 or 4.
- Remaining slots can take any unused letters.

Possible words:

- S   _   O   T   _   → could be SHOT_, SPOTS (but S already), SCOTS, etc.

Let’s build a word:
- If T is in position 2: S T O _ _
  - Remaining letters: C, K, P, L, M, Y, D, etc.
  - STOCK: S T O C K – letters are all valid under current constraints.
  - STOMP: S T O M P – but P and M are untested and might be good.
  - STONY: N is out.
  - STOCK seems safer.

- If T is in position 4: S _ O T _
  - Examples: SHOT_, but H and another letter needed.
  - SCOTS: S C O T S – double S is redundant.
  - SPOUT: U is out.
  - SLATE, SHOTS, etc. – none seem better than STOCK.

Therefore, STOCK is the best next guess as it places T in position 2, introduces C and K (both new), and fits all constraints.

   - N and U are not in the word at all.

So we now know the pattern:
S   _   O   _   _
with T somewhere in positions 2 or 4, and no N, U, A, R, E.

Letters we still need to place: T plus any new ones we haven’t tried from the remaining common alphabet (e.g., L, C, P, I, Y, H, D, G, etc.).

Candidate letters for positions 2 and 4:
- T must be in 2 or 4.
- Remaining slots can take any unused letters.

Possible words:
- S   T   O   _   _   → could be STOCK, STOMP, STONE (but N is out), STOWS (double S), etc.
- S   _   O   T   _   → could be SHOT_, SPOTS (but S already), SCOTS, etc.

Let’s build a word:
- If T is in position 2: S T O _ _
  - Remaining letters: C, K, P, L, M, Y, D, etc.
  - STOCK: S T O C K – letters are all valid under current constraints.
  - STOMP: S T O M P – but P and M are untested and might be good.
  - STONY: N is out.
  - STOCK seems safer.

- If T is in position 4: S _ O T _
  - Examples: SHOT_, but H and another letter needed.
  - SCOTS: S C O T S – double S is redundant.
  - SPOUT: U is out.
  - SLATE, SHOTS, etc. – none seem better than STOCK.

Therefore, STOCK is the best next guess as it places T in position 2, introduces C and K (both new), and fits all constraints.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Position map (✓ = correct, – = wrong spot, x = absent):
   S T O C K
   ✓ ✓ ✓ – x

So the word is:
S T O _ _
with:
- C somewhere in the word but not in slot 4
- K is excluded entirely
- Already excluded letters: A, R, E, N, U, K

We need to fill slots 4 and 5 with letters that:
- Are not in (A, R, E, N, U, K)
- Are not C in slot 4
- Are valid 5-letter-word endings after STO_

Candidate endings that fit:
- C must be in slot 5 (only remaining slot it could occupy) → STO C _
  – but slot 4 must be filled with another letter.
- The only way C can appear is therefore at slot 5, and slot 4 must be a new letter that is not yet ruled out.

Common English endings for STO__:
- STOIC  (I is new, C allowed in 5)
- STOLE  (E is already excluded)
- STORM  (R is excluded)
- STOGE  (E excluded, G new)
- STOPE  (E excluded)
- STOLE  (E excluded)
- STOCK  (already tried, K excluded)
- STOMP  (M, P new)
- STORY  (Y new, R excluded)

The only fully-compliant possibilities among these are:
STOIC (letters S, T, O, I, C – none excluded)
STOMP (letters S, T, O, M, P – none excluded)

Between the two, STOIC is more common, so I’ll try that first.
