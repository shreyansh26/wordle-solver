For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle include:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- CRISP
- STARE
- RAISE
- AUDIO
- ADIEU

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common ending vowel)

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters in multiple positions.

From the two rounds of feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (since T(-) in both guesses).

2. TRICK → T(-) R(x) I(x) C(✓) K(x)
   - New letters NOT in the word: R, I, K
   - C is IN the word and is in the correct position 4.

So far we know:
- Word is _ _ _ C _
- T is somewhere in the word (positions 2, 3, or 5)
- Letters not in the word: S, L, A, E, R, I, K

Remaining common letters to try: D, G, H, M, N, O, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word with:
- C in position 4
- T somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5)
- None of the banned letters

A good candidate is MOUTH – it has:
- O, U (common vowels)
- M, H (common consonants)
- T in position 4 is banned (C is there), so T must be in position 2 or 5 – in MOUTH, T is in 5
- None of the banned letters are used

But MOUTH puts T in position 5 – allowed since T hasn't been ruled out there.

Another candidate: NIGHT – same logic, T in position 5, C is in 4, but NIGHT doesn't have C in position 4.
Wait no – C must be in position 4.

So we need _ _ _ C _. And T must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Candidate: DUCTY – but Y is less common.
PITCH – but I is banned.
BOTCH – but O is allowed, T in position 3, C in 4 – uses B, O, T, C, H – all allowed.

BOTCH:
- B, O, T, C, H
- C is in position 4 (✓)
- T is in position 3 (allowed, not ruled out)
- No banned letters

This seems good.
