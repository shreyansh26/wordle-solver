For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the information gained. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- All five most common vowels (A, O, E, plus I and U aren't here but we have three vowels)
- The common consonant S
- The common consonant R

This word should give us good feedback on which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

All five letters from AROSE were marked “x”, so none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common starting letters and vowels.

These letters are still very frequent in English five-letter words and haven’t been used yet.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that have been ruled out completely (x):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, B, T, F, C, K

Letters that must appear in the word (✓ or –):
- I is confirmed to be in the word (it got ✓ in UNBIT position 3).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (it got – in FLICK position 2).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L.
2. Does not use any of the 12 ruled-out letters above.
3. Has I not in position 3 (because in FLICK, I got –, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3).
4. Has L not in position 2.

Remaining unused letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats of I/L.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also tests some new letters. Good candidates:
- GLIMP (but M is okay, P is okay, G and L and I are okay; check positions)
- PIDLY (but D is okay, etc.)

A word that fits perfectly: “GLIMP”:
- Contains G, L, I, M, P – none are in the forbidden list.
- I is in position 3 in FLICK but got “–”, so it must exist but not in position 3; GLIMP has I in position 3 – that would be invalid.  
Oops, I made a mistake. Let’s choose another.

Try “DILLY”:
- Contains D, I, L, Y – but only 4 distinct letters, and Y is okay.
- I is in position 2 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” and in position 3).
- L is in position 3 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” in position 2).

But DILLY is 5 letters and valid. However, let’s ensure it meets all criteria:
- Uses D, I, L, Y (L appears twice is okay).
- I is in position 2 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 3).
- L is in position 3 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 2).

Good choice. So DILLY is a valid next guess.

Another good candidate is “HILLY” but H is also unused. Let’s go with DILLY.

Wait, let’s pick a word with no duplicates to maximize information. Try “PLIMY”:
- P, L, I, M, Y – all unused.
- I is in position 3 – but FLICK had I in position 3 with “–”, so I cannot be in position 3. Invalid.

Need I not in position 3. Try “PILMY”:
- P, I, L, M, Y.
- I is in position 2 – okay.
- L is in position 3 – okay (not position 2).

This word PILMY is valid and meets all constraints.

Let’s use PILMY.

Try “DILLY”:
- Contains D, I, L, Y – but only 4 distinct letters, and Y is okay.
- I is in position 2 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” and in position 3).
- L is in position 3 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” in position 2).

But DILLY is 5 letters and valid. However, let’s ensure it meets all criteria:
- Uses D, I, L, Y (L appears twice is okay).
- I is in position 2 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 3).
- L is in position 3 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 2).

Good choice. So DILLY is a valid next guess.

Another good candidate is “HILLY” but H is also unused. Let’s go with DILLY.

Wait, let’s pick a word with no duplicates to maximize information. Try “PLIMY”:
- P, L, I, M, Y – all unused.
- I is in position 3 – but FLICK had I in position 3 with “–”, so I cannot be in position 3. Invalid.

Need I not in position 3. Try “PILMY”:
- P, I, L, M, Y.
- I is in position 2 – okay.
- L is in position 3 – okay (not position 2).

This word PILMY is valid and meets all constraints.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,lipid,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize the information gained. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- All five most common vowels (A, O, E, plus I and U aren't here but we have three vowels)
- The common consonant S
- The common consonant R

This word should give us good feedback on which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from AROSE were marked “x”, so none of A, R, O, S, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge chunk of common starting letters and vowels.  
To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely fresh common letters: B, I, T, U, N.

These letters are still very frequent in English five-letter words and haven’t been used yet.  
A good candidate is “UNBIT”.

<guess>UNBIT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNBIT -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) B(x) I(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- All letters from AROSE are out: A, R, O, S, E.
- All letters from UNBIT except the I are out: U, N, B, T.

Therefore the secret word contains the letter I in the third position (since I got ✓ in position 3 of UNBIT).  
We still need four more distinct letters that have not been used yet.  
Good unused letters include C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
To maximize coverage, I’ll choose a word that uses I in the third spot and several other common consonants plus a vowel.  
A good candidate is “FLICK”:
- F, L, C, K have not been tested.  
- I is in position 3, matching the feedback.  
This should reveal more about the remaining letters.

<guess>FLICK</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: UNBIT -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) B(x) I(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: FLICK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From all feedback so far:

Letters that have been ruled out completely (x):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, B, T, F, C, K

Letters that must appear in the word (✓ or –):
- I is confirmed to be in the word (it got ✓ in UNBIT position 3).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (it got – in FLICK position 2).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L.
2. Does not use any of the 12 ruled-out letters above.
3. Has I not in position 3 (because in FLICK, I got –, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3).
4. Has L not in position 2.

Remaining unused letters: D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus repeats of I/L.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also tests some new letters. Good candidates:
- GLIMP (but M is okay, P is okay, G and L and I are okay; check positions)
- PIDLY (but D is okay, etc.)

A word that fits perfectly: “GLIMP”:
- Contains G, L, I, M, P – none are in the forbidden list.
- I is in position 3 in FLICK but got “–”, so it must exist but not in position 3; GLIMP has I in position 3 – that would be invalid.  
Oops, I made a mistake. Let’s choose another.

Try “DILLY”:
- Contains D, I, L, Y – but only 4 distinct letters, and Y is okay.
- I is in position 2 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” and in position 3).
- L is in position 3 – allowed (since in FLICK it was “–” in position 2).

But DILLY is 5 letters and valid. However, let’s ensure it meets all criteria:
- Uses D, I, L, Y (L appears twice is okay).
- I is in position 2 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 3).
- L is in position 3 – okay (since it must be somewhere but not position 2).

Good choice. So DILLY is a valid next guess.

Another good candidate is “HILLY” but H is also unused. Let’s go with DILLY.

Current known facts (combining all feedback):

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, B, T, F, C, K, M, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   I (position unknown)  
   L (position unknown)

3. Positional constraints discovered so far:
   - I cannot be in position 3 (because in UNBIT it was correct in position 3, but in FLICK it was marked “-”, meaning it must be elsewhere—contradiction).  
   Correction: in FLICK, I was in position 3 and got “-”, which means I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   Therefore I must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

   - L cannot be in position 2 (from FLICK it got “-” in position 2) and cannot be in position 3 (from PILMY it got “-” in position 3).  
   Therefore L must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

4. Letters still allowed (not in the forbidden list):  
   D, G, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z  
   (and I and L which we already know must appear)

5. We have two letters confirmed (I and L) and need three more distinct letters from the allowed set.

6. P got “-” in position 1, so P is in the word but not in position 1.

Let’s try to pick a word that satisfies all these constraints and also tests new positions for I and L.

Possible word structure:
- Must contain I and L, and also P.
- Positions:
   - I cannot be 3.
   - L cannot be 2 or 3.
   - P cannot be 1.

Let’s try “LIPID”:
   L is in position 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), P in 3 (allowed since P only cannot be 1), I in 4 (repeats I), D in 5 (allowed).  
But I appears twice—no rule against it, but we’d rather not repeat letters to maximize new info.

Try “PLAID”:
   P in 1 (forbidden, P got “-” in position 1 = cannot be 1).  

Try “PLUGH”:
   P in 1 (forbidden).  

Try “DWILG” – not a valid English word.

Valid 5-letter word: “PLAID” but P in 1 is out.

Alternative valid word: “PILED”:
   P in 1 (forbidden).  

“HILID” – invalid.

“GILDS” – S is out.

“WILDS” – S is out.

“LIMIT” – T is out.

“LIVED”:
   L in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), V in 3 (allowed), E is out (from AROSE).  E is out.

“LIGHD” – invalid.

Another candidate: “LIPPY” – Y is out.

“LIPID” is the only remaining valid word that uses P, I, L, and new letters.  
Let’s use LIPID to test the positions.

But note: LIPID has I twice, which might not give much extra info.  
However, it satisfies all constraints and is a valid English word.
