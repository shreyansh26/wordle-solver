For my first guess in Wordle, I want a word that has common letters and gives me the best chance of getting useful information. Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. Some popular choices are:

- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E) 
- CRISP (C,R,I,S,P)
- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)

However, I need to choose one that's most balanced. After considering options like CRANE, SLATE, or STARE, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers several very common letters (C,R,A,N,E) and has a good mix of consonants and vowels. This should give me solid information about which of these letters are in the word and potentially their positions.

A good next word maximizes information: we still need to test consonants like S, T, L, D, etc. A balanced choice that meets the constraints is “RAISE”:
– Contains R, A, E (all required).
– Adds new common consonants S and I.
– Satisfies placement constraints: R is in slot 1 (allowed), A is in slot 2 (allowed), E is in slot 5 (but feedback says E cannot be in slot 5) – oops, that violates the E position.

Let’s pick “TEARY” instead:
– Contains A, E, R.
– Adds T and Y (new letters).
– R is in slot 4 (allowed).

Try “EARLY”:

Let me extract what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)

From CRANE:
- C, N are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From EARLY:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- L is NOT in the word.
- Y is NOT in the word.

Combine these facts:
Letters confirmed in the word: R, A, E
Letters excluded so far: C, N, L, Y
Positions we now know:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, A, and E exactly once, avoids C, N, L, Y, and respects the positional exclusions.

Possible consonants to test next: S, T, D, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, Z (excluding already eliminated letters).

A good next word should test new common consonants and provide maximum information. Let me try to place the known letters (R, A, E) in allowed positions and add two new consonants.

Candidate positions:
- R can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be in 2, 3, or 4.

One promising word is ""STARE"":
- Contains S, T, A, R, E.
- Checks all required letters.
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5).
However, E would be in position 5, which is excluded (from CRANE feedback). So ""STARE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""TREAD"":
- T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5).
But R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE), so invalid.

Try ""AROSE"":
- A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5).
R is in position 2, which is excluded. Invalid.

Try ""RETAG"":
- R(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), G(5).
This satisfies:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (allowed).
- Adds new consonants T and G.
- Excludes none of the forbidden letters.

From CRANE:

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From EARLY:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- L is NOT in the word.
- Y is NOT in the word.

Combine these facts:
Letters confirmed in the word: R, A, E
Letters excluded so far: C, N, L, Y
Positions we now know:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, A, and E exactly once, avoids C, N, L, Y, and respects the positional exclusions.

Possible consonants to test next: S, T, D, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, Z (excluding already eliminated letters).

A good next word should test new common consonants and provide maximum information. Let me try to place the known letters (R, A, E) in allowed positions and add two new consonants.

Candidate positions:
- R can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- A can be in 1, 4, or 5.
- E can be in 2, 3, or 4.

One promising word is ""STARE"":
- Contains S, T, A, R, E.
- Checks all required letters.
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), E(5).
However, E would be in position 5, which is excluded (from CRANE feedback). So ""STARE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""TREAD"":
- T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5).
But R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE), so invalid.

Try ""AROSE"":
- A(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5).
R is in position 2, which is excluded. Invalid.

Try ""RETAG"":
- R(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), G(5).
This satisfies:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (allowed).
- Adds new consonants T and G.
- Excludes none of the forbidden letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters confirmed to be in the word (somewhere):
- R (not in positions 2, 3, or 1)
- A (not in positions 2, 3, or 4)
- E (not in positions 1, 5, or 2)

Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word:
C, N, L, Y, T, G

Positions excluded so far:
- R ≠ 1, 2, 3
- A ≠ 2, 3, 4
- E ≠ 1, 2, 5

Therefore:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- A must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 3 or 4

Check for clashes:
- If R is in 4, E could be in 3 or 4, but not both in 4 → E must be in 3
- If R is in 5, A could be in 1 or 5, but can’t both be in 5 → A must be in 1

Thus two possible skeletons:
1. A _ E R _   (A1, E3, R4, positions 2 & 5 unknown)
2. A _ _ E R   (A1, E4, R5, position 2 & 3 unknown)

Letters still allowed (excluding C,N,L,Y,T,G): B, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting one of the skeletons and using only allowed letters.

For skeleton 1: A _ E R _
Try A B E R _ → ABEER (invalid), ABEAR (invalid), AFEAR (invalid), AMER_ (no), AVERB (no), AWE R_ (no)

For skeleton 2: A _ _ E R
Try A S P E R (ASPER – archaic but valid), A S I E R (ASIER – not common), A S H E R (ASHER), A S S E R (AS SER – not a word), A D V E R (ADVER – no), A S P E R (ASPER) seems the best fit. AS PER is listed as a variant form for “as per”, acceptable in Scrabble. Another clean one is “AFTER”, but T is excluded. “ASHER” uses S, H, E, R, A – all allowed letters, and is a common name. “ASHER” fits the pattern A S _ E R (A1, S2, E4, R5, H3). H is allowed. So ASHER looks perfect.

Check:
- A1 (allowed), S2 (new), H3 (new), E4 (allowed), R5 (allowed)
- Contains required letters A, E, R in valid positions

Common starting words often include vowels and frequent consonants. Some popular choices are:\n\n- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)\n- SLATE (S,L,A,T,E) \n- CRISP (C,R,I,S,P)\n- ADIEU (A,D,I,E,U)\n\nHowever, I need to choose one that\'s most balanced. After considering options like CRANE, SLATE, or STARE, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers several very common letters (C,R,A,N,E) and has a good mix of consonants and vowels.

We now have:

- A is in position 1 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is in position 5 (✓).
- Letters S and H are NOT in the word.
- Letters already ruled out: C, N, L, Y, T, G, S, H.

So the word looks like:

A _ _ E R

Letters still allowed for the two blanks: B, D, F, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We just need two more distinct letters from the allowed set that make a real 5-letter English word of the form A _ _ E R.

Let’s list plausible candidates:

- AIDER – uses I and D (both allowed)
- AIMER – uses I and M (both allowed)
- AFIRE – uses F and I (but F and I allowed)
- ABLER – uses B and L (L excluded)
- AMVER – not a standard word
- AWNER – W allowed, N excluded
- ACKER – C excluded
- AUGER – uses U and G (G excluded)
- AIDER – I and D both allowed and AIDER is valid.

Check AIDER:
- A1 (ok), I2 (allowed), D3 (allowed), E4 (ok), R5 (ok) – no forbidden letters.

Therefore AIDER is the logical next guess.
