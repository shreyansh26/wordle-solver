For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can quickly provide information about the presence or absence of key vowels and consonants. The best starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequently used consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain

Popular strategic first guesses include words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""SLATE."" These cover many high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) which are all very common in English words.

From the first guess RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.

- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

- A is NOT in position 2 (original position 2).

Summary of what we know after two guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, I, T, M  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, E  
3. Additional positional constraints:
   - A is **not** in position 2 (from RAISE) and **not** in position 4 (from STEAM).  
   - S is **not** in position 1 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 4 (from RAISE).  
   - E is **not** in position 2 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 5 (from RAISE).

So the word must:
- Contain A, S, E exactly once each (since STEAM already shows A once and E once, and we’ve had no indicators of duplicates).
- Place A in position 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
- Place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- Place E in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  

We also need two more distinct letters which are not R, I, T, M.

Let’s list out possible positions for A, S, E satisfying the above:

Try A in 3:
- _ _ A _ _
   – S can be 2 or 5
   – E can be 1 or 4

   Case: S in 2, E in 1 → E S A _ _
      Need two more letters (not R, I, T, M). Example: E S A _ _ → ESAXY – but we need valid 5-letter words. Try “ESCAL” – but L is allowed. “ESCAL” uses A, S, E once each, but it’s 5 letters. Actually “ESCAL” is 5 letters but it’s not a common word.

   Case: S in 2, E in 4 → _ S A E _
      Need valid words: “BASED” – but D is allowed, and it contains A, S, E. Let’s check if this fits all constraints:
         - B is new letter, not R, I, T, M  
         - A in 3 (ok), S in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok).  
         - Doesn’t repeat any letters.  
      Word “BASED” is valid 5-letter English.

Another candidate: “CEASE”
   - C, E, A, S, E – repeats E, but we don’t know if duplicates exist. However feedback so far has not indicated duplicates. So safer to avoid duplicates.

Another: “LEASE”
   - L, E, A, S, E – same E duplicate.

“CASED”
   - C, A, S, E, D – all unique, A in 2 (no), so invalid.

“SABLE”
   - S in 1 (no), invalid.

“PEASE”
   - P, E, A, S, E – E duplicate.

“ABASE”
   - A in 1 and 3 – duplicates A, probably not.

“BEAST”
   - B, E, A, S, T – but T is excluded.

“CHASE”
   - C, H, A, S, E – but S is in 4 (invalid).

“DEASH” (not common).

Best candidate appears to be “BASED”.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, A, S, E, D – none of R, I, T, M.  
- Contains A, S, E once each.  
- A in 3 (allowed).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- E in 4 (allowed).  

Looks good.

   - L, E, A, S, E – same E duplicate.

“CASED”
   - C, A, S, E, D – all unique, A in 2 (no), so invalid.

“SABLE”
   - S in 1 (no), invalid.

“PEASE”
   - P, E, A, S, E – E duplicate.

“ABASE”
   - A in 1 and 3 – duplicates A, probably not.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters that can quickly provide information about the presence or absence of key vowels and consonants. The best starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequently used consonants (R, T, N, S, L)
- Avoid duplicate letters to maximize information gain

Popular strategic first guesses include words like ""RAISE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""SLATE."" These cover many high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) which are all very common in English words.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R or I.
- Contains A, S, and E.
- A is NOT in position 2 (original position 2).
- S is NOT in position 4 (original position 4).
- E is NOT in position 5 (original position 5).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Excludes R and I.
- Includes A, S, and E.
- Places A somewhere other than position 2.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible next guess: ""PEASE""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (not 2).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4, so this is bad).
  
Alternative: ""EASEL""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (but feedback says A is not in position 2). Doesn't work.

Alternative: ""SABLE""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (no). Doesn't work.

Alternative: ""CHASE""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 4 (no, conflict with feedback).
  
Alternative: ""LEASE""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (no). Doesn't work.

Alternative: ""STEAK""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 (ok, not position 4).
- E is in position 2 (ok, not position 5).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
This seems valid.

But let's think of another: ""SEATS""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 and 5 (position 4 is ok since S isn't there).
- E is in position 2 (ok).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
This is also valid.

Alternative: ""STEAM""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 (ok).
- E is in position 2 (ok).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
Valid.

Between these, ""STEAM"" seems good as it introduces new letter M which could help narrow down.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEAM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after two guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, I, T, M  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, E  
3. Additional positional constraints:
   - A is **not** in position 2 (from RAISE) and **not** in position 4 (from STEAM).  
   - S is **not** in position 1 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 4 (from RAISE).  
   - E is **not** in position 2 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 5 (from RAISE).

So the word must:
- Contain A, S, E exactly once each (since STEAM already shows A once and E once, and we’ve had no indicators of duplicates).
- Place A in position 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
- Place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- Place E in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  

We also need two more distinct letters which are not R, I, T, M.

Let’s list out possible positions for A, S, E satisfying the above:

Try A in 3:
- _ _ A _ _
   – S can be 2 or 5
   – E can be 1 or 4

   Case: S in 2, E in 1 → E S A _ _
      Need two more letters (not R, I, T, M). Example: E S A _ _ → ESAXY – but we need valid 5-letter words. Try “ESCAL” – but L is allowed. “ESCAL” uses A, S, E once each, but it’s 5 letters. Actually “ESCAL” is 5 letters but it’s not a common word.

   Case: S in 2, E in 4 → _ S A E _
      Need valid words: “BASED” – but D is allowed, and it contains A, S, E. Let’s check if this fits all constraints:
         - B is new letter, not R, I, T, M  
         - A in 3 (ok), S in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok).  
         - Doesn’t repeat any letters.  
      Word “BASED” is valid 5-letter English.

Another candidate: “CEASE”
   - C, E, A, S, E – repeats E, but we don’t know if duplicates exist. However feedback so far has not indicated duplicates. So safer to avoid duplicates.

Another: “LEASE”
   - L, E, A, S, E – same E duplicate.

“CASED”
   - C, A, S, E, D – all unique, A in 2 (no), so invalid.

“SABLE”
   - S in 1 (no), invalid.

“PEASE”
   - P, E, A, S, E – E duplicate.

“ABASE”
   - A in 1 and 3 – duplicates A, probably not.

Step 2 – update the global constraints  
Known letters that must appear: A, S, E.  
Known letters that must NOT appear: R, I, T, M, B, D.  
Known positions:  
- E is locked in position 4.  
- A cannot be in position 2 (from both RAISE and BASED) and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) and cannot be in position 3 (BASED shows A(-) when it was in position 3). So A must be in position 1 or 5.  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from RAISE) and cannot be in position 3 (BASED) and cannot be in position 1 (from STEAM). So S must be in position 2 or 5.

We still need two additional distinct letters that are not among R, I, T, M, B, D.

- S is in position 4 (no, conflict with feedback).
  
Alternative: ""LEASE""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (no). Doesn't work.

Alternative: ""STEAK""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 (ok, not position 4).
- E is in position 2 (ok, not position 5).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
This seems valid.

But let's think of another: ""SEATS""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 and 5 (position 4 is ok since S isn't there).
- E is in position 2 (ok).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
This is also valid.

Alternative: ""STEAM""
- Contains A, S, E.
- A is in position 3 (ok).
- S is in position 1 (ok).
- E is in position 2 (ok).
- Doesn't contain R or I.
Valid.

Between these, ""STEAM"" seems good as it introduces new letter M which could help narrow down.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEAM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) M(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Summary of what we know after two guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, I, T, M  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, E  
3. Additional positional constraints:
   - A is **not** in position 2 (from RAISE) and **not** in position 4 (from STEAM).  
   - S is **not** in position 1 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 4 (from RAISE).  
   - E is **not** in position 2 (from STEAM) and **not** in position 5 (from RAISE).

So the word must:
- Contain A, S, E exactly once each (since STEAM already shows A once and E once, and we’ve had no indicators of duplicates).
- Place A in position 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
- Place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- Place E in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  

We also need two more distinct letters which are not R, I, T, M.

Let’s list out possible positions for A, S, E satisfying the above:

Try A in 3:
- _ _ A _ _
   – S can be 2 or 5
   – E can be 1 or 4

   Case: S in 2, E in 1 → E S A _ _
      Need two more letters (not R, I, T, M). Example: E S A _ _ → ESAXY – but we need valid 5-letter words. Try “ESCAL” – but L is allowed. “ESCAL” uses A, S, E once each, but it’s 5 letters. Actually “ESCAL” is 5 letters but it’s not a common word.

   Case: S in 2, E in 4 → _ S A E _
      Need valid words: “BASED” – but D is allowed, and it contains A, S, E. Let’s check if this fits all constraints:
         - B is new letter, not R, I, T, M  
         - A in 3 (ok), S in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok).  
         - Doesn’t repeat any letters.  
      Word “BASED” is valid 5-letter English.

Another candidate: “CEASE”
   - C, E, A, S, E – repeats E, but we don’t know if duplicates exist. However feedback so far has not indicated duplicates. So safer to avoid duplicates.

Another: “LEASE”
   - L, E, A, S, E – same E duplicate.

“CASED”
   - C, A, S, E, D – all unique, A in 2 (no), so invalid.

“SABLE”
   - S in 1 (no), invalid.

“PEASE”
   - P, E, A, S, E – E duplicate.

“ABASE”
   - A in 1 and 3 – duplicates A, probably not.

“BEAST”
   - B, E, A, S, T – but T is excluded.

“CHASE”
   - C, H, A, S, E – but S is in 4 (invalid).

“DEASH” (not common).

Best candidate appears to be “BASED”.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, A, S, E, D – none of R, I, T, M.  
- Contains A, S, E once each.  
- A in 3 (allowed).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- E in 4 (allowed).  

Looks good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEAM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) M(x)
Guess 3: BASED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Step 1 – extract the new information from Guess 3  
BASED → B(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

- B and D are NOT in the word.  
- E is in the word **and is in the 4th position.**  
- A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.  
- S is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.

Step 2 – update the global constraints  
Known letters that must appear: A, S, E.  
Known letters that must NOT appear: R, I, T, M, B, D.  
Known positions:  
- E is locked in position 4.  
- A cannot be in position 2 (from both RAISE and BASED) and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) and cannot be in position 3 (BASED shows A(-) when it was in position 3). So A must be in position 1 or 5.  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from RAISE) and cannot be in position 3 (BASED) and cannot be in position 1 (from STEAM). So S must be in position 2 or 5.

We still need two additional distinct letters that are not among R, I, T, M, B, D.

Step 3 – enumerate possible placements  
Case A: A in 1, S in 2  
Pattern: A S _ E _  
Need two more letters for positions 3 and 5 from the allowed set {C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
Reasonable common word: A S C E N → ASCEN (not a word); A S C E T → ACETS (invalid, T banned); A S H E N → ASHEN (valid).

Case B: A in 1, S in 5  
Pattern: A _ _ E S  
Need letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Possible: A F L E S (AFLES – no); A C H E S (ACHES – valid).

Case C: A in 5, S in 2  
Pattern: _ S _ E A  
Possible: C S L E A (CSLEA – no); F S L E A (FSLEA – no); G S N E A (GSNEA – no). Hard to form common word.

Case D: A in 5, S in 5 (impossible) – skip.

Among the candidates, ASHEN and ACHES both satisfy all constraints and use allowed letters.  
ACHES has C and H in the remaining slots, both allowed, and fits perfectly:
- Letters: A, C, H, E, S – none of the banned letters.  
- E is in position 4.  
- A is in position 1 (not 2, 3, 4).  
- S is in position 5 (not 1, 3, 4).  

Therefore ACHES is a strong next guess.

Constraints on H:
- Must appear once somewhere.  
- Positions 1, 4 are taken by A and E.  
- Position 2 is now S, so H must be in 3 or 5.  
- We need another letter for whichever position H doesn’t take, but it must be a new allowed letter (not R,I,T,M,B,D,C).
