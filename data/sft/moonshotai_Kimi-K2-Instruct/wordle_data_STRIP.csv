For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. Ideally, this word should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many different letters as possible
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Some good starting words that meet these criteria include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 3 vowels which might be too vowel-heavy)

I'll go with SLATE as it includes common letters S, L, A, T, E and gives me good coverage of both vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback for SLATE:
- S(✓): first letter is S and is in the correct position.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the word must start with S, contain T somewhere other than the 4th slot, and must not contain L, A, E.

Possible structure: S _ _ _ _  
T must appear in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in 4).

Let’s look for common 5-letter English words starting with S and containing T, but no L/A/E.

Some candidates:
- STING (has I, N, G – none ruled out)
- STUNT (has U, N – none ruled out)
- SWIFT (has W, I, F – none ruled out)
- SPORT (has P, O, R – none ruled out)
- SHIFT (has H, I, F – none ruled out)

Among these, STING and STUNT are strong, but STING uses I, N, G – all still possibilities, and it places T in the 2nd slot, which is allowed.

Have a good mix of vowels and consonants\n\nSome good starting words that meet these criteria include:\n- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)\n- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (but this has 3 vowels which might be too vowel-heavy)\n\nI'll go with SLATE as it includes common letters S, L, A, T, E and gives me good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)  
   – S is fixed in position 1.  
   – T is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – L, A, E are not in the word.

2. STING → S(✓) T(✓) I(-) N(x) G(x)  
   – S and T are fixed in positions 1 and 2, so word starts ST _ _ _.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – N and G are not in the word.

3. STICK → S(✓) T(✓) I(-) C(x) K(x)  
   – C and K are not in the word.  
   – I is still “in the word but not shown” so it must be in position 4 or 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: S T _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: I
- Letters already eliminated: L, A, E, N, G, C, K
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STING) and is not in position 4 (STICK placed it there and it only got “-”), so I must be in position 5.

That pins the word structure: S T _ _ I

Remaining letters to test (common ones not yet excluded): B, D, F, H, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common ST _ _ I word using only allowed letters.  Obvious candidate:
- STYMI (but Y, M are allowed; however STYMI is uncommon)
- STUMI (not a word)
- STORI (not English)
- STRIP (letters R, P are allowed)  
- STRIP fits all rules: starts ST, ends I, uses only allowed letters R, P.

No conflicts found.  Let’s try STRIP.
