For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has a good variety of common letters to maximize information gain. Words with common vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, N, L are typically good starting points. 

Looking at common English letters, I'll consider words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Updated knowledge:

- Pattern so far: _ L A _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, M, P
- C is in the word but is in the wrong position (so C must be in position 1, 4, or 5)

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, R, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Because C must be placed somewhere else, and we still need a vowel for either position 1, 4 or 5, I’ll aim for a word that places C in position 4 or 5 and uses new vowels and consonants.

Candidate words:
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – keeps C out but introduces F, N, K
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – introduces G, N, D
- BLAND (B, L, A, N, D) – introduces B, N, D

None of these use C, so let’s try to use C in position 4 or 5. Which words fit _ L A _ _ and end with C? Not many. So instead, let’s try C in position 1 again but with different last letters, even though C was marked “-” in position 1 before – it just means C is not in position 1.

Actually, let’s use C in position 4. For example, “ULCER” doesn’t fit the pattern. Another idea: place C in position 5, like “FLAC_” but we need a valid word.

Actually, let’s try “FLACK”:
- F (new)
- L (fixed)
- A (fixed)
- C (must be here or 5)
- K (new)

But “FLACK” isn’t ideal.

Better: “GLAND” is solid but doesn’t use C.

Wait, let’s ensure C appears once more. Let’s consider C in position 4: “ULAC_” isn’t valid. “ALACK” doesn’t work.

Alternative: “CLANG” but C in position 1 was marked “-”, so C can’t be first.

Next best: “BLAND” (B, L, A, N, D) – introduces B, N, D.

But we still haven’t placed C. Let’s instead choose “BLANK” which uses B, N, K, and keeps C available for placement later.

However, we know C must be in position 4 or 5. Let’s try “FLACK” isn’t valid. “PLACK” is invalid (P is out).

Next, try “CLANG” isn’t possible (C can’t be first). So we need a word where C appears but not first.

“ULCER” fits but E is out. “OCCUR” has double C and U, but C positions overlap.

Instead, let’s just find a word fitting _ L A _ _ with new letters and ensure C is covered. The simplest valid word fitting _ L A _ _ is “BLAND”.

But I realize I have to place C somewhere. Let’s try “FLACK” isn’t standard. “ALACK” is invalid.

Next idea: use C in position 4, so word must be _ L A C _. Candidates: “CLACK” (invalid C first), “BLACK”.

“BLACK”:
- B
- L (fixed)
- A (fixed)
- C (must be here)

This uses C in position 4, which is allowed since C was marked “-” only for position 1.

Next, try “CLANG” isn’t possible (C can’t be first). So we need a word where C appears but not first.

“ULCER” fits but E is out. “OCCUR” has double C and U, but C positions overlap.

Instead, let’s just find a word fitting _ L A _ _ with new letters and ensure C is covered. The simplest valid word fitting _ L A _ _ is “BLAND”.

But I realize I have to place C somewhere. Let’s try “FLACK” isn’t standard. “ALACK” is invalid.

Next idea: use C in position 4, so word must be _ L A C _. Candidates: “CLACK” (invalid C first), “BLACK”.

“BLACK”:
- B
- L (fixed)
- A (fixed)
- C (must be here)
- K

This uses C in position 4, which is allowed since C was marked “-” only for position 1.

Let’s go with “BLACK”.

From all feedback so far:

_ L A C K

Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are now locked as L A C K.
Only the first letter is still unknown.

Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, M, P, B  
Letters already placed: L, A, C, K (so they are used)

Remaining consonants to test for position 1: F, G, H, N, R, W, D, etc.

A very common starting consonant is F.  
Let’s try “FLACK” – but the word must be a valid 5-letter word and we already have L-A-C-K fixed, so we just need any consonant followed by LACK.  
The only common word is “FLACK” itself, but it uses B in BLACK which is ruled out.  
Another legal word is “CLACK” – but C in position 1 was marked “-” in Guess 2, so C can’t be first.  

Next common letter: G. “GLACK” isn’t valid.  

Next: H. “HLACK” isn’t valid.  

Next: N. “NLACK” isn’t valid.  

Next: R. “RLACK” isn’t valid.  

We need a real word. The only valid English word fitting the pattern _ L A C K is actually “BLACK” (already tried) and “FLACK” (not standard).  

I realize we need to pick a valid 5-letter word starting with a new letter followed by LACK. The only recognized word is “ALACK”, but A is already in position 3.  

Wait — the pattern is _ L A C K, but “ALACK” has A first, which would duplicate A in position 3.  

Realizing this, the only valid word left is “FLACK”, but B was ruled out, and F hasn’t been tried yet.  

Checking dictionary: “FLACK” is a valid 5-letter word meaning publicity agent.  

So our next choice is “FLACK”.
