Since this is the first guess with no feedback to work from, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess should contain common English letters and ideally include vowels to quickly identify which vowels are in the word.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S,L,A,T,E)
- CRANE (C,R,A,N,E)
- RAISE (R,A,I,S,E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has:
- 3 vowels (A,I,E) to quickly identify vowel presence
- Common consonants (R,S) that appear frequently in English words
- Good letter distribution that can help narrow down possibilities

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: exists in the word, but is in the wrong position (currently in position 1). So R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5.
- A: not in the word at all.
- I: exists and is in the correct position (position 3).
- S: not in the word at all.
- E: exists and is in the correct position (position 5).

So we know the pattern is: _ _ I _ E, with an R somewhere in positions 2,3,4, or 5. But positions 3 and 5 are already taken by I and E, so R must be in position 2 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ R I _ E
- _ _ I R E

We also know that A and S are not in the word, so we can't use those letters.

- CIRE? Not common.
- HIRE? 4 letters.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Pattern confirmed: _ R I _ E  
(R in 2, I in 3, E in 5)

Letters known to be absent: A, S, G, P, B  
Letters still “alive”: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Additional info:
- D appeared in BRIDE and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong spot).  
  Since D was in slot 4 and is wrong there, D must be in slot 1.

So the word has the fixed form: D R I _ E  
We just need a single consonant for slot 4.

Possible consonants for slot 4 (not already excluded):  
C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for real five-letter words that fit D R I _ E:

DRICE – not a word  
DRIFE – not a word  
DRIKE – not a word  
DRILE – not a word  
DRIME – not a word
