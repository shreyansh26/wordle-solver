For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to cover as many frequently used letters as possible to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Commonly recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- OATER (O, A, T, E, R)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because it includes:
1. C - one of the most common consonants
2. R - very common in English words
3. A - the most common vowel
4. N - a common consonant
5. E - the most common letter in English

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters across different positions, allowing us to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in CRANE are now disqualified.
Since the first word used C, R, A, N, E and none of them appear, we need a word that uses entirely different letters.

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a word that contains the next-most-common letters we haven’t tried yet.  
Common high-frequency letters we still have available: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, etc.

One classic second-guess choice after an all-gray CRANE is “SLOTH” or “STOIC”.  
Let’s choose “STOIC” because it hits several common consonants (S, T) plus the high-value vowels O and I.

Letters used this time: S, T, O, I, C (but note that C was already ruled out in position 1, so we’d rather avoid it).  
Therefore, “SLOTH” is safer: S, L, O, T, H — none of these were in CRANE.

But “SLOTH” leaves out I, which is very common.  
A better balance is “STOIC” even though C is already ruled out; however, we prefer to avoid any letter already ruled out.  

Another strong candidate: “SLIMY” (S, L, I, M, Y).

The most balanced, completely fresh set of common letters: S, T, O, L, D → “STOLD” isn’t a word.  
After checking valid 5-letter words, “STOIC” is valid and gives us S, T, O, I, C — but C is already out.  
Therefore, “STOIC” is not a good choice because C has been marked ✗.

Let’s pick “SLOTH” instead (S, L, O, T, H) since none of those letters appeared in CRANE and they are all common.

- L(✗), O(✗), T(✗): also eliminated.  
- H(-): appears somewhere but NOT last.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Positions 2-3-4-5 must avoid C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T.  
- H exists but is NOT in position 5.

Letters still possible (common ones): B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,Y …

- S,H,I,P,S? No.  
- S,U,I,T,H? No (T eliminated).  
- S,H,I,N? Need fifth letter.

- “SHIM” needs fifth letter.  
- “SHIM” + Y → “SHIMY”? Not valid.  
- “SHIP” + ? → “SHIPS” (P and S both already used/eliminated S is first).  
- “SHIV” + ? → “SHIVS” (S already used).  
- “SHY” + ? → “SHYLY”? Too many Y’s.  
- “SKUNK”? K and U are still allowed, but N eliminated.  
- “SHUCK”? C eliminated.  
- “SHIMD”? Not a word.

- SHILO? O eliminated.

Letters: S (✓ first), H (must be somewhere else, here pos 2), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (second S, but feedback only told us S is first letter, so second S is allowed because we have no info on multiplicity).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,SUSHI,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The goal is to cover as many frequently used letters as possible to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Commonly recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- OATER (O, A, T, E, R)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because it includes:
1. C - one of the most common consonants
2. R - very common in English words
3. A - the most common vowel
4. N - a common consonant
5. E - the most common letter in English

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters across different positions, allowing us to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in CRANE are now disqualified.
Since the first word used C, R, A, N, E and none of them appear, we need a word that uses entirely different letters.

A good second-guess strategy is to pick a word that contains the next-most-common letters we haven’t tried yet.  
Common high-frequency letters we still have available: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, etc.

One classic second-guess choice after an all-gray CRANE is “SLOTH” or “STOIC”.  
Let’s choose “STOIC” because it hits several common consonants (S, T) plus the high-value vowels O and I.

Letters used this time: S, T, O, I, C (but note that C was already ruled out in position 1, so we’d rather avoid it).  
Therefore, “SLOTH” is safer: S, L, O, T, H — none of these were in CRANE.

But “SLOTH” leaves out I, which is very common.  
A better balance is “STOIC” even though C is already ruled out; however, we prefer to avoid any letter already ruled out.  

Another strong candidate: “SLIMY” (S, L, I, M, Y).

The most balanced, completely fresh set of common letters: S, T, O, L, D → “STOLD” isn’t a word.  
After checking valid 5-letter words, “STOIC” is valid and gives us S, T, O, I, C — but C is already out.  
Therefore, “STOIC” is not a good choice because C has been marked ✗.

Let’s pick “SLOTH” instead (S, L, O, T, H) since none of those letters appeared in CRANE and they are all common.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) O(x) T(x) H(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We have two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – CRANE (C,R,A,N,E) → all letters eliminated (✗ each).

Round 2 – SLOTH  
- S(✓): must be the FIRST letter.  
- L(✗), O(✗), T(✗): also eliminated.  
- H(-): appears somewhere but NOT last.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Positions 2-3-4-5 must avoid C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T.  
- H exists but is NOT in position 5.

Letters still possible (common ones): B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,Y …  
We need a five-letter word beginning with S that contains H somewhere NOT at the end and uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate list:
- S,B,I,D,H, etc. → “SIDHU”? Not valid.  
- S,H,I,P,S? No.  
- S,U,I,T,H? No (T eliminated).  
- S,H,I,N? Need fifth letter.

Looking at a valid word list:
- “SUKIH”? Not valid.  
- “SHIM” needs fifth letter.  
- “SHIM” + Y → “SHIMY”? Not valid.  
- “SHIP” + ? → “SHIPS” (P and S both already used/eliminated S is first).  
- “SHIV” + ? → “SHIVS” (S already used).  
- “SHY” + ? → “SHYLY”? Too many Y’s.  
- “SKUNK”? K and U are still allowed, but N eliminated.  
- “SHUCK”? C eliminated.  
- “SHIMD”? Not a word.

Let me try “SHIM” + another allowed letter:  
“SHIM” + Y → “SHIMY” – invalid.  
“SHIM” + P → “SHIMP”? No.  
“SHIM” + U → “SHIMU”? No.  
“SHIV” + E → E eliminated.  
“SHIV” + A → A eliminated.

“SHIM” + S → “SHIMS” – second S not helpful.  
“SHIK” + ? → “SHIKI”? No.

Another approach: jump to “SH” start.  
Valid words beginning with SH using allowed letters:

- SHIED – uses I, E (E eliminated).  
- SHIED – no.  
- SHIFT – T eliminated.  
- SHIVY – Y allowed, but V allowed. “SHIVY” is not common.  
- SHIMD? No.  
- SHIPY? No.  
- SHUCK – C out.  
- SHYLY – too many Y’s.  
- SHILO? O eliminated.  
- SHIVS – S already first letter, another S not helpful.

Wait, H can’t be last, so position 5 is not H.

Let me check dictionary list systematically for S _ _ _ _ with letters from B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,P,U,Y,W.

A concise valid word: “SHULI”? No.

Valid words with allowed letters:  
- S I D H U (SIDHU) – not valid.  
- S U I D H – not valid.  
- S H I F T – T eliminated.  
- S H I P S – S already first, another S is ok, but P allowed, S allowed only once? (No, S appears once in feedback so far.)  
- S H I P S – but second S not needed, and P allowed.  
- S H I P S – valid English word? Not really.  

Wait, “SHIPS” – S H I P S – but P is allowed, I is allowed, H is allowed (not last), S is only once? Yes.

I see a clear candidate: “SHIPS”.

Letters: S (✓ first), H (must be somewhere else, here pos 2), I (allowed), P (allowed), S (second S, but feedback only told us S is first letter, so second S is allowed because we have no info on multiplicity).

So “SHIPS” meets all constraints.

(Another option: “SHIMS” – but M is allowed and S is allowed, but we have no info on M yet.)

Let me choose “SHIPS”.

Step 1 – Extract what we know so far  
- Definitely correct: S is the first letter.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, P  
- Letters that exist somewhere in the word but are not yet placed: H, I, S

Step 2 – Map the positions  
Position 1: S (locked)  
Positions 2–5 must contain H, I, and one more S somewhere, plus one additional letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Step 3 – Identify the alphabet still available  
All letters not yet marked ✗:  
B D F G H I K M U W Y    (and another S)

Step 4 – Search for 5-letter words S _ _ _ _ that  
- use H and I exactly once each (so two distinct additional letters, one of which is the second S)  
- use only letters from the allowed set above  
- and obey the positional constraints:  
  – H is NOT in position 2 (because SHIPS gave H(-) in position 2, meaning H is present but not there)  
  – I is NOT in position 3 (SHIPS gave I(-) in position 3, so I exists but not there)  
  – S is NOT in position 5 (SHIPS gave S(-) in position 5, so another S exists but not there)

Step 5 – Generate candidates  
We need S _ _ _ _ with the letters: {H, I, S, ?, ?}, where the two ? come from B D F G K M U W Y, and both H and I must appear once, and an extra S appears once.

Possible patterns:  
- S I _ _ _ with H somewhere 3-4 and another S in one of the remaining two spots.  
  – Example: S I _ H S → but S cannot be last → invalid.  
  – S I _ S H → H cannot be last → invalid.  
- S _ I _ _ with H somewhere else.  
  – Example: S _ I H S → S last invalid.  
  – S _ I S H → H last invalid.  
- S H _ _ _ with I somewhere else.  
  – Example: S H _ I S → S last invalid.  
  – S H _ S I → I last allowed.  
  – S H I _ S → S last invalid.  
- S _ _ H _ with I somewhere else.  
  – Example: S _ I H _ → H in 4 allowed; need one more letter and a second S, but then S would have to be in 2 or 3, which are not excluded.  
  – S _ _ I H → H last invalid.  

A pattern that works: S _ _ H _  
We know H must be present and not in position 2, so put H in 4.  
We know I must be present and not in 3, so put I in 2 or 5. 5 is allowed for I.  
We need one more S somewhere: positions 3 or 5. 5 is allowed for S (only the final position was ruled out for S in feedback).  

So candidate: S I _ H S – but S final is invalid.  
Candidate: S _ I H S – final S invalid.  
Candidate: S _ S H I – this fits all constraints:  
  – S1 fixed  
  – S3 extra S (allowed)  
  – H4 (allowed)  
  – I5 (allowed)  
  – The middle letter (position 2) must be from B, D, F, G, K, M, U, W, Y.  

Check what single letter in position 2 forms a valid word:  
- S D S H I – no.  
- S U S H I – no.  
- S K S H I – no.  
- S U S H I – no.  
- S Y S H I – no.  
- S U S H I – no.  

None of these are valid.  

Another pattern: S _ _ I H – H last invalid.  
Another pattern: S _ H I _ – I in 4 allowed. Need an extra S.  
  – S _ H I S – S last invalid.  
  – S _ S H I – this is the same pattern as above.  

So we need a valid word of the form S _ S H I or S _ H S I.  

Search valid English words:  
- SUSHI – letters: S, U, S, H, I → exactly S _ S H I with U in position 2.  
  – All letters allowed (U is still allowed).  
  – Positions:  
      1: S ✓  
      2: U allowed  
      3: S allowed (second S)  
      4: H allowed (not in 2)  
      5: I allowed (not in 3)  

This meets every constraint and is a real word.

Therefore, our next guess is SUSHI.
