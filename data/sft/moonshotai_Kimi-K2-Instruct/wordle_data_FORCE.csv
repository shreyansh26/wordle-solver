For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which vowels or consonants are in the word. A good starting word should ideally cover multiple vowels and common consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because:
- It contains three common vowels: A, E
- It has three very common consonants: S, L, T
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, so it's likely to give meaningful feedback

Another strong contender is ""AROSE"" since it covers all five major vowels, but ""SLATE"" gives a better mix of consonants. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it balances vowel and consonant coverage well.

From the first guess (SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)) we know:
- E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

1. Ends with E.

3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

A balanced next guess could be “CRONE”:
- It ends with E (matches known position).
- Letters C, R, O, N are new and common.
- Avoids S, L, A, T.

Current known facts:
1. The letter E is in position 5 (last letter).
2. Letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, N.
3. Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions (from CRONE):
   - C is somewhere, but not in position 1
   - R is somewhere, but not in position 2
   - O is somewhere, but not in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains at least C, R, and O in some positions (but not in their original positions from CRONE)
- Doesn't contain S, L, A, T, N

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 5 is E
- We have C, R, O to place in positions 1-4
- Need two more letters (but we already have C, R, O)

Looking at possible arrangements:
- We could try OCHRE, but H wasn't tested yet
- But we need to place C, R, O in different positions

Let me think of words ending in E with C, R, O:
- FORCE: but has F and ends with CE, but we need to check positions
- OCHRE: has H and positions O(1) C(3) H(4) R(2) E(5)
- CHORE: C(1) H(2) O(3) R(4) E(5)

Looking at CHORE:
- C is in position 1 (originally in position 1 in CRONE, so this would be marked as - again)
- R is in position 4 (originally in position 2, so this is new)
- O is in position 3 (same as original, so this would be - again)

This isn't optimal. Let me try FORCE:
- F is new
- O is in position 2 (originally position 3 - good)
- R is in position 3 (originally position 2 - good)
- C is in position 4 (originally position 1 - good)
- E is correct in position 5

This seems better as it tests F and moves all known letters to new positions.
