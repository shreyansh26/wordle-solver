### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically involves using common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"" are good starting points because they use common vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong opener that includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, N, R) which should help quickly determine which letters are in the word.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, so none of them exist anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must now choose a word that avoids those five letters entirely.  
Looking at common 5-letter words without C, R, A, N, or E, good starting candidates are:

- SLUMS – uses common letters S, L, U, M
- DOUGH – uses D, O, U, G, H
- BIGHT – uses B, I, G, H, T
- SULKY – uses S, U, L, K, Y

Among these, “DOUGH” contains the very common vowel “O” and the high-frequency consonants D, G, H, giving a nice spread of new letters to test. So I’ll pick “DOUGH”.

Current state:
1. Letters absolutely excluded: C, R, A, N, E, D, O, U, G  
2. Letters known to be in the word: H (and it sits in position 5)  
3. Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y  
4. Remaining unused vowels: I, Y  

We need a five-letter word that:
- Ends in H.
- Uses none of the excluded letters.
- Uses as many of the still-available common letters as possible to maximize information.

Good candidate endings are “___SH” or “___TH”, but T is still available while S is also still available. The vowel I is available and quite common. Let me build a word that satisfies:

Focus on “M, I, S, T” plus the known H in last place. The word “SMITH” fits perfectly:
- Letters: S, M, I, T, H
- None of the excluded letters appear.
- Places H correctly in position 5.
- Tests four new letters in one go.

Hence, “SMITH” is my next optimal guess.
