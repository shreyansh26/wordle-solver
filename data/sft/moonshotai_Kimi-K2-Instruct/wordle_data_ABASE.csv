2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" comes to mind as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters. This should give us good feedback about several likely letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE we know:
- Position 1: A is correct (✓)  
- Position 2: R is not in the word (x)  
- Position 3: O is not in the word (x)  
- Position 4: S is correct (✓)  
- Position 5: E is correct (✓)

So the pattern so far is: A _ _ S E  
Letters already confirmed in the word: A, S, E  
Letters already ruled out: R, O  

We now need a five-letter word starting with A, ending with SE, and not containing R or O. Common consonants to try next are D, L, N, T, H, M, etc.  
A simple word that fits: A D D S E → “ADUSE” is not valid. How about “ABASE”? It uses A (confirmed), S and E (confirmed), and avoids R and O.  
But “ABASE” repeats A in position 2 and 3; that’s allowed since we only know R and O are absent.  
Another option is “AMUSE” which uses new letters M and U.  
Checking the pattern A _ _ S E:  
- A(✓) M(-) U(-) S(✓) E(✓) would tell us about M and U.  
“AMUSE” seems like a solid next guess to test M and U while keeping the known positions.

We still need the 2nd and 3rd letters, which must be consonants that have not been ruled out.  
Common unused consonants so far: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y

A 5-letter word that starts with A and ends in SE, without any of R, O, M, U is “ABASE”.  
But “ABASE” repeats the letter A in positions 1, 2, and 3, and we have no information about B yet.

Another candidate: “ABASE” fits the pattern perfectly and only uses letters we haven’t ruled out.  
Let’s try it.
