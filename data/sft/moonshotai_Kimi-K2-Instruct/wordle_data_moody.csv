For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This gives us a good chance to identify or eliminate many common letters early on.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That rules out about 1/3 of the alphabet.  
To maximize new information, we should now use a completely fresh set of common letters.  
A good second-guess word uses frequent consonants and the remaining vowels O and U, e.g.:

- TOUCH  
- MOUND  
- CLOUD  

Among these, “TOUCH” includes:
T, O, U, C, H – none of which were in RAISE and all are relatively common.

Feedback so far:
- R, A, I, S, E, T, U, C, H are all absent.
- O is confirmed present and in position 2.

We know:
- The word is _ O _ _ _
- Remaining usable letters include: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels (none left except sometimes Y).  
Most useful are common consonants that haven’t been tried: B, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, W, Y.

We want a 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ _ using only these letters.  
Some candidate words: “BOGUS” (but uses U and S which are already ruled out), “DONUT” (uses N, U, T), “FOLLY”, “GONER”, “JOLLY”, “MOMMY”, “POMMY”, “WOOLY”, “BOBBY”, “BOGGY”, “BOFFO”, “BONEY”, etc.

A good mix of new letters is B, N, Y – so “BONEY” gives B, O, N, E, Y. E is already ruled out, so skip.  
“MOGGY” uses M, O, G, G, Y – none ruled out except G isn’t super-common.  
“FOLLY” uses F, O, L, L, Y – all fresh and common.  
“BLOOM” has B, L, O, O, M – but double O is less likely after first O already in position 2.  
“POLLY” uses P, O, L, L, Y – all fresh except repeated L.

I’ll pick “FOLLY” because it introduces three new common consonants (F, L, Y) and keeps the known O in position 2.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y

Remaining unused, common letters:
Consonants: B D G J K M N P Q V W X Z

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) from the remaining consonants, none repeated.

Good candidates:
- B O O _ Y → impossible, O already set.
- B O D _ Y → BODY? but BODY is 4 letters.
- B O N _ Y → BONNY? but N already tried (L ruled out but N not yet).
Wait, BONNY has N twice, so that’s allowed? But N hasn’t been ruled out yet. Let’s see if BONNY is legal: B, O, N, N, Y. All letters except O, Y are new. N is not ruled out. So BONNY is valid.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- R: very common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- I: another common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: very common vowel

This gives us a good chance to identify or eliminate many common letters early on.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That rules out about 1/3 of the alphabet.  
To maximize new information, we should now use a completely fresh set of common letters.  
A good second-guess word uses frequent consonants and the remaining vowels O and U, e.g.:

- TOUCH  
- MOUND  
- CLOUD  

Among these, “TOUCH” includes:
T, O, U, C, H – none of which were in RAISE and all are relatively common.  
This should quickly tell us which of these new letters are present and where they sit.

- The word is _ O _ _ _
- Remaining usable letters include: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels (none left except sometimes Y).  
Most useful are common consonants that haven’t been tried: B, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, W, Y.

We want a 5-letter word matching _ O _ _ _ using only these letters.  
Some candidate words: “BOGUS” (but uses U and S which are already ruled out), “DONUT” (uses N, U, T), “FOLLY”, “GONER”, “JOLLY”, “MOMMY”, “POMMY”, “WOOLY”, “BOBBY”, “BOGGY”, “BOFFO”, “BONEY”, etc.

A good mix of new letters is B, N, Y – so “BONEY” gives B, O, N, E, Y. E is already ruled out, so skip.  
“MOGGY” uses M, O, G, G, Y – none ruled out except G isn’t super-common.  
“FOLLY” uses F, O, L, L, Y – all fresh and common.  
“BLOOM” has B, L, O, O, M – but double O is less likely after first O already in position 2.  
“POLLY” uses P, O, L, L, Y – all fresh except repeated L.

- P O N D Y → PONDY? Not a word.
- P O P P Y → POPPY — P allowed, and P is still fresh.

Between POPPY and BONNY, both fit. POPPY uses P twice, BONNY uses N twice. POPPY is more common and uses the fresh letter P.

So I’ll go with POPPY.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Confirmed information so far:
- Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, T, U, C, H, F, L, P
- Pattern known: _ O _ _ Y  (position 2 = O, position 5 = Y)

Remaining candidate letters:
Consonants: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
(No other vowels are left except sometimes Y, already fixed at the end.)

We need three distinct new consonants for positions 1, 3, 4.

Common combinations that form real 5-letter words ending in ‑Y:
- B O N D Y → BONDY? Not a word.
- B O O B Y → BOOBY – valid; B and O are allowed (O already placed).
- B O O G Y → BOOGY – valid.
- B O O Z Y → BOOZY – valid.
- D O G G Y → DOGGY – D and G allowed.
- G O O G Y → GOOGY? Not a word.
- J O C K Y → JOCKY (variant spelling of JOCKEY) – C is already ruled out.
- M O O C H Y – too long.
- M O O N Y → MOONY – valid.
- M O O S Y → MOOSY? Not standard.
- N O O B Y → NOOBY? Not standard.
- W O O D Y → WOODY – valid; W, D allowed.
- Z O N K Y → ZONKY? Not standard.

Among the legitimate choices, BOOBY, BOOGY, BOOZY, DOGGY, MOONY, WOODY are all real words.

To introduce fresh letters efficiently, BOOBY uses B twice but nothing else is new; DOGGY uses D, G twice; WOODY uses W, D, plus the already-used O and Y.  
BOOZY uses B, O, Z, Y – Z is a rare letter but still allowed.

I’ll pick BOOZY because it introduces the new letters B, Z and keeps the known O in place 2 and Y in place 5.

Pattern check: B(1) O(2) O(3) Z(4) Y(5) – letters are all within the allowed set.

Known facts after five guesses:

- Letters ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, T, U, C, H, F, L, P, B, Z  
- Pattern confirmed: _ O _ _ Y  
  – Position 2 = O  
  – Position 5 = Y  
- Remaining candidate consonants: D, G, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X  
- No other vowels left (only O and Y are used).

We need a 5-letter word fitting the mask _ O _ _ Y using only the remaining consonants for positions 1, 3, 4.

Real dictionary words that fit:

1. D O G G Y   (D, G, G)  
2. D O N K Y   (D, N, K)  
3. M O N K Y   (M, N, K)  
4. W O O D Y   (W, D, D) – but D is duplicated; still allowed.

The word “DONKY” isn’t a valid English spelling; the correct spelling is DONKEY (but it has E, which is ruled out).  
The actual valid word is DONKY? No, it’s DONKEY.

But DONKEY uses E, which is already ruled out, so the only valid 5-letter words remaining are:

- DOGGY  
- MONKY (not a word, correct is MONKEY, ruled out by E)  
- WOODY  

Therefore, the only remaining valid word with the remaining letters is DOGGY.

All letters in DOGGY (D, O, G, G, Y) are within the allowed set:

- D, G: not yet ruled out  
- O (pos 2) and Y (pos 5) are confirmed

Hence DOGGY must be the secret word.
