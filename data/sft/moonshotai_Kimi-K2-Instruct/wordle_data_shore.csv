For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to help identify what letters might be in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have several of these letters. 

Some popular starting words are:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes C, R, A, N, E which are all very common letters and gives good coverage across different positions.

- R: in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and in position 5 (✓)

2. It contains R, but R is not in position 2.
3. It does NOT contain C, A, or N.

- Has E in position 5.
- Includes R in a different position (not 2).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – but O is not very high-frequency.
- IRATE (I, R, A, T, E) – but A is excluded.
- UTTER (U, T, T, E, R) – but T is repeated and not ideal.
- STREP (S, T, R, E, P) – but P is not super common.
- TIGER (T, I, G, E, R) – G is medium frequency, but still good.

TIGER seems decent because:

Let’s consolidate what we know after the two guesses.

From CRANE:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word and is the 5th letter (position 5).

From TIGER:
- T, I, G are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it is in position 5, so this is consistent).
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5; but 5 is already taken by E, so R is in position 1 or 3).

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains R exactly once, in position 1 or 3.
- Does not contain C, A, N, T, I, G.

Remaining common letters to try: S, L, O, D, H, U, B, F, M, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has R in position 1 or 3.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. R _ _ _ E   (R in position 1)
2. _ _ R _ E  (R in position 3)

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns and using allowed letters.

Option 1: R _ _ _ E
- R O U S E (R, O, U, S, E) – O, U, S are allowed.
- R A I S E – but A is excluded.
- R O S E S – but it’s plural, and we need 5 letters.
- R I S E N – but I is excluded.
- R O D E O – but ends with O, not E.

ROUSE seems good.

Option 2: _ _ R _ E
- S T A R E – but T, A are excluded.
- S P A R E – but A is excluded.
- S H A R E – but A is excluded.
- S C O R E – but C is excluded.
- S L U R E – not a valid word.
- S L O R E – not a valid word.
- F R O R E – not valid.

From all feedback we have:

CRANE  → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
TIGER  → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(-) R(-)
ROUSE  → R(-) O(-) U(x) S(-) E(✓)

What we have learned:

1. The final letter is definitely E (position 5).
2. R is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
   The only remaining possible position for R is position 3.
3. C, A, N, T, I, G, U are all absent.
4. O is in the word but is NOT in position 2 (from ROUSE feedback: O(-)).
5. S is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (from ROUSE feedback: S(-)).

So the unknown pattern is:
_ _ R _ E
with the additional constraints:
- Letters already excluded: C, A, N, T, I, G, U
- O and S must appear somewhere (because O(-) and S(-) mean they are present but in wrong positions).
- O cannot be in position 2, and S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: any letter except the excluded ones.
- Position 2: any letter except excluded ones and O.
- Position 3: R (fixed).
- Position 4: any letter except excluded ones and S.
- Position 5: E (fixed).

We need to fit O and S into positions 1, 2, or 4, respecting their placement restrictions.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words of the form _ _ R _ E that:
- contain both O and S once each,
- avoid all excluded letters,
- place O not in position 2,
- place S not in position 4.

Candidate words that fit:
- S O R R E – invalid (double R, and R already determined once)
- S O R E E – invalid (double E)
- S H O R E – valid word, fits all constraints.
- F R O S E – invalid (R must be in position 3)
- P O R S E – invalid (S in position 4)

Only common word left: SHORE.

Check constraints:
- SHORE: S not in position 4 (✓), O not in position 2 (✓), R in position 3 (✓), no excluded letters (✓).

Therefore, the best next guess is SHORE.
