2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

This is the first guess, so I have no prior information to work with. In Wordle-type games, a common first guess strategy is to use a word with common letters to maximize the information gained early on. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc., which contain many of the most frequently used letters in English.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains all vowels (except U) plus common consonants S and R, giving good coverage of frequently used letters. This should provide helpful feedback regardless of the secret word.
