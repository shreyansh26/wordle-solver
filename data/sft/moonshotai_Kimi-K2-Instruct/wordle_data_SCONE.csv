For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Words like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" are excellent choices because they contain 5 of the most common letters each. Between these, ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word and which positions they're in.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s currently at position 4).
- E(✓) – E is in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ E, and S must appear exactly once somewhere except position 4.  
We also know the word cannot contain A or R.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3 and E in position 5.
2. Move S to a new possible position (positions 1, 2, or 5; but 5 is already E, so 1 or 2).
3. Introduce new common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good letters to test next include T, N, L, I, C, D.  
A word that satisfies all this is “STONE”:
- S in position 1 (new spot for S).
- T and N are new letters.
- Keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.

Another candidate is “CHOSE”, but C and H are less common than T and N, and S is already placed in position 1 in both options. “STONE” seems slightly better for coverage.

Therefore, I’ll guess STONE.
