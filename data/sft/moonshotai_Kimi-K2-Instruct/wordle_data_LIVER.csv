For my first guess, I want to maximize the information gained about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common consonants in English include R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U.

Looking at letter frequency in 5-letter words, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N. To cover as many common letters as possible while ensuring the word is valid, I'll choose a word that includes several of these.

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us coverage of 5 different highly frequent letters, including 2 vowels and 3 consonants, which should help narrow down possibilities significantly based on the feedback received.

- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is not in the word at all

   – R exists but is not in position 2
   – I exists but is not in position 3
   – T and D are absent.

Combining:
- E is locked into position 4.
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 … but 4 is already E, so R must be in position 3 or 5.
- I must be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 … but 4 is E, so I must be in 1, 2, or 5.

We’ve tested: A, S, T, D are out.  
Still-untested common letters: N, L, C, O, U, M, G, H, etc.

The pattern now looks like:  
_ _ _ E _ with R in 3 or 5, and I in 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that places R in position 3 and I in position 2 while adding new frequent letters:  
C R I E R? (invalid, double R and not common)  
F R I E N → “FRIEN” invalid  
P R I E S → “PRIES” seems valid.

“PRIES” has:
- P (new letter)
- R in position 2 (but we know R cannot be in position 2 from TRIED feedback R(-)).  
Oops, that’s no good.

Instead try R in position 5 and I in position 1:  
I _ _ E R.  
We need three consonants that haven’t been ruled out.  
“INNER” – double N, and we don’t know N yet.  
“IVIER” – invalid.  
“INKER” – uses new letters N, K. “INKER” is a valid word.

<check>INKER</check> satisfies:
- I in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (locked)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- N and K are new high-frequency letters to test.

A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words.

Let’s absorb the new feedback for INKER:

I(-) N(x) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- N is NOT in the word at all.
- K is NOT in the word at all.
- E is correctly placed in position 4.
- R is correctly placed in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:

_ _ _ E R

and we still need both I and R in the word, but R is already fixed in position 5, so we only need to place I somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since position 4 is E, and position 1 was just ruled out for I).

Also, letters already excluded: A, S, T, D, N, K.

Still-allowed common letters: C, L, O, U, G, H, M, B, F, Y, etc.

We want a 5-letter word ending in “E R” with I in position 2 or 3.

Possible candidates:
– I in position 2: _ I _ E R → “L I V E R” (LIVER), “F I B E R”, “C I D E R” (but D is excluded), etc.
– I in position 3: _ _ I E R → “C H I E R”, “P I E R” (only 4 letters), “F I E R” (no), “V I E R” (no), “B I E R” (valid).

BIER is only 4 letters, so CHIER is invalid. LIVER seems the best common choice with new letters L and V.

Let’s verify:
LIVER → L, I, V are new; matches _ I _ E R and keeps I in position 2.

All constraints satisfied.
