Since this is the first guess without any prior feedback, I should choose a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information gain. A good initial word should contain frequently used letters in English and diverse vowels/consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason.

Let me consider:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E - common consonants and vowels
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - similar rationale
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - another balanced option

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers multiple common consonants and vowels while avoiding repeats.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong place.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is in the word but in the wrong place.
- E is not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- S and T (both misplaced from their positions in SLATE)
- No L, A, or E
- 3 unknown letters yet to be discovered

A good next step is to keep S and T but move them to new positions and introduce new high-frequency consonants/vowels. Since A and E are out, the vowels left are I, O, U. Common consonants not yet tried include R, N, D, M, etc.

Possible structure: place S and T in different spots, fill the rest with new letters. For example:
- Start with S in position 1: but in SLATE it was in position 1 and marked wrong place, so position 1 is wrong for S.
- T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked wrong place, so avoid position 4 for T.

Let’s try a word like ""STIRP"" - but P isn't super common. Better to use ""STORY"" - includes O as a new vowel and R/Y as consonants. Or ""STRIP"" - but I is a vowel and P is less common. 

""STORY"" seems good: uses S and T in new positions (S in 2, T in 3), adds O and R, and Y.

But wait, S was in position 1 in SLATE and marked wrong place, so in STORY it's in position 2 - that's new. T was in position 4 and now is in position 3 - also new. O is a new vowel, R is new consonant, Y is new.

Another option: ""TRUST"" - but T and S are already known to be in the word. T in position 1, R new, U new vowel, S in position 4, T again - but this repeats T which isn't ideal.

""FIRST"" - uses F new, I new, R new, S in position 4 (was position 1), T in position 5 (was position 4). This seems good: keeps S and T but moves them, introduces F, I, R.

Between ""STORY"" and ""FIRST"", ""FIRST"" introduces more new letters (F, I, R) while moving S and T to new positions.

Let me go with ""FIRST"".
