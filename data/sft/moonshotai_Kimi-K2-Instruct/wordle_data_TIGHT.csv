Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help identify key vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, S, T, etc. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong starting choice because:
1. It contains three common vowels (A, I, E)
2. It includes two common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid 5-letter word
4. It can quickly reveal information about the presence/position of these letters

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, O, N.  
2. Letter I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.  
3. Letter T is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in T.
- It contains I, but I can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- However, position 5 is already T, so I must be in position 1 or 2.
- Available letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Let’s assume I is in position 2 (most common placement).  
We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T, with I in position 2, using only allowed letters.

A good choice: “LIGHT” fits:
- L, G, H are all allowed (not yet ruled out).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- Ends in T (position 5), matching feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use a word with common letters like E, A, R, S, T, etc. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong starting choice because:
1. It contains three common vowels (A, I, E)
2. It includes two common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid 5-letter word
4. It can quickly reveal information about the presence/position of these letters
