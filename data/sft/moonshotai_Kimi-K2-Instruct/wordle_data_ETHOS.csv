For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm their presence. Good first guesses often include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. Popular starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ARISE. After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1
- L is NOT in the word at all
- A is NOT in the word at all
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5

So the mystery word:
1. Contains S, T, E (each at least once)
2. Does NOT contain L or A
3. S is not in spot 1, T is not in spot 4, E is not in spot 5

I need a new 5-letter word that uses only the letters we know are possible (no L or A) and places S, T, E in new positions.  
A common pattern is to keep S, T, E and add other frequent consonants/vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- STEIN – but L is not in the word, so this is fine.  
- BUTES (not common)  
- SENTO (not common)  

Popular, valid choices that fit: “STONE” or “STEIN”.  
STONE:
- S is in spot 1 → but feedback says S is not in spot 1. So STONE is invalid.  
STEIN:
- S in spot 1 → same problem.  
So I need to move S out of spot 1.  

Try “TESLA” – but A is not allowed.  
Try “EXIST” – uses only S, T, E plus X, I. I is allowed (not ruled out).  
Positions:  
- S is now spot 5 – allowed (feedback only said S not in spot 1).  
- T is spot 2 – allowed (feedback only said T not in spot 4).  
- E is spot 1 – allowed (feedback only said E not in spot 5).  

So “EXIST” looks valid and contains S, T, E in new positions while introducing X and I to test new letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is present but NOT in position 1.
- L, A are NOT in the word.
- T is present but NOT in position 4.
- E is present but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (EXIST):
- E in position 1 = ✓.  Therefore E is fixed in slot 1.
- X is NOT in the word.
- I is NOT in the word.
- S is present but NOT in position 4.
- T is present but NOT in position 5.

So the word has:
- E fixed at position 1.
- Must contain S and T somewhere, each with restricted positions:
  – S cannot be in 1 or 4.
  – T cannot be in 4 or 5.
- May not contain: L, A, X, I.

Remaining letters to consider come from the common consonants & vowels that are still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Word pattern so far: E _ _ _ _

We need to place S and T plus two more distinct allowed letters in the remaining four slots, respecting the positional bans.

Candidate constructions:
- E T _ S _   (T in 2, S in 4) → S is banned from 4 → invalid
- E _ T S _   (T in 3, S in 4) → S banned from 4 → invalid
- E _ T _ S   (T in 3, S in 5) → allowed
- E T S _ _   (T in 2, S in 3) → allowed
- E S T _ _   (S in 2, T in 3) → allowed
- E S _ T _   (S in 2, T in 4) → T banned from 4 → invalid
- E _ S T _   (S in 3, T in 4) → T banned from 4 → invalid
- E _ _ S T   (S in 4, T in 5) → both positions banned → invalid
- E _ _ T S   (T in 4, S in 5) → T banned from 4 → invalid

So the only legal placements for S and T are:
1. E T S _ _
2. E _ T _ S
3. E S T _ _

We need two more distinct allowed letters (not L, A, X, I) to fill the remaining blanks.

Let’s pick one of the patterns and fill it with frequent remaining letters.  
Take pattern 2: E _ T _ S  
We need letters for positions 2 and 4. Good frequent candidates: R, N, D, C, H, M, O, U, etc.

Combine to make common 5-letter English words.  
ETHOS: letters E, T, H, O, S.  
- E is fixed at 1 ✓  
- T is at 3 ✓  
- S is at 5 ✓  
- H and O are allowed.  
- Positions: S is allowed in 5 (only banned from 1 & 4).  
- T is allowed in 3 (only banned from 4 & 5).  
This satisfies every constraint and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, ETHOS is a solid next guess.
