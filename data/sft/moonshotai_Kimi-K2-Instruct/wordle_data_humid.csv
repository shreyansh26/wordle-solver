For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can give me good information about vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O) and frequently used consonants (like T, N, S, R, L). 

Some popular starting words in Wordle include:
- AROSE (uses A, O, E and common consonants R, S)
- SLATE (uses A, E and common consonants S, L, T)
- CRANE (uses A, E and common consonants C, R, N)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters to work with in subsequent guesses.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word, so we should avoid any of those letters entirely in the next guess.

That leaves the remaining alphabet letters:
B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z

My goal now is to pick a word that uses some of the remaining common consonants and vowels to gather maximum information. Good candidates:
- U and I are common vowels still available.
- T, N, L, C, D, H, M, B, F, G, K, P are still available consonants.

Popular Wordle openers that avoid A, R, O, S, E:
- UNTIL – uses U, I, T, N, L
- LUMPY – uses U, Y, M, P, L
- CHIMP – uses I, M, P, C, H
- BLINK – uses I, N, K, B, L
- TUBBY – uses U, Y, B, T

Of these, ""UNTIL"" includes two common vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L), giving excellent coverage without any excluded letters.

- Letter that is in the word but in the wrong position: U (it showed up as “-” in the 1st position, so U is somewhere else in the word—positions 2, 3, or 5)

Remaining vowels we can still try: U (already known to be in the word), plus Y (sometimes vowel)

We need three more consonants and the letter U placed somewhere, with the 4th letter fixed as I.

Good strategy: pick a word that

2. uses several new common consonants.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels (like A, E, I, O) and frequently used consonants (like T, N, S, R, L). \n\nSome popular starting words in Wordle include:\n- AROSE (uses A, O, E and common consonants R, S)\n- SLATE (uses A, E and common consonants S, L, T)\n- CRANE (uses A, E and common consonants C, R, N)\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage of common letters to work with in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are **not** in the secret word, so we should avoid any of those letters entirely in the next guess.\n\nThat leaves the remaining alphabet letters:\nB C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z\n\nMy goal now is to pick a word that uses some of the remaining common consonants and vowels to gather maximum information. Good candidates:\n- U and I are common vowels still available.\n- T, N, L, C, D, H, M, B, F, G, K, P are still available consonants.\n\nPopular Wordle openers that avoid A, R, O, S, E:\n- UNTIL – uses U, I, T, N, L\n- LUMPY – uses U, Y, M, P, L\n- CHIMP – uses I, M, P, C, H\n- BLINK – uses I, N, K, B, L\n- TUBBY – uses U, Y, B, T\n\nOf these, ""UNTIL"" includes two common vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L), giving excellent coverage without any excluded letters.\n\nSo I will guess:\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we now know:\n- Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L\n- Letter that IS in the word: I (and it is in position 4, because we got ✓ on the 4th letter in UNTIL)\n- Letter that is in the word but in the wrong position: U (it showed up as “-” in the 1st position, so U is somewhere else in the word—positions 2, 3, or 5)\n\nSo far the word looks like: _ _ _ I _\n\nRemaining consonants we can still try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\nRemaining vowels we can still try: U (already known to be in the word), plus Y (sometimes vowel)\n\nWe need three more consonants and the letter U placed somewhere, with the 4th letter fixed as I.\n\nGood strategy: pick a word that\n1. puts U in a different position (not first) and\n2. uses several new common consonants.\n\nCandidates:\n- DUCKY: uses D, C, K, Y and U in position 2.\n- MUCKY: uses M, C, K, Y and U in position 2.\n- BUMPY: uses B, M, P, Y and U in position 2.\n\nAmong these, “BUMPY” looks good: B, M, P, Y are all fresh letters, and U is moved to position 2, satisfying the “-” feedback from earlier.\n\nLet’s go with BUMPY.\n\n<guess>BUMPY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(✓) L(x)\nGuess 3: BUMPY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
Step 1 – summarize everything we know so far  
Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, L, B, P, Y  
Letters certainly in the word: I (locked in position 4), U, M (both correct letters, position unknown)  
So the word pattern is: _ _ _ I _

Step 2 – place U and M  
- U and M must both appear exactly once each (no duplicates showed up in feedback).  
- Their allowed columns are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is already I).  
- From guess 2 we saw U in position 1 but got “–”, so U cannot be in 1.  
  Therefore U must be in position 2, 3 or 5.  
- From guess 3 we saw M in position 3 and got “✓”, so M is definitely in position 3.

Word pattern now: _ _ M I _

Step 3 – choose remaining letters  
Available consonants (not yet eliminated): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z  
We still need two more consonants for positions 1 and 5.  
We also need to place U somewhere; the only open positions are 2 and 5.  
But position 5 is the final consonant, so U must be in position 2.

Word pattern now: _ U M I _

Step 4 – test common consonants for positions 1 and 5  
Pick two fresh, common consonants from the available set.  
Popular choices: C, D, F, G, H, K.  
We need a word of the form C U M I D, D U M I C, etc.  
Let’s try “D U M I C” → but “DUMIC” is not a recognized English word.  
“FUMID” is valid, but “F” appears in position 1 and “D” in 5.  
“HUMID” uses H (common) and D (common) and is a real English word.

Step 5 – verify no letters conflict  
H, U, M, I, D — none of them were marked “x” in any feedback, and positions satisfy all clues.

Hence the next guess is “HUMID”.
