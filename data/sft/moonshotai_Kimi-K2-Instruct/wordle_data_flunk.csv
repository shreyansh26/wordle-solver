Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonant positions as possible. This helps maximize information gain in subsequent guesses. 

A strong opening word typically includes:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequently occurring consonants (R, S, T, L, N)

Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It covers 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
2. All letters are very common in 5-letter words.
3. It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing coverage.

Let's go with ""RAISE"" as our first guess.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
So the word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

To progress, we need a word that:
- Uses none of those five letters.
- Still contains a good mix of other common consonants and vowels.

The remaining most-common letters are: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, Y, M, P, etc.  
A balanced five-letter word using many of these is “CLOUT”.  

- C and L are common consonants.
- O and U cover two more vowels (since A, I, E are ruled out).
- T is another high-frequency consonant.

No letter in “CLOUT” overlaps with the disallowed set, and it should give fresh positional information.

From all feedback so far:

Disallowed letters (x): R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T, B  
Confirmed letters and positions:  
- L must be in position 2 (✓ in both CLOUT and BLUNK)  
- U, N, K are in the word but their exact positions are unknown (✓ in BLUNK but positions not locked).

We also know the word looks like: _ L _ _ _ with the remaining letters drawn from {U, N, K} plus any other letters not yet ruled out. However, from BLUNK we learned that every letter in BLUNK except the first (B) is actually in the word (L, U, N, K). That means the secret word is an anagram of L, U, N, K plus one more letter that must be in position 1 (since positions 2-5 contain L, U, N, K in some order).

Possible letters for position 1: any not yet ruled out (not R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T, B). Common options: D, F, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try to form valid 5-letter words that:
- Start with one of the allowed letters.
- Have L as the second letter.
- Contain U, N, K somewhere in positions 3-5.

One such word is “FLUNK”:
- F is allowed (not yet ruled out).
- L is in position 2 (correct).
- Contains U, N, K (all confirmed from BLUNK).

Let’s check if FLUNK is possible:
- F: new, allowed.
- L: correct position.
- U: confirmed in word, position not yet locked.
- N: confirmed in word, position not yet locked.
- K: confirmed in word, position not yet locked.

This is a strong candidate.
