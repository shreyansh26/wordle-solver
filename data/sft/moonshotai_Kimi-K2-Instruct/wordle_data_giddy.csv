For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters right (either in the correct position or wrong position), which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are very common in English. I'm going to choose a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so I can test as many distinct letters as possible in one guess.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and gives me information about these key letters.

All five letters from arose (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appears anywhere in the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

2. until  → U,N,T,L are absent, but I is somewhere in the word (wrong position).

So the secret word:
- is made only from the letters we have NOT yet ruled out, and
- contains the letter I (but not in position 3).

B C D F G H I J K M P Q V W Y Z  (and of course the already-known I).

- uses I (not in the 3rd spot),
- uses several other still-unknown letters,
- keeps every letter unique so we maximize information.

A common consonant combination is CH, and we can test D, M, P, etc.

A valid word that satisfies these criteria is “CHIMP”:
- I is in position 4 (not 3),
- C, H, M, P are all fresh letters we have never tested,
- and it is a valid English word.

So far we know:

1. Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, L, C, H, M, P (12 letters gone).
2. The word contains the letter I, but I cannot be in positions 3 (from until) or 4 (from chimp).  
   So I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
3. Remaining consonants that have never been tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, Y, Z  
   Remaining vowels that have never been tried: none (only I is left among common vowels).

To gather fresh information, I want to test several of the most common remaining letters in one guess.  
Among the unused letters, the highest-frequency ones are D, G, K, Y.  
A valid 5-letter word that uses three of these plus the required I and another unused letter is “DINGY”:

- D, N, G, Y are all fresh letters (N was ruled out in until, but wait — N was marked x in until, so N is out!).  
Oops — “N” is already out. Let me rethink.

Re-evaluate ruled-out letters again:  
From the feedback we have  
arose → A,R,O,S,E out  
until → U,N,T,L out  
chimp → C,H,I,M,P out (note: I is still in the word, just not in position 3 or 4)

So definitely out: A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,L,C,H,M,P (13 letters)  
Still usable: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,Q,V,W,Y,Z plus any other unused letters.

Therefore, the word must contain I (in pos 1, 2, or 5) and be built from the 13 remaining letters.

A good word to test four new common letters is “BIDGY” (but “bidgy” is not a recognized English word).  
Another valid word is “WIGGY” (but G is repeated and we’d only learn G once).  
“FIJID” – no, that’s a place and also has repeated I.

Let me pick “BIVID” – but not a word.

Another valid word built only from unused letters and fitting positions 1/2/5 for I is “KIDGY” – again not valid.

Let me try a simpler, real word: “BINGO” – but B is still valid, I is valid, N is already out. No.

How about “VIGID”? Not a word.

Best valid word I can construct using only fresh letters plus the known I is “BILGY” – not common.

Instead, let’s use “WIGGY” – it is valid and tests W, I, G, Y (only repeats G). Probably acceptable.

But let’s find a word with no repeats: “BIDYK” – no.

Wait, let me simply list still-available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,Q,V,W,Y,Z.

A valid word that uses four of them plus I is “BIDYG” – no.

Actually “FIDGY” is a known word (past tense of fidge, meaning to fidget), though rare.  
But “WIGGY” is more common.

To maximize new letters, let me use “FIDGY”. It tests F, I, D, G, Y (all fresh except I).

So:
F (new)
I (known to be in word)
D (new)
G (new)
Y (new)

And I is in position 2 here, which is allowed.

So “FIDGY” is my next guess.

1. Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, L, C, H, M, P (12 letters gone).
2. The word contains the letter I, but I cannot be in positions 3 (from until) or 4 (from chimp).  
   So I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
3. Remaining consonants that have never been tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, Y, Z  
   Remaining vowels that have never been tried: none (only I is left among common vowels).

To gather fresh information, I want to test several of the most common remaining letters in one guess.  
Among the unused letters, the highest-frequency ones are D, G, K, Y.  
A valid 5-letter word that uses three of these plus the required I and another unused letter is “DINGY”:

- D, N, G, Y are all fresh letters (N was ruled out in until, but wait — N was marked x in until, so N is out!).  
Oops — “N” is already out. Let me rethink.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This maximizes the chance of getting some letters right (either in the correct position or wrong position), which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I are very common in English. I'm going to choose a word that uses several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so I can test as many distinct letters as possible in one guess.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and gives me information about these key letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from arose (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appears anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built only from the remaining 19 letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.

To learn as much as possible in one shot, I want a fresh set of frequent consonants plus one or two vowels.  
Among the remaining vowels, only I and U are common.  
A good mix of still-unknown common letters is: U, I, T, N, L.  
Putting them together gives the valid word UNTIL.

<guess>until</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. arose  → A,R,O,S,E are all absent.
2. until  → U,N,T,L are absent, but I is somewhere in the word (wrong position).

So the secret word:
- is made only from the letters we have NOT yet ruled out, and
- contains the letter I (but not in position 3).

The remaining candidate letters (excluding the 10 already excluded) are:
B C D F G H I J K M P Q V W Y Z  (and of course the already-known I).

We want a word that:
- uses I (not in the 3rd spot),
- uses several other still-unknown letters,
- keeps every letter unique so we maximize information.

A common consonant combination is CH, and we can test D, M, P, etc.

A valid word that satisfies these criteria is “CHIMP”:
- I is in position 4 (not 3),
- C, H, M, P are all fresh letters we have never tested,
- and it is a valid English word.

   So I must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
3. Remaining consonants that have never been tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, Y, Z  
   Remaining vowels that have never been tried: none (only I is left among common vowels).

arose → A,R,O,S,E out  
until → U,N,T,L out  
chimp → C,H,I,M,P out (note: I is still in the word, just not in position 3 or 4)

So definitely out: A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,L,C,H,M,P (13 letters)  
Still usable: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,Q,V,W,Y,Z plus any other unused letters.

Therefore, the word must contain I (in pos 1, 2, or 5) and be built from the 13 remaining letters.

A good word to test four new common letters is “BIDGY” (but “bidgy” is not a recognized English word).  
Another valid word is “WIGGY” (but G is repeated and we’d only learn G once).  
“FIJID” – no, that’s a place and also has repeated I.

Let me pick “BIVID” – but not a word.

Another valid word built only from unused letters and fitting positions 1/2/5 for I is “KIDGY” – again not valid.

How about “VIGID”? Not a word.

Best valid word I can construct using only fresh letters plus the known I is “BILGY” – not common.

Instead, let’s use “WIGGY” – it is valid and tests W, I, G, Y (only repeats G). Probably acceptable.

But let’s find a word with no repeats: “BIDYK” – no.

Wait, let me simply list still-available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,Q,V,W,Y,Z.

A valid word that uses four of them plus I is “BIDYG” – no.

Actually “FIDGY” is a known word (past tense of fidge, meaning to fidget), though rare.  
But “WIGGY” is more common.

To maximize new letters, let me use “FIDGY”. It tests F, I, D, G, Y (all fresh except I).

So:
F (new)
I (known to be in word)
D (new)
G (new)
Y (new)

And I is in position 2 here, which is allowed.

So “FIDGY” is my next guess.

From the latest feedback:

Letters we know are NOT in the word (13 letters):
A,R,O,S,E,U,N,T,L,C,H,M,P,F

Letters we now know ARE in the word and their positions so far:
- I is in position 2 (✓).
- D is in position 3 (✓).
- Y is in position 5 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not in the guessed positions:
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from fidgy feedback).

Still-unused letters that could fill position 1 and 4 (positions 2,3,5 are now fixed):
Available letters: B, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (since G is in but not at pos 4, and I,D,Y are placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Has D in position 3.
3. Has Y in position 5.
4. Contains G somewhere (but not in position 4).
5. Uses only letters from the remaining pool for positions 1 and 4.

So the word looks like: _ I D _ Y, where the blanks must be filled with remaining letters, and G must appear in one of the blanks.

But position 4 cannot be G (since G is marked ""-"" in position 4), so G must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: G I D _ Y, where position 4 must be a letter from the remaining pool (B,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z) that forms a valid word.

Looking at the possibilities:
- G I D B Y? Not a word.
- G I D K Y? Not a word.
- G I D V Y? Not a word.
- G I D W Y? Not a word.
- G I D J Y? Not a word.
- G I D Z Y? Not a word.
- G I D Q Y? Not a word.
- G I D X Y? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. This suggests I might have misapplied the rules. Let me re-examine the feedback:

fidgy feedback: F(x), I(✓), D(✓), G(-), Y(✓)

This means:
- I is in position 2 (✓) - correct position.
- D is in position 3 (✓) - correct position.
- Y is in position 5 (✓) - correct position.
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-), so G must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be G I D _ Y, but position 4 must be a letter that forms a valid word. The only letter left that could fit is perhaps a letter we've already ruled out, but that's impossible. This suggests the only possible word is ""GIDDY"" - but we ruled out G being in position 4 (which isn't relevant here), and G is in position 1.

Wait, ""GIDDY"" has G in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, D in 4, Y in 5. But we've ruled out D being in position 4 (no, we haven't - D was confirmed in position 3 only). However, ""GIDDY"" uses D twice, and we have no restriction against that.

But we already have D in position 3, and the feedback doesn't prohibit another D elsewhere. So ""GIDDY"" seems possible.

But let's check if we have any reason to exclude D from position 4 - no, only G was excluded from position 4. So ""GIDDY"" fits all known constraints.

However, we have only 6 guesses total and this is guess 5, so we need to be confident. ""GIDDY"" is indeed a valid word and matches all feedback so far.

Therefore, the next guess should be GIDDY.

But we already have D in position 3, and the feedback doesn't prohibit another D elsewhere. So ""GIDDY"" seems possible.

But let's check if we have any reason to exclude D from position 4 - no, only G was excluded from position 4. So ""GIDDY"" fits all known constraints.

However, we have only 6 guesses total and this is guess 5, so we need to be confident. ""GIDDY"" is indeed a valid word and matches all feedback so far.

Therefore, the next guess should be GIDDY.Based on all the feedback, the only 5-letter word that fits is:",Guess 5: giddy -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) I(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
