For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best approach is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

These words include the vowels A and E, plus common consonants like S, T, R, N, L. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are all absent (x).
- N is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position (-).

Letters we know are NOT in the secret word: C, R, A, E  
Letter we know is in the word: N  
Position we know N is NOT in: position 5  

So we need a 5-letter word that
1. Contains N
2. Does not contain C, R, A, E
3. Has N in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Common consonants and vowels left: T, L, S, O, I, D, U, M, N, Y, etc.

I want a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.  
Good candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – uses N in 4th position.
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D) – uses N in 4th position.
- BLUNT (B, L, U, N, T) – uses N in 4th position.

I'll choose STONY because it includes S, T, O, Y – all common and not yet ruled out.

2. T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
3. O is correct in position 3 (✓).
4. N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
5. Y is not in the word (x).

Combining with the first guess:
- Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, Y
- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 1), O (position 3), N, T
- S is locked at position 1.
- O is locked at position 3.
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and STONY feedback), so N must be in position 2.
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STONY feedback), and positions 1,3,4 are taken by S, O, N respectively, so T must be in position 5.

So far the word looks like: S _ O N T
Only position 2 remains to be filled.

Letters not yet eliminated: any except C, R, A, E, Y
Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words matching S _ O N T:
- SPONT (not a standard English word)
- SLONT (not standard)
- SHONT (not standard)
- SWONT (not standard)

The only valid English word matching S _ O N T is:
- SPOON (but O is already in position 3, and this would have O twice)
- SPONT isn't valid
- Actually looking at dictionary, common word is ""SPONT"" but it's not standard.

Wait, let me reconsider the positions. From STONY:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from CRANE: not position 5, from STONY: not position 4)
- So N could be in positions 2 or 3
- But O is confirmed in position 3, so N must be in position 2
- T is in word but not position 2, and positions 1,3,2 are S,O,N, so T must be in 4 or 5
- From CRANE: N not in 5, but T could be in 5

So word structure: S N O _ _
With T needing to be in 4 or 5
And remaining letters to be determined

Possible words:
- SNOUT (but U was not eliminated)

- SNOOT (O appears twice, but O is confirmed)
- SNACK (A is eliminated)
- SNOBS (S already used)
- SNOOK (K possible)

Actually, let's reconstruct:
S _ O _ _
N must be in position 2 (since it can't be 4 or 5, and 3 is O)

So word is S N O T _ or S N O _ T

Looking for common words:
