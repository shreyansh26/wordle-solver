For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters frequently found in 5-letter words. This will help gather maximum information about the secret word's letters. I'll use the common vowels A and E, and common consonants like R, S, and T. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 3 vowels (A, I, E) which are very common in English words
2. It uses 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- A and S are in the word but in wrong positions.
- R and I are not in the word.

So the unknown pattern is: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain A and S somewhere in positions 1-4.

Next I should try a word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Places A and S in new positions.
- Uses common letters not yet eliminated (avoid R and I).
- Uses other high-frequency letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""STARE"":
- S moves to position 1 (new position).
- T is a new high-frequency consonant.
- A moves to position 2 (new position).
- R is not in the word (from feedback), so this won't work.

Instead, I'll try ""CHASE"":
- C and H are new high-frequency consonants.
- A moves to position 2 (was position 2 in RAISE, but that's still allowed since feedback was just ""wrong position"").
- S moves to position 3.
- E stays position 5.

Wait, let me reconsider the positions more carefully:
- A was position 2 in RAISE but marked wrong position, so it cannot be in position 2.
- S was position 4 in RAISE but marked wrong position, so it cannot be in position 4.

Let me try ""SWEAT"":
- S is in position 1 (was 4, so new position is fine)
- W is a new letter
- E is correctly in position 5
- A is in position 3 (was 2, new position is fine)
- T is a new letter

But this might be too many new letters. Let me try ""LEASE"":
- L is new
- E is position 5
- A is position 2 (but A was in position 2 in RAISE and marked wrong position - so this is invalid)

Let me try ""SABLE"":
- S is position 1 (was 4, ok)
- A is position 2 (was 2, invalid - same position)

Try ""PELAS"" - but this doesn't end with E.

Correct approach:
- Must end with E
- Must contain A and S in positions 1-4, not in their original positions (A not 2, S not 4)
- Cannot have R or I

Best candidate: ""STALE""
- S is position 1 (was 4, ok)
- T is new

- SNARE (but N is good, R is eliminated)
- SPACE (C is good)
