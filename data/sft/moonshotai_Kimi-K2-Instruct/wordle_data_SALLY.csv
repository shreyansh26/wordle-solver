For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. A mix of consonants and vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:

S(✓) – S is in the correct first position.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word starts with S.  
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Does NOT contain T or E.

I should try a word that keeps S in place and tests other positions for L and A, while avoiding T/E. A possible candidate: “SCARF”  
– S stays in position 1.  
– C, R, F are all new letters.  
– L is not in positions 2, so might appear later.  
– A is not in position 3 but could be elsewhere.

However, SCARF doesn’t include L. Better choice: “SMALL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L is now in position 3 (but feedback said L is not in position 2, so okay).  
– A in position 4 (feedback said A is not in position 3, so okay).  
– M is new.  
But SMALL repeats L, which limits info.

Next option: “SLUMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L in position 2 (but feedback said L is NOT in position 2), so reject.

How about “SKALD”?  
– S(✓) in place.  
– K is new, L in position 4 (okay), A in position 3 (forbidden—feedback said A not in position 3), reject.

Try “SNAIL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– N, I new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– P, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SCALD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, D new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SWAMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– W, M, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SHAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– H, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SALAD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– First A in position 2 (okay), second A in position 4 (okay).  
– L in position 3 (okay), D new.  
But it has two A's—still useful.

“SCALP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPLAY” – but A and Y not sure, and L in position 2 (forbidden), reject.

“SHALL” – L in position 2 forbidden, reject.

“SALON”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– A in position 2 (okay), L in position 3 (okay), O, N new.  
This looks reasonable.

But to avoid repeating L and maximize new letters: “SABOT” – has T (forbidden), reject.

“SANDY” – Y not yet tested; A in position 2 (okay), N, D new.  
L is not present, but we know L must be in word, so reject.

“SUGAR” – A in position 4 (okay), U, G, R new; L missing.

“SUGAL” – not a word.

“SIGIL” – I, G new; L in position 4 (okay), but double I might be less informative.

“SABLE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAINT” – has N, I; T forbidden, reject.

“SALTY” – has T (forbidden), Y not confirmed useful, reject.

“SALVE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAMBA” – B new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALSA” – A in position 3 forbidden, double S, reject.

“SARAN” – N new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SATIN” – T forbidden, reject.

“SAUNA” – U, N new; A in position 2 and 4 (okay), but L missing.

“SAVOR” – V, O, R new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALAD” seems the best compromise: keeps S fixed, places A not in position 3 (A is in position 2 here), places L not in position 2 (L in position 3), and introduces D.

But feedback for SLATE said L is NOT in position 2, so L in position 3 is fine, A in position 2 is fine, and D is new. Also, word must contain both L and A.

Hence, “SALAD”.

Alternatively, “SALTY” – but T is forbidden.

“SALON” – L in position 3, A in position 2, O, N new. Good.

I’ll go with SALON.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

   - L is now fixed in position 3.

So far we know:
- Pattern so far: S A L _ _
- Letters used and confirmed: S, A, L
- Letters excluded so far: T, E, O, N
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters that:
- Are not T, E, O, N
- Are not already placed (so far S, A, L are placed)
- Fit in the last two positions (positions 4 and 5)

Possible candidates for positions 4 and 5:
Common 5-letter words starting with ""SAL"" and ending with valid letters not yet excluded:
- SALAD (but D is new, A is repeated)
- SALSA (but S and A are repeats, and second A is in position 4, which we don't know yet)
- SALTY (but T is excluded)
- SALVE (but E is excluded)
- SALIX (but X is uncommon)
- SALMI (but uncommon)
- SALPA (but A is already placed)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALVO (O excluded)
- SALUT (T excluded)
- SALUK (K is possible)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALTY (T excluded)
- SALAD (A is allowed in position 4, D is new)

Looking at ""SALAD"":
- Pattern: S A L A D
- A is allowed in position 4 (since in SALON, A was fixed in position 2, so no info about position 4)
- D is new and not excluded
- Word is valid

But is A allowed in position 4? From SLATE, A was (-) in position 3 (so A is in the word but not position 3). From SALON, A is fixed in position 2. So A is only in position 2, and cannot be in positions 3,4,5. So SALAD is invalid because it has A in position 4.

Next candidates:
- SALKS (not a word)
- SALMI (M, I new)
- SALMI is a word (a type of stew), but might be obscure
- SALPS (P, S - S already used)
- SALIX (X is possible, I is new)
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALPA (A already in position 2, cannot be in 5)
- SALUK (U, K new)
- SALUK is a breed of dog, valid word

SALUK: S A L U K - all letters new except S,A,L which are fixed; U and K are unused and not excluded.

Another option: SALMI (S A L M I) - M and I are unused and not excluded.

Between SALUK and SALMI, both seem valid. SALMI is slightly more common in crosswords.

But let me check other possibilities:
- SALPS (S A L P S) - P and S; S already used in position 1, so P and second S are not helpful
- SALIX (S A L I X) - I and X

Looking at word frequency, SALMI and SALUK are both somewhat obscure. Maybe there's a more common word.

Another approach: think of common words starting with SAL.
Common ones are:
- SALAD (invalid due to A in position 4)
- SALTY (invalid, T excluded)
- SALSA (invalid, A in position 4)
- SALVE (invalid, E excluded)
- SALON (already used)
- SALVO (invalid, O excluded)
- SALUT (invalid, T excluded)
- SALPA (invalid, A in position 5)
- SALLY (Y is possible, but double L - L is already in position 3)
- SALMI (valid)
- SALUK (valid)

Given the constraints, SALMI seems the best next guess.

But let me double-check the pattern:
Current known: S A L _ _
Excluded letters: T, E, O, N
Remaining positions 4,5 must be filled with letters not yet used. From alphabet, possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, excluding any that might conflict.

Looking back at SLATE and SALON, no restrictions on positions 4,5 except letters not excluded.

Possible common endings:
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALUK (U, K)
- SALIX (I, X)
- SALVE (invalid)
- SALPA (invalid)

SALMI is a valid 5-letter word (a type of ragout or stew).

Thus, I'll go with SALMI.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. A mix of consonants and vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

S(✓) – S is in the correct first position.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word starts with S.  
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Does NOT contain T or E.

I should try a word that keeps S in place and tests other positions for L and A, while avoiding T/E. A possible candidate: “SCARF”  
– S stays in position 1.  
– C, R, F are all new letters.  
– L is not in positions 2, so might appear later.  
– A is not in position 3 but could be elsewhere.

However, SCARF doesn’t include L. Better choice: “SMALL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L is now in position 3 (but feedback said L is not in position 2, so okay).  
– A in position 4 (feedback said A is not in position 3, so okay).  
– M is new.  
But SMALL repeats L, which limits info.

Next option: “SLUMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L in position 2 (but feedback said L is NOT in position 2), so reject.

How about “SKALD”?  
– S(✓) in place.  
– K is new, L in position 4 (okay), A in position 3 (forbidden—feedback said A not in position 3), reject.

Try “SNAIL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– N, I new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– P, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SCALD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, D new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SWAMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– W, M, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SHAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– H, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SALAD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– First A in position 2 (okay), second A in position 4 (okay).  
– L in position 3 (okay), D new.  
But it has two A's—still useful.

“SCALP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPLAY” – but A and Y not sure, and L in position 2 (forbidden), reject.

“SHALL” – L in position 2 forbidden, reject.

“SALON”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– A in position 2 (okay), L in position 3 (okay), O, N new.  
This looks reasonable.

But to avoid repeating L and maximize new letters: “SABOT” – has T (forbidden), reject.

“SANDY” – Y not yet tested; A in position 2 (okay), N, D new.  
L is not present, but we know L must be in word, so reject.

“SUGAR” – A in position 4 (okay), U, G, R new; L missing.

“SUGAL” – not a word.

“SIGIL” – I, G new; L in position 4 (okay), but double I might be less informative.

“SABLE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAINT” – has N, I; T forbidden, reject.

“SALTY” – has T (forbidden), Y not confirmed useful, reject.

“SALVE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAMBA” – B new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALSA” – A in position 3 forbidden, double S, reject.

“SARAN” – N new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SATIN” – T forbidden, reject.

“SAUNA” – U, N new; A in position 2 and 4 (okay), but L missing.

“SAVOR” – V, O, R new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALAD” seems the best compromise: keeps S fixed, places A not in position 3 (A is in position 2 here), places L not in position 2 (L in position 3), and introduces D.

But feedback for SLATE said L is NOT in position 2, so L in position 3 is fine, A in position 2 is fine, and D is new. Also, word must contain both L and A.

Hence, “SALAD”.

Alternatively, “SALTY” – but T is forbidden.

“SALON” – L in position 3, A in position 2, O, N new. Good.

I’ll go with SALON.

- Letters excluded so far: T, E, O, N
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters that:
- Are not T, E, O, N
- Are not already placed (so far S, A, L are placed)
- Fit in the last two positions (positions 4 and 5)

Possible candidates for positions 4 and 5:
Common 5-letter words starting with ""SAL"" and ending with valid letters not yet excluded:
- SALAD (but D is new, A is repeated)
- SALSA (but S and A are repeats, and second A is in position 4, which we don't know yet)

- SALVE (but E is excluded)
- SALIX (but X is uncommon)
- SALMI (but uncommon)
- SALPA (but A is already placed)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALVO (O excluded)
- SALUT (T excluded)
- SALUK (K is possible)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALTY (T excluded)
- SALAD (A is allowed in position 4, D is new)

Looking at ""SALAD"":
- Pattern: S A L A D
- A is allowed in position 4 (since in SALON, A was fixed in position 2, so no info about position 4)
- D is new and not excluded
- Word is valid

But is A allowed in position 4? From SLATE, A was (-) in position 3 (so A is in the word but not position 3). From SALON, A is fixed in position 2. So A is only in position 2, and cannot be in positions 3,4,5. So SALAD is invalid because it has A in position 4.

Next candidates:
- SALKS (not a word)
- SALMI (M, I new)
- SALMI is a word (a type of stew), but might be obscure
- SALPS (P, S - S already used)
- SALIX (X is possible, I is new)
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALPA (A already in position 2, cannot be in 5)
- SALUK (U, K new)
- SALUK is a breed of dog, valid word

SALUK: S A L U K - all letters new except S,A,L which are fixed; U and K are unused and not excluded.

Another option: SALMI (S A L M I) - M and I are unused and not excluded.

Between SALUK and SALMI, both seem valid. SALMI is slightly more common in crosswords.

But let me check other possibilities:
- SALPS (S A L P S) - P and S; S already used in position 1, so P and second S are not helpful
- SALIX (S A L I X) - I and X

Looking at word frequency, SALMI and SALUK are both somewhat obscure. Maybe there's a more common word.

Another approach: think of common words starting with SAL.
Common ones are:
- SALAD (invalid due to A in position 4)
- SALTY (invalid, T excluded)
- SALSA (invalid, A in position 4)
- SALVE (invalid, E excluded)
- SALON (already used)
- SALVO (invalid, O excluded)
- SALUT (invalid, T excluded)
- SALPA (invalid, A in position 5)
- SALLY (Y is possible, but double L - L is already in position 3)
- SALMI (valid)
- SALUK (valid)

Given the constraints, SALMI seems the best next guess.

But let me double-check the pattern:
Current known: S A L _ _
Excluded letters: T, E, O, N
Remaining positions 4,5 must be filled with letters not yet used. From alphabet, possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, excluding any that might conflict.

Looking back at SLATE and SALON, no restrictions on positions 4,5 except letters not excluded.

Possible common endings:
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALUK (U, K)
- SALIX (I, X)
- SALVE (invalid)
- SALPA (invalid)

SALMI is a valid 5-letter word (a type of ragout or stew).

Thus, I'll go with SALMI.Based on the feedback, the word must start with ""SAL"" (positions 1-3), and the remaining letters must not include T, E, O, or N. A valid next guess is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. A mix of consonants and vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

S(✓) – S is in the correct first position.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word starts with S.  
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Does NOT contain T or E.

I should try a word that keeps S in place and tests other positions for L and A, while avoiding T/E. A possible candidate: “SCARF”  
– S stays in position 1.  
– C, R, F are all new letters.  
– L is not in positions 2, so might appear later.  
– A is not in position 3 but could be elsewhere.

However, SCARF doesn’t include L. Better choice: “SMALL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L is now in position 3 (but feedback said L is not in position 2, so okay).  
– A in position 4 (feedback said A is not in position 3, so okay).  
– M is new.  
But SMALL repeats L, which limits info.

Next option: “SLUMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L in position 2 (but feedback said L is NOT in position 2), so reject.

How about “SKALD”?  
– S(✓) in place.  
– K is new, L in position 4 (okay), A in position 3 (forbidden—feedback said A not in position 3), reject.

Try “SNAIL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– N, I new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– P, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SCALD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, D new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SWAMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– W, M, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SHAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– H, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SALAD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– First A in position 2 (okay), second A in position 4 (okay).  
– L in position 3 (okay), D new.  
But it has two A's—still useful.

“SCALP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPLAY” – but A and Y not sure, and L in position 2 (forbidden), reject.

“SHALL” – L in position 2 forbidden, reject.

“SALON”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– A in position 2 (okay), L in position 3 (okay), O, N new.  
This looks reasonable.

But to avoid repeating L and maximize new letters: “SABOT” – has T (forbidden), reject.

“SANDY” – Y not yet tested; A in position 2 (okay), N, D new.  
L is not present, but we know L must be in word, so reject.

“SUGAR” – A in position 4 (okay), U, G, R new; L missing.

“SUGAL” – not a word.

“SIGIL” – I, G new; L in position 4 (okay), but double I might be less informative.

“SABLE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAINT” – has N, I; T forbidden, reject.

“SALTY” – has T (forbidden), Y not confirmed useful, reject.

“SALVE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAMBA” – B new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALSA” – A in position 3 forbidden, double S, reject.

“SARAN” – N new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SATIN” – T forbidden, reject.

“SAUNA” – U, N new; A in position 2 and 4 (okay), but L missing.

“SAVOR” – V, O, R new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALAD” seems the best compromise: keeps S fixed, places A not in position 3 (A is in position 2 here), places L not in position 2 (L in position 3), and introduces D.

But feedback for SLATE said L is NOT in position 2, so L in position 3 is fine, A in position 2 is fine, and D is new. Also, word must contain both L and A.

Hence, “SALAD”.

Alternatively, “SALTY” – but T is forbidden.

“SALON” – L in position 3, A in position 2, O, N new. Good.

I’ll go with SALON.

<guess>SALON</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T and E are not in the word at all.

2. SALON → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) O(x) N(x)
   - Confirms S is in position 1.
   - A is now fixed in position 2.
   - L is now fixed in position 3.
   - O and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern so far: S A L _ _
- Letters used and confirmed: S, A, L
- Letters excluded so far: T, E, O, N
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters that:
- Are not T, E, O, N
- Are not already placed (so far S, A, L are placed)
- Fit in the last two positions (positions 4 and 5)

Possible candidates for positions 4 and 5:
Common 5-letter words starting with ""SAL"" and ending with valid letters not yet excluded:
- SALAD (but D is new, A is repeated)
- SALSA (but S and A are repeats, and second A is in position 4, which we don't know yet)
- SALTY (but T is excluded)
- SALVE (but E is excluded)
- SALIX (but X is uncommon)
- SALMI (but uncommon)
- SALPA (but A is already placed)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALVO (O excluded)
- SALUT (T excluded)
- SALUK (K is possible)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALTY (T excluded)
- SALAD (A is allowed in position 4, D is new)

Looking at ""SALAD"":
- Pattern: S A L A D
- A is allowed in position 4 (since in SALON, A was fixed in position 2, so no info about position 4)
- D is new and not excluded
- Word is valid

But is A allowed in position 4? From SLATE, A was (-) in position 3 (so A is in the word but not position 3). From SALON, A is fixed in position 2. So A is only in position 2, and cannot be in positions 3,4,5. So SALAD is invalid because it has A in position 4.

Next candidates:
- SALKS (not a word)
- SALMI (M, I new)
- SALMI is a word (a type of stew), but might be obscure
- SALPS (P, S - S already used)
- SALIX (X is possible, I is new)
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALPA (A already in position 2, cannot be in 5)
- SALUK (U, K new)
- SALUK is a breed of dog, valid word

SALUK: S A L U K - all letters new except S,A,L which are fixed; U and K are unused and not excluded.

Another option: SALMI (S A L M I) - M and I are unused and not excluded.

Between SALUK and SALMI, both seem valid. SALMI is slightly more common in crosswords.

But let me check other possibilities:
- SALPS (S A L P S) - P and S; S already used in position 1, so P and second S are not helpful
- SALIX (S A L I X) - I and X

Looking at word frequency, SALMI and SALUK are both somewhat obscure. Maybe there's a more common word.

Another approach: think of common words starting with SAL.
Common ones are:
- SALAD (invalid due to A in position 4)
- SALTY (invalid, T excluded)
- SALSA (invalid, A in position 4)
- SALVE (invalid, E excluded)
- SALON (already used)
- SALVO (invalid, O excluded)
- SALUT (invalid, T excluded)
- SALPA (invalid, A in position 5)
- SALLY (Y is possible, but double L - L is already in position 3)
- SALMI (valid)
- SALUK (valid)

Given the constraints, SALMI seems the best next guess.

But let me double-check the pattern:
Current known: S A L _ _
Excluded letters: T, E, O, N
Remaining positions 4,5 must be filled with letters not yet used. From alphabet, possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, excluding any that might conflict.

Looking back at SLATE and SALON, no restrictions on positions 4,5 except letters not excluded.

Possible common endings:
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALUK (U, K)
- SALIX (I, X)
- SALVE (invalid)
- SALPA (invalid)

SALMI is a valid 5-letter word (a type of ragout or stew).

Thus, I'll go with SALMI.Based on the feedback, the word must start with ""SAL"" (positions 1-3), and the remaining letters must not include T, E, O, or N. A valid next guess is:

Excluded letters: T, E, O, N, M, I

Available letters for positions 4 and 5 (from the remaining alphabet):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) from the above set that form a valid English word when appended to “SAL”.

Possible English words beginning with “SAL” and using only the allowed letters:
- SALAD – A and D: A already used in position 2, so invalid (A cannot appear again).  
- SALSA – Same issue; A is repeated.  
- SALTY – T is excluded.  
- SALVE – E is excluded.  
- SALPA – P and A: A already used.  
- SALUK – U and K: both allowed.  
- SALKS – Not a standard word.  
- SALDS – Not a standard word.  
- SALFG – Not a word.  
- SALGY – Not a word.  
- SALCH – Not a word.  
- SALER – R allowed; “SALER” (variant of SALAR) is acceptable.  
- SALER vs SALUK: SALER is obscure; SALUK is the greyhound breed and is widely accepted.

Between SALUK and SALER, SALUK (S A L U K) is the clearer valid word.

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. A mix of consonants and vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. After considering these options, I think ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good feedback about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:

S(✓) – S is in the correct first position.  
L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
T(x) – T is not in the word at all.  
E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Word starts with S.  
- Contains L somewhere other than position 2.  
- Contains A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Does NOT contain T or E.

I should try a word that keeps S in place and tests other positions for L and A, while avoiding T/E. A possible candidate: “SCARF”  
– S stays in position 1.  
– C, R, F are all new letters.  
– L is not in positions 2, so might appear later.  
– A is not in position 3 but could be elsewhere.

However, SCARF doesn’t include L. Better choice: “SMALL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L is now in position 3 (but feedback said L is not in position 2, so okay).  
– A in position 4 (feedback said A is not in position 3, so okay).  
– M is new.  
But SMALL repeats L, which limits info.

Next option: “SLUMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– L in position 2 (but feedback said L is NOT in position 2), so reject.

How about “SKALD”?  
– S(✓) in place.  
– K is new, L in position 4 (okay), A in position 3 (forbidden—feedback said A not in position 3), reject.

Try “SNAIL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– N, I new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– P, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SCALD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, D new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SWAMP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– W, M, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SHAWL”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– H, W new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SALAD”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– First A in position 2 (okay), second A in position 4 (okay).  
– L in position 3 (okay), D new.  
But it has two A's—still useful.

“SCALP”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– C, P new.  
– A in position 3 (forbidden), reject.

“SPLAY” – but A and Y not sure, and L in position 2 (forbidden), reject.

“SHALL” – L in position 2 forbidden, reject.

“SALON”  
– S(✓) in place.  
– A in position 2 (okay), L in position 3 (okay), O, N new.  
This looks reasonable.

But to avoid repeating L and maximize new letters: “SABOT” – has T (forbidden), reject.

“SANDY” – Y not yet tested; A in position 2 (okay), N, D new.  
L is not present, but we know L must be in word, so reject.

“SUGAR” – A in position 4 (okay), U, G, R new; L missing.

“SUGAL” – not a word.

“SIGIL” – I, G new; L in position 4 (okay), but double I might be less informative.

“SABLE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAINT” – has N, I; T forbidden, reject.

“SALTY” – has T (forbidden), Y not confirmed useful, reject.

“SALVE” – has E (forbidden), reject.

“SAMBA” – B new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALSA” – A in position 3 forbidden, double S, reject.

“SARAN” – N new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SATIN” – T forbidden, reject.

“SAUNA” – U, N new; A in position 2 and 4 (okay), but L missing.

“SAVOR” – V, O, R new; A in position 2 (okay), but L missing.

“SALAD” seems the best compromise: keeps S fixed, places A not in position 3 (A is in position 2 here), places L not in position 2 (L in position 3), and introduces D.

But feedback for SLATE said L is NOT in position 2, so L in position 3 is fine, A in position 2 is fine, and D is new. Also, word must contain both L and A.

Hence, “SALAD”.

Alternatively, “SALTY” – but T is forbidden.

“SALON” – L in position 3, A in position 2, O, N new. Good.

I’ll go with SALON.

- SALTY (T excluded)
- SALAD (A is allowed in position 4, D is new)

Looking at ""SALAD"":
- Pattern: S A L A D
- A is allowed in position 4 (since in SALON, A was fixed in position 2, so no info about position 4)
- D is new and not excluded
- Word is valid

But is A allowed in position 4? From SLATE, A was (-) in position 3 (so A is in the word but not position 3). From SALON, A is fixed in position 2. So A is only in position 2, and cannot be in positions 3,4,5. So SALAD is invalid because it has A in position 4.

Next candidates:
- SALKS (not a word)
- SALMI (M, I new)
- SALMI is a word (a type of stew), but might be obscure
- SALPS (P, S - S already used)
- SALIX (X is possible, I is new)
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALVE (E excluded)
- SALPA (A already in position 2, cannot be in 5)
- SALUK (U, K new)
- SALUK is a breed of dog, valid word

SALUK: S A L U K - all letters new except S,A,L which are fixed; U and K are unused and not excluded.

Another option: SALMI (S A L M I) - M and I are unused and not excluded.

Between SALUK and SALMI, both seem valid. SALMI is slightly more common in crosswords.

But let me check other possibilities:
- SALPS (S A L P S) - P and S; S already used in position 1, so P and second S are not helpful
- SALIX (S A L I X) - I and X

Looking at word frequency, SALMI and SALUK are both somewhat obscure. Maybe there's a more common word.

Another approach: think of common words starting with SAL.
Common ones are:
- SALAD (invalid due to A in position 4)
- SALTY (invalid, T excluded)
- SALSA (invalid, A in position 4)
- SALVE (invalid, E excluded)
- SALON (already used)
- SALVO (invalid, O excluded)
- SALUT (invalid, T excluded)
- SALPA (invalid, A in position 5)
- SALLY (Y is possible, but double L - L is already in position 3)
- SALMI (valid)
- SALUK (valid)

Given the constraints, SALMI seems the best next guess.

But let me double-check the pattern:
Current known: S A L _ _
Excluded letters: T, E, O, N
Remaining positions 4,5 must be filled with letters not yet used. From alphabet, possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, excluding any that might conflict.

Looking back at SLATE and SALON, no restrictions on positions 4,5 except letters not excluded.

Possible common endings:
- SALMI (M, I)
- SALUK (U, K)
- SALIX (I, X)
- SALVE (invalid)
- SALPA (invalid)

SALMI is a valid 5-letter word (a type of ragout or stew).

Thus, I'll go with SALMI.Based on the feedback, the word must start with ""SAL"" (positions 1-3), and the remaining letters must not include T, E, O, or N. A valid next guess is:

1. Pattern: S A L _ _
2. Letters already placed correctly: S(1), A(2), L(3)
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: T, E, O, N, M, I

Excluded letters: T, E, O, N, M, I

Available letters for positions 4 and 5 (from the remaining alphabet):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) from the above set that form a valid English word when appended to “SAL”.

Possible English words beginning with “SAL” and using only the allowed letters:
- SALAD – A and D: A already used in position 2, so invalid (A cannot appear again).  
- SALSA – Same issue; A is repeated.  
- SALTY – T is excluded.  
- SALVE – E is excluded.  
- SALPA – P and A: A already used.  
- SALUK – U and K: both allowed.  
- SALKS – Not a standard word.  
- SALDS – Not a standard word.  
- SALFG – Not a word.  
- SALGY – Not a word.  
- SALCH – Not a word.  
- SALER – R allowed; “SALER” (variant of SALAR) is acceptable.  
- SALER vs SALUK: SALER is obscure; SALUK is the greyhound breed and is widely accepted.

Between SALUK and SALER, SALUK (S A L U K) is the clearer valid word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- Fixed first three letters: S A L
- After four guesses the only letters allowed are the ones we have NOT yet tried in positions 4 and 5.
- Letters already ruled out (absent entirely): T, E, O, N, M, I, U, K
- Available unused letters for positions 4 & 5 (from the remaining alphabet):  
  B, C, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a real five-letter word that begins with “SAL” and ends with two letters chosen only from the allowed set.

Scanning an internal word list, the only common* word that fits is:
- SALAD – but it repeats A (A already appears in position 2 and cannot be reused).  
- SALPS – but P and S are allowed; however the plural “salps” is fairly obscure.  
- SALER – R allowed, but “saler” is very rare.  
- SALTY – T is banned.  
- SALVE – E is banned.  
- SALPA – A is repeated, P allowed but A cannot be reused.  
- SALFG, SALCH, etc. – none are words.

The only remaining *common* valid choice is **SALPS**.

(*“Common” is relative, but among the possibilities it’s the best remaining.*)

The only way S can be “in the word but wrong position” is if there is a second S later.  
Therefore the secret word must contain a second S in position 4, giving the pattern:

That leaves only position 5 to be filled from the still-allowed letters and to form a real word.

Quick scan of the dictionary:
