For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can give me good information to narrow down the possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. I want to include some of these common letters to test their presence in the secret word.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common consonants and different vowels. ""ARISE"" is often recommended as a first guess because it contains:
- A, R (common letters)
- I, S, E (common letters and vowels)

This gives us coverage of several high-frequency letters that could appear in many 5-letter words.

Alternative good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SOARE"", but I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it's a well-balanced choice.

Let's interpret the feedback from ARISE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 4th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (E is 5th)
- Contains S somewhere (not 4th)
- Does NOT contain A, R, or I

Good letters to test next: common letters not yet ruled out, especially consonants and remaining vowels (O, U) since A, I are out. Also need to place S and test new positions.

A word like ""HOUSE"" would be good:
- H: common untested consonant
- O: untested vowel
- U: untested vowel
- S: tests S in 4th position (which we know it's not, but this helps confirm placement)
- E: already confirmed 5th

But since we know S isn't 4th, maybe better to test S in 1st, 2nd or 3rd position. ""STONE"" is good:
