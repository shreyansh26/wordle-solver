For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

From the feedback so far:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. R is in the word but not in position 2 (from CRONE feedback: R(-)).
3. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E (since R must appear somewhere, and position 2 is already ruled out).

Remaining common letters to try for positions 1, 3, 4 that haven't been used or ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for a word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses unused letters

A good candidate is ""BRIDE"":
- B: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (but from CRONE we know R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong)
Wait - that violates the R(-) from CRONE.

Alternative: ""URINE"":
- U: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (again violates R(-))
Not good.

""PRIDE"":
- P: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

""FRIED"":
- F: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

""GRIME"":
- G: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

Need R in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible word: ""RIDGE"" - but E is already position 5, so this would be _ R I D E - R in position 1.

""RIDGE"" uses D and I which haven't been eliminated.

But let's check if ""RIDGE"" fits:
- R: position 1 (allowed since R(-) only ruled out position 2)
- I, D, G: not in eliminated letters
- Ends in E

This seems valid.

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ from all three guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since in CRONE it was in position 2 and marked -, and in RIDGE it was in position 1 and marked -). So R must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G.

So the word pattern is: _ _ R _ E or _ _ _ R E, using only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining letters to use: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in E with R in position 3 or 4.

Let's try:
- _ _ R _ E: possible words like ""BURPE"" (not valid), ""FURYE"" (not valid), ""MERGE"" (G eliminated), ""PUREE"" (but P,U,R,E,E - E is already used)
- _ _ _ R E: like ""HUMER"" (not ending in E), ""FUMER"" (not valid), ""PURER"" (not 5 distinct letters), ""MURER"" (invalid)

Looking at valid words:
""BERRY"" - but Y is allowed, but ends in Y not E.
""PERKY"" - ends in Y.
""CURVE"" - C and U and V allowed, but C is eliminated.

Wait, let's think systematically. Possible pattern is _ _ _ R E or _ _ R _ E.

For _ _ R _ E:
- First letter: must be from remaining (B,F,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y)
- Second letter: same set
- Third letter: R (fixed)
- Fourth letter: from remaining letters

Possible combinations:
- B R _ E: but R is position 2 which is invalid (R must be 3 or 4)
- _ B R _ E: like ""MBREE"" (invalid), ""FBREE"" (invalid)

Better approach: look for actual words fitting _ _ R _ E or _ _ _ R E with constraints.

Let's try ""URBAN"" - but doesn't end in E.
""PUREE"" - but E is already position 5, and we have two E's which might not fit.

Wait, ""FURZE"" - but Z is not common.
""MERGE"" - G eliminated.
""PERSE"" - but S eliminated.
""VERGE"" - G eliminated.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A valid word: ""PURGE"" - but G eliminated.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
and contains no S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids S, L, A, T.  
Common remaining high-frequency consonants are R, N, C, H and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is ""CRONE"":

Remaining common letters to try for positions 1, 3, 4 that haven't been used or ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for a word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses unused letters

A good candidate is ""BRIDE"":
- B: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (but from CRONE we know R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong)
Wait - that violates the R(-) from CRONE.

Alternative: ""URINE"":
- U: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (again violates R(-))
Not good.

Possible word: ""RIDGE"" - but E is already position 5, so this would be _ R I D E - R in position 1.

""RIDGE"" uses D and I which haven't been eliminated.

But let's check if ""RIDGE"" fits:

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R E.

Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G, B, U, K.

Remaining available letters: F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, plus previously unused vowels (none left except E which is already used).

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in “R E” and uses only remaining letters. 

Let’s list possible candidates:
- F _ _ R E: FUMER (invalid), FIBRE (B eliminated), FURZE (Z not common), FIRER (I and R repeated).
- H _ _ R E: HUMER (invalid), HOPER (P, O, E, R – O eliminated), HURRY (Y instead of E).
- M _ _ R E: MURRE (invalid), MURER (invalid).
- P _ _ R E: PUREE (U eliminated), PURER (R twice and ends in R, not E).
- V _ _ R E: VAPOR (O eliminated), VIBER (B eliminated).
- W _ _ R E: WIPER (I and P available), but I is eliminated.
- Y _ _ R E: YAGER (G eliminated).

None of these are valid except:
- ""FIBRE"" uses B (eliminated)
- ""HYPER"" uses Y, P, H, E, R – all allowed letters and fits _ _ _ R E.

Let’s check HYPER:
- H: not eliminated
- Y: not eliminated
- P: not eliminated
- E: position 5 (correct)
- R: position 4 (correct per pattern).

This fits perfectly.",Guess 5: HYPER -> FEEDBACK: H(-) Y(x) P(x) E(-) R(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,WHERE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Words like ""ADIEU"", ""AROSE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This will help me quickly narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
and contains no S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids S, L, A, T.  
Common remaining high-frequency consonants are R, N, C, H and vowels O, I, U.

A good candidate that fits these constraints is ""CRONE"":
- Letters: C, R, O, N, E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T
- Ends in E
- Uses common letters that haven't been ruled out.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback so far:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. R is in the word but not in position 2 (from CRONE feedback: R(-)).
3. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

So the pattern is: _ R _ _ E (since R must appear somewhere, and position 2 is already ruled out).

Remaining common letters to try for positions 1, 3, 4 that haven't been used or ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for a word that:
- Ends in E
- Contains R somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses unused letters

A good candidate is ""BRIDE"":
- B: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (but from CRONE we know R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong)
Wait - that violates the R(-) from CRONE.

Alternative: ""URINE"":
- U: not eliminated
- R: in position 2 (again violates R(-))
Not good.

""PRIDE"":
- P: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

""FRIED"":
- F: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

""GRIME"":
- G: not eliminated
- R: position 2 (violates R(-))

Need R in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible word: ""RIDGE"" - but E is already position 5, so this would be _ R I D E - R in position 1.

""RIDGE"" uses D and I which haven't been eliminated.

But let's check if ""RIDGE"" fits:
- R: position 1 (allowed since R(-) only ruled out position 2)
- I, D, G: not in eliminated letters
- Ends in E

This seems valid.

<guess>RIDGE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: RIDGE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

1. E is fixed in position 5 (✓ from all three guesses).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since in CRONE it was in position 2 and marked -, and in RIDGE it was in position 1 and marked -). So R must be in position 3 or 4.
3. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G.

So the word pattern is: _ _ R _ E or _ _ _ R E, using only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining letters to use: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in E with R in position 3 or 4.

Let's try:
- _ _ R _ E: possible words like ""BURPE"" (not valid), ""FURYE"" (not valid), ""MERGE"" (G eliminated), ""PUREE"" (but P,U,R,E,E - E is already used)
- _ _ _ R E: like ""HUMER"" (not ending in E), ""FUMER"" (not valid), ""PURER"" (not 5 distinct letters), ""MURER"" (invalid)

Looking at valid words:
""BERRY"" - but Y is allowed, but ends in Y not E.
""PERKY"" - ends in Y.
""CURVE"" - C and U and V allowed, but C is eliminated.

Wait, let's think systematically. Possible pattern is _ _ _ R E or _ _ R _ E.

For _ _ R _ E:
- First letter: must be from remaining (B,F,H,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y)
- Second letter: same set
- Third letter: R (fixed)
- Fourth letter: from remaining letters
- Fifth letter: E (fixed)

Possible combinations:
- B R _ E: but R is position 2 which is invalid (R must be 3 or 4)
- _ B R _ E: like ""MBREE"" (invalid), ""FBREE"" (invalid)

Better approach: look for actual words fitting _ _ R _ E or _ _ _ R E with constraints.

Let's try ""URBAN"" - but doesn't end in E.
""PUREE"" - but E is already position 5, and we have two E's which might not fit.

Wait, ""FURZE"" - but Z is not common.
""MERGE"" - G eliminated.
""PERSE"" - but S eliminated.
""VERGE"" - G eliminated.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A valid word: ""PURGE"" - but G eliminated.
""BURKE"" - B, U, R, K, E: all allowed letters, R in position 3.

Let's check ""BURKE"":
- B: not eliminated
- U: not eliminated
- R: position 3 (allowed, since R must be 3 or 4)
- K: not eliminated
- E: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

  - In RIDGE, R was in position 1 → R not in 1.
  - In BURKE, R was in position 3 → R not in 3.
- Therefore, R must appear in position 4 only.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R E.

Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G, B, U, K.

Remaining available letters: F, H, M, P, V, W, Y, plus previously unused vowels (none left except E which is already used).

We need a valid 5-letter word that ends in “R E” and uses only remaining letters.

We now have five guesses and their feedback. Let's extract all the constraints:

Fixed positions:
- E is in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).

Fixed letters:
- R must appear in positions 3 or 4 (because in CRONE it was in position 2 and marked -, in RIDGE position 1 and marked -, in BURKE position 3 and marked -, and in HYPER position 4 and marked -).

But HYPER feedback shows:
- H(-) : H is in the word but not in position 1.
- Y(x) : Y is not in the word.
- P(x) : P is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know E is in position 5).
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already knew).

So new eliminations:
- Y and P are not in the word.

Previously eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G, B, U, K, Y, P.

Remaining available letters: F, H, M, V, W, plus E (fixed in position 5) and R (must appear in 3 or 4).

So the pattern must be:
- Position 5: E
- One of positions 3 or 4 must be R
- Other positions must be from F, H, M, V, W

Possible patterns:
- _ _ R _ E
- _ _ _ R E

Given that H is in the word but not in position 1 (from HYPER feedback), let's consider:

For _ _ R _ E:
- Position 1 and 2 must be from F, M, V, W (since H can't be in position 1)
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: from F, M, V, W

Possible combinations:
- F M R _ E: FMREE (invalid)
- F V R _ E: FVREE (invalid)
- M V R _ E: MVREE (invalid)
- W M R _ E: WMREE (invalid)

For _ _ _ R E:
- Position 1: from F, M, V, W (since H can't be in position 1)
- Position 2: from F, H, M, V, W (H allowed here)
- Position 3: from F, H, M, V, W
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E

Looking for valid words:
- H must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be in position 1)
- Let's try to place H in position 2:
  - _ H _ R E: FH R E (need a 3rd letter between H and R)
  - F H M R E: FH M R E → ""FHMRE"" (invalid)
  - F H V R E: ""FHVRE"" (invalid)
  - M H F R E: ""MHFRE"" (invalid)

Let's try placing H in position 3:
- _ _ H R E
- Possible combinations:
  - F M H R E: ""FMHRE"" (invalid)
  - M F H R E: ""MFHRE"" (invalid)
  - V M H R E: ""VMHRE"" (invalid)
  - W M H R E: ""WMHRE"" (invalid)

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Maybe I'm missing combinations.

Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words ending in ""RE"" with these constraints:
- Must use only F, H, M, V, W, R, E
- Must contain R in position 3 or 4
- Must contain H (since H is in the word per HYPER feedback)

Looking through possible words:
- ""WHERE"": W H E R E
  - Letters: W, H, E, R, E
  - E is in position 5 and 3 (but we only know E is in position 5, so this might have E in wrong place)
  - But in WHERE, E is in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 E would be marked (-) if it must be in 5. Wait, the feedback only tells us about each position, not about duplicates.

But let's check if WHERE fits:
- Pattern: _ _ _ R E (R in position 4)
- Contains H (in position 2)
- Uses only W, H, E, R (all allowed)
- E is in position 5 (matches)
- Doesn't use any eliminated letters.

This seems valid.

Fixed positions:
- E is in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).

Fixed letters:
- R must appear in positions 3 or 4 (because in CRONE it was in position 2 and marked -, in RIDGE position 1 and marked -, in BURKE position 3 and marked -, and in HYPER position 4 and marked -).

But HYPER feedback shows:
- H(-) : H is in the word but not in position 1.
- Y(x) : Y is not in the word.
- P(x) : P is not in the word.
- E(-) : E is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know E is in position 5).
- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 5 (which we already knew).

So new eliminations:
- Y and P are not in the word.

Previously eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, I, D, G, B, U, K, Y, P.

Remaining available letters: F, H, M, V, W, plus E (fixed in position 5) and R (must appear in 3 or 4).

So the pattern must be:
- Position 5: E
- One of positions 3 or 4 must be R
- Other positions must be from F, H, M, V, W

Possible patterns:
- _ _ R _ E
- _ _ _ R E

Given that H is in the word but not in position 1 (from HYPER feedback), let's consider:

For _ _ R _ E:
- Position 1 and 2 must be from F, M, V, W (since H can't be in position 1)
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: from F, M, V, W

Possible combinations:
- F M R _ E: FMREE (invalid)
- F V R _ E: FVREE (invalid)
- M V R _ E: MVREE (invalid)
- W M R _ E: WMREE (invalid)

For _ _ _ R E:
- Position 1: from F, M, V, W (since H can't be in position 1)
- Position 2: from F, H, M, V, W (H allowed here)
- Position 3: from F, H, M, V, W
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: E

Looking for valid words:
- H must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be in position 1)
- Let's try to place H in position 2:
  - _ H _ R E: FH R E (need a 3rd letter between H and R)
  - F H M R E: FH M R E → ""FHMRE"" (invalid)
  - F H V R E: ""FHVRE"" (invalid)
  - M H F R E: ""MHFRE"" (invalid)

Let's try placing H in position 3:
- _ _ H R E
- Possible combinations:
  - F M H R E: ""FMHRE"" (invalid)
  - M F H R E: ""MFHRE"" (invalid)
  - V M H R E: ""VMHRE"" (invalid)
  - W M H R E: ""WMHRE"" (invalid)

Hmm, none of these are valid words. Maybe I'm missing combinations.

Let's think of actual valid 5-letter words ending in ""RE"" with these constraints:
- Must use only F, H, M, V, W, R, E
- Must contain R in position 3 or 4
- Must contain H (since H is in the word per HYPER feedback)

Looking through possible words:
- ""WHERE"": W H E R E
  - Letters: W, H, E, R, E
  - E is in position 5 and 3 (but we only know E is in position 5, so this might have E in wrong place)
  - But in WHERE, E is in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 E would be marked (-) if it must be in 5. Wait, the feedback only tells us about each position, not about duplicates.

But let's check if WHERE fits:
- Pattern: _ _ _ R E (R in position 4)
- Contains H (in position 2)
- Uses only W, H, E, R (all allowed)
- E is in position 5 (matches)
- Doesn't use any eliminated letters.

This seems valid.

<guess>WHERE</guess>",Guess 6: WHERE -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) H(✓) E(✓) R(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
