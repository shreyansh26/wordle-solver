For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, which is optimal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent attempts.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it appears somewhere, just not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it appears somewhere, just not last).

So we know:
- The word contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Does NOT use R, O, or S.

Looking at common letters that remain (excluding R,O,S and including A,E), possible choices include D, T, N, L, C, M, P, etc. 

A good next guess would be a word like ""TABLE"":
- T: common letter not yet tested.
- A: must be in position 2 (since it can't be 1).
- B: new letter.
- L: new letter.
- E: must be in position 4 (since it can't be 5).

This tests A in position 2, E in position 4, and introduces T, B, L.

Step 1 – Extract what we now know from all feedback

Letters definitely in the word (and CAN appear in more than one place):
- A – must be in 3, 4, or 5 (it was wrong in positions 1, 2, 3 so far)
- E – must be in 1, 2, or 3 (it was wrong in positions 4, 5, 2 so far)
- L – must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it was wrong in position 4)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
R, O, S, T, B, C, H

Step 2 – Work out possible positions for the three known letters

We have three letters (A, E, L) and need to fit them into five slots, possibly with repeats; however, let’s assume no repeats first (most common case).

Look at the intersection of the position constraints:

- A : possible slots 3, 4, 5  
- E : possible slots 1, 2, 3  
- L : possible slots 1, 2, 3, 5  

Step 3 – Pick a word that obeys those constraints while also introducing new untested consonants

Untested consonants that are still allowed include D, F, G, I (as consonant Y), J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple, common pattern that fits:

- Position 1: E (allowed 1,2,3 → choose 1)
- Position 2: L (allowed 1,2,3,5 → choose 2)
- Position 3: A (allowed 3,4,5 → choose 3)
- Positions 4–5: fill with two new consonants that have never appeared and are allowed.

One such word: E L A N D  
Check:  
E (pos 1 – allowed)  
L (pos 2 – allowed)  
A (pos 3 – allowed)  
N and D are both fresh letters and are not on the forbidden list.  
Word is valid: ELAND.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This gives us information about 5 different letters in one guess, which is optimal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent attempts.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it appears somewhere, just not first).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it appears somewhere, just not last).

So we know:
- The word contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Does NOT use R, O, or S.

Looking at common letters that remain (excluding R,O,S and including A,E), possible choices include D, T, N, L, C, M, P, etc. 

A good next guess would be a word like ""TABLE"":
- T: common letter not yet tested.
- A: must be in position 2 (since it can't be 1).
- B: new letter.
- L: new letter.
- E: must be in position 4 (since it can't be 5).

This tests A in position 2, E in position 4, and introduces T, B, L.

  (because they got “-” in at least one spot, meaning present but wrong position)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, B

- Positions definitely wrong for the known letters:
  – A cannot be 1st or 2nd (from AROSE and TABLE respectively)
  – E cannot be 5th or 4th (from AROSE and TABLE respectively)
  – L cannot be 4th (from TABLE)

Therefore the remaining alphabet pool is:
  – Vowels left: A, E (I, U yet untested)
  – Consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  – But we already know L is in.

We want a 5-letter word that
  - contains A, E and L
  - does not use R, O, S, T, B
  - places A not in position 1 or 2
  - places E not in position 4 or 5
  - places L not in position 4

A word that satisfies all these constraints and uses common remaining letters is “LEACH”.

Check:
L – known to be in word  
E – known to be in word, now in 2nd position (allowed, because we only know it can’t be 4th or 5th)  
A – known to be in word, now in 3rd position (allowed, can’t be 1st or 2nd)

1. E is in the correct first position.
2. L is in the word but not in position 2.
3. A is in the word but not in position 3.
4. N and D are not in the word at all.

Combining all previous constraints:

Positions still open: 2, 3, 4, 5
- A cannot be in 1, 2, 3 → must be 4 or 5
- L cannot be in 4 → must be 2, 3, or 5

Let’s try placing A in position 4 and L in position 5:
E _ _ A L

We need consonants for positions 2 and 3 from the allowed set. Good common choices are F and M.

A valid word following this pattern: E F A M L → but ""EFAML"" isn't a real word.
Instead, let's use G and M: E G A M L → ""EGAML"" isn't valid.

Try swapping positions of A and L:
E _ L A _

Now we need two consonants for positions 2 and 5. Common options: G and M
E G L A M → ""EGLAM"" isn't a real word.

Alternative pattern: place L in 3, A in 4:
E _ L A _

Need consonants for 2 and 5. Try F and M:
E F L A M → ""EFL"" isn't valid.

Another approach: use I as a vowel in position 2 (since it's untested) and L in 3, A in 5:
E I L _ A → need one consonant for position 4. Try K:
E I L K A → ""EILKA"" isn't a word.

Let's try a simpler pattern: E _ A _ L
Need consonants for 2 and 4. Good options: G and M:
E G A M L → not valid.

Real word check: ""EMAIL"" fits E _ A _ L with I in position 2:
E M A I L → but we know M hasn't been tested yet.

However, let's verify:
E(1) M(2) A(3) I(4) L(5):
- E confirmed at 1 ✓
- A would be at 3 - but A can't be at 3 (from LEACH feedback) ✗

Next try: E L A _ _ but L can't be at 2.

Try E A _ _ L but A can't be at 2.

Try E _ _ A L with A at 4:
Possible word: E G A M L → invalid.

Real word: ""EXALT"" - but T is forbidden.

""EVACU"" uses C (forbidden).

""EAGLE"" - but G is allowed, L must be at 4 or 5, A at 2 or 3 or 4 or 5:
E A G L E → has two E's, but pattern would be E(1)A(2)G(3)L(4)E(5)
- A at 2 is allowed (only forbidden at 1,2,3 from LEACH? Wait no:
From TABLE A(-) means A not at 2, from LEACH A(-) means A not at 3, from AROSE A(-) means A not at 1.
So A can be 4 or 5 only.

Thus E A _ _ _ is impossible since A must be 4 or 5.

Best pattern is E _ _ A L or E _ _ _ A with L somewhere.

Real word: ""EQUAL"" - Q and U are new, A at 4, L at 5:
E Q U A L → Q and U are untested, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed).

Check constraints:

We need consonants for positions 2 and 3 from the allowed set. Good common choices are F and M.

A valid word following this pattern: E F A M L → but ""EFAML"" isn't a real word.
Instead, let's use G and M: E G A M L → ""EGAML"" isn't valid.

Try swapping positions of A and L:
E _ L A _

Now we need two consonants for positions 2 and 5. Common options: G and M
E G L A M → ""EGLAM"" isn't a real word.

Alternative pattern: place L in 3, A in 4:
E _ L A _

Need consonants for 2 and 5. Try F and M:
E F L A M → ""EFL"" isn't valid.

Another approach: use I as a vowel in position 2 (since it's untested) and L in 3, A in 5:
E I L _ A → need one consonant for position 4. Try K:
E I L K A → ""EILKA"" isn't a word.

Let's try a simpler pattern: E _ A _ L
Need consonants for 2 and 4. Good options: G and M:
E G A M L → not valid.

Real word check: ""EMAIL"" fits E _ A _ L with I in position 2:
E M A I L → but we know M hasn't been tested yet.

However, let's verify:
E(1) M(2) A(3) I(4) L(5):
- E confirmed at 1 ✓
- A would be at 3 - but A can't be at 3 (from LEACH feedback) ✗

Next try: E L A _ _ but L can't be at 2.

Try E A _ _ L but A can't be at 2.

Try E _ _ A L with A at 4:
Possible word: E G A M L → invalid.

Real word: ""EXALT"" - but T is forbidden.

""EVACU"" uses C (forbidden).

""EAGLE"" - but G is allowed, L must be at 4 or 5, A at 2 or 3 or 4 or 5:
E A G L E → has two E's, but pattern would be E(1)A(2)G(3)L(4)E(5)
- A at 2 is allowed (only forbidden at 1,2,3 from LEACH? Wait no:
From TABLE A(-) means A not at 2, from LEACH A(-) means A not at 3, from AROSE A(-) means A not at 1.
So A can be 4 or 5 only.

Thus E A _ _ _ is impossible since A must be 4 or 5.

Best pattern is E _ _ A L or E _ _ _ A with L somewhere.

Real word: ""EQUAL"" - Q and U are new, A at 4, L at 5:
E Q U A L → Q and U are untested, A at 4 (allowed), L at 5 (allowed).

Check constraints:
- E at 1 ✓
- A at 4 (not at 1,2,3) ✓
- L at 5 (not at 4) ✓
- Q, U haven't been tested and aren't forbidden.",Guess 5: EQUAL -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
