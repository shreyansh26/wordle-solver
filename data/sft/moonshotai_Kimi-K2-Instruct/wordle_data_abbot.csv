For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to help narrow down possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to maximize information gain.

After considering options, ""AROSE"" comes to mind:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Contains 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing coverage
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good feedback on several key letters regardless of the secret word.

From the first feedback:
- A is in the word and in the first position.
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So the word starts with A, contains O (but not in position 3), and does **not** contain R, S, or E.

Since O is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

I want my next guess to:
1. Keep A in position 1.
2. Place O in a different spot to test where it fits.
3. Use other common letters that weren’t ruled out (like L, N, T, C, K, etc.).

A good option might be ""ALOIN"":
- A stays in position 1.
- O is in position 2 (testing if O is in position 2).
- L, I, N are new letters (none ruled out yet).

Alternatively, ""ADOPT"":
- A stays in position 1.
- O is in position 2.
- D, P, T are new letters.

Another option: ""ANCHO"":

From the new feedback:

- A (1st) ✓, O (4th) ✓, T (5th) ✓ ⇒ template: A _ _ O T
- L and N are NOT in the word (x).
- Previously excluded letters: R, S, E, D, P, L, N.

We now need a consonant for positions 2 and 3 using only the remaining alphabet.

Possible common letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We want two consonants that fit A _ _ O T and remain valid 5-letter words.

Let’s list plausible pairs:

- C and H → ACHOT (not a word)
- C and K → ACKOT (not a word)
- G and H → AGHOT (not a word)
- M and B → AMBOT (not a word)
- C and O already used in position 4.

Scanning real English words matching A _ _ O T:

- ABHOT – invalid
- ABBOT – uses B twice, but B is allowed.
- ACCOT – invalid
- AFGOT – invalid
- AHROT – invalid, R excluded
- ALLOT – L is excluded
- AMMOT – invalid
- ANGOT – N excluded
- APHOT – P excluded
- ARGOT – R excluded
- ASCOT – S excluded
- ASSOT – S excluded
- AVBOT – invalid

Only plausible real word left is **ABBOT**.

Check constraints:
- A ✓, O ✓, T ✓ positions correct.
- B has not been used or excluded.
- Word length and validity confirmed.
- Only one new letter B introduced twice, but that’s allowed.

Therefore, ABBOT is the logical next guess.
