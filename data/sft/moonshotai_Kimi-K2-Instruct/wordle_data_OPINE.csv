For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will provide maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""SLATE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""ADIEU"" uses 4 vowels but has fewer consonants to test
- ""RAISE"" has 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- ""SLATE"" has 2 vowels and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it tests common letters in positions that could help narrow down the word quickly. It contains R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters in 5-letter words.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word that contains common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""SLATE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""ADIEU"" uses 4 vowels but has fewer consonants to test
- ""RAISE"" has 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- ""SLATE"" has 2 vowels and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it tests common letters in positions that could help narrow down the word quickly. It contains R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters in 5-letter words.

- The letters R, A, and S are NOT in the word.
- The letters I and E ARE in the word and each is in its correct position: 3rd and 5th respectively.
- So the pattern so far is: _ _ I _ E

I need a word that:
1. Is 5 letters.
2. Has I in the 3rd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Does NOT contain R, A, or S.
5. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Some candidate words:
- ""CHIME"" – contains C, H, M (valid letters, not ruled out)
- ""WHILE"" – contains W, H, L
- ""QUITE"" – contains Q, U, T
- ""PINE"" – too short, 4 letters
- ""GRIPE"" – contains R (invalid)

""CHIME"" seems good: C, H, M are all common and not yet ruled out.

- ""FLITE"" – F, L, I, T, E.  All letters allowed.
- ""GLIDE"" – G, L, I, D, E.  All letters allowed.
- ""PLINE"" – P, L, I, N, E.  All letters allowed.
- ""TWINE"" – T, W, I, N, E.  All letters allowed.

""TWINE"" tests T and W, which are common, and N, another common consonant. It gives good coverage.
