For a first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and gives us good information about vowels and consonants. Some good first guesses include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" which use many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

All five letters in AROSE are rejected, so we now know the secret word contains none of: A, R, O, S, E.

We need a completely fresh set of common consonants and vowels.

Common consonants not yet tested: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, H, G  
Common vowels not yet tested: I, U  

A balanced word that covers several of these:  
- “UNTIL” – uses U, N, T, I, L

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → all five letters (A, R, O, S, E) are not in the word at all (x).
2. UNTIL → U is in the word but in the wrong position (-), N, T, I are not in the word (x), and L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- No A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I.
- U and L are somewhere in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, and vowels not tested yet: none left (since A, O, E, I, U have all been tried, with only U being in the word).

Since we have only U and L confirmed, and five slots, we need to guess a word that:
- Uses U and L but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (from the above list).

Possible positions for U and L:
- U cannot be in position 1, L cannot be in position 5.
- U could be in 2,3,4,5; L could be in 1,2,3,4.

Let’s try a word like ""FLUKY"":
- F, L, U, K, Y — all letters not previously ruled out.
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 1).

This seems like a good next guess to test new common letters while placing U and L in acceptable spots.

- The only remaining possible positions for U and L are:
  - U must be in position 4, but K is already there, so U must be in position 5. But Y is already there, so this seems impossible. Wait, let me re-examine:
  
Actually, U cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from UNTIL and FLUKY feedback). So U must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is K and position 5 is Y, both confirmed correct. Therefore, U must be in position 4, but K is already there. This implies U must be in position 5, but Y is there and confirmed correct. This suggests U is not in the word, which contradicts UNTIL's feedback where U was marked as in the word but wrong position.

Wait, let's carefully re-examine the feedback:

From UNTIL: U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 1. L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 5.

From FLUKY: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 2. U(-) means U is in the word but not in position 3.

So:
- U cannot be in positions 1, 3.
- L cannot be in positions 2, 5.
- The word ends with KY (positions 4,5).
- Contains L and U.

Possible positions:
- U must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5). But position 4 is K, so U must be in position 2.
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2,5). Position 4 is K, so L must be in position 1 or 3.

So the word structure is:
- Position 1: L or other letter
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L or other letter
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: Y

And the letters used so far that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, F.

Available letters (common ones) that haven't been ruled out: B, C, D, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y (Y is already used), L, U (already placed).

Possible candidates:
- If L is in position 1: word starts with L, then U, then needs a 3rd letter before KY. L _ _ K Y
  Possible: LUCKY (but C wasn't tested)
- If L is in position 3: word is _ U L K Y
  Possible: BULKY, DULKY (but DULKY isn't a word), HULKY (no), PULKY (no), so BULKY seems best.

Let's check BULKY:
- B: new letter
- U: position 2 (allowed, not in 1,3)
- L: position 3 (allowed, not in 2,5)
- K: position 4 (correct)
- Y: position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

<guess>BULKY</guess>",BULKY,"From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → N, T, I are NOT in the word; U and L are in the word but NOT in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
3. FLUKY → F is NOT in the word; L and U are in the word but NOT in positions 2 and 3 respectively; K and Y are in the word and ARE in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

So we know:
- The word ends with ""KY"" (positions 4 and 5).
- Contains L and U somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5 (for L) and not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (for U).
- The only remaining possible positions for U and L are:
  - U must be in position 4, but K is already there, so U must be in position 5. But Y is already there, so this seems impossible. Wait, let me re-examine:
