For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to use a word that covers common letters and vowels to maximize information. A good starting word should include several common consonants and a mix of vowels. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants like R and S. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

The feedback for AROSE shows:
- A is NOT in the word (x).  
- R is NOT in the word (x).  
- O is NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th, so it could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th, so it could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th).

So the secret word definitely contains S and E, but does NOT contain A, R, or O.  
We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E in positions 1–3 or 1–4 (since they weren’t correct in positions 4 and 5).  
2. Avoids A, R, O.  
3. Uses common consonants not yet tried (e.g., T, L, N, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates:  
- “STEIN” – uses S and E, introduces T, I, N.  
- “STEED” – uses S and E twice, introduces T, D.  
- “SLEET” – uses S, E, introduces L, T.  

I’ll pick “STEIN” because it introduces three new consonants (T, I, N) and places S first and E third, both different from their original positions.

Let’s summarize what we know so far.

Letters definitely in the word (but their positions are still unknown):
- S (must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 because position 1 was already tried and marked “-”)
- E (must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 because position 3 was already tried and marked “-”)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, O, I, N

Letters that have never been tested:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We therefore need a new 5-letter word that:
- contains both S and E
- does NOT contain A, R, O, I, N
- places S and E in previously untried positions

Let’s look at the remaining possible positions for S and E:

Possible positions left for S: 2, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions left for E: 1, 2, 4, 5  

We want to test a few new consonants and a vowel we haven’t used yet. The vowels left are U and Y (and the “sometimes” vowels). Good fresh consonants are L, D, M, K, C, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “DESKS”.  
- Contains both S and E.  
- S is in position 3 (new).  
- E is in position 2 (new).  
- D and K are brand-new letters.

- E is correctly in position 2.  
- The first S is marked “-” (wrong position) — it cannot be at position 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

A good starting word should include several common consonants and a mix of vowels. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes all five common vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants like R and S. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback for AROSE shows:
- A is NOT in the word (x).  
- R is NOT in the word (x).  
- O is NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th, so it could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 5th, so it could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th).

So the secret word definitely contains S and E, but does NOT contain A, R, or O.  
We need a new word that:
1. Uses S and E in positions 1–3 or 1–4 (since they weren’t correct in positions 4 and 5).  
2. Avoids A, R, O.  
3. Uses common consonants not yet tried (e.g., T, L, N, D, C, etc.).

Good candidates:  
- “STEIN” – uses S and E, introduces T, I, N.  
- “STEED” – uses S and E twice, introduces T, D.  
- “SLEET” – uses S, E, introduces L, T.  

I’ll pick “STEIN” because it introduces three new consonants (T, I, N) and places S first and E third, both different from their original positions.

Letters definitely in the word (but their positions are still unknown):

- E (must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 because position 3 was already tried and marked “-”)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, O, I, N

Letters that have never been tested:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We therefore need a new 5-letter word that:
- contains both S and E
- does NOT contain A, R, O, I, N
- places S and E in previously untried positions

Let’s look at the remaining possible positions for S and E:

Possible positions left for S: 2, 3, 4, 5  
Possible positions left for E: 1, 2, 4, 5  

We want to test a few new consonants and a vowel we haven’t used yet. The vowels left are U and Y (and the “sometimes” vowels). Good fresh consonants are L, D, M, K, C, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “DESKS”.  
- Contains both S and E.  
- S is in position 3 (new).  
- E is in position 2 (new).  
- D and K are brand-new letters.

Possible positions left for E: 1, 2, 4, 5  

We want to test a few new consonants and a vowel we haven’t used yet. The vowels left are U and Y (and the “sometimes” vowels). Good fresh consonants are L, D, M, K, C, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints is “DESKS”.  
- Contains both S and E.  
- S is in position 3 (new).  
- E is in position 2 (new).  
- D and K are brand-new letters.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, I, N) are present.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: DESKS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s digest the new feedback:

DESKS → D(x) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)

- E is correctly in position 2.  
- The first S is marked “-” (wrong position) — it cannot be at position 3.  
- The last S is marked “✓” — it is correctly in position 5.

So the word structure now looks like:
_ E _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: E (fixed at 2), S (fixed at 5).  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N, D, K.

We still need three more letters for positions 1, 3, and 4, chosen from the unused set {B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Common consonants we haven’t tried yet: B, C, F, L, M, P, T.  
Common vowel we haven’t tried yet: U (Y is sometimes a vowel but less common).

We want common letters to maximize hits. Let’s pick “C” and “L” plus “U” for a vowel.

A 5-letter word fitting _ E _ _ S:

Possible candidate: “CELTS”  
- C E L T S  
- E is correct position 2, S correct at 5.  
- C, L, T are all new and allowed.  

This satisfies every constraint.

   - Position 2 = E (✓)
   - Position 5 = S (✓)

2. Letters NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, O, I, N, D, K, C, L

3. Letters that still need placement (positions 1, 3, 4):
   Must come only from {B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}

4. From the feedback:
   - T appeared in Guess 4 at position 4 and was marked “-”:  
     T is in the word, but NOT at position 4.
   - Therefore T must be at position 1 or 3.

5. We need two more letters for the remaining two slots, avoiding the forbidden set.

Possible consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We should pick common ones: B, F, G, H, M, P, U, Y

Let’s test T at position 1 first (placing T in the first slot) and fill positions 3 & 4 with two new consonants or vowels that haven’t appeared.

Candidate: T E M P S  
- T at 1 (new position)  
- E at 2 (fixed)  
- M, P new letters  
- S at 5 (fixed)  
No forbidden letters are used.

Updated facts from all feedback:

1. Confirmed positions:
   - Position 2 = E
   - Position 5 = S

2. Known letters still somewhere in the word (but positions unknown):
   - T (marked “-” twice: once at pos 4 [CELTS], once at pos 1 [TEMPS])  
     Therefore T must be at position 3.

3. Letters ruled out entirely:
   A, R, O, I, N, D, K, C, L, M, P

4. Remaining candidates for positions 1 and 4 must come from the unused set:
   B, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. Pattern is now:
   _ E T _ S

6. We still need two new letters for positions 1 and 4.  
   Common consonants left: B, F, G, H, Y  
   Vowels left: U

A very common English word that fits this exact pattern is:
   B E T Y S  (but Y rarely precedes S, and Y is consonantal here).
   B E T H S  (valid but uncommon).
   F E T U S  (legal word and uses new F and U).

Check: F, E, T, U, S – all allowed positions; no banned letters.

Therefore the most reasonable final guess is:
