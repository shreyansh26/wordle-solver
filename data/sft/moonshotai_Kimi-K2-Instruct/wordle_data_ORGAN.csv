For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice among Wordle players because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, while also providing information about the presence/absence of these common letters. Other good first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I'll stick with ""CRANE"" as it's well-balanced.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in position 2 (second letter).
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the target word looks like:
- _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed at position 2)
- Must contain A and N somewhere (positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for A and N, so A and N must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Must not contain C or E at all.

Possible positions for A and N:
- A could be in position 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in position 1, 3, or 5

We also want to test new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet include L, S, T, D, M, B, etc. Let’s try to place A and N in positions we haven’t ruled out, and test some new consonants.

A good next guess might be “DRAIN”:
- D (new letter)
- R (confirmed at position 2)
- A (possible at position 3, since N is confirmed not at 4, but A could be at 3)
- I (new vowel)
- N (possible at position 5)

However, A cannot be at position 3 (since A(-) means A is not at position 3), so “DRAIN” is invalid. Let’s rethink.

Another approach: place A at position 1 or 5, and N at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not overlapping with A). 

Let’s try “BRAND”:
- B (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – but A(-) means A is not at 3 – so invalid)

Next, “FRANK”:
- F (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid, same issue)

“PRANK”:
- P (new)

- D (new)
- R (fixed at 2)

“GRANT”:
- G (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

“TRAIN”:
- T (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

Hmm, A cannot be at 3, and N cannot be at 4. Let’s try placing A at 1 and N at 5:

“AR _ _ N” – but R is at 2, so positions are:
1: A
2: R
5: N

Now we need letters for 3 and 4. Let’s pick common consonants not yet used (S, T, L, etc.).

Option: “ARTNS” – not a valid word.

“ARSON”:
- A (1)
- R (2)
- S (3)
- O (4)
- N (5)
This fits: A at 1 (allowed), N at 5 (allowed), R at 2 (correct), and introduces S and O.

Check constraints:
- A is in the word (position 1 is allowed)
- N is in the word (position 5 is allowed)
- No C or E
- Valid 5-letter word: ARSON.

Thus, ARSON is a reasonable next guess.

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Round 2: ARSON → A(-) R(✓) S(x) O(-) N(✓)

Let’s consolidate the information.

1. Letter inventory
   - Must contain: R (position 2), N (somewhere), A (somewhere), O (somewhere)
   - Must NOT contain: C, E, S

2. Position constraints so far
   - R is fixed in slot 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in slot 1 or 3 → A can be in slot 4 or 5.
   - N is in the word but NOT in slot 4 → N can be in slot 1, 3, or 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in slot 4 → O can be in slot 1, 3, or 5.

3. Current pattern (underscore = unknown):
   _ R _ _ _

4. Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, plus vowels I and U.

5. Decide where to place A, N, O.
   - A must be in slot 4 or 5.
   - N must be in slot 1, 3, or 5.
   - O must be in slot 1, 3, or 5 (and different from N).

6. Enumerate possibilities that satisfy all constraints (R fixed at 2):

   Case 1: A in slot 4
            _ R _ A _
            Then N and O must go in slots 1, 3, 5 without conflict.
            - If N in 1, O in 3 or 5 → NR A _ or NR _ A O
            - If N in 3, O in 1 or 5 → OR N A _ or _ R N A O
            - If N in 5, O in 1 or 3 → OR _ A N or _ R O A N

            Candidate words that fit:
            – NR A _  (need consonant in 5)  → NR A D → NRA D?  No 5-letter word “NRAD”.
            – OR N A _ → ORNA_  (slot 5) → ORNAD? no. ORNAM – not valid.
            – OR _ A N → ORDAN? ORDAN not in word list.
            – _ R N A O → not valid starting letter.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,4,ORGAN,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice among Wordle players because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, while also providing information about the presence/absence of these common letters. Other good first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I'll stick with ""CRANE"" as it's well-balanced.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:

- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in position 2 (second letter).
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the target word looks like:
- _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed at position 2)
- Must contain A and N somewhere (positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for A and N, so A and N must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Must not contain C or E at all.

Possible positions for A and N:
- A could be in position 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in position 1, 3, or 5

We also want to test new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet include L, S, T, D, M, B, etc. Let’s try to place A and N in positions we haven’t ruled out, and test some new consonants.

A good next guess might be “DRAIN”:
- D (new letter)
- R (confirmed at position 2)
- A (possible at position 3, since N is confirmed not at 4, but A could be at 3)
- I (new vowel)
- N (possible at position 5)

However, A cannot be at position 3 (since A(-) means A is not at position 3), so “DRAIN” is invalid. Let’s rethink.

Another approach: place A at position 1 or 5, and N at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not overlapping with A). 

Let’s try “BRAND”:
- B (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – but A(-) means A is not at 3 – so invalid)

Next, “FRANK”:
- F (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid, same issue)

“PRANK”:
- P (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

Try “DRANT”:
- D (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

“GRANT”:
- G (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

“TRAIN”:
- T (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

Hmm, A cannot be at 3, and N cannot be at 4. Let’s try placing A at 1 and N at 5:

“AR _ _ N” – but R is at 2, so positions are:
1: A
2: R
5: N

Now we need letters for 3 and 4. Let’s pick common consonants not yet used (S, T, L, etc.).

Option: “ARTNS” – not a valid word.

“ARSON”:
- A (1)
- R (2)
- S (3)
- O (4)
- N (5)
This fits: A at 1 (allowed), N at 5 (allowed), R at 2 (correct), and introduces S and O.

Check constraints:
- A is in the word (position 1 is allowed)
- N is in the word (position 5 is allowed)
- No C or E
- Valid 5-letter word: ARSON.

Thus, ARSON is a reasonable next guess.

  From CRANE we already knew R is in position 2, but NORMA places R in position 3 and gets (-).  
  That does NOT contradict the earlier “R(✓) in position 2”; it only confirms R is NOT in position 3.  
  Therefore the fixed info is: R is at position 2.

- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 → A must be in position 4.

- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 → N must be in position 3 or 5.

- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 → O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Template so far
_ R A _ _   (because A must be in slot 4 and R in slot 2)

Now place N and O in the remaining slots 1, 3, 5, without overlap and without re-using forbidden letters.

Slots left: 1, 3, 5 must hold N and O plus one more consonant (since we already have R, A, N, O; we need a fifth letter that isn’t C, E, S, M).

Possibilities
- If N is in slot 3:
  Pattern becomes _ R A N _
  Then O must go in slot 1 or 5, and we need another consonant for the remaining slot.
  Valid word shape: O R A N _ or _ R A N O
  Candidates:
    – ORAN_ → ORANG (but G was never tested and is allowed)
    – FRANO, BRANO not common
    – ORANT (not a word)
  ORANG is a recognized 5-letter word.

- If N is in slot 5:
  Pattern becomes _ R A _ N
  Then O must go in slot 1 or 3.
  Slot 3 is already A, so O must be in slot 1.
  Pattern: O R A _ N
  Need a consonant in slot 4 other than C, E, S, M.
  Candidate: ORADN? Not valid.
  OR A _ N → ORABN, ORALN, ORAHN… none are words.

Hence the only common valid candidate in this branch is ORANG.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities effectively. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is a popular choice among Wordle players because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting some letters in the secret word, while also providing information about the presence/absence of these common letters. Other good first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"", but I'll stick with ""CRANE"" as it's well-balanced.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:

- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is in position 2 (second letter).
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the target word looks like:
- _ R _ _ _ (R is fixed at position 2)
- Must contain A and N somewhere (positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for A and N, so A and N must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- Must not contain C or E at all.

Possible positions for A and N:
- A could be in position 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in position 1, 3, or 5

We also want to test new letters. Common consonants we haven’t tried yet include L, S, T, D, M, B, etc. Let’s try to place A and N in positions we haven’t ruled out, and test some new consonants.

A good next guess might be “DRAIN”:
- D (new letter)
- R (confirmed at position 2)
- A (possible at position 3, since N is confirmed not at 4, but A could be at 3)
- I (new vowel)
- N (possible at position 5)

However, A cannot be at position 3 (since A(-) means A is not at position 3), so “DRAIN” is invalid. Let’s rethink.

Another approach: place A at position 1 or 5, and N at position 1, 3, or 5 (but not overlapping with A). 

Let’s try “BRAND”:
- B (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – but A(-) means A is not at 3 – so invalid)

Next, “FRANK”:
- F (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid, same issue)

“PRANK”:
- P (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

Try “DRANT”:
- D (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

“GRANT”:
- G (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

“TRAIN”:
- T (new)
- R (fixed at 2)
- A (at 3 – invalid)

Hmm, A cannot be at 3, and N cannot be at 4. Let’s try placing A at 1 and N at 5:

“AR _ _ N” – but R is at 2, so positions are:
1: A
2: R
5: N

Now we need letters for 3 and 4. Let’s pick common consonants not yet used (S, T, L, etc.).

Option: “ARTNS” – not a valid word.

“ARSON”:
- A (1)
- R (2)
- S (3)
- O (4)
- N (5)
This fits: A at 1 (allowed), N at 5 (allowed), R at 2 (correct), and introduces S and O.

Check constraints:
- A is in the word (position 1 is allowed)
- N is in the word (position 5 is allowed)
- No C or E
- Valid 5-letter word: ARSON.

Thus, ARSON is a reasonable next guess.

<guess>ARSON</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) S(x) O(-) N(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: CRANE → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Round 2: ARSON → A(-) R(✓) S(x) O(-) N(✓)

Let’s consolidate the information.

1. Letter inventory
   - Must contain: R (position 2), N (somewhere), A (somewhere), O (somewhere)
   - Must NOT contain: C, E, S

2. Position constraints so far
   - R is fixed in slot 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in slot 1 or 3 → A can be in slot 4 or 5.
   - N is in the word but NOT in slot 4 → N can be in slot 1, 3, or 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in slot 4 → O can be in slot 1, 3, or 5.

3. Current pattern (underscore = unknown):
   _ R _ _ _

4. Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, plus vowels I and U.

5. Decide where to place A, N, O.
   - A must be in slot 4 or 5.
   - N must be in slot 1, 3, or 5.
   - O must be in slot 1, 3, or 5 (and different from N).

6. Enumerate possibilities that satisfy all constraints (R fixed at 2):

   Case 1: A in slot 4
            _ R _ A _
            Then N and O must go in slots 1, 3, 5 without conflict.
            - If N in 1, O in 3 or 5 → NR A _ or NR _ A O
            - If N in 3, O in 1 or 5 → OR N A _ or _ R N A O
            - If N in 5, O in 1 or 3 → OR _ A N or _ R O A N

            Candidate words that fit:
            – NR A _  (need consonant in 5)  → NR A D → NRA D?  No 5-letter word “NRAD”.
            – OR N A _ → ORNA_  (slot 5) → ORNAD? no. ORNAM – not valid.
            – OR _ A N → ORDAN? ORDAN not in word list.
            – _ R N A O → not valid starting letter.

            Seems no common word fits this case easily.

   Case 2: A in slot 5
            _ R _ _ A
            Then N must be in slot 1 or 3, and O must be in slot 1 or 3 (different from N).

            Sub-cases:
            a) N in 1, O in 3 → N R O _ A
            b) O in 1, N in 3 → O R N _ A
            c) N in 1, O in 3 already covered.

            Need a consonant in slot 4.

            a) N R O _ A  → NRODA, NROMA, NROGA, NROKA, NROTA, NROLA…
               “NORMA” is valid 5-letter word.

            b) O R N _ A  → ORNDA, ORNFA… not common.
               “ORANG” – but G not yet tested, but “ORANG” ends in G, not A.

            The only common valid 5-letter word fitting pattern a) is NORMA.

7. Verify NORMA:
   - Pattern: N R O M A
   - Contains: R (pos 2) ✓
               N (pos 1) ✓ (allowed because N was only excluded from pos 4)
               A (pos 5) ✓ (allowed because A excluded from 1,3)
               O (pos 3) ✓ (allowed because O excluded from 4)
   - Does NOT contain C, E, S.
   - All letters unique except none reused so far.

So NORMA is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on ORANG:  
O(✓) – O is correct in position 1  
R(✓) – R is correct in position 2  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3  
N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4  
G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 5  

So we now know the pattern:
O R _ _ _   (positions 1 and 2 locked)
Letters still to place: A, N, G in the remaining three positions 3,4,5, with these restrictions:
- A must not be in position 3  
- N must not be in position 4  
- G must not be in position 5  

Also, the set of letters that are NOT in the word at all is {C, E, S, M}. Any other consonant is possible.

Let’s list all 5-letter words fitting O R _ _ _ and containing exactly the letters A, N, G plus any others not forbidden.

Candidate permutations:
1. O R A N G → A is in position 3 (forbidden) – reject
2. O R A G N → A in position 3 – reject
3. O R N A G → N in position 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), G in 5 (forbidden) – reject
4. O R N G A → N in 3 (allowed), G in 4 (allowed), A in 5 (allowed) – no restriction violated  
   Check ORNGA – not a valid English word.
5. O R G A N → G in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed)  
   Check ORGAN – valid English word.

Verify ORGAN:
- Matches pattern O R _ _ _  ✔
- Contains A, N, G exactly once ✔
- A is in position 4 (allowed) ✔
- N is in position 5 (allowed – not in 4) ✔
- G is in position 3 (allowed – not in 5) ✔
- No forbidden letters C, E, S, M ✔

Thus, ORGAN is the only valid common 5-letter word that satisfies every constraint.
