Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback to consider, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and frequent consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 distinct letters including 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which of these letters are in the secret word.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess due to its letter diversity and frequency.

All five letters from “AROSE” were rejected (A, R, O, S, E), so none of those appears anywhere in the secret word.  
That leaves us with the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess we want to:
1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
2. Still pick a valid English word.  
3. Use a fresh set of common letters to obtain maximal information.

Scanning a mental list of 5-letter words, the first that meets those rules is:
- BULKY (B U L K Y) – all letters allowed; contains U and L; avoids every excluded letter.

Other possibilities (e.g., CLUMP, FLUKY) also fit, but BULKY is just as good and uses three fresh consonants (B, K, Y) to maximize new information.

So the next guess is BULKY.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, K

Letters that are definitely IN the word:
B (1st position), U (2nd position), L (3rd position), Y (5th position)

So the pattern so far is: B U L _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with B U L
- ends with Y
- only uses letters that are still allowed (i.e., excludes A R O S E N T I K)
- has a 4th letter that is not any of the excluded letters

The only letters still allowed (excluding the above) are:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U, L, Y (which are already placed)

But we already have U, L, Y in the correct positions, and B is already confirmed in the first position.

So the 4th letter must be one of: C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for 5-letter words that fit B U L _ Y, the only common English word that comes to mind is:
BULGY (where G is the 4th letter)

""Bulgy"" is a valid English word meaning swollen or protruding. None of its letters are in the excluded list.

Other possibilities like BULFY, BULHY, etc., are not valid English words. So BULGY seems to be the only valid candidate.

Therefore, the next guess is BULGY.

Letters that are definitely IN the word:
B (1st position), U (2nd position), L (3rd position), Y (5th position)

So the pattern so far is: B U L _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with B U L
- ends with Y
- only uses letters that are still allowed (i.e., excludes A R O S E N T I K)
- has a 4th letter that is not any of the excluded letters

The only letters still allowed (excluding the above) are:
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U, L, Y (which are already placed)

But we already have U, L, Y in the correct positions, and B is already confirmed in the first position.

So the 4th letter must be one of: C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for 5-letter words that fit B U L _ Y, the only common English word that comes to mind is:
BULGY (where G is the 4th letter)

""Bulgy"" is a valid English word meaning swollen or protruding. None of its letters are in the excluded list.

Other possibilities like BULFY, BULHY, etc., are not valid English words. So BULGY seems to be the only valid candidate.

Therefore, the next guess is BULGY.",Guess 4: BULGY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and there's no feedback to consider, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters in English to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels like A and E, and frequent consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 distinct letters including 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which of these letters are in the secret word.

Other good options might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess due to its letter diversity and frequency.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters from “AROSE” were rejected (A, R, O, S, E), so none of those appears anywhere in the secret word.  
That leaves us with the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

For the second guess we want to:
1. Avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
2. Still pick a valid English word.  
3. Use a fresh set of common letters to obtain maximal information.

Common remaining consonants: T, L, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K  
Common remaining vowels: I, U  

A balanced starting word that uses several of these is “UNTIL”.  
It contains U, N, T, I, L – none of which appeared in the first guess.  
It’s also a valid English word.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I  
Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: U, L

We have only two confirmed letters so far: U and L.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains U and L somewhere (positions unknown)  
- does NOT contain any of the eight excluded letters (A R O S E N T I)  
- uses only the still-available letters: B C D F G H J K M P Q V W X Y Z, plus U and L.

Scanning a mental list of 5-letter words, the first that meets those rules is:
- BULKY (B U L K Y) – all letters allowed; contains U and L; avoids every excluded letter.

Other possibilities (e.g., CLUMP, FLUKY) also fit, but BULKY is just as good and uses three fresh consonants (B, K, Y) to maximize new information.

So the next guess is BULKY.
