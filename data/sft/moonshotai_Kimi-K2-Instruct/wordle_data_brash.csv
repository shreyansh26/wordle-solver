1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify vowels and consonants. The word should contain a mix of vowels and consonants, ideally including some of the most frequent letters in English. 

A widely recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S

This gives me good coverage of frequently used letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is in the word and in the correct (2nd) position (✓).
- O and E are not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So:
1. R is fixed at position 2: _ R _ _ _
2. A and S must appear somewhere else in the word (not positions 1 and 4 respectively).
3. O and E are not in the word.

Letters left to consider: A, S, plus other consonants/vowels (but no O, E).
Common consonants not yet used: T, L, N, D, etc.
Let’s try a word that keeps R in place, repositions A and S, and introduces new common letters like T and I.

A good candidate: TRIAS (but this isn’t a valid 5-letter word).
Another option: TRASH – keeps R at position 2, moves S to position 5, A to position 4, and adds T and H. This seems valid.

From the first two guesses we now know the following pattern:

- R is locked into the second position (✓) and is therefore **R**  
- A is in the word but must be in position 3 (because TRASH gave A ✓ at position 3).  
- S is in the word but must be in position 4 (because TRASH gave S ✓ at position 4).  
- H is in the word and must be in position 5 (because TRASH gave H ✓ at position 5).  
- T, O, E are not in the word (x).  

So the revealed pattern is:  
_ R A S H  

We need a five-letter word that ends in RASH and starts with a letter we haven’t ruled out.

Letters already used/excluded: T, O, A (positioned), R (positioned), S (positioned), H (positioned), E.  
Remaining common starting letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A common dictionary word that fits is **BRASH** (B-R-A-S-H).  
Let’s check:
- B hasn’t been used or excluded.  
- Pattern: B (✓) R (✓) A (✓) S (✓) H (✓) – all confirmed letters fit exactly.
