For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The best starting words often contain multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are present in the target word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C. A good first word should cover some of these.

Some strong candidates are:
- ""ADIEU"" (many vowels)
- ""AROSE"" (good mix of vowels and consonants)
- ""LATER"" (common letters)
- ""ARISE"" (covers several common letters)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word  
   - A (confirmed by ARISE, BLOAT, ONATY)  
   - O (confirmed by BLOAT, ONATY)  
   - T (confirmed by BLOAT, ONATY)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word  
   R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y

3. Letter positions that have been ruled out  
   - A: not 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th → A must be 2nd.  
   - O: not 3rd, 4th, 5th, 1st → O must be 2nd.  
   - T: not 5th, 1st, 2nd, 4th → T must be 3rd.

But A and O both need the 2nd position, which is impossible. That contradiction tells us that at least one of O or T must occur twice (or our positional deductions are missing an option).

Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully:

- BLOAT: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- ONATY: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 1.  

So O is confirmed, and its possible positions are 2, 4, 5.

- BLOAT: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- ONATY: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

So A is confirmed, and its possible positions are 2, 5 (it was already ruled out of 1st, 4th).

- BLOAT: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- ONATY: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  

So T is confirmed, and its possible positions are 1, 2, 3.

Thus:
- A: 2 or 5  
- O: 2, 4, 5  
- T: 1, 2, 3  

Now we need two more consonants that have not been eliminated: remaining consonants include C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, W.

Let’s look for a word that can fit A and O and T together while satisfying these constraints.

Case 1: A is 2nd  
Then O can be 4th or 5th, T can be 1st or 3rd.

Pattern 1a: T A _ O _  
We need a consonant for the 3rd and 5th positions.  
Let’s pick G and M → TAGOM (but not a valid word).  
Try C and H → TACOH (invalid).  
Try M and P → TAMOP (invalid).

Pattern 1b: _ A T O _  
Possible consonants for 1st and 5th:  
C A T O H (invalid).  
D A T O M (invalid).  
G A T O P (invalid).  
H A T O D (invalid).  
P A T O H (invalid).

Case 2: A is 5th  
Then O can be 2nd or 4th, T can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Pattern 2a: T _ O _ A  
We need consonants for 2nd and 4th positions.  
Try C and D → T C O D A (valid word: TCODA? No).  
Try M and P → T M O P A (invalid).  
Try D and M → T D O M A (invalid).  

Pattern 2b: _ T O _ A

Pattern 2d: T O _ _ A

P O T C A (invalid).  
C O T H A (invalid).  
G O T C A (invalid).  
F O T C A (invalid).  
W O T C A (invalid).  

Wait, how about C O T T A? Uses T twice. Feedback doesn’t forbid doubles, so this is possible.  
Check: C, O, T, T, A – contains O, A, T and uses two Ts, which is allowed.

Let’s verify positions:  
C (1) – unknown, could be valid.  
O (2) – allowed (position 2 is allowed for O).  
T (3) – allowed (position 3 is allowed for T).  
T (4) – allowed (no info yet on 4th position).  
A (5) – allowed (position 5 is allowed for A).

And all letters are from the allowed set and haven’t been ruled out yet.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,tonga,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The best starting words often contain multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are present in the target word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C. A good first word should cover some of these.

Some strong candidates are:
- ""ADIEU"" (many vowels)
- ""AROSE"" (good mix of vowels and consonants)
- ""LATER"" (common letters)
- ""ARISE"" (covers several common letters)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from ARISE is:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x): R, I, S, and E are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, but A is not in the 1st position.
- The letters R, I, S, and E are absent.

Since A is the only confirmed letter, I now want a word that:
1. Places A in a different position (not first).
2. Uses entirely new consonants, avoiding R, I, S, E.
3. Introduces new vowels (since only A was confirmed and the others were rejected).

Good remaining vowels to test: O, U, Y.
Good consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W.

I’ll choose a word with A in the second position and new letters to gather more information. “BLOAT” is a strong candidate:
- B, L, O, T are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2, satisfying the feedback.

<guess>BLOAT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOAT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) O(-) A(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

- ARISE → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
  – Only A is confirmed present (but not in position 1).

- BLOAT → B(x), L(x), O(-), A(-), T(-)  
  – B and L are absent.  
  – O, A, and T are each present but in the wrong positions.

So we now know the target word:
1. Contains the letters A, O, T (each once).
2. Does NOT contain B, L, R, I, S, E.
3. Has positions locked for these three letters:
   – A is NOT in 1st or 4th positions.  
   – O is NOT in 3rd position.  
   – T is NOT in 5th position.

We still need two more consonants.  From remaining common English letters that haven’t been ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, U, Y, W, etc.

Let’s build a word using A, O, T plus two new consonants, ensuring:
- A is in 2nd, 3rd, or 5th positions.  
- O is in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th positions.  
- T is in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions.

A convenient pattern is “O _ A T _”.  Filling the 2nd and 5th slots with fresh consonants that haven’t been tried: e.g. N and Y → “ONATY”.  Checking: letters are O, N, A, T, Y – all allowed so far.

   - T: not 5th, 1st, 2nd, 4th → T must be 3rd.

But A and O both need the 2nd position, which is impossible. That contradiction tells us that at least one of O or T must occur twice (or our positional deductions are missing an option).

Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully:

- BLOAT: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- ONATY: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 1.

- ONATY: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Step 1 – Extract what is now certain  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- A is in position 5 (✓).  
- C is not in the word (x).  
- The letters R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y, C are already ruled out.  
- The letters T and D (and a few others) have not been ruled out, but we know:
  – T exists in the word (from BLOAT and ONATY feedback) but is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (those two positions in COTTA received “-”, meaning T is present but wrong spot).

Step 2 – Reconstruct the confirmed skeleton  
We now have:  
_  O  _  _  A

Step 3 – Determine where T can be  
T must appear at least once somewhere in the word, and the only positions we haven’t disallowed for T are 1 and 5.  
But position 5 is already occupied by A, so T must be in position 1.

Step 4 – Fill the remaining two unknown positions (3 and 4)  
We need two consonants that have not been eliminated.  
Allowed consonants left: D, F, G, H, M, P, U (as vowel), W, etc. (but not R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y, C).

A quick scan of common patterns starting “TO _ _ A” gives, for example:

- T O D G A  (not a valid English word)  
- T O W N A  (invalid)  
- T O P A Z  (invalid, and Z hasn’t been tested yet)  
- T O P H A  (invalid)  
- T O M A H  (invalid)  
- T O D A Y  (invalid length)  
- T O P A W  (invalid)  
- T O D G A  (invalid)

Another pattern is to insert a double consonant or a common digraph.  
Finally, “TOMYA” uses M and Y; but Y is already ruled out.  

Going through mentally, the only 5-letter English word that fits “TO _ _ A” using only the allowed letters is:

T O M A N  (invalid)  
T O P A Z  (invalid)  
T O M A T  (invalid)  

The actual valid English word that matches is:

T O P A Z  (but Z is not ruled out yet; let’s keep it).  

However, let’s double-check the simplest:  
T O M A N  – again invalid.

After careful consideration, the only remaining valid word that satisfies the constraints is:

T O P A Z – but Z is not disallowed yet.

But we have used A at 5, O at 2, T at 1. We need 3 and 4.  

Let me list remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

The actual valid word that fits is:

T O M A T  – invalid.

Another look gives: T O P A Z (valid word TOPAZ).

Let’s check:  
- T in 1 – allowed.  
- O in 2 – confirmed.  
- P and Z are new letters that have not been ruled out.  
- A in 5 – confirmed.  

So TOPAZ is a correct candidate.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For a first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The best starting words often contain multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are present in the target word.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, N, S, C. A good first word should cover some of these.

Some strong candidates are:
- ""ADIEU"" (many vowels)
- ""AROSE"" (good mix of vowels and consonants)
- ""LATER"" (common letters)
- ""ARISE"" (covers several common letters)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter)

This should give good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>ARISE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>The feedback from ARISE is:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x): R, I, S, and E are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, but A is not in the 1st position.
- The letters R, I, S, and E are absent.

Since A is the only confirmed letter, I now want a word that:
1. Places A in a different position (not first).
2. Uses entirely new consonants, avoiding R, I, S, E.
3. Introduces new vowels (since only A was confirmed and the others were rejected).

Good remaining vowels to test: O, U, Y.
Good consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W.

I’ll choose a word with A in the second position and new letters to gather more information. “BLOAT” is a strong candidate:
- B, L, O, T are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2, satisfying the feedback.

<guess>BLOAT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOAT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) O(-) A(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two guesses we have:

- ARISE → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)  
  – Only A is confirmed present (but not in position 1).

- BLOAT → B(x), L(x), O(-), A(-), T(-)  
  – B and L are absent.  
  – O, A, and T are each present but in the wrong positions.

So we now know the target word:
1. Contains the letters A, O, T (each once).
2. Does NOT contain B, L, R, I, S, E.
3. Has positions locked for these three letters:
   – A is NOT in 1st or 4th positions.  
   – O is NOT in 3rd position.  
   – T is NOT in 5th position.

We still need two more consonants.  From remaining common English letters that haven’t been ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, U, Y, W, etc.

Let’s build a word using A, O, T plus two new consonants, ensuring:
- A is in 2nd, 3rd, or 5th positions.  
- O is in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th positions.  
- T is in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions.

A convenient pattern is “O _ A T _”.  Filling the 2nd and 5th slots with fresh consonants that haven’t been tried: e.g. N and Y → “ONATY”.  Checking: letters are O, N, A, T, Y – all allowed so far.

Let’s try ONATY.

<guess>ONATY</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLOAT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) O(-) A(-) T(-)
Guess 3: ONATY -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) A(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word  
   - A (confirmed by ARISE, BLOAT, ONATY)  
   - O (confirmed by BLOAT, ONATY)  
   - T (confirmed by BLOAT, ONATY)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word  
   R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y

3. Letter positions that have been ruled out  
   - A: not 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th → A must be 2nd.  
   - O: not 3rd, 4th, 5th, 1st → O must be 2nd.  
   - T: not 5th, 1st, 2nd, 4th → T must be 3rd.

But A and O both need the 2nd position, which is impossible. That contradiction tells us that at least one of O or T must occur twice (or our positional deductions are missing an option).

Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully:

- BLOAT: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- ONATY: O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 1.  

So O is confirmed, and its possible positions are 2, 4, 5.

- BLOAT: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- ONATY: A(-) means A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  

So A is confirmed, and its possible positions are 2, 5 (it was already ruled out of 1st, 4th).

- BLOAT: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- ONATY: T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  

So T is confirmed, and its possible positions are 1, 2, 3.

Thus:
- A: 2 or 5  
- O: 2, 4, 5  
- T: 1, 2, 3  

Now we need two more consonants that have not been eliminated: remaining consonants include C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, W.

Let’s look for a word that can fit A and O and T together while satisfying these constraints.

Case 1: A is 2nd  
Then O can be 4th or 5th, T can be 1st or 3rd.

Pattern 1a: T A _ O _  
We need a consonant for the 3rd and 5th positions.  
Let’s pick G and M → TAGOM (but not a valid word).  
Try C and H → TACOH (invalid).  
Try M and P → TAMOP (invalid).

Pattern 1b: _ A T O _  
Possible consonants for 1st and 5th:  
C A T O H (invalid).  
D A T O M (invalid).  
G A T O P (invalid).  
H A T O D (invalid).  
P A T O H (invalid).

Case 2: A is 5th  
Then O can be 2nd or 4th, T can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Pattern 2a: T _ O _ A  
We need consonants for 2nd and 4th positions.  
Try C and D → T C O D A (valid word: TCODA? No).  
Try M and P → T M O P A (invalid).  
Try D and M → T D O M A (invalid).  

Pattern 2b: _ T O _ A  
Try C T O D A (invalid).  
D T O M A (invalid).  

Pattern 2c: _ _ T O A  
Try C H T O A (invalid).  
D M T O A (invalid).  

Pattern 2d: T O _ _ A  
Try T O D G A (invalid).  
T O C H A (valid word: TOCHA? No).  
T O C K A (invalid).  

Pattern 2e: _ O T _ A  
Try C O T D A (invalid).  
D O T M A (invalid).  
M O T C A (invalid).  
H O T C A (invalid).  
P O T C A (invalid).  
C O T H A (invalid).  
G O T C A (invalid).  
F O T C A (invalid).  
W O T C A (invalid).  

Wait, how about C O T T A? Uses T twice. Feedback doesn’t forbid doubles, so this is possible.  
Check: C, O, T, T, A – contains O, A, T and uses two Ts, which is allowed.

Let’s verify positions:  
C (1) – unknown, could be valid.  
O (2) – allowed (position 2 is allowed for O).  
T (3) – allowed (position 3 is allowed for T).  
T (4) – allowed (no info yet on 4th position).  
A (5) – allowed (position 5 is allowed for A).

And all letters are from the allowed set and haven’t been ruled out yet.

So our next guess is COTTA.

Step 3 – Determine where T can be

Step 4 – Fill the remaining two unknown positions (3 and 4)  
We need two consonants that have not been eliminated.  
Allowed consonants left: D, F, G, H, M, P, U (as vowel), W, etc. (but not R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y, C).

A quick scan of common patterns starting “TO _ _ A” gives, for example:

- T O D G A  (not a valid English word)  
- T O W N A  (invalid)  
- T O P A Z  (invalid, and Z hasn’t been tested yet)

Another pattern is to insert a double consonant or a common digraph.  
Finally, “TOMYA” uses M and Y; but Y is already ruled out.  

Going through mentally, the only 5-letter English word that fits “TO _ _ A” using only the allowed letters is:

T O M A N  (invalid)  
T O P A Z  (invalid)  
T O M A T  (invalid)  

The actual valid English word that matches is:

T O P A Z  (but Z is not ruled out yet; let’s keep it).  

However, let’s double-check the simplest:  
T O M A N  – again invalid.

After careful consideration, the only remaining valid word that satisfies the constraints is:

T O P A Z – but Z is not disallowed yet.

But we have used A at 5, O at 2, T at 1. We need 3 and 4.  

Let me list remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

The actual valid word that fits is:

T O M A T  – invalid.

Another look gives: T O P A Z (valid word TOPAZ).

Let’s check:  
- T in 1 – allowed.  
- O in 2 – confirmed.  
- P and Z are new letters that have not been ruled out.  
- A in 5 – confirmed.  

So TOPAZ is a correct candidate.

Current confirmed facts:

1. Letters in the word and their exact positions  
   - T is now known to be in position 1 (✓ from TOPAZ).  
   - O is known to be in position 2 (✓ from COTTA).  
   - A is known to be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from earlier feedback).  
     The only remaining slot for A is position 2, but position 2 is already occupied by O!  
     Therefore A must appear **twice** in the word, with its second instance in the **second position** (since the first instance cannot be in 1,3,4,5).  
     But position 2 is already O. This contradiction implies A must appear **exactly once** and that single A must be in position 2.  
     Reconciling: the feedback in TOPAZ gives A(-), which reiterates A is present but **not in position 4**, consistent with earlier exclusions.  
     However, the only position left for **one** A is position 2, which is already **O**.  
     The only resolution is that **A must be the second letter**, and O must appear elsewhere.  
     Therefore our earlier conclusion that O is at position 2 must be incorrect.  
     Re-examine COTTA feedback: O(✓) only confirms **O is in the word and in the correct spot**, which is **position 2**.  
     Re-examine TOPAZ feedback: O(✓) confirms **O is in the word and in the correct spot**, which must be **position 2** again.  
     Hence, the skeleton is now:  
       T O _ _ _  
     and we still need to place **A** somewhere.  
     The earlier exclusions for A are:  
       - not 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th → impossible!  
       This implies our assumption about **single** A is wrong.  
     Instead, **A must appear exactly once**, and the exclusions must be incomplete.  
     Let's re-list all exclusions for A:  
       - ARISE: A(-) → A not in position 1  
       - BLOAT: A(-) → A not in position 4  
       - ONATY: A(-) → A not in position 3  
       - COTTA: A(✓) → A is in position 5  
       - TOPAZ: A(-) → A is not in position 4 (repeats BLOAT exclusion)  
     Therefore, **A is in position 5** (from COTTA).  

2. Updated skeleton: T O _ _ A  

3. Letters confirmed in word: T, O, A  
   Letters confirmed **not** in word: R, I, S, E, B, L, N, Y, C, P, Z  

4. Remaining consonants to choose from (for positions 3 and 4):  
   D, F, G, H, M, U, W, etc.

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form **TO _ _ A**.  
   Checking common words:  
     - TODAY  
     - TOGGA (invalid)  
     - TOMIA (invalid)  
     - TOGMA (invalid)  
   The only common word is **TODAY**.

6. Check TODAY against constraints:  
   - T (1), O (2), D (3), A (4), Y (5).  
   - A in position 4 contradicts COTTA feedback A(✓) in position 5.  
   Therefore **TODAY** is invalid.  

7. Re-examine the skeleton and constraints:  
   - T(1), O(2), A(5) are fixed.  
   - We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 that are **not** ruled out.  
   - Valid English word fitting **TO _ _ A** with T, O, A fixed in those spots:  
     - TOGMA (invalid), TOGGA (invalid), TOMIA (invalid), TOUGH (invalid, ends in H not A).  
     Actually, the only valid English word is **TOGMA** (invalid).  

8. Realization: The only valid word left is **TOMAN** (historical currency unit), but ends in N (excluded).  
   After exhaustive check, the only remaining possibility is **TODAY**, despite A position conflict, indicating a reconsideration.  

9. Re-evaluate: COTTA feedback A(✓) **only** confirms A is in position 5, while TOPAZ feedback A(-) confirms A is **not** in position 4 (consistent).  
   Thus, the word must be **T O _ _ A**.  

10. The only valid English word fitting is **TOMIA** (invalid).  
    Finally, the correct valid word is **TODAY**, but contradicts A position.  

11. Correct approach: must use **two** T's or reconsider.  
    Reviewing: COTTA feedback T(-) in positions 3 and 4 means T is present but not in those spots.  
    TOPAZ feedback T(✓) in position 1 confirms T is in position 1.  
    Therefore, the word must contain **only one T**, in position 1.  

12. Final valid word: **TODAY** is the only possible word, despite seeming conflict.  
    Recheck: if word is TODAY:  
      - T(1) ✓  
      - O(2) ✓  
      - D, A, Y – Y is excluded (from ONATY), so invalid.

14. Realization: must be **TOXMA** (invalid).
