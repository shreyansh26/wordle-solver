moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,1,PULSE,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T are good choices. A popular opening word is ""SLATE"" because it includes several common consonants and vowels, but another strong option is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons. 

Since we have no prior information, ""RAISE"" is a solid first guess as it includes R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback:
- R is NOT in the word.  
- A is NOT in the word.  
- I is NOT in the word.  
- S is in the word and is in the correct position (position 4).  
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (position 5).  

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""SE"" and contains neither R, A, nor I. We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ S E.  
We should next explore common consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet, such as T, N, L, C, H, O, U, etc.  

A strong next guess is “HOUSE” because:
- It keeps the known SE in positions 4-5.  
- It introduces new letters H, O, U, giving us three fresh letters to test.  

Another candidate is “LOUSE” (tests L, O, U), but “HOUSE” feels slightly more common.  
So I’ll pick HOUSE.

Current known facts:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S E
- Letters NOT in the word: R A I H O
- Letters in the word but wrong position: U (it is present, but not in position 3)
- Letters confirmed in positions 4-5: S E

Since U is in the word but not in position 3, it must occupy either position 1 or 2.
We also need two new consonants or vowels (avoiding R,A,I,H,O) to fill the remaining slots.

Letters we haven’t used yet that are common: D, N, L, T, M, C, B, F, G, P, Y, etc.

Let’s try:
U _ _ S E or _ U _ S E

Possible candidates:
- DULSE (invalid: L is ok, but D and L are fine, but let’s check other options)
- MULSE – not a common word
- PULSE – uses P, U, L, S, E → P and L are new letters and U moves to position 2. This fits our constraints: pattern _ U _ S E and uses new letters P and L.

Checking: PULSE fits the pattern _ULSE, with U in position 2, which is allowed because we only know U is not in position 3.
