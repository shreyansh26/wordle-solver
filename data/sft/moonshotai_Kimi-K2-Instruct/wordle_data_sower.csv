For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, a strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage across vowels and consonants.

Feedback summary:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So the secret word must contain R, O, S, E but NOT A.  
Also, none of these letters (R, O, S, E) are in the positions we just tried.

Positions from “arose”:
1 2 3 4 5
a r o s e

Therefore:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4
- E is NOT in position 5

I want a new guess that keeps R, O, S, E and avoids position 2 for R, position 3 for O, position 4 for S, and position 5 for E, while also excluding A.

A good rearrangement is “ROSES” but that repeats S.  
Next try: “SORE” + one more letter; but we need five letters.

A valid word that fits is “ROSES” but with an extra letter.  
Let’s try “ROSES” anyway; it reuses S but the rules allow it.

Wait, a better unique-letter choice is “ROUSE” – it reuses E in position 5 (forbidden), so no.

Another candidate: “STORE” – uses T (new), S, T, O, R, E.

Check positions:
S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)

But:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback)

So “STORE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “RESIN” – uses I (new letter), but contains I (allowed).

Positions:
R(1), E(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)

Check constraints:
- R is allowed anywhere except position 2 (ok, position 1)
- O must appear somewhere; O is missing in “RESIN” – invalid.

We must keep O.

Let’s systematically list permutations of R,O,S,E plus one new letter not A.

We need a fifth letter: common choices are T, N, L, C, etc.

Candidate: “ROTES” – letters R,O,T,E,S.

Check positions:
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
- S cannot be in 4 (ok, it’s in 5)
- E cannot be in 5 (ok, it’s in 4)
- R cannot be in 2 (ok, it’s in 1)

This satisfies all feedback constraints and introduces T as a new letter.

Therefore, “ROTES” is a valid second guess.

Letters that must be in the word somewhere but not yet placed:
- R (from both guesses).
- S (from both guesses).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A (from guess 1).

Let’s list the two possibilities:

   So R _ O S E must be something like R I O S E – but RIOSE is not a valid English word.

2. S _ O R E → S _ O R E.  
   We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ O R E.  
   The second letter must be a consonant or vowel not A or T, and make a valid word.

The only common English word that fits S _ O R E is:

S N O R E

Let’s check constraints:

- S N O R E  
  - Position 1: S – allowed (S is in word, position unknown).  
  - Position 2: N – new letter, no constraints.  
  - Position 3: O – matches ✓ (correct).  
  - Position 4: R – allowed (R is in word, not yet placed).

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So the secret word must contain R, O, S, E but NOT A.  
Also, none of these letters (R, O, S, E) are in the positions we just tried.

Positions from “arose”:
1 2 3 4 5
a r o s e

Therefore:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4
- E is NOT in position 5

I want a new guess that keeps R, O, S, E and avoids position 2 for R, position 3 for O, position 4 for S, and position 5 for E, while also excluding A.

A good rearrangement is “ROSES” but that repeats S.  
Next try: “SORE” + one more letter; but we need five letters.

A valid word that fits is “ROSES” but with an extra letter.  
Let’s try “ROSES” anyway; it reuses S but the rules allow it.

Wait, a better unique-letter choice is “ROUSE” – it reuses E in position 5 (forbidden), so no.

Another candidate: “STORE” – uses T (new), S, T, O, R, E.

Check positions:
S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)

But:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback)

So “STORE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “RESIN” – uses I (new letter), but contains I (allowed).

Positions:
R(1), E(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)

Check constraints:
- R is allowed anywhere except position 2 (ok, position 1)
- O must appear somewhere; O is missing in “RESIN” – invalid.

We must keep O.

Let’s systematically list permutations of R,O,S,E plus one new letter not A.

We need a fifth letter: common choices are T, N, L, C, etc.

Candidate: “ROTES” – letters R,O,T,E,S.

Check positions:
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
- S cannot be in 4 (ok, it’s in 5)
- E cannot be in 5 (ok, it’s in 4)
- R cannot be in 2 (ok, it’s in 1)

This satisfies all feedback constraints and introduces T as a new letter.

Therefore, “ROTES” is a valid second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
Guess 2: rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

What we now know:

Letters in the word and their known positions:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

Letters that must be in the word somewhere but not yet placed:
- R (from both guesses).
- S (from both guesses).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A (from guess 1).
- T (from guess 2).

So, the word has the pattern:

[?] [?] O [?] E

with the letters R and S still to be placed in the two remaining open slots (1 and 4), and no other constraints yet on what the second letter (position 2) might be (except it can’t be A or T).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits:

_ _ O _ E

with R and S somewhere in positions 1 and 4 (order unknown).

Let’s list the two possibilities:

1. R _ O S E → R O S E (but we need 5 letters; R O S E is 4 letters).  
   So R _ O S E must be something like R I O S E – but RIOSE is not a valid English word.

2. S _ O R E → S _ O R E.  
   We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ O R E.  
   The second letter must be a consonant or vowel not A or T, and make a valid word.

The only common English word that fits S _ O R E is:

S N O R E

Let’s check constraints:

- S N O R E  
  - Position 1: S – allowed (S is in word, position unknown).  
  - Position 2: N – new letter, no constraints.  
  - Position 3: O – matches ✓ (correct).  
  - Position 4: R – allowed (R is in word, not yet placed).  
  - Position 5: E – matches ✓ (correct).  

All letters used are allowed (no A or T), and we’ve placed R and S in the two open positions.

Therefore, a valid next guess is SNORE.

Let us summarize every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word and their correct positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from guess 3).

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R, O, E (each appears at least once).

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A (from guess 1)
- T (from guess 2)
- N (from guess 3)

Therefore the hidden word must:

- start with S
- contain the letters R, O, E exactly once each
- have no A, T, N
- have no other constraints on the remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 except that O, R, E must all appear somewhere.

From guess 2 we also know:
- O is NOT in position 3 (because in rotes, O was marked ✓ in position 2 and that is now fixed, so the O in rotes is irrelevant; actually rotes had O in position 2 and it was marked ✓, which meant O is in position 2.  Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.)

Clarifying the feedback from rotes:  
rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

- O(✓) means O is in the word **and in position 2**.  
- E(✓) means E is in the word **and in position 4**.  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1.  

So now the fixed positions are:

1: S (✓ from snore)  
2: O (✓ from rotes)  
3: ?  
4: E (✓ from rotes)  
5: ?  

And we still need to place R somewhere. The only remaining open positions are 3 and 5, but R cannot be in position 1 (already fixed as S) and there’s no restriction on position 3 or 5 for R except that it must appear once.

So the hidden word is S O _ E _ and the blank must be R.

But we need a 5-letter word that is S O _ E R. The only common English word that fits is:

S O V E R  — but SOVER is not a valid English word.  
S O R E R  — SORER is valid.  

Let me check:

SORER:
- S O R E R has two R’s. Our constraints say we must have exactly one R (from earlier feedback). Thus invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine carefully: we have letters S, O, R, E each appearing exactly once. Therefore we need a 5-letter word with:

S _ _ _ _
O _ _ _ _
R _ _ _ _
E _ _ _ _

and the fifth letter must be a new letter that is not A, T, N, and that appears exactly once.

But we already have S in position 1, O in position 2, E in position 4, so positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and one new allowed letter such that the word is valid.

Our pattern is now:  
S O _ E _

and the missing letters are R and one other letter. But we have only four letters in the word so far: S, O, R, E. The word must be 5 letters, so there must be one more distinct letter. However, the feedback says the word contains exactly S, O, R, E and no others (because the other letters A, T, N are ruled out and we have no evidence of more). This seems to be a contradiction unless the word has one of these letters repeated.

Re-evaluate: our feedback says:

- The word contains S, O, R, E.  
- No A, T, N.  
- S in position 1.  
- O in position 2.  
- E in position 4.  

Therefore the word is S O _ E _, and the blank positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and exactly one additional letter that is allowed (but we have no evidence any other letter is in the word). The only possibility is that one of the positions 3 or 5 is R and the other is a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, but the word must be valid.

The only valid English word that fits S O _ E _ is:

S O V E R  — invalid (SOVER not a word)  
S O L E R  — SOLER is not a common English word  
S O R E R  — invalid (duplicate R)  

This indicates we must have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me carefully re-read guess 3 feedback:

Guess 3: snore → S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

This means:

- S is in the word and in position 1 (✓).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the correct summary is:

Correct positions: S in position 1.  
Letters in word: S, O, R, E.  
Letters not in word: A, T, N.  
Constraints on positions:  
- O is NOT in position 3.  
- R is NOT in position 4.  
- E is NOT in position 5.  

We have 5 positions. Position 1 is S. The remaining letters O, R, E must be placed in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that none of them is in the forbidden positions above.

Let’s list all permutations placing O, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints:

Forbidden positions:
- O cannot be in 3  
- R cannot be in 4  
- E cannot be in 5  

We need to assign O, R, E to positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with each used exactly once and satisfying the above.

Possible assignments:

Case 1: O in position 2  
   Then R and E must be in 3, 4, 5 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5:  
   - R in 3, E in 4: allowed (R not in 4, E not in 5) → word: S O R E _ – but this is 4 letters plus blank. We need 5 letters. So we need a fifth letter. But we have no evidence of another letter. This suggests we must have a repeated letter among S, O, R, E. But feedback indicates each of S, O, R, E appears exactly once. Thus no valid word exists with these constraints unless we have missed something.

Case 2: O in position 4  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 5 avoiding R in 4 (ok), E not in 5:  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R O E _ – but then E is in position 4, which is allowed (constraint is E not in 5). So the word would be S R O E _, but we need 5 letters. The last position must be a letter, but we have no extra letters. This again indicates a missing insight.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 4 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5 (ok):  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R E O _ – but O is in 5, so word would be S R E _ O.  
   - R in 3, E in 2: word S E R _ O.  

The valid English word fitting S _ _ _ O with letters S, O, R, E and R and E in positions 2, 3, 4 is:

S E R V O  — invalid  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R R O  — invalid double R  

This seems problematic. The only valid 5-letter word containing exactly S, O, R, E each once, starting with S, and fitting the position constraints is:

S E R O  — impossible  

Upon re-examination, we realize we must have overlooked that the word must contain exactly these four letters plus possibly one more that has not been ruled out yet. But our feedback says the word contains only S, O, R, E, and the positions are S _ _ _ _. 

The correct pattern now is:

1: S  
2: ?  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?  

with O, R, E placed somewhere in positions 2-5, and no A, T, N, and with the constraints:

- O not in 3  
- R not in 4  
- E not in 5  

The only valid English word that fits these constraints is:

S O R E  — too short  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R V E  — contains V, but we have no evidence of V  

It appears the only possible word is S O R E D, but D has not been ruled in or out. However, the feedback only guarantees that the word contains S, O, R, E, and no A, T, N. The word could have one other letter that we haven’t tested.

Thus, the valid English word fitting the constraints is:

S O R E D  — but we have no info on D  
S H O R E  — H is new, and this is a valid word  

Let me check SHORE:

Letters: S, H, O, R, E – all allowed (no A, T, N).  
Positions:  
S(1) ✓  
H – new letter  
O – must be in word and not in position 3 (in SHORE, O is in position 3 – forbidden!)  
Thus invalid.

Next candidate: S O R V E  — invalid  

Next: S P O R E  — P is new, and positions: S(1), P(2), O(3) – but O cannot be in 3. Invalid.

Next: S O R R E  – duplicate R, invalid.

Next: S E R V O  – valid word? SERVO exists, and positions: S(1), E(2), R(3), V(4), O(5) – check constraints:

- O is in position 5 – allowed (constraint is O not in 3, ok)  
- R is in position 3 – allowed (constraint is R not in 4, ok)  
- E is in position 2 – allowed (constraint is E not in 5, ok)  
- Letters used: S, E, R, V, O – all allowed (no A, T, N)  

SERVO is a valid English word (device in control systems) and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERVO.

<guess>servo</guess>",servo,"Let us summarize every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word and their correct positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from guess 3).

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R, O, E (each appears at least once).

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A (from guess 1)
- T (from guess 2)
- N (from guess 3)

Therefore the hidden word must:

- start with S
- contain the letters R, O, E exactly once each
- have no A, T, N
- have no other constraints on the remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 except that O, R, E must all appear somewhere.

From guess 2 we also know:
- O is NOT in position 3 (because in rotes, O was marked ✓ in position 2 and that is now fixed, so the O in rotes is irrelevant; actually rotes had O in position 2 and it was marked ✓, which meant O is in position 2.  Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.)

Clarifying the feedback from rotes:  
rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

- O(✓) means O is in the word **and in position 2**.  
- E(✓) means E is in the word **and in position 4**.  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1.  

So now the fixed positions are:

1: S (✓ from snore)  
2: O (✓ from rotes)  
3: ?  
4: E (✓ from rotes)  
5: ?  

And we still need to place R somewhere. The only remaining open positions are 3 and 5, but R cannot be in position 1 (already fixed as S) and there’s no restriction on position 3 or 5 for R except that it must appear once.

So the hidden word is S O _ E _ and the blank must be R.

But we need a 5-letter word that is S O _ E R. The only common English word that fits is:

S O V E R  — but SOVER is not a valid English word.  
S O R E R  — SORER is valid.

The only possibility is that one of the positions 3 or 5 is R and the other is a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, but the word must be valid.

The only valid English word that fits S O _ E _ is:

S O V E R  — invalid (SOVER not a word)  
S O L E R  — SOLER is not a common English word  
S O R E R  — invalid (duplicate R)  

This indicates we must have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me carefully re-read guess 3 feedback:

Guess 3: snore → S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

This means:

- S is in the word and in position 1 (✓).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the correct summary is:

Correct positions: S in position 1.  
Letters in word: S, O, R, E.  
Letters not in word: A, T, N.  
Constraints on positions:  
- O is NOT in position 3.  
- R is NOT in position 4.  
- E is NOT in position 5.  

We have 5 positions. Position 1 is S. The remaining letters O, R, E must be placed in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that none of them is in the forbidden positions above.

Let’s list all permutations placing O, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints:

Forbidden positions:
- O cannot be in 3  
- R cannot be in 4  
- E cannot be in 5  

We need to assign O, R, E to positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with each used exactly once and satisfying the above.

Possible assignments:

Case 1: O in position 2  
   Then R and E must be in 3, 4, 5 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5:  
   - R in 3, E in 4: allowed (R not in 4, E not in 5) → word: S O R E _ – but this is 4 letters plus blank. We need 5 letters. So we need a fifth letter. But we have no evidence of another letter. This suggests we must have a repeated letter among S, O, R, E. But feedback indicates each of S, O, R, E appears exactly once. Thus no valid word exists with these constraints unless we have missed something.

Case 2: O in position 4  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 5 avoiding R in 4 (ok), E not in 5:  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R O E _ – but then E is in position 4, which is allowed (constraint is E not in 5). So the word would be S R O E _, but we need 5 letters. The last position must be a letter, but we have no extra letters. This again indicates a missing insight.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 4 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5 (ok):  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R E O _ – but O is in 5, so word would be S R E _ O.  
   - R in 3, E in 2: word S E R _ O.  

The valid English word fitting S _ _ _ O with letters S, O, R, E and R and E in positions 2, 3, 4 is:

S E R V O  — invalid  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R R O  — invalid double R  

This seems problematic. The only valid 5-letter word containing exactly S, O, R, E each once, starting with S, and fitting the position constraints is:

S E R O  — impossible  

Upon re-examination, we realize we must have overlooked that the word must contain exactly these four letters plus possibly one more that has not been ruled out yet. But our feedback says the word contains only S, O, R, E, and the positions are S _ _ _ _. 

The correct pattern now is:

1: S  
2: ?  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?  

with O, R, E placed somewhere in positions 2-5, and no A, T, N, and with the constraints:

- O not in 3  
- R not in 4  
- E not in 5  

The only valid English word that fits these constraints is:

S O R E  — too short  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R V E  — contains V, but we have no evidence of V  

It appears the only possible word is S O R E D, but D has not been ruled in or out. However, the feedback only guarantees that the word contains S, O, R, E, and no A, T, N. The word could have one other letter that we haven’t tested.

Thus, the valid English word fitting the constraints is:

S O R E D  — but we have no info on D  
S H O R E  — H is new, and this is a valid word  

Let me check SHORE:

Letters: S, H, O, R, E – all allowed (no A, T, N).  
Positions:  
S(1) ✓  
H – new letter  
O – must be in word and not in position 3 (in SHORE, O is in position 3 – forbidden!)  
Thus invalid.

Next candidate: S O R V E  — invalid  

Next: S P O R E  — P is new, and positions: S(1), P(2), O(3) – but O cannot be in 3. Invalid.

Next: S O R R E  – duplicate R, invalid.

Next: S E R V O  – valid word? SERVO exists, and positions: S(1), E(2), R(3), V(4), O(5) – check constraints:

- O is in position 5 – allowed (constraint is O not in 3, ok)  
- R is in position 3 – allowed (constraint is R not in 4, ok)  
- E is in position 2 – allowed (constraint is E not in 5, ok)  
- Letters used: S, E, R, V, O – all allowed (no A, T, N)  

SERVO is a valid English word (device in control systems) and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERVO.",Guess 4: servo -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(-) R(-) V(x) O(-),FAIL
moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,sower,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, a strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage across vowels and consonants.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So the secret word must contain R, O, S, E but NOT A.  
Also, none of these letters (R, O, S, E) are in the positions we just tried.

Positions from “arose”:
1 2 3 4 5
a r o s e

Therefore:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4
- E is NOT in position 5

I want a new guess that keeps R, O, S, E and avoids position 2 for R, position 3 for O, position 4 for S, and position 5 for E, while also excluding A.

A good rearrangement is “ROSES” but that repeats S.  
Next try: “SORE” + one more letter; but we need five letters.

A valid word that fits is “ROSES” but with an extra letter.  
Let’s try “ROSES” anyway; it reuses S but the rules allow it.

Wait, a better unique-letter choice is “ROUSE” – it reuses E in position 5 (forbidden), so no.

Another candidate: “STORE” – uses T (new), S, T, O, R, E.

Check positions:
S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)

But:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback)

So “STORE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “RESIN” – uses I (new letter), but contains I (allowed).

Positions:
R(1), E(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)

Check constraints:
- R is allowed anywhere except position 2 (ok, position 1)
- O must appear somewhere; O is missing in “RESIN” – invalid.

We must keep O.

Let’s systematically list permutations of R,O,S,E plus one new letter not A.

We need a fifth letter: common choices are T, N, L, C, etc.

Candidate: “ROTES” – letters R,O,T,E,S.

Check positions:
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
- S cannot be in 4 (ok, it’s in 5)
- E cannot be in 5 (ok, it’s in 4)
- R cannot be in 2 (ok, it’s in 1)

This satisfies all feedback constraints and introduces T as a new letter.

Therefore, “ROTES” is a valid second guess.

<guess>rotes</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback so far:

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
Guess 2: rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

What we now know:

Letters in the word and their known positions:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

Letters that must be in the word somewhere but not yet placed:
- R (from both guesses).
- S (from both guesses).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A (from guess 1).
- T (from guess 2).

So, the word has the pattern:

[?] [?] O [?] E

with the letters R and S still to be placed in the two remaining open slots (1 and 4), and no other constraints yet on what the second letter (position 2) might be (except it can’t be A or T).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits:

_ _ O _ E

with R and S somewhere in positions 1 and 4 (order unknown).

Let’s list the two possibilities:

1. R _ O S E → R O S E (but we need 5 letters; R O S E is 4 letters).  
   So R _ O S E must be something like R I O S E – but RIOSE is not a valid English word.

2. S _ O R E → S _ O R E.  
   We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ O R E.  
   The second letter must be a consonant or vowel not A or T, and make a valid word.

The only common English word that fits S _ O R E is:

S N O R E

Let’s check constraints:

- S N O R E  
  - Position 1: S – allowed (S is in word, position unknown).  
  - Position 2: N – new letter, no constraints.  
  - Position 3: O – matches ✓ (correct).  
  - Position 4: R – allowed (R is in word, not yet placed).  
  - Position 5: E – matches ✓ (correct).  

All letters used are allowed (no A or T), and we’ve placed R and S in the two open positions.

Therefore, a valid next guess is SNORE.

<guess>snore</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: snore -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let us summarize every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word and their correct positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from guess 3).

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R, O, E (each appears at least once).

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A (from guess 1)
- T (from guess 2)
- N (from guess 3)

Therefore the hidden word must:

- start with S
- contain the letters R, O, E exactly once each
- have no A, T, N
- have no other constraints on the remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 except that O, R, E must all appear somewhere.

From guess 2 we also know:
- O is NOT in position 3 (because in rotes, O was marked ✓ in position 2 and that is now fixed, so the O in rotes is irrelevant; actually rotes had O in position 2 and it was marked ✓, which meant O is in position 2.  Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.)

Clarifying the feedback from rotes:  
rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

- O(✓) means O is in the word **and in position 2**.  
- E(✓) means E is in the word **and in position 4**.  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1.  

So now the fixed positions are:

1: S (✓ from snore)  
2: O (✓ from rotes)  
3: ?  
4: E (✓ from rotes)  
5: ?  

And we still need to place R somewhere. The only remaining open positions are 3 and 5, but R cannot be in position 1 (already fixed as S) and there’s no restriction on position 3 or 5 for R except that it must appear once.

So the hidden word is S O _ E _ and the blank must be R.

But we need a 5-letter word that is S O _ E R. The only common English word that fits is:

S O V E R  — but SOVER is not a valid English word.  
S O R E R  — SORER is valid.  

Let me check:

SORER:
- S O R E R has two R’s. Our constraints say we must have exactly one R (from earlier feedback). Thus invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine carefully: we have letters S, O, R, E each appearing exactly once. Therefore we need a 5-letter word with:

S _ _ _ _
O _ _ _ _
R _ _ _ _
E _ _ _ _

and the fifth letter must be a new letter that is not A, T, N, and that appears exactly once.

But we already have S in position 1, O in position 2, E in position 4, so positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and one new allowed letter such that the word is valid.

Our pattern is now:  
S O _ E _

and the missing letters are R and one other letter. But we have only four letters in the word so far: S, O, R, E. The word must be 5 letters, so there must be one more distinct letter. However, the feedback says the word contains exactly S, O, R, E and no others (because the other letters A, T, N are ruled out and we have no evidence of more). This seems to be a contradiction unless the word has one of these letters repeated.

Re-evaluate: our feedback says:

- The word contains S, O, R, E.  
- No A, T, N.  
- S in position 1.  
- O in position 2.  
- E in position 4.  

Therefore the word is S O _ E _, and the blank positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and exactly one additional letter that is allowed (but we have no evidence any other letter is in the word). The only possibility is that one of the positions 3 or 5 is R and the other is a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, but the word must be valid.

The only valid English word that fits S O _ E _ is:

S O V E R  — invalid (SOVER not a word)  
S O L E R  — SOLER is not a common English word  
S O R E R  — invalid (duplicate R)  

This indicates we must have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me carefully re-read guess 3 feedback:

Guess 3: snore → S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

This means:

- S is in the word and in position 1 (✓).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the correct summary is:

Correct positions: S in position 1.  
Letters in word: S, O, R, E.  
Letters not in word: A, T, N.  
Constraints on positions:  
- O is NOT in position 3.  
- R is NOT in position 4.  
- E is NOT in position 5.  

We have 5 positions. Position 1 is S. The remaining letters O, R, E must be placed in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that none of them is in the forbidden positions above.

Let’s list all permutations placing O, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints:

Forbidden positions:
- O cannot be in 3  
- R cannot be in 4  
- E cannot be in 5  

We need to assign O, R, E to positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with each used exactly once and satisfying the above.

Possible assignments:

Case 1: O in position 2  
   Then R and E must be in 3, 4, 5 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5:  
   - R in 3, E in 4: allowed (R not in 4, E not in 5) → word: S O R E _ – but this is 4 letters plus blank. We need 5 letters. So we need a fifth letter. But we have no evidence of another letter. This suggests we must have a repeated letter among S, O, R, E. But feedback indicates each of S, O, R, E appears exactly once. Thus no valid word exists with these constraints unless we have missed something.

Case 2: O in position 4  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 5 avoiding R in 4 (ok), E not in 5:  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R O E _ – but then E is in position 4, which is allowed (constraint is E not in 5). So the word would be S R O E _, but we need 5 letters. The last position must be a letter, but we have no extra letters. This again indicates a missing insight.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 4 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5 (ok):  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R E O _ – but O is in 5, so word would be S R E _ O.  
   - R in 3, E in 2: word S E R _ O.  

The valid English word fitting S _ _ _ O with letters S, O, R, E and R and E in positions 2, 3, 4 is:

S E R V O  — invalid  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R R O  — invalid double R  

This seems problematic. The only valid 5-letter word containing exactly S, O, R, E each once, starting with S, and fitting the position constraints is:

S E R O  — impossible  

Upon re-examination, we realize we must have overlooked that the word must contain exactly these four letters plus possibly one more that has not been ruled out yet. But our feedback says the word contains only S, O, R, E, and the positions are S _ _ _ _. 

The correct pattern now is:

1: S  
2: ?  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?  

with O, R, E placed somewhere in positions 2-5, and no A, T, N, and with the constraints:

- O not in 3  
- R not in 4  
- E not in 5  

The only valid English word that fits these constraints is:

S O R E  — too short  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R V E  — contains V, but we have no evidence of V  

It appears the only possible word is S O R E D, but D has not been ruled in or out. However, the feedback only guarantees that the word contains S, O, R, E, and no A, T, N. The word could have one other letter that we haven’t tested.

Thus, the valid English word fitting the constraints is:

S O R E D  — but we have no info on D  
S H O R E  — H is new, and this is a valid word  

Let me check SHORE:

Letters: S, H, O, R, E – all allowed (no A, T, N).  
Positions:  
S(1) ✓  
H – new letter  
O – must be in word and not in position 3 (in SHORE, O is in position 3 – forbidden!)  
Thus invalid.

Next candidate: S O R V E  — invalid  

Next: S P O R E  — P is new, and positions: S(1), P(2), O(3) – but O cannot be in 3. Invalid.

Next: S O R R E  – duplicate R, invalid.

Next: S E R V O  – valid word? SERVO exists, and positions: S(1), E(2), R(3), V(4), O(5) – check constraints:

- O is in position 5 – allowed (constraint is O not in 3, ok)  
- R is in position 3 – allowed (constraint is R not in 4, ok)  
- E is in position 2 – allowed (constraint is E not in 5, ok)  
- Letters used: S, E, R, V, O – all allowed (no A, T, N)  

SERVO is a valid English word (device in control systems) and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERVO.

But we have only four letters in the word so far: S, O, R, E. The word must be 5 letters, so there must be one more distinct letter. However, the feedback says the word contains exactly S, O, R, E and no others (because the other letters A, T, N are ruled out and we have no evidence of more). This seems to be a contradiction unless the word has one of these letters repeated.\n\nRe-evaluate: our feedback says:\n\n- The word contains S, O, R, E.  \n- No A, T, N.  \n- S in position 1.  \n- O in position 2.  \n- E in position 4.  \n\nTherefore the word is S O _ E _, and the blank positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and exactly one additional letter that is allowed (but we have no evidence any other letter is in the word).

Position 1 is S. The remaining letters O, R, E must be placed in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that none of them is in the forbidden positions above.\n\nLet’s list all permutations placing O, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints:\n\nForbidden positions:\n- O cannot be in 3  \n- R cannot be in 4  \n- E cannot be in 5  \n\nWe need to assign O, R, E to positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with each used exactly once and satisfying the above.\n\nPossible assignments:\n\nCase 1: O in position 2  \n   Then R and E must be in 3, 4, 5 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5:  \n   - R in 3, E in 4: allowed (R not in 4, E not in 5) → word: S O R E _ – but this is 4 letters plus blank. We need 5 letters. So we need a fifth letter. But we have no evidence of another letter. This suggests we must have a repeated letter among S, O, R, E. But feedback indicates each of S, O, R, E appears exactly once. Thus no valid word exists with these constraints unless we have missed something.\n\nCase 2: O in position 4  \n   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 5 avoiding R in 4 (ok), E not in 5:  \n   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R O E _ – but then E is in position 4, which is allowed (constraint is E not in 5). So the word would be S R O E _, but we need 5 letters. The last position must be a letter, but we have no extra letters. This again indicates a missing insight.\n\nCase 3: O in position 5  \n   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 4 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5 (ok):  \n   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R E O _ – but O is in 5, so word would be S R E _ O.  \n   - R in 3, E in 2: word S E R _ O.  \n\nThe valid English word fitting S _ _ _ O with letters S, O, R, E and R and E in positions 2, 3, 4 is:\n\nS E R V O  — invalid  \nS E R O  — too short  \nS E R R O  — invalid double R  \n\nThis seems problematic. The only valid 5-letter word containing exactly S, O, R, E each once, starting with S, and fitting the position constraints is:\n\nS E R O  — impossible  \n\nUpon re-examination, we realize we must have overlooked that the word must contain exactly these four letters plus possibly one more that has not been ruled out yet. But our feedback says the word contains only S, O, R, E, and the positions are S _ _ _ _. \n\nThe correct pattern now is:\n\n1: S  \n2: ?  \n3: ?  \n4: ?  \n5: ?  \n\nwith O, R, E placed somewhere in positions 2-5, and no A, T, N, and with the constraints:\n\n- O not in 3  \n- R not in 4  \n- E not in 5  \n\nThe only valid English word that fits these constraints is:\n\nS O R E  — too short  \nS E R O  — too short  \nS E R V E  — contains V, but we have no evidence of V  \n\nIt appears the only possible word is S O R E D, but D has not been ruled in or out. However, the feedback only guarantees that the word contains S, O, R, E, and no A, T, N. The word could have one other letter that we haven’t tested.\n\nThus, the valid English word fitting the constraints is:\n\nS O R E D  — but we have no info on D  \nS H O R E  — H is new, and this is a valid word  \n\nLet me check SHORE:\n\nLetters: S, H, O, R, E – all allowed (no A, T, N).  \nPositions:  \nS(1) ✓  \nH – new letter  \nO – must be in word and not in position 3 (in SHORE, O is in position 3 – forbidden!)  \nThus invalid.\n\nNext candidate: S O R V E  — invalid  \n\nNext: S P O R E  — P is new, and positions: S(1), P(2), O(3) – but O cannot be in 3.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, a strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repeating any, giving us maximum coverage across vowels and consonants.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback summary:

A(x) – A is NOT in the word  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position  
O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position  

So the secret word must contain R, O, S, E but NOT A.  
Also, none of these letters (R, O, S, E) are in the positions we just tried.

Positions from “arose”:
1 2 3 4 5
a r o s e

Therefore:
- R is NOT in position 2
- O is NOT in position 3
- S is NOT in position 4
- E is NOT in position 5

I want a new guess that keeps R, O, S, E and avoids position 2 for R, position 3 for O, position 4 for S, and position 5 for E, while also excluding A.

A good rearrangement is “ROSES” but that repeats S.  
Next try: “SORE” + one more letter; but we need five letters.

A valid word that fits is “ROSES” but with an extra letter.  
Let’s try “ROSES” anyway; it reuses S but the rules allow it.

Wait, a better unique-letter choice is “ROUSE” – it reuses E in position 5 (forbidden), so no.

Another candidate: “STORE” – uses T (new), S, T, O, R, E.

Check positions:
S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)

But:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from feedback)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback)

So “STORE” is invalid.

Next candidate: “RESIN” – uses I (new letter), but contains I (allowed).

Positions:
R(1), E(2), S(3), I(4), N(5)

Check constraints:
- R is allowed anywhere except position 2 (ok, position 1)
- O must appear somewhere; O is missing in “RESIN” – invalid.

We must keep O.

Let’s systematically list permutations of R,O,S,E plus one new letter not A.

We need a fifth letter: common choices are T, N, L, C, etc.

Candidate: “ROTES” – letters R,O,T,E,S.

Check positions:
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (ok, it’s in 2)
- S cannot be in 4 (ok, it’s in 5)
- E cannot be in 5 (ok, it’s in 4)
- R cannot be in 2 (ok, it’s in 1)

This satisfies all feedback constraints and introduces T as a new letter.

Therefore, “ROTES” is a valid second guess.

Guess 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
Guess 2: rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

What we now know:

Letters in the word and their known positions:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

Letters that must be in the word somewhere but not yet placed:
- R (from both guesses).
- S (from both guesses).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A (from guess 1).
- T (from guess 2).

So, the word has the pattern:

[?] [?] O [?] E

with the letters R and S still to be placed in the two remaining open slots (1 and 4), and no other constraints yet on what the second letter (position 2) might be (except it can’t be A or T).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits:

_ _ O _ E

with R and S somewhere in positions 1 and 4 (order unknown).

Let’s list the two possibilities:

1. R _ O S E → R O S E (but we need 5 letters; R O S E is 4 letters).  
   So R _ O S E must be something like R I O S E – but RIOSE is not a valid English word.

2. S _ O R E → S _ O R E.  
   We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form S _ O R E.  
   The second letter must be a consonant or vowel not A or T, and make a valid word.

The only common English word that fits S _ O R E is:

S N O R E

Let’s check constraints:

- S N O R E  
  - Position 1: S – allowed (S is in word, position unknown).  
  - Position 2: N – new letter, no constraints.  
  - Position 3: O – matches ✓ (correct).  
  - Position 4: R – allowed (R is in word, not yet placed).  
  - Position 5: E – matches ✓ (correct).  

All letters used are allowed (no A or T), and we’ve placed R and S in the two open positions.

Therefore, a valid next guess is SNORE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: rotes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: snore -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let us summarize every constraint we now have.

Letters known to be in the word and their correct positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from guess 3).

Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R, O, E (each appears at least once).

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
- A (from guess 1)
- T (from guess 2)
- N (from guess 3)

Therefore the hidden word must:

- start with S
- contain the letters R, O, E exactly once each
- have no A, T, N
- have no other constraints on the remaining positions 2, 3, 4, 5 except that O, R, E must all appear somewhere.

From guess 2 we also know:
- O is NOT in position 3 (because in rotes, O was marked ✓ in position 2 and that is now fixed, so the O in rotes is irrelevant; actually rotes had O in position 2 and it was marked ✓, which meant O is in position 2.  Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.)

Clarifying the feedback from rotes:  
rotes → R(-) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(-)

- O(✓) means O is in the word **and in position 2**.  
- E(✓) means E is in the word **and in position 4**.  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5.  
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1.  

So now the fixed positions are:

1: S (✓ from snore)  
2: O (✓ from rotes)  
3: ?  
4: E (✓ from rotes)  
5: ?  

And we still need to place R somewhere. The only remaining open positions are 3 and 5, but R cannot be in position 1 (already fixed as S) and there’s no restriction on position 3 or 5 for R except that it must appear once.

So the hidden word is S O _ E _ and the blank must be R.

But we need a 5-letter word that is S O _ E R. The only common English word that fits is:

S O V E R  — but SOVER is not a valid English word.  
S O R E R  — SORER is valid.  

Let me check:

SORER:
- S O R E R has two R’s. Our constraints say we must have exactly one R (from earlier feedback). Thus invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine carefully: we have letters S, O, R, E each appearing exactly once. Therefore we need a 5-letter word with:

S _ _ _ _
O _ _ _ _
R _ _ _ _
E _ _ _ _

and the fifth letter must be a new letter that is not A, T, N, and that appears exactly once.

But we already have S in position 1, O in position 2, E in position 4, so positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and one new allowed letter such that the word is valid.

Our pattern is now:  
S O _ E _

and the missing letters are R and one other letter. But we have only four letters in the word so far: S, O, R, E. The word must be 5 letters, so there must be one more distinct letter. However, the feedback says the word contains exactly S, O, R, E and no others (because the other letters A, T, N are ruled out and we have no evidence of more). This seems to be a contradiction unless the word has one of these letters repeated.

Re-evaluate: our feedback says:

- The word contains S, O, R, E.  
- No A, T, N.  
- S in position 1.  
- O in position 2.  
- E in position 4.  

Therefore the word is S O _ E _, and the blank positions 3 and 5 must be filled with R and exactly one additional letter that is allowed (but we have no evidence any other letter is in the word). The only possibility is that one of the positions 3 or 5 is R and the other is a letter we haven’t ruled out yet, but the word must be valid.

The only valid English word that fits S O _ E _ is:

S O V E R  — invalid (SOVER not a word)  
S O L E R  — SOLER is not a common English word  
S O R E R  — invalid (duplicate R)  

This indicates we must have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me carefully re-read guess 3 feedback:

Guess 3: snore → S(✓) N(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

This means:

- S is in the word and in position 1 (✓).  
- N is not in the word (x).  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the correct summary is:

Correct positions: S in position 1.  
Letters in word: S, O, R, E.  
Letters not in word: A, T, N.  
Constraints on positions:  
- O is NOT in position 3.  
- R is NOT in position 4.  
- E is NOT in position 5.  

We have 5 positions. Position 1 is S. The remaining letters O, R, E must be placed in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that none of them is in the forbidden positions above.

Let’s list all permutations placing O, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints:

Forbidden positions:
- O cannot be in 3  
- R cannot be in 4  
- E cannot be in 5  

We need to assign O, R, E to positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with each used exactly once and satisfying the above.

Possible assignments:

Case 1: O in position 2  
   Then R and E must be in 3, 4, 5 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5:  
   - R in 3, E in 4: allowed (R not in 4, E not in 5) → word: S O R E _ – but this is 4 letters plus blank. We need 5 letters. So we need a fifth letter. But we have no evidence of another letter. This suggests we must have a repeated letter among S, O, R, E. But feedback indicates each of S, O, R, E appears exactly once. Thus no valid word exists with these constraints unless we have missed something.

Case 2: O in position 4  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 5 avoiding R in 4 (ok), E not in 5:  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R O E _ – but then E is in position 4, which is allowed (constraint is E not in 5). So the word would be S R O E _, but we need 5 letters. The last position must be a letter, but we have no extra letters. This again indicates a missing insight.

Case 3: O in position 5  
   Then R and E must be in 2, 3, 4 avoiding R in 4 and E in 5 (ok):  
   - R in 2, E in 3: word S R E O _ – but O is in 5, so word would be S R E _ O.  
   - R in 3, E in 2: word S E R _ O.  

The valid English word fitting S _ _ _ O with letters S, O, R, E and R and E in positions 2, 3, 4 is:

S E R V O  — invalid  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R R O  — invalid double R  

This seems problematic. The only valid 5-letter word containing exactly S, O, R, E each once, starting with S, and fitting the position constraints is:

S E R O  — impossible  

Upon re-examination, we realize we must have overlooked that the word must contain exactly these four letters plus possibly one more that has not been ruled out yet. But our feedback says the word contains only S, O, R, E, and the positions are S _ _ _ _. 

The correct pattern now is:

1: S  
2: ?  
3: ?  
4: ?  
5: ?  

with O, R, E placed somewhere in positions 2-5, and no A, T, N, and with the constraints:

- O not in 3  
- R not in 4  
- E not in 5  

The only valid English word that fits these constraints is:

S O R E  — too short  
S E R O  — too short  
S E R V E  — contains V, but we have no evidence of V  

It appears the only possible word is S O R E D, but D has not been ruled in or out. However, the feedback only guarantees that the word contains S, O, R, E, and no A, T, N. The word could have one other letter that we haven’t tested.

Thus, the valid English word fitting the constraints is:

S O R E D  — but we have no info on D  
S H O R E  — H is new, and this is a valid word  

Let me check SHORE:

Letters: S, H, O, R, E – all allowed (no A, T, N).  
Positions:  
S(1) ✓  
H – new letter  
O – must be in word and not in position 3 (in SHORE, O is in position 3 – forbidden!)  
Thus invalid.

Next candidate: S O R V E  — invalid  

Next: S P O R E  — P is new, and positions: S(1), P(2), O(3) – but O cannot be in 3. Invalid.

Next: S O R R E  – duplicate R, invalid.

Next: S E R V O  – valid word? SERVO exists, and positions: S(1), E(2), R(3), V(4), O(5) – check constraints:

- O is in position 5 – allowed (constraint is O not in 3, ok)  
- R is in position 3 – allowed (constraint is R not in 4, ok)  
- E is in position 2 – allowed (constraint is E not in 5, ok)  
- Letters used: S, E, R, V, O – all allowed (no A, T, N)  

SERVO is a valid English word (device in control systems) and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERVO.

3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word

4. Remaining open positions

The only unknown letter left to place is the single R; everything else is already determined.  
Therefore the hidden pattern is:

The only English word that fits S O R E _ and uses only allowed letters is:

S  O  R  E  L   → “SOREL” (a valid 5-letter word meaning a young male red deer or a type of sorrel plant).

From the very first guess we established:

- O is in position 2 (✓ from rotes).  
- E is in position 4 (✓ from rotes).  
- S is in position 1 (✓ from snore & servo & sorel).  

So the pattern is fixed:

1  2  3  4  5  
S  O  ?  E  ?

We also know:

- R is in the word but **not** in position 3 (sorel showed R in 3 = –).  
- The only remaining open positions are 3 and 5.  
- The letter in position 3 must be R, but R is **forbidden** in position 3.  
- No other letters (A, T, N, V, L) are allowed.

This is a contradiction unless the word contains R in position 5.

Hence the hidden word must be:

S  O  _  E  R

The only valid English five-letter word matching S O _ E R is:

S  O  P  E  R  → “SOPER” (a surname / common crossword word, and it satisfies every constraint).

We have never tried the letter P, and it has not been ruled out by any feedback.

So the final logical guess is “SOPER”.
