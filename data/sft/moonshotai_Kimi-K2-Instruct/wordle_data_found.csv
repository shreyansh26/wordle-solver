For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me good information about common letters. A good starting word should have common consonants and vowels, and avoid rare letters. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good coverage of common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - includes common letters and the valuable 'R'
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O - heavy on vowels, might not give enough consonant info

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers three very common vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about what letters are or aren't in the word.

Every letter in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) was marked “x”, so none of those five letters appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common letters, so I need a fresh set of letters that are still frequent and cover both consonants and vowels.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H  
Good remaining vowels to test: O, U (since A, I, E are out)

A balanced word that uses only unused letters is “CLOUT”:
- C, L, O, U, T → none of these appeared in RAISE.  
It gives vowels O and U plus consonants C, L, T.

So the current pattern is:
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: D

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ O U N D.

Letters already eliminated: R, A, I, S, E, C, L, T, M.

Remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A quick check of English 5-letter words ending in OUND reveals:
- FOUND
- HOUND
- POUND
- ROUND
- SOUND
- WOUND

From these, we can immediately eliminate:
- ROUND (R is out)
- SOUND (S is out)

That leaves: FOUND, HOUND, POUND, WOUND.

All four use letters we haven’t eliminated. For a first attempt among them, I’ll pick FOUND because F is a relatively common letter.

So the next guess is FOUND.
