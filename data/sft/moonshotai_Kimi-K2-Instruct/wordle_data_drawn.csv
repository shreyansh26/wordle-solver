For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain vowels (especially A and E) and frequently used consonants like T, R, S, N, or L. Since we have no prior feedback, a balanced approach is best.

Some excellent first-guess options include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good vowel coverage)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - common consonants with vowels)

I'll go with STARE as it's widely considered one of the strongest opening words due to its letter frequency coverage.

So far we know:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- R is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

Since A is locked in the third spot, our pattern is: _ _ A _ _

R must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). We should avoid any word containing S, T, or E. Good consonants to test next are often L, N, C, D, G, M, etc. Let’s try a word that keeps R but moves it, and uses new consonants.

A good candidate is CRANK:
- C and N are new consonants.
- R is used in the 2nd position (different from last time).
- K is a common end letter.
This follows all constraints so far.

Valid consonants left: D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: O, U (A already used)

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 4:
- First letter: any of the remaining consonants.
- Fourth letter: any of the remaining consonants or vowels (except A).

Let’s list a few candidates that fit _ R A _ N and use only still-allowed letters:
- G R A N D (D not yet ruled out)
- D R A W N (W not yet ruled out)
- H R A N D (H not yet ruled out)
- P R A N D (P not yet ruled out)
- F R A N D (F not yet ruled out)
- G R A V N (V not yet ruled out, but ""GRAVN"" is not a valid word)
- M R A N N (double N, not valid)

Among valid English words that fit _ R A _ N and use only un-eliminated letters, the most common ones are:
- GRAND
- DRAWN
- FRAND (not a valid English word)
- PRAND (not a valid English word)

So ""GRAND"" and ""DRAWN"" are the best candidates. Between these, ""GRAND"" is a very common word and uses G and D, neither of which has been ruled out.

Let’s choose GRAND as the next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,drawn,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain vowels (especially A and E) and frequently used consonants like T, R, S, N, or L. Since we have no prior feedback, a balanced approach is best.

Some excellent first-guess options include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good vowel coverage)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - common consonants with vowels)

I'll go with STARE as it's widely considered one of the strongest opening words due to its letter frequency coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- R is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.
- S, T, and E are not in the word at all.

Since A is locked in the third spot, our pattern is: _ _ A _ _

R must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5). We should avoid any word containing S, T, or E. Good consonants to test next are often L, N, C, D, G, M, etc. Let’s try a word that keeps R but moves it, and uses new consonants.

A good candidate is CRANK:
- C and N are new consonants.
- R is used in the 2nd position (different from last time).
- K is a common end letter.
This follows all constraints so far.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now have:
- A is still locked in position 3.
- R is confirmed in position 2 (because it got ✓ this time).
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- C and K are not in the word.

So the current known pattern is: _ R A _ _

Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, C, K  
Letters that are IN but whose exact spots are unknown: N  
Other still-possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

N must appear in position 1 or 5, because it cannot be in 4 (from the CRANK feedback) and positions 2 and 3 are fixed as R and A.

Two straightforward possibilities:
1. N _ R A _  (N in 1)
2. _ R A _ N  (N in 5)

Let’s choose a word that places N in 5 and uses new consonants: B R A I N.  
- B and I haven’t been used yet.  
- N lands in the allowed position 5.  
- Pattern: B R A I N.

This respects every constraint discovered so far.

From all feedback so far:

Known fixed letters
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 = A
- Position 5 = N

So the pattern is:  _  R  A  _  N

Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, C, K, B, I, G  
Letters that must be placed: D (from GRAND feedback: D is in the word, but not in position 4) and N (but N is already locked in position 5)

Therefore D must be in position 1.  
That makes the structure: D  R  A  _  N

Only position 4 remains, and it must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out (not in {S,T,E,C,K,B,I,G}).  
Letters still allowed: F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, O

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting D R A _ N, we scan the dictionary and quickly find:

- DRAIN – but I is already excluded  
- DRANK – but K is already excluded  
- DRAWN – valid, uses W (still allowed)  
- DRAMN – not a word  
- DRAPN – not a word  
- DRAUN – not a word  
- DRAMN – not a word  

The only valid, common word left is DRAWN.

Check constraints:
- DRAWN: D,R,A,W,N  
- D is allowed (only must avoid position 4 – it’s in 1)  
- W is still allowed  
- Every other letter is already fixed or confirmed.

Hence DRAWN is the unique remaining valid guess.
