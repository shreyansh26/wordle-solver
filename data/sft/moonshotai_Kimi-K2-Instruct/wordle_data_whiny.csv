### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most frequent consonants in English are R, T, N, S, L, and the most common vowels are E, A, I, O, U. A good strategy is to include a mix of these common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words that contain these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- 3 vowels: A, O, E (covering the most common vowels)
- 2 very common consonants: R, S

This gives us good coverage across the alphabet and should provide helpful feedback about which common letters are in the secret word.

From the previous feedback we know:

Remaining vowels that are still possible: I (already confirmed), and sometimes Y.  

We need a 5-letter word that:

- uses only letters not yet ruled out
- has no repeats of letters we already have (to maximize info)

To cover more fresh letters, let’s use C, H, or D, etc.

Possible candidates built from letters not yet ruled out:
- DINKY (but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we already have I)
- NINNY (repeats N, not optimal)
- WINCH (has W and C/H, but W is still possible)
- CHINK (has C, H, N, I, K)

CHINK uses five unique letters (C, H, I, N, K), all still possible, and contains both confirmed letters N and I.

From all clues so far:

Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, K

Fixed letters in their exact positions:
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N

So the secret word now looks like: _ H I N _

Remaining unused letters (not yet shown in any feedback and not ruled out):
Vowels: none left except the already-placed I
Consonants: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need one consonant for position 1 and one consonant for position 5, both picked from the above list, forming a valid 5-letter English word.

A quick scan of the dictionary gives a few possibilities ending in “HIN_” or starting with “_HIN”, but the only common word pattern that matches _HIN_ is “WHINY” (W-H-I-N-Y).

Checking:
- Position 1: W (still allowed)
- Position 2: H (✓ fixed)
- Position 3: I (✓ fixed)
- Position 4: N (✓ fixed)
- Position 5: Y (still allowed)
