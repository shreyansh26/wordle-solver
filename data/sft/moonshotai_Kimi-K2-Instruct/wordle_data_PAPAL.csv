As this is my first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. The optimal strategy at this stage is to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters in English (to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the word)
2. Avoids repeating letters (to test as many unique letters as possible)
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Common letters in English 5-letter words include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should incorporate several of these. After considering options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I decide on ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) with no repeats.

Current state:
- Letters eliminated so far: R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I
- Known in the word: L (in position 5)
- Known in the word but not yet placed: A (but not in position 1)

Remaining frequent consonants: C, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K
Remaining frequent vowels: A (must be in positions 2-5)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with L
- Contains A somewhere in positions 2-4
- Uses only letters not already eliminated

Possible endings: * * * * L  
We also need a vowel besides A (since A is already accounted for). The remaining vowels not eliminated are none—only A is left. So the word must contain A exactly once and no other vowels, ending in L.

Looking for words fitting _ _ _ A L or _ _ A _ L or _ A _ _ L:

- CABAL: ends in L, has A in position 3. Uses C, B (both unused).
- PAPAL: ends in L, has A in positions 2 and 4. Uses P (unused).
- GAVEL: ends in L, has A in position 2, but E is already eliminated.
- NAVAL: N is eliminated.
- CAMEL: E is eliminated.
- BAGEL: E is eliminated.

Best candidate is CABAL:
- C, A, B, A, L
- But it has two A's, and we only know A is in the word once (from the single ""-"" in guess 1). So CABAL is risky.

Next option: PAPAL also has two A's.

Better option: PALLID is 6 letters. Too long.

Looking for 5-letter words with single A and ending in L:

- PAWAL: Not a valid word.
- PAPAL: Double A, invalid.
- CABAL: Double A, invalid.
- CAMEL: E eliminated.
- GAVEL: E eliminated.
- LABEL: E eliminated.

Alternative: Maybe A isn't required to appear only once. The feedback ""A(-)"" only means A is in the word but not in position 1; it doesn't specify frequency. So words like PAPAL or CABAL might be possible, but they're less likely.

Another approach: Since L is in position 5, we can try A in position 2:

- BADLY: Uses B, A, D, L, Y. All unused letters. Ends with L, positions: B A D L Y. Wait, that's 5 letters ending with Y, not L. Rejected.
- BAGEL: E eliminated.
- CABAL: Double A, but valid word. Let's check: C A B A L. All letters unused except L.

Given limited options, CABAL seems the best next guess despite double A, as all letters are fresh and it satisfies constraints.

- GAVEL: E eliminated.
- LABEL: E eliminated.

Alternative: Maybe A isn't required to appear only once. The feedback ""A(-)"" only means A is in the word but not in position 1; it doesn't specify frequency. So words like PAPAL or CABAL might be possible, but they're less likely.

Another approach: Since L is in position 5, we can try A in position 2:

- BADLY: Uses B, A, D, L, Y. All unused letters. Ends with L, positions: B A D L Y. Wait, that's 5 letters ending with Y, not L. Rejected.
- BAGEL: E eliminated.
- CABAL: Double A, but valid word. Let's check: C A B A L. All letters unused except L.

Given limited options, CABAL seems the best next guess despite double A, as all letters are fresh and it satisfies constraints.

Let me analyze the new information from the third guess CABAL.

Feedback from CABAL:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (since it got a checkmark)
- B(x) → B is NOT in the word
- A(✓) → A is in position 4 (since it got a checkmark)
- L(✓) → L is in position 5 (since it got a checkmark)

So now we know the exact structure:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: A  
- Position 5: L

Letters definitely not in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I, C, B

The word structure is: _ A _ A L

We need to find valid 5-letter English words matching this pattern using only remaining letters. The available letters are: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and L which we already know positions)

Looking at common letters, possible consonants for positions 1 and 3: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- D A M A L (DAMAL) - Not a valid English word
- G A M A L - Not valid
- H A M A L - Not valid
- G A D A L - Not valid
- F A M A L - Not valid
- P A P A L - P is available, but we have P,A,P,A,L. This is valid!
- D A D A L - Not valid
- M A M A L - Not valid

PAPAL is indeed a valid English word meaning ""relating to the pope"". All letters P, A, L are available (P hasn't been used yet).

Let me verify: P A P A L
- Position 1: P - not eliminated
- Position 2: A - confirmed ✓
- Position 3: P - not eliminated  
- Position 4: A - confirmed ✓
- Position 5: L - confirmed ✓

This perfectly matches the known structure.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word structure is _ A _ A L
- Letters A are in positions 2 and 4
- Letter L is in position 5
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, U, N, T, I, C, B
