Since this is the first guess without any prior information, I'll choose a word that uses common English letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as an excellent starting word because it contains:

- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet to help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S – not in the word
- L – not in the word
- A – in the word but in the wrong position
- T – in the word but in the wrong position
- E – not in the word

So the secret word definitely contains A and T, but neither is in its position in SLATE (A was 3rd, T was 4th).  
We also know S, L, E are ruled out completely.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- uses A and T
- places A not in position 3 and T not in position 4
- avoids S, L, E entirely

A high-value second guess that satisfies these constraints is “CARTY” – it keeps A and T, moves them to new positions, and brings in fresh consonants (C, R, Y) that haven’t been tested yet.

From the new feedback on CARTY:
- C – not in the word ( x )

- R – not in the word ( x )
- T – is in the word but in the wrong position ( - ) → T appears somewhere, but not in position 4
- Y – not in the word ( x )

So we now know:
- The word is _ A _ _ _
- It contains T, but T is not in position 4
- Letters we must avoid: S, L, E, C, R, Y

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining high-frequency letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, I, O.

Position 4 is now open (can’t be T), and T can be in 1, 3, or 5. Let’s pick a word that:
- keeps A in position 2,
- tries T in position 5,
- introduces new common letters.

The word “MATHS” would fit, but S is already eliminated.  
Instead, “MATCH” introduces M, T, C, H – but C is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “BATON” – but O and N have not been played, and T would be in position 3.  
“PATIO” also seems good, but we want to place T in a new spot.

A better choice: “PATIO”
- P (new)
- A (fixed at pos 2)
- T (moved to pos 3)

This tests three new letters (P, I, O) and still places T in an allowed spot.

Let’s extract the new information from PATIO:
- P (1st letter) – not in the word  
- A (2nd letter) – correct and in the right place → A is locked in position 2  
- T (3rd letter) – in the word but wrong position → T is present but cannot be 3rd  
- I (4th letter) – not in the word  
- O (5th letter) – correct and in the right place → O is locked in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ O  
We know:  
- T must appear somewhere, and the only open positions for T are 1, 3, or 4 (it cannot be 3 because T was wrong there, so 1 or 4).  
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, E, C, R, Y, P, I  

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, W  
Remaining vowels: none left to test (A and O are fixed; U hasn’t been tested and is still allowed).

Let’s pick T in position 4 (since 1 might block more possibilities).  
We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, avoiding everything ruled out.  
Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U, W.

A high-value word that fits: G A T O N → but T cannot be 3rd (it is 3rd here) and N hasn’t been used.  
Actually, T at 4th is allowed: _ A _ T O.  
Possible letters for 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, U.

Possible words:
- N A B T O – invalid (not a word)  
- N A G T O – invalid  
- M A N T O – valid word (“MANTO”) but obscure.  
- D A N T O – not a word  
- F A N T O – not a word  
- B A N T O – valid (“BANTO”) but obscure.  
- W A N T O – not a word  
- H A N T O – not a word  
- G A U T O – not a word  
- M A U T O – not a word  
- D A U T O – not a word  

Wait, let’s try G A U T O – again, not a word.  
T must be in position 1 or 4.  

Option with T in position 1: T A _ _ O.  
We avoid S, L, E, C, R, Y, P, I.  
We need two consonants for 3rd and 4th.  
Common choices: T A B O N – invalid (not a word)  
T A M O N – invalid  
T A N G O – valid word (“TANGO”).

TANGO:
- T is in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (fixed)  
- N, G, O are new letters (none ruled out)  

This tests N and G in one shot.
