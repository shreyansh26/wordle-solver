- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

The word ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This gives me good coverage of vowels and common consonants, which should provide useful feedback on my first attempt.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains R and E.
- A, O, S are not in the word.
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that includes R and E, avoids A, O, S, and doesn’t put R in spot 2 or E in spot 5. I’ll pick a word with more common unused letters. “E” must go somewhere except the last position, and “R” somewhere except position 2. A good candidate that meets these constraints is “THEIR”. It uses T, H, and I (all still possible), places E in position 2, and R in position 5, satisfying the positional constraints.

From the new feedback on THEIR:

- T(x) → T is not in the word.

- E(-) → E is present but not in position 3.
- I(-) → I is present but not in position 4.

So far we know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: E, I, R (with R locked in position 5).
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, H.

Positions we have ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (from AROSE) or 1-4 (because it is fixed at 5).
- E cannot be in positions 3 (from THEIR) or 5 (from AROSE).
- I cannot be in position 4.

Remaining available positions for E: 1, 2, 4.
Remaining available positions for I: 1, 2, 3.

Let’s choose a word that uses these letters plus other unused common consonants. The remaining common letters we can still use include N, L, C, B, D, G, F, M, K, Y, etc.

A candidate should:
- End with R.
- Contain E and I in valid positions.
- Avoid all eliminated letters (A, O, S, T, H).

One such word is “LINER”:
- Ends with R ✓
- Contains E and I ✓
- Uses L and N (both still possible).

Let’s check positions:
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since only positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since only position 4 is ruled out).
- R is in position 5 (confirmed ✓).
- L and N are new letters not yet guessed.
