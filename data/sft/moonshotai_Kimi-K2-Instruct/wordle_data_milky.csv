1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers common letters S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I will choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the word contains L, but L cannot be in position 2.

We also know the word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.  
So consonants we can still use include D, G, H, K, N, P, R, Y, etc.  
Vowels left are I, O, U.

Since L must appear somewhere other than position 2, and we have no other letters confirmed, a good next step is to test another set of common letters while placing L in a different spot.

Let me pick a word that:
- Moves L to position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.
- Introduces other common unused letters like R, I, N, O.

A strong candidate is ""FLING"":
- Contains L (position 2 → feedback will show if L is correct here or if it needs to move again).
- Adds F, I, N, G which are fresh letters not yet tested.

However, since L is confirmed not to be in position 2, placing L there is not ideal.  
Better: move L to position 3 and use fresh letters.

Another good option is ""WORLD"":
- Places L in position 4.
- Uses W, O, R, D which are all new letters.

""WORLD"" seems optimal for gaining new information while positioning L in a new spot.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,milky,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers common letters S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I will choose ""SLATE"" as it includes very common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E), giving good coverage for initial feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, A, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the word contains L, but L cannot be in position 2.

We also know the word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.  
So consonants we can still use include D, G, H, K, N, P, R, Y, etc.  
Vowels left are I, O, U.

Since L must appear somewhere other than position 2, and we have no other letters confirmed, a good next step is to test another set of common letters while placing L in a different spot.

Let me pick a word that:
- Moves L to position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5.
- Introduces other common unused letters like R, I, N, O.

A strong candidate is ""FLING"":
- Contains L (position 2 → feedback will show if L is correct here or if it needs to move again).
- Adds F, I, N, G which are fresh letters not yet tested.

However, since L is confirmed not to be in position 2, placing L there is not ideal.  
Better: move L to position 3 and use fresh letters.

Another good option is ""WORLD"":
- Places L in position 4.
- Uses W, O, R, D which are all new letters.

""WORLD"" seems optimal for gaining new information while positioning L in a new spot.

<guess>WORLD</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: WORLD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(x) R(x) L(-) D(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on WORLD:
- W, O, R, D are NOT in the word (x).
- L is again marked as “in the word but wrong position” (-), reinforcing that L must appear exactly once somewhere, just not in positions 2 or 4.

Letters we now know are **not** in the word:  
S, A, T, E, W, O, R, D.

Letters still possible (common 5-letter set):  
B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L exactly once.
2. Places L in a new position (1, 3, or 5).
3. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.

A good candidate is “CLINK”:
- L is in position 3 (new spot).
- Uses fresh plausible letters C, I, N, K.

Another candidate is “FLUNK”:
- L in position 3, uses F, U, N, K.

“CLINK” seems slightly more common, so I’ll go with that.

- K and L are in the word but in WRONG positions (-).

So we now know:
- I is fixed in position 2.
- K and L must appear somewhere else in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and each exactly once.
- Letters already ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, O, R, D, C, N, P, U.

Still allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, Y, Z (plus I fixed in pos 2).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ I _ _ _ (positions 1,3,4,5) that uses K and L exactly once each in those remaining slots and only uses allowed letters.

Some possible patterns:
- K I L _ _
- K I _ L _
- K I _ _ L
- L I K _ _
- L I _ K _
- L I _ _ K
- _ I K L _
- _ I K _ L
- _ I L K _
- _ I L _ K
- _ I _ K L
- _ I _ L K

We need to pick a valid English word from these patterns using allowed letters.

Let me check:
- FILMY – lacks K and L
- GILKY – not a word
- HILKY – not a word
- MILKY – M, I, L, K, Y – this fits pattern _ I L K Y with L in 3, K in 4, Y in 5. All letters allowed, and it's a valid word.
- JILKY – not a word
- VILKY – not a word
- ZILKY – not a word
- MILKY seems to be the only valid option here.

Let me verify:
- M, I, L, K, Y – all allowed
- I is in correct position 2 (matches ✓)
- K is in word but not in 4 (but we don't know yet if 4 is wrong, but from previous feedback K was not in 5, but no restriction on 4 yet)
Wait, from PIKUL feedback: K was in position 3 and marked as wrong position (-), so K cannot be in 3. In MILKY, K is in 4, which is allowed.
Similarly, L was in position 5 in PIKUL and marked (-), so L cannot be in 5. In MILKY, L is in 3 – allowed.

So MILKY satisfies all constraints.

- P and U are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position 2 (✓).
