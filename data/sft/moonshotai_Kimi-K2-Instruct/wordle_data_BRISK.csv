For the first guess, I want to pick a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Words with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage to test multiple letters at once.

Other good options include:
- STARE
- CRANE
- SLATE
- AUDIO

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced starting guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, O, E are not in the word.

So the target has the form:
_ R _ _ _  
and contains S somewhere not position 4.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R as its 2nd letter.
- Contains S not in the 4th slot.
- Does not use A, O, or E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, V, Y.
Good vowel to include: I or U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

A common word meeting these requirements is ""BRISK"":
- R is fixed in position 2.
- S appears in position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not in position 4 in AROSE, but the secret word could still have S in position 4 if the rule is interpreted per-guess; however, to be safe, I'll avoid S in position 4).
Actually, the feedback for AROSE said S is in the word but in the wrong position, so S is definitely present but not in position 4. So position 4 is out for S.

So ""BRISK"" would put S in position 4, which conflicts with the feedback. Let me pick another word.

Better choices:
- ""CRISP"" – R in 2, S in 4 (again conflict).
- ""DRUMS"" – R in 2, S in 5 (allowed).
- ""TRUST"" – R in 2, S in 5 (allowed).

I'll go with ""TRUST"":
- T R U S T: R in 2 (✓), S in 4 (but the feedback said S is not in 4 for AROSE, so this is allowed because it's a different guess), and avoids A, O, E.
But TRUST has S in 4, which was the exact position ruled out in AROSE's feedback (since S in AROSE was in position 4 and marked ""-""). So S cannot be in 4.

Next options:
- ""DRIPS"" – R in 2, S in 5 (allowed).
- ""GRIPS"" – R in 2, S in 5 (allowed).
- ""CRUST"" – R in 2, S in 4 (conflict).

Best is ""GRIPS"":

From the two prior guesses we now know:
1. R is fixed in position 2.  
   Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _

2. The word must contain both S and I, but:
   - S is **not** in position 5 (because in GRIPS, S in position 5 got “-” indicating it is in the word but wrong position).  
   - I **is** in position 3 (because in GRIPS, I in position 3 got “✓”).

Current pattern: _ R I _ _

Letters ruled out so far: A, O, E, G, P.

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We still need to place S somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is forbidden), so viable spots for S are 1 or 4.

Viable vowels left: U (I is already used).

Let’s list candidates fitting _ R I _ _ that include S somewhere:

- S R I _ _ → SR is not a legal start for common 5-letter words.  
- _ R I S _ → Valid words: CRISP, FRISK, PRISM, TRIST… but P is already ruled out, CRISP/PRISM lose P, TRIST is obscure.  
- _ R I _ S → Valid words: CRIBS, DRIBS, FRIGS, GRIDS, TRIGS, BRISK (B allowed), CRUIS (variant), but S in 5 is forbidden.  
However, from GRIPS feedback, S is in the word but **not** in 5, so S must be in 4.  
Hence the pattern is _ R I S _

Now we need a first letter that has not been eliminated:
