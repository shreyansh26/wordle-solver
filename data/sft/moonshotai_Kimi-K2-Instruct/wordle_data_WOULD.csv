For the first guess, I want to choose a word that is likely to give me good information. A good starting word should:
1. Be a common 5-letter word
2. Contain frequently used letters in English
3. Have a good mix of vowels and consonants

Some excellent starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, CRATE, SLANT, etc. These words contain common letters like S, T, A, E, R, N, L which appear frequently in English words.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it contains:
- C and R (very common consonants)
- A and E (very common vowels)
- N (common consonant)

This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters that might appear in the secret word.

All letters in CRANE were marked ""x"", so none of C, R, A, N, E occur anywhere in the secret word.  
I therefore need a 5-letter word that uses none of those five letters.

Good remaining high-frequency consonants include: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K  
Good remaining vowels include: I, O, U

A word that combines several of these remaining common letters is “STOUT”.  
It uses S, T, O, U – all of which have not yet been tested and are common in English words – plus another consonant (T).

No letters in STOUT overlap with the eliminated set {C, R, A, N, E}.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters eliminated entirely (x): C, R, A, N, E, S, T, T (T already counted once)
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions (-): O, U

So the secret word definitely contains the letters O and U, and does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, T.  
Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, plus the vowels I and the known vowels O and U.

Since O and U are already confirmed present, we still need three more letters from the remaining pool.  
A good strategy is to test several new common consonants in one word while placing O and U in new positions.

Let’s try “PLUMB”:
- P, L, M, B are all new and common consonants.
- U is placed in a different spot (position 3 instead of 4).
- O is not used here; we’ll test it in another guess if needed, but focusing on consonants first.

However, let me check if PLUMB is valid: yes, it’s a 5-letter word meaning a lead weight or to measure depth.

But wait, PLUMB uses U in position 3, which is new, but doesn’t use O at all. A better word would incorporate both O and U to confirm their positions.

Let me try “CLOUD” but C, L, O, U, D: C is eliminated, so no.

“FOULY” – F, O, U, L, Y: F, L, Y are new, O and U are used in new positions. But “FOULY” is an adverb form, might be obscure.

“GLOOM” – G, L, O, O, M: uses O twice, but T is eliminated, S is eliminated, etc. G, L, M are new.

“GROUP” – G, R, O, U, P: R is eliminated.

“SOUND” – S, O, U, N, D: S and N eliminated.

“DOUGH” – D, O, U, G, H: D, G, H are new consonants, uses both O and U. This seems strong.

Yes, DOUGH uses:
- D, G, H – new consonants
- O and U – confirmed present letters, placed in new positions (positions 2 and 3).

No eliminated letters are used.

So DOUGH is a good next guess.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters permanently out (x):  
C, R, A, N, E, S, T, G, H

Letters confirmed IN the word and positions known (✓):
- O at position 2  
- U at position 3

Letters confirmed IN the word but positions unknown (-):
- D

So the word pattern is:
_  O  U  _  _

with D somewhere in the remaining blanks (positions 1, 4 or 5), and no other letters from the eliminated list.

Remaining high-frequency letters we have not yet tried:
B, F, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels I (still unused) and the known O, U.

We have two empty slots (positions 1 and 4 or 5) and D must go in one of them plus one more new consonant or vowel.

A word that fits the pattern _OU_ _ and uses D:

Possible placements:
- D at position 1 → DOU _ _ (need two more letters)
- D at position 4 → _ OUD _ (need one more letter)
- D at position 5 → _ OU _ D (need one more letter)

Let me think of common 5-letter words that fit:

First, _OU_ _ with D at position 1: DOUB_ – “DOUBT” or “DOUBS” (DOUBS is obscure). DOUBT is common and fits pattern DOUBT.

Check if any letters are eliminated: D(-) confirmed, O,U confirmed, B, T are fresh. T was marked x in earlier guess (STOUT), so T is eliminated. So DOUBT is invalid because T is out.

Next: _ OUD _ . Words like “BOUDS”, but “BOUDS” is obscure. “BOUDH” etc. – nothing common.

Next: _ OU _ D . Possible words: MOUND (M, N, D – N is eliminated), FOUND (F, N – N eliminated), POUND (P, N – N eliminated), LOUD? (only 4 letters), WOUND (W, N – N eliminated), BOULD (not a word), HOULD (not a word).

Hmm, N is eliminated so MOUND, FOUND, POUND, WOUND are out.

Wait, the only consonant not eliminated among common ones is B, F, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Another approach: maybe D is at position 5, and position 1 and 4 have new letters.

Example: _ O U _ D  
We need two new consonants for positions 1 and 4.

A common word: “FOULD” – not a word. “BOULD” – not. “LOUID” – not. “VOULD” – not.

Wait, let’s try “MIXED” but X is ok, but M, I, X, E, D – E is eliminated.

Another candidate: “VOULD” – not a word.

“WOULD” – W, O, U, L, D.  
Check:
- W: fresh  
- O: position 2 ✓  
- U: position 3 ✓  
- L: fresh  
- D: confirmed somewhere, here at position 5.

No eliminated letters used. WOULD is a common word.

Yes, WOULD fits perfectly:
- Pattern: W O U L D  
- Uses D at position 5.  
- Uses new letters W and L.

This seems the strongest next guess.
