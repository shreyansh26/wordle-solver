Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I'll choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good opening word should have common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they contain frequent letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of frequently used letters in English.

- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

- A is in position 2 (different from position 1 in AROSE).

Let's digest the new feedback.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
- S is fixed in the last position (#5).  
- A occurs somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (in AROSE it was position 1, in PATHS it was position 2 and still marked “-” meaning wrong position).  
- R, O, E are completely out.

Guess 2: PATHS → P(x) A(-) T(x) H(-) S(-)  
- S was already pinned at #5, but here it is marked “-”. That must be an error in the feedback display; actually the fifth letter S is still ✓, so the only useful new info is:  
  – P, T are not in the word.  
  – H is in the word but not in position 4.  
  – A is confirmed again as present but still not in position 2.

So we now know:
- Word ends with S.  
- Contains A and H (A not in positions 1 or 2, H not in position 4).  
- Letters not in the word: P, T, R, O, E.

Common consonants left to test: N, L, C, D, M, B, G, etc.

We also know A must be in position 3, 4 or 5. Position 5 is already S, so A must be in 3 or 4.  
H cannot be in 4, so H must be in 1, 2 or 3 (and if A is in 3, H can’t be there).

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
S in 5, A in 3, H in 1 or 2, plus two new consonants.

Candidate: “HANDS”  
- H in 1, A in 2 – but the feedback says A is not in 2, so invalid.

Candidate: “CLASH” – ends with H, but we need S last.

Candidate: “CHAMS” – S last, good, but M is untested and H in 3, A in 4.  
But we have no info on C, M yet.

Simpler word: “BLANK” – no S.

Actually the simplest word meeting constraints: “CHASM”

Let me check:
- C, H, A, S, M.  
- S is last (✓).  
- A is in position 3 (nowhere near 1 or 2).  
- H is in position 2 (not 4).  
- C and M are new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Letters we know are in the word:
   - S must be in position 5 (from AROSE).  
   - A must be in position 3 (from CHASM).  
   - H must be in the word but not in position 4 (from PATHS and CHASM).  
   - The word therefore looks like: _ _ A _ S, with H appearing somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 4, so H must be in 1 or 2).

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   R, O, E, P, T, C, M.

3. Still-untested common consonants: N, L, B, G, D, K, F, W.

4. Still-untested vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y).

5. Word pattern: _ _ A _ S  
   With H in position 1 or 2.

Possibilities:
- H _ A _ S  
- _ H A _ S

We have two blanks left to fill; they must be letters not already ruled out.

Let’s try the pattern H _ A _ S first.

For H _ A _ S:
- Second letter: could be N, L, B, G, D, K, F, I, U...
- Fourth letter: same pool.

Example candidates:
- HNAKS – invalid (K not ruled out, but N & K together may not form a word).  
- HBAKS – not valid.  
- HLA _ S: “HL” not legal start in English.  
- HIA _ S: H + I is fine; what four-letter ending?  
Wait, English words: H I A _ S – nothing common.

Try _ H A _ S pattern instead.

Second letter H, so position 2 is H:
_ H A _ S

Fill positions 1 and 4 with available letters.

Candidates:
- B H A _ S – BHADS? No.  
- N H A _ S – NHADS? No.  
- L H A _ S – LHADS? No.  
- G H A _ S – GHADS? No.  
- D H A _ S – DHABS? Not a word.  
- K H A _ S – KHAKS? No.  
- F H A _ S – FHADS? No.  
- I H A _ S – IHADS? No.  
- U H A _ S – UHADS? No.

Wait, we also have N, L, B, G, D, K, F, W, and vowels I, U.

Let me list real words of pattern _ H A _ S:

- SHAMS – but S is already in position 5, and M is out.  
- WHAMS – M out.  
- CHAOS – O is out.  
- CHADS – C out.  
- WHACK – too short.  
- SHAKS – M is out, but “SHAKS” is not valid.  
- BHANG – too short.  
- SHADS – S is already in position 5, and D is untested, but duplicate S.

Hmm, maybe I’m missing a simple word.

Let’s try LHA _ S – no.  
Wait, English word matching _ H A _ S: “SHADS” is plural of shad, but S already used in position 5 and we can’t have S twice.

Another approach: fourth letter could be N, and first letter could be L or B or G.

Example: L H A N S – but that’s 5 letters: LHANS? Not a word.

B H A N S – BHANS? No.

G H A N S – GHANS? No.

What about first letter I?

I H A N S – IHANS? No.

U H A N S – UHANS? No.

Let me rethink vowels: only I, U, Y left.

- PHAGE – too short.  

Wait, perhaps we overlooked D.

- SHADS – S in 5 already, plus duplicate S.  

None seem valid under current constraints.

So pattern options:

1. H _ A _ S  
2. _ H A _ S

Check constraints:
- S in 5 ✓  
- A in 3 ✓  
- H in 2 ✓  
- K and N are new letters (not ruled out).

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,GNASH,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I'll choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good opening word should have common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices because they contain frequent letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of frequently used letters in English.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, the feedback tells us:
- S is in the word and in the correct final position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. Word ends with S.
2. Contains A somewhere (but not position 1).
3. Does not contain R, O, E.

To maximize information gain, I need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Uses new common consonants (since we eliminated R and already have S).
- Places A in a different position (not first).
- Avoids O, E.

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try a word like ""PATHS"":
- P, A, T, H are all new letters being tested.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 1 in AROSE).
- Ends with S as required.

Other options could be ""TAILS"", ""MANTS"", but ""PATHS"" tests several new letters efficiently.

Guess 2: PATHS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) T(x) H(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's digest the new feedback.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
- S is fixed in the last position (#5).  
- A occurs somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (in AROSE it was position 1, in PATHS it was position 2 and still marked “-” meaning wrong position).  
- R, O, E are completely out.

Guess 2: PATHS → P(x) A(-) T(x) H(-) S(-)  
- S was already pinned at #5, but here it is marked “-”. That must be an error in the feedback display; actually the fifth letter S is still ✓, so the only useful new info is:  
  – P, T are not in the word.  
  – H is in the word but not in position 4.  
  – A is confirmed again as present but still not in position 2.

So we now know:
- Word ends with S.  
- Contains A and H (A not in positions 1 or 2, H not in position 4).  
- Letters not in the word: P, T, R, O, E.

Common consonants left to test: N, L, C, D, M, B, G, etc.

We also know A must be in position 3, 4 or 5. Position 5 is already S, so A must be in 3 or 4.  
H cannot be in 4, so H must be in 1, 2 or 3 (and if A is in 3, H can’t be there).

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
S in 5, A in 3, H in 1 or 2, plus two new consonants.

Candidate: “HANDS”  
- H in 1, A in 2 – but the feedback says A is not in 2, so invalid.

Candidate: “CLASH” – ends with H, but we need S last.

Candidate: “CHAMS” – S last, good, but M is untested and H in 3, A in 4.  
But we have no info on C, M yet.

Simpler word: “BLANK” – no S.

Actually the simplest word meeting constraints: “CHASM”

Let me check:
- C, H, A, S, M.  
- S is last (✓).  
- A is in position 3 (nowhere near 1 or 2).  
- H is in position 2 (not 4).  
- C and M are new letters.

That seems valid.

- H-B-A-D-S → HBADS? No.  
- H-N-A-K-S → HNAKS? No.  
- H-L-A-N-S → HLAN is not a start.  

Case 2: _ H A _ S  
Need first and fourth letters.

Real words:  
- B H A N S – BHANS? no.  
- D H A N S – DHANS? no.  
- F H A N S – FHANS? no.  
- G H A N S – GHANS? no.  
- K H A N S – KHANS – YES! “KHANS” is a valid plural of khan.

Check constraints:
- S in 5 ✓  
- A in 3 ✓  
- H in 2 ✓  
- K and N are new letters (not ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, P, T, C, M).

Therefore, the next logical guess is KHANS.

Let’s update the constraints with the new feedback (Guess 4: KHANS):

- K is **not** in the word.  
- H is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
- A is **correct** in position 3 (already known).  
- N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- S is **correct** in position 5 (already known).

So the word looks like: _ _ A _ S  
with:
- H must appear exactly once, and cannot be in position 2 or 4.  
  Therefore H must be in position 1.  
- N must appear exactly once, and cannot be in position 4 (and position 5 is S).  
  Therefore N must be in position 2.

This gives the fixed pattern: H N A _ S

The only remaining blank is position 4. We need a letter that:
- has **not** been ruled out (i.e., not R, O, E, P, T, C, M, K).  
- has **not** been used yet in any position (so far we have H, N, A, S).  

Valid unused letters: B, D, F, G, I, L, U, W, Y.

Real English 5-letter words matching H N A _ S:
- H N A D S → “HNADS” – invalid.  
- H N A G S → “HNAGS” – invalid.  
- H N A L S → “HNALS” – invalid.  
- H N A B S → “HNABS” – invalid.

Looking at the Scrabble/NWL list, **HNADS** is not a word, but “HANDS” is!

- HANDS ends with S, has A in 3, N in 2, H in 1 – exactly matching our constraints.  
- The letter D has never been ruled out and is unused so far.

Therefore the next guess is clearly **HANDS**.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the first guess AROSE, the feedback tells us:
- S is in the word and in the correct final position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. Word ends with S.
2. Contains A somewhere (but not position 1).
3. Does not contain R, O, E.

To maximize information gain, I need a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Uses new common consonants (since we eliminated R and already have S).
- Places A in a different position (not first).
- Avoids O, E.

Good consonants to test next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try a word like ""PATHS"":
- P, A, T, H are all new letters being tested.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 1 in AROSE).
- Ends with S as required.

Other options could be ""TAILS"", ""MANTS"", but ""PATHS"" tests several new letters efficiently.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's digest the new feedback.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
- S is fixed in the last position (#5).  
- A occurs somewhere in the word but NOT in position 1 or 2 (in AROSE it was position 1, in PATHS it was position 2 and still marked “-” meaning wrong position).  
- R, O, E are completely out.

Guess 2: PATHS → P(x) A(-) T(x) H(-) S(-)  
- S was already pinned at #5, but here it is marked “-”. That must be an error in the feedback display; actually the fifth letter S is still ✓, so the only useful new info is:  
  – P, T are not in the word.  
  – H is in the word but not in position 4.  
  – A is confirmed again as present but still not in position 2.

So we now know:
- Word ends with S.  
- Contains A and H (A not in positions 1 or 2, H not in position 4).  
- Letters not in the word: P, T, R, O, E.

Common consonants left to test: N, L, C, D, M, B, G, etc.

We also know A must be in position 3, 4 or 5. Position 5 is already S, so A must be in 3 or 4.  
H cannot be in 4, so H must be in 1, 2 or 3 (and if A is in 3, H can’t be there).

Let’s try a word that satisfies:
S in 5, A in 3, H in 1 or 2, plus two new consonants.

Candidate: “HANDS”  
- H in 1, A in 2 – but the feedback says A is not in 2, so invalid.

Candidate: “CLASH” – ends with H, but we need S last.

Candidate: “CHAMS” – S last, good, but M is untested and H in 3, A in 4.  
But we have no info on C, M yet.

Simpler word: “BLANK” – no S.

Actually the simplest word meeting constraints: “CHASM”

Let me check:
- C, H, A, S, M.  
- S is last (✓).  
- A is in position 3 (nowhere near 1 or 2).  
- H is in position 2 (not 4).  
- C and M are new letters.

That seems valid.

1. Letters we know are in the word:
   - S must be in position 5 (from AROSE).  
   - A must be in position 3 (from CHASM).  
   - H must be in the word but not in position 4 (from PATHS and CHASM).  
   - The word therefore looks like: _ _ A _ S, with H appearing somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 4, so H must be in 1 or 2).

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
   R, O, E, P, T, C, M.

3. Still-untested common consonants: N, L, B, G, D, K, F, W.

4. Still-untested vowels: I, U (and sometimes Y).

5. Word pattern: _ _ A _ S  
   With H in position 1 or 2.

Possibilities:
- H _ A _ S  
- _ H A _ S

We have two blanks left to fill; they must be letters not already ruled out.

Let’s try the pattern H _ A _ S first.

For H _ A _ S:
- Second letter: could be N, L, B, G, D, K, F, I, U...
- Fourth letter: same pool.

Example candidates:
- HNAKS – invalid (K not ruled out, but N & K together may not form a word).  
- HBAKS – not valid.  
- HLA _ S: “HL” not legal start in English.  
- HIA _ S: H + I is fine; what four-letter ending?  
Wait, English words: H I A _ S – nothing common.

Try _ H A _ S pattern instead.

Second letter H, so position 2 is H:
_ H A _ S

Fill positions 1 and 4 with available letters.

Candidates:
- B H A _ S – BHADS? No.  
- N H A _ S – NHADS? No.  
- L H A _ S – LHADS? No.  
- G H A _ S – GHADS? No.  
- D H A _ S – DHABS? Not a word.  
- K H A _ S – KHAKS? No.  
- F H A _ S – FHADS? No.  
- I H A _ S – IHADS? No.  
- U H A _ S – UHADS? No.

Wait, we also have N, L, B, G, D, K, F, W, and vowels I, U.

Let me list real words of pattern _ H A _ S:

- SHAMS – but S is already in position 5, and M is out.  
- WHAMS – M out.  
- CHAOS – O is out.  
- CHADS – C out.  
- WHACK – too short.  
- SHAKS – M is out, but “SHAKS” is not valid.  
- BHANG – too short.  
- SHADS – S is already in position 5, and D is untested, but duplicate S.

Hmm, maybe I’m missing a simple word.

Let’s try LHA _ S – no.  
Wait, English word matching _ H A _ S: “SHADS” is plural of shad, but S already used in position 5 and we can’t have S twice.

Another approach: fourth letter could be N, and first letter could be L or B or G.

Example: L H A N S – but that’s 5 letters: LHANS? Not a word.

B H A N S – BHANS? No.

G H A N S – GHANS? No.

What about first letter I?

I H A N S – IHANS? No.

U H A N S – UHANS? No.

Let me rethink vowels: only I, U, Y left.

Try _ H A I S?  
Possible real word: “CHAIS” – C is out.

“SHAIS” – not a word.

“PHAIS” – P out.

“KHAIS” – K is untested; but “KHAIS” is not a valid word.

“LHAIS” – no.

“BHAIS” – not valid.

“GHAIS” – no.

Try _ H A U S?  
“SHAUS” – no.

“KHAUS” – rare; probably invalid.

“BHAUS” – no.

“LHAUS” – no.

Real pattern: _ H A _ S.

Let’s list English 5-letter words ending in S with A in 3, H in 2:

- CHAOS – O out.  
- SHADS – S already in 5.  
- WHAMS – M out.  
- SHAMS – M out.  
- PHAGE – too short.  

Wait, perhaps we overlooked D.

Word: DHABS – no.  
FHARS – no.

Actually, “BHANG” is not 5 letters.

Let me list all real _ H A _ S words:

- SHAMS – M out.  
- CHAOS – O out.  
- WHAMS – M out.  
- SHADS – S in 5 already, plus duplicate S.  

None seem valid under current constraints.

Recheck: we have S in 5, A in 3, H must be in 1 or 2.

So pattern options:

1. H _ A _ S  
2. _ H A _ S

In case 1: H _ A _ S  
Need second and fourth letters. Available letters: N, L, B, G, D, K, F, W, I, U, Y.

Real words:  
- H-B-A-D-S → HBADS? No.  
- H-N-A-K-S → HNAKS? No.  
- H-L-A-N-S → HLAN is not a start.  

Case 2: _ H A _ S  
Need first and fourth letters.

Real words:  
- B H A N S – BHANS? no.  
- D H A N S – DHANS? no.  
- F H A N S – FHANS? no.  
- G H A N S – GHANS? no.  
- K H A N S – KHANS – YES! “KHANS” is a valid plural of khan.

Check constraints:
- S in 5 ✓  
- A in 3 ✓  
- H in 2 ✓  
- K and N are new letters (not ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, P, T, C, M).

Therefore, the next logical guess is KHANS.

<guess>KHANS</guess>

<guess>KHANS</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: PATHS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) T(x) H(-) S(-)
Guess 3: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(-) A(✓) S(✓) M(x)
Guess 4: KHANS -> FEEDBACK: K(x) H(-) A(✓) N(-) S(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let’s update the constraints with the new feedback (Guess 4: KHANS):

- K is **not** in the word.  
- H is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
- A is **correct** in position 3 (already known).  
- N is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
- S is **correct** in position 5 (already known).

So the word looks like: _ _ A _ S  
with:
- H must appear exactly once, and cannot be in position 2 or 4.  
  Therefore H must be in position 1.  
- N must appear exactly once, and cannot be in position 4 (and position 5 is S).  
  Therefore N must be in position 2.

This gives the fixed pattern: H N A _ S

The only remaining blank is position 4. We need a letter that:
- has **not** been ruled out (i.e., not R, O, E, P, T, C, M, K).  
- has **not** been used yet in any position (so far we have H, N, A, S).  

Valid unused letters: B, D, F, G, I, L, U, W, Y.

Real English 5-letter words matching H N A _ S:
- H N A D S → “HNADS” – invalid.  
- H N A G S → “HNAGS” – invalid.  
- H N A L S → “HNALS” – invalid.  
- H N A B S → “HNABS” – invalid.

Looking at the Scrabble/NWL list, **HNADS** is not a word, but “HANDS” is!

- HANDS ends with S, has A in 3, N in 2, H in 1 – exactly matching our constraints.  
- The letter D has never been ruled out and is unused so far.

Therefore the next guess is clearly **HANDS**.

Let’s break down all constraints from the five clues.

1. Correct letters and positions
   – S is fixed in position 5 (from every guess).

2. Present but misplaced letters
   – A: present somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in:
        AROSE it was position 1 and marked “-”;  
        PATHS it was position 2 and marked “-”;  
        CHASM it was position 3 and marked ✓, but now in HANDS it is position 2 and again marked “-”, so A **cannot** be in 1,2,3,4.  
        BUT a 5-letter word has only positions 1-5, and 5 is S.  
        Therefore **A cannot be placed at all** → contradiction.  
   – H: present but not in positions 1, 2, 4 (from PATHS, CHASM, KHANS) and now in HANDS it is again marked “-” in position 1.  
        So H **must** be in position 3.  
   – N: present but not in positions 2 or 4 (KHANS and HANDS both mark “-”).

3. Absent letters
   R, O, E, P, T, C, M, K, D.

4. Current pattern
   – Position 5: S  
   – Position 3: must be H (only remaining legal spot)  
   – N must be in 1, 3, or 5. 3 is H, 5 is S → N **must** be in 1.  
   So far: N _ H _ S.

5. Remaining blanks
   Positions 2 and 4 must be chosen from still-legal, unused letters:
   Allowed: B, F, G, I, L, U, W, Y, (none of which have appeared).

Real English 5-letter words matching N _ H _ S:
- N I H I S – invalid  
- N U H U S – invalid  
- N E H E S – E ruled out  
- N A H A S – A ruled out  
- N B H _ _ – no common word  
- N L H _ _ – no common word  

The only common word that fits: **NIGHS** (plural of “nigh”).

Check constraints:
- Ends in S (✓)  
- H in 3 (✓)  
- N in 1 (✓)  
- I and G are new, never ruled out.

Therefore NIGHS is the only viable remaining candidate.
