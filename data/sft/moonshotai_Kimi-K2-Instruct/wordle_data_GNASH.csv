For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has C, R, N which are common consonants
- It has two vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It avoids less common letters like Z, Q, X
- It's a valid 5-letter word

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _
N is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
We need a word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position
2. Doesn't contain C, R, or E
3. Contains N somewhere (but not in 4th position)
4. Uses common remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: A (already used), I, O, U

I'll try ""PLANT"":
- P, L, N, T are all common letters not ruled out
- P L A N T - N is in position 4 (but feedback said N is wrong position in CRANE)
Wait, in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got (-), meaning N is in word but not position 4. In PLANT, N would be position 4 - same as before. So PLANT is invalid.

   - New information:
     – N is in position 2 (✓).
     – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
     – I and L are NOT in the word.

So the current picture is:

- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, I, L.

Remaining usable consonants (aside from N and S): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y
Remaining vowels: A (already in place), O, U

Possible patterns:

Let’s try N O A S Y – but Y isn’t ruled out, yet we might prefer more common letters.
Actually, with N in 2 and A in 3, we have:

Wait! After SNAIL, N got ✓, so N is in position 2. Therefore the pattern is:

4. _ N A _ S – e.g., ""KNACK"" – but C is ruled out
5. ""PNASS"" – invalid
6. ""DNAST"" – invalid
7. ""PNAYS"" – invalid
8. ""UNAPT"" – T at end, but A is 3rd, N 2nd → U N A P T – yes, valid and contains P (allowed), U (allowed), T (allowed), N, A.

Let’s check ""UNAPT"":
- U N A P T
- Letters used: U (allowed), N (correct pos 2), A (correct pos 3), P (allowed), T (allowed)
- S is still floating – but ""UNAPT"" doesn’t contain S, and we know S is in the word. So this fails.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has C, R, N which are common consonants
- It has two vowels (A, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- It avoids less common letters like Z, Q, X
- It's a valid 5-letter word

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ _
N is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
We need a word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position
2. Doesn't contain C, R, or E
3. Contains N somewhere (but not in 4th position)
4. Uses common remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: A (already used), I, O, U

I'll try ""PLANT"":
- P, L, N, T are all common letters not ruled out
- P L A N T - N is in position 4 (but feedback said N is wrong position in CRANE)
Wait, in CRANE, N was in position 4 and got (-), meaning N is in word but not position 4. In PLANT, N would be position 4 - same as before. So PLANT is invalid.

Let me try ""STAND"":
- S T A N D
- N is in position 4 again - same issue.

Try ""PLANK"":
- P L A N K - N in position 4 again.

Try ""PLANT"" but N in different position - can't be.

Try ""PAINT"":
- P A I N T - A is position 2 here, but we need A in position 3.

Wait, I need A in position 3. Let me think differently.

Word structure: _ _ A _ _
N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Try ""SNACK"":
- S N A C K - but C is ruled out.

Try ""PLANK"" but that's P L A N K - N in 4th.

Try ""PLANT"" - no, N is 4th.

Try ""STANK"":
- S T A N K - N in 4th again.

Hmm, I need N in position 1, 2 or 5 with A in 3.

Try ""NAVAL"":
- N A V A L - A is position 2, not 3.

Try ""MANIA"":
- M A N I A - A in position 2.

Try ""PLANT"" - no.

Let me think of words with A in position 3 and N elsewhere:
- _ N A _ _
- _ _ A N _
- _ _ A _ N

Try ""SNAIL"":
- S N A I L - A in 3, N in 2
No C,R,E - good
Letters: S,N,A,I,L - all allowed

This seems valid.

<guess>SNAIL</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SNAIL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(✓) A(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(-) E(x)
   - Known so far:
     – A is definitely in position 3.
     – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SNAIL → S(-) N(✓) A(✓) I(x) L(x)
   - New information:
     – N is in position 2 (✓).
     – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
     – I and L are NOT in the word.

So the current picture is:
N _ A _ _
Plus:
- S exists somewhere, just not position 1.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, I, L.

Remaining usable consonants (aside from N and S): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y
Remaining vowels: A (already in place), O, U

Possible patterns:
N _ A _ _
with S in position 3 (but position 3 is A) or 4 or 5.

Let’s try N O A S Y – but Y isn’t ruled out, yet we might prefer more common letters.
Actually, with N in 2 and A in 3, we have:
_ N A _ _

Wait! After SNAIL, N got ✓, so N is in position 2. Therefore the pattern is:
_ N A _ _

We also know S is somewhere but not first. Let’s list possibilities placing S in 4 or 5.

Candidate words:
1. B N A S _ – BNAS_ isn’t valid (no 5-letter words beginning BNAS)
2. _ N A S T – ""GNAST"" isn’t valid
3. _ N A S S – not valid
4. _ N A _ S – e.g., ""KNACK"" – but C is ruled out
5. ""PNASS"" – invalid
6. ""DNAST"" – invalid
7. ""PNAYS"" – invalid
8. ""UNAPT"" – T at end, but A is 3rd, N 2nd → U N A P T – yes, valid and contains P (allowed), U (allowed), T (allowed), N, A.

Let’s check ""UNAPT"":
- U N A P T
- Letters used: U (allowed), N (correct pos 2), A (correct pos 3), P (allowed), T (allowed)
- S is still floating – but ""UNAPT"" doesn’t contain S, and we know S is in the word. So this fails.

Alternative: include S in position 4 or 5.
Pattern _ N A _ _
with S in 4: _ N A S _
Possible word: ""KNARS"" – but K and S allowed, but R is ruled out.

""DNASE"" – E ruled out.

""GNATS"" – G, N, A, T, S
Check:
- G allowed, N in 2, A in 3, T allowed, S in 5.
- Letters: G,N,A,T,S – none are forbidden and S is in the word but not first – satisfies all constraints.

""GNATS"" fits perfectly.
