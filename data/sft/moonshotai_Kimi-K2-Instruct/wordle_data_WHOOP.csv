For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and is likely to give us useful information regardless of the secret word. Words with common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T are good choices. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ""CRANE"" - covers common consonants and vowels
- ""SLATE"" - similar approach
- ""RAISE"" - good mix of vowels and consonants
- ""ADIEU"" - covers almost all vowels
- ""STARE"" - common letters

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give us good information about which of these letters are present in the secret word.

All five letters in “CRANE” are ruled out: C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.  
Since we have zero hits, we should pivot to the next most common letters that were not used.

A solid opening pattern with completely fresh letters is:

S, T, O, I, L  → “STOIL” (valid English word, though uncommon)

S, T, I, L, U → “STILU” (invalid)

Let's process the new feedback step-by-step.

From the feedback for SPOIL:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- P(-) → P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 3 (correct spot).
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, D, U, B, T, S, I, L  
Letters known to be in the word: O (position 3), P (somewhere else)  
Remaining unused common letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O fixed in position 3
- P must appear somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- No other letters from the ruled-out set

Possible patterns: _ P O _ _, _ _ O P _, _ _ O _ P

Looking for words that fit this pattern using only the remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z plus P and O.

Some candidates:
- ""GOPHY"" - invalid (GOPHY isn't a word)
- ""VOPHY"" - invalid
- ""MOPHY"" - invalid
- ""KOPHY"" - invalid
- ""GYPOS"" - invalid (S is ruled out)
- ""GOOPY"" - invalid (double O isn't helpful, and Y is allowed)
- ""MOPPY"" - invalid (double P)
- ""JOKPY"" - invalid
- ""KOPJE"" - invalid (E is ruled out)
- ""PHONY"" - invalid (H is allowed, but P is in position 1 which is allowed, but we need O in position 3)
- ""PYGMY"" - invalid (Y is allowed, but O is missing)

Wait, let's think differently. Since O is fixed in position 3 and P must be somewhere else, let's try:
- Position 1: from remaining letters (F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z)
- Position 2: P (but P can't be here because feedback says P is NOT in position 1, but could be here)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: from remaining letters
- Position 5: from remaining letters

But P must appear somewhere, so possible positions for P are 2,4,5.

Let's try ""KOPHY"" - but HYPH is not a word.
Actually, ""KOPJE"" is a word but uses E which is ruled out.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 3 and P somewhere else, using only allowed letters.

Looking at allowed letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z plus P, O.

Possible words:
- ""KOPJE"" - invalid (E ruled out)
- ""KOPPA"" - invalid (A ruled out)
- ""KOPHS"" - invalid (S ruled out)
- ""KOPJE"" - already considered
- ""MOPPY"" - invalid (double P, Y is allowed but double P is fine, but L is ruled out? No L is already ruled out)
Wait, ""MOPPY"" - letters M, O, P, P, Y - all allowed (M, P, O, Y are unused). But is MOPPY a word? It's slang for ""mopey"", but might not be valid.

""POPPY"" - invalid (P in position 1 is allowed, but we have double P and O is in position 3)
But P is allowed in position 1, and we know P is in the word somewhere (from feedback), but no restriction that P can't be in position 1. However, the feedback from SPOIL only told us P is NOT in position 1, but could be elsewhere.

Actually, the SPOIL feedback said P(-), which means P is in the word but NOT in position 1. So P can be in positions 2,4,5.

So possible patterns:
- _ P O _ _
- _ _ O P _
- _ _ O _ P

Using remaining letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z plus P, O.

Let's try _ P O _ _:
First letter: from F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Second: P
Third: O (fixed)
Fourth: from allowed letters
Fifth: from allowed letters

Possible words:
- ""KPOXY"" - invalid
- ""MPOXY"" - invalid
- ""GPOXY"" - invalid
- ""HPOXY"" - invalid
- ""JPOXY"" - invalid

Not finding valid words here. Let's try _ _ O P _:
Third: O
Fourth: P
Possible words:
- ""GYMPO"" - invalid (G, Y, M, P, O) but P is in position 4 which is allowed
But is GYMPO a word? No.

""GYPO"" is 4 letters. Not helpful.

Let's try _ _ O _ P:
Third: O
Fifth: P
Possible words:
- ""GYKOP"" - invalid
- ""MYKOP"" - invalid
- ""FYKOP"" - invalid

This is tricky. Maybe look for actual valid words.

Looking at the pattern _ _ O _ P, with O in position 3 and P in position 5, and other letters from F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible valid word: ""GYROP"" - but is this a word? ""Gyrop"" is short for gyroscope but not standard.

Another pattern: _ P O _ _
Example: ""KIPPO"" - but I is ruled out.

Wait, let's list the allowed letters again:
Allowed: O (fixed pos 3), P (must appear), and others from F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting _ P O _ _ is ""KOPJE"" but E is ruled out.
Another: ""JOPPY"" - P in position 2, O position 3, Y in 5 - but is JOPPY a word? No.

Actually, the word ""KOPHY"" is not valid. Let's think of real words.

A valid word is ""GOPHY"" - no, not valid.

Alternative: ""MYOPY"" - a medical term for myopia. Is this valid? Yes, ""myopy"" is an archaic term for myopia.

But let's check letters:
M, Y, O, P, Y - all allowed (M, Y, O, P are unused; Y appears twice which is fine)
O is in position 3 (correct)
P is in position 4 (allowed, since P must be somewhere and this is position 4)

Thus, ""MYOPY"" fits all constraints.

<guess>MYOPY</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 3.
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, D, U, B, T, S, I, L.

A valid 5-letter word that has O in the third position, includes P elsewhere, and uses only the remaining letters is:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and is likely to give us useful information regardless of the secret word. Words with common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T are good choices. 

Some popular starting words include:
- ""CRANE"" - covers common consonants and vowels
- ""SLATE"" - similar approach
- ""RAISE"" - good mix of vowels and consonants
- ""ADIEU"" - covers almost all vowels
- ""STARE"" - common letters

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give us good information about which of these letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in “CRANE” are ruled out: C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.  
Since we have zero hits, we should pivot to the next most common letters that were not used.  
Good candidates now: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P.

A solid opening pattern with completely fresh letters is:

S, T, O, I, L  → “STOIL” (valid English word, though uncommon)  
or  
S, T, I, L, U → “STILU” (invalid)  
or  
S, T, O, L, D → “STOLD” (invalid)  
or  
S, T, O, U, L → “STOUL” (invalid)

Among valid 5-letter English words that use none of C,R,A,N,E, “STOIC” or “SOULD” could work, but let’s pick the more common word “STOIC”:

S, T, O, I, C — but wait, C is already ruled out.  
Next best common valid word: “DOUBT” (D, O, U, B, T) — all fresh.

“DOUBT” gives us a strong new set of common consonants and a fresh vowel set.

Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, D, U, B, T  
Letters known to be in the word at least once: O (and it is NOT in position 2)
Remaining common letters not yet used: S, L, I, G, H, M, Y, P, F, K, W, V, X, Z, J, Q (but we’ll focus on the most common ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter O somewhere (and not in position 2)
- Uses none of the ruled-out letters
- Uses only the remaining letters

Let me pick a word with O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and see what happens. A good candidate is “SPOIL” — but S and P are still allowed, I and L are allowed, and O is allowed and not in position 2. Let me check if S, P, O, I, L are all unused so far:

- S: not used yet ✓
- P: not used yet ✓
- O: known to exist ✓ (and in “SPOIL” it is in position 3, so not disqualified)
- I: not used yet ✓
- L: not used yet ✓

- No other letters from the ruled-out set

Possible patterns: _ P O _ _, _ _ O P _, _ _ O _ P

- ""JPOXY"" - invalid

Not finding valid words here. Let's try _ _ O P _:
Third: O
Fourth: P
Possible words:
- ""GYMPO"" - invalid (G, Y, M, P, O) but P is in position 4 which is allowed
But is GYMPO a word? No.

""GYPO"" is 4 letters. Not helpful.

Let's try _ _ O _ P:
Third: O
Fifth: P
Possible words:
- ""GYKOP"" - invalid
- ""MYKOP"" - invalid
- ""FYKOP"" - invalid

This is tricky. Maybe look for actual valid words.

Looking at the pattern _ _ O _ P, with O in position 3 and P in position 5, and other letters from F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible valid word: ""GYROP"" - but is this a word? ""Gyrop"" is short for gyroscope but not standard.

Another pattern: _ P O _ _
Example: ""KIPPO"" - but I is ruled out.

Wait, let's list the allowed letters again:
Allowed: O (fixed pos 3), P (must appear), and others from F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting _ P O _ _ is ""KOPJE"" but E is ruled out.
Another: ""JOPPY"" - P in position 2, O position 3, Y in 5 - but is JOPPY a word? No.

Actually, the word ""KOPHY"" is not valid. Let's think of real words.

A valid word is ""GOPHY"" - no, not valid.

Alternative: ""MYOPY"" - a medical term for myopia. Is this valid? Yes, ""myopy"" is an archaic term for myopia.

But let's check letters:
M, Y, O, P, Y - all allowed (M, Y, O, P are unused; Y appears twice which is fine)
O is in position 3 (correct)
P is in position 4 (allowed, since P must be somewhere and this is position 4)

Thus, ""MYOPY"" fits all constraints.

<guess>MYOPY</guess>Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 3.
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, D, U, B, T, S, I, L.

A valid 5-letter word that has O in the third position, includes P elsewhere, and uses only the remaining letters is:

From the new feedback on MYOPY:

- Y(x) – Y is not in the word (and we already had I, L ruled out).
- O(✓) – O is in position 3 (confirmed again).
- P(-) – P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it is also not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 from all clues so far; therefore P must be in position 5).

Current knowns:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ P
- Allowed alphabet so far:
  – Definitely used: O (pos 3), P (pos 5)
  – Allowed but not yet placed: F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Z (every other letter tried so far is ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that ends “_ _ O _ P” using only these remaining consonants.

Scanning the dictionary for matches:

- F, G, H, J, K, V, W, Z plus O and P.
- Possible candidates:
  – “GHOJP” (invalid)
  – “KHOVP” (invalid)
  – “WHOOP” – uses two O’s, but the second O would have to be allowed (O is allowed but we have no restriction on duplicates).  “WHOOP” is a valid English word and satisfies:
      W(allowed, new), H(allowed, new), O(pos 3), O(allowed duplicate), P(pos 5).

“WHOOP” fits every constraint:
