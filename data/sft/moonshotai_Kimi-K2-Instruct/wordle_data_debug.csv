For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words are those with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. A classic strong first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters in English words. However, another good option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. It contains the common combination ""ATE"" 
3. It has L which is also frequent
4. This gives good coverage of consonants and vowels

Let me go with SLATE as my first guess to get broad information about the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word, but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but **not** in the 5th position.
- Does **not** contain S, L, A, or T.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last slot.
2. Does not use any of the eliminated letters S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, D, C, H, M, B, G, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (E is already known to be present).

Possible candidates:
- ""REIGN"" – has E in 2nd, but uses N and G which are common.
- ""NERVE"" – has two E’s, good because we know E is in word.
- ""CHIME"" – has E in 5th (but we know E is not in 5th), so no.
- ""MERRY"" – has E in 2nd, but double R might be too specific.

""NERVE"" seems like a strong choice: uses E twice (one must be in correct spot), and uses common letters N, R, V which haven’t been tested yet.

1. Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, N, R, V, F, Y  
   Forbidden alphabet so far: A, F, L, N, R, S, T, V, Y

2. Two E’s must appear in the word, because:
   - Guess 2 (NERVE) showed E(✓) in position 2 and an extra E(-) elsewhere.  
   - Guess 3 (BEEFY) again showed E(✓) in position 2 and an extra E(-) elsewhere (position 3 in that guess).  
   Therefore the word definitely has an E in position 2 and at least one more E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

3. Letters still usable: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus the already-known E).

4. We have the pattern: _ E _ _ _ with another E somewhere else.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies:
- E in position 2
- At least one more E in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- No forbidden letters (A, F, L, N, R, S, T, V, Y)

Let’s list the most common English words fitting that pattern and check if they avoid the forbidden letters:

- CHEEP – C, H, P allowed, but P is fine. Uses E in 1 and 2: good.
- DEEP? – D, P allowed. Needs another E: DEEPS (but S is forbidden). DEEPD isn’t a word.
- GEESE – G allowed, but second S is forbidden.  
- KEEPS – S is forbidden.  
- MEETS – S is forbidden.  
- PEEP? – P allowed, but PEP is only 3 letters. PEEP needs another letter.  
- CHEEP looks good and is a valid word.

CHEEP:
- C, H, E, E, P – none of the letters are in the forbidden list.
- Positions: _ E _ _ _ (E in 2), plus another E in 3.  
It also tests C and H, two new letters.

Another candidate could be “GEEKY” but Y is forbidden.  
“DEED” is too short, “MEEK” is 4 letters.  
“CHEEP” seems the only common 5-letter word left under the constraints.

Therefore: CHEEP.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Common starting words are those with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. A classic strong first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters in English words. However, another good option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. It contains the common combination ""ATE"" 
3. It has L which is also frequent
4. This gives good coverage of consonants and vowels

Let me go with SLATE as my first guess to get broad information about the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word, but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but **not** in the 5th position.
- Does **not** contain S, L, A, or T.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last slot.
2. Does not use any of the eliminated letters S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, D, C, H, M, B, G, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (E is already known to be present).

Possible candidates:
- ""REIGN"" – has E in 2nd, but uses N and G which are common.
- ""NERVE"" – has two E’s, good because we know E is in word.
- ""CHIME"" – has E in 5th (but we know E is not in 5th), so no.
- ""MERRY"" – has E in 2nd, but double R might be too specific.

""NERVE"" seems like a strong choice: uses E twice (one must be in correct spot), and uses common letters N, R, V which haven’t been tested yet.

Guess 2: NERVE -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(✓) R(x) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:

- First E in position 2 is CORRECT (✓). So the word has pattern: _ E _ _ _
- Second E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since position 2 is already correct, this means the second E must appear elsewhere in the word (it can’t be in position 5 because we saw that from SLATE).

Also recall:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (from SLATE).
- So current constraints:
  – Pattern: _ E _ _ _
  – Contains at least one more E besides position 2
  – Cannot use S, L, A, T, N, R, V

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with E in position 2 and at least one more E somewhere else, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""BEECH"" – has E in 2 and 3, but uses C and H which are untested.
- ""DEEDS"" – has E in 2 and 4, but S is eliminated.
- ""GEESE"" – has E in 2, 3, 5, but S is eliminated.
- ""METER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""FEWER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""PEEVE"" – V is eliminated.
- ""CHEEP"" – P is allowed, but C and H are allowed. However, we have no info on them yet.
- ""BEEFY"" – F and Y are allowed.

""BEEFY"" seems good: E in 2, another E in 3, avoids all eliminated letters, and tests B, F, Y.

Another option is ""MEEKS"" – but S is eliminated.
""GEEKY"" – G, K, Y are allowed, E in 2 and 3.

I think ""BEEFY"" is the most straightforward choice here.

But wait, let me double-check: BEEFY has letters B, E, E, F, Y. All letters are allowed (not in x list), and has E in 2 and E in 3.

Let’s update everything we now know.

Forbidden letters (x so far):  
A, C, F, H, L, N, P, R, S, T, V, Y  
(alphabetically: A, C, F, H, L, N, P, R, S, T, V, Y)

We also have two E’s in the word, because each guess that gave two E’s confirms an extra one:
- Guess 2 (NERVE) → E(✓) in position 2 and another E(-) elsewhere.  
- Guess 3 (BEEFY) → E(✓) in position 2 and another E(-) elsewhere (position 3).  
- Guess 4 (CHEEP) → both E’s now marked (-), meaning they are in the word but **not** in positions 3 or 4 (since CHEEP showed E(-) in positions 3 and 4).

So the word must contain:
- E in position 2 (✓)  
- At least one more E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, **but** from CHEEP we now know positions 3 and 4 are **not** where that extra E sits.  
Therefore the only remaining possible positions for the extra E are 1 or 5.

Current pattern possibilities:
- E E _ _ _  (extra E in position 1)  
- _ E _ _ E  (extra E in position 5)  

Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z, plus the two E’s.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
1. Has E in position 2.  
2. Has another E in position 1 or 5.  
3. Uses only the allowed letters above.

Let’s test both patterns.

Pattern E E _ _ _  
Common English words: EE is rare at start. Possibles:  
- EERIE – but R and I: R is forbidden.  
- EEJIT – J is allowed, but I allowed? I is allowed. But EEJIT is slang (often considered valid in Scrabble/Wordle).  
- EEKED – K, D allowed, but D is allowed. However EEKED uses K and D, but ends with D which is allowed. Let’s check letters: E, E, K, E, D. All letters allowed.  
But wait, we need exactly two E’s? No, word can have more than two. But we know at least two E’s. EEKED has three E’s, which is extra information.  

Pattern _ E _ _ E  
Let’s consider:  
- D E E D E – DEEDE is not a word.  
- M E E K E – MEEK? too short.

- B E E D E – BEEDE? Not a standard word.  
- M E D G E – only one E.  
- J E E P E – no.  

Actually the most common word left seems to be EERIE, but R is forbidden.  
EEKED is a valid word (past tense of eek). It has:
- E(1), E(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).  
All letters E, K, D are allowed.  
It tests K and D, which are new.  

Another option: EERED (like “e’er” with past tense? not standard).  
EEKED seems the only plausible 5-letter word.  

But let me double-check:  
EEKED – E, E, K, E, D  
Letters used: E, K, D – all allowed.  
Positions: E(1), E(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).  
But we know from CHEEP that an E in position 4 would have been marked (-) if it were in word but not in position 4. CHEEP showed E(-) in position 4, so E is **not** in position 4. Therefore EEKED would have E in position 4 which is now known to be invalid. So EEKED is **invalid**.

Therefore the extra E must be in position 1 or 5, and other positions must avoid E.  

Let’s try pattern _ E _ _ E (extra E at 5).  
Candidate words:

Actually, the only valid common word left is:  
J E E Z E – but that’s slang.  
B E E D E – not a word.  
D E E D E – not a word.  

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word has exactly two E’s, one fixed at position 2, and the other at position 5.  
So pattern: _ E _ _ E  
Letters allowed: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

- B E D G E seems the closest valid word.  

BEDGE has:
- B, E, D, G, E – all letters allowed.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words are those with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. A classic strong first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters in English words. However, another good option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. 

I think ""SLATE"" is slightly better because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. It contains the common combination ""ATE"" 
3. It has L which is also frequent
4. This gives good coverage of consonants and vowels

Let me go with SLATE as my first guess to get broad information about the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word, but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but **not** in the 5th position.
- Does **not** contain S, L, A, or T.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last slot.
2. Does not use any of the eliminated letters S, L, A, T.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, D, C, H, M, B, G, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (E is already known to be present).

Possible candidates:
- ""REIGN"" – has E in 2nd, but uses N and G which are common.
- ""NERVE"" – has two E’s, good because we know E is in word.
- ""CHIME"" – has E in 5th (but we know E is not in 5th), so no.
- ""MERRY"" – has E in 2nd, but double R might be too specific.

""NERVE"" seems like a strong choice: uses E twice (one must be in correct spot), and uses common letters N, R, V which haven’t been tested yet.

<guess>NERVE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: NERVE -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(✓) R(x) V(x) E(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback:
- N, R, V are NOT in the word (x).
- First E in position 2 is CORRECT (✓). So the word has pattern: _ E _ _ _
- Second E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since position 2 is already correct, this means the second E must appear elsewhere in the word (it can’t be in position 5 because we saw that from SLATE).

Also recall:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (from SLATE).
- So current constraints:
  – Pattern: _ E _ _ _
  – Contains at least one more E besides position 2
  – Cannot use S, L, A, T, N, R, V

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with E in position 2 and at least one more E somewhere else, avoiding all eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""BEECH"" – has E in 2 and 3, but uses C and H which are untested.
- ""DEEDS"" – has E in 2 and 4, but S is eliminated.
- ""GEESE"" – has E in 2, 3, 5, but S is eliminated.
- ""METER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""FEWER"" – R is eliminated.
- ""PEEVE"" – V is eliminated.
- ""CHEEP"" – P is allowed, but C and H are allowed. However, we have no info on them yet.
- ""BEEFY"" – F and Y are allowed.

""BEEFY"" seems good: E in 2, another E in 3, avoids all eliminated letters, and tests B, F, Y.

Another option is ""MEEKS"" – but S is eliminated.
""GEEKY"" – G, K, Y are allowed, E in 2 and 3.

I think ""BEEFY"" is the most straightforward choice here.

But wait, let me double-check: BEEFY has letters B, E, E, F, Y. All letters are allowed (not in x list), and has E in 2 and E in 3.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Let's extract everything we now know.

1. Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, N, R, V, F, Y  
   Forbidden alphabet so far: A, F, L, N, R, S, T, V, Y

2. Two E’s must appear in the word, because:
   - Guess 2 (NERVE) showed E(✓) in position 2 and an extra E(-) elsewhere.  
   - Guess 3 (BEEFY) again showed E(✓) in position 2 and an extra E(-) elsewhere (position 3 in that guess).  
   Therefore the word definitely has an E in position 2 and at least one more E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

3. Letters still usable: B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus the already-known E).

4. We have the pattern: _ E _ _ _ with another E somewhere else.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies:
- E in position 2
- At least one more E in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- No forbidden letters (A, F, L, N, R, S, T, V, Y)

Let’s list the most common English words fitting that pattern and check if they avoid the forbidden letters:

- CHEEP – C, H, P allowed, but P is fine. Uses E in 1 and 2: good.
- DEEP? – D, P allowed. Needs another E: DEEPS (but S is forbidden). DEEPD isn’t a word.
- GEESE – G allowed, but second S is forbidden.  
- KEEPS – S is forbidden.  
- MEETS – S is forbidden.  
- PEEP? – P allowed, but PEP is only 3 letters. PEEP needs another letter.  
- CHEEP looks good and is a valid word.

CHEEP:
- C, H, E, E, P – none of the letters are in the forbidden list.
- Positions: _ E _ _ _ (E in 2), plus another E in 3.  
It also tests C and H, two new letters.

Another candidate could be “GEEKY” but Y is forbidden.  
“DEED” is too short, “MEEK” is 4 letters.  
“CHEEP” seems the only common 5-letter word left under the constraints.

Therefore: CHEEP.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know after five guesses.

Forbidden letters (have been marked x):  
A, C, F, H, L, N, P, R, S, T, V, Y

Letters definitely present (from the two E marks):  
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- A second E must appear somewhere else (always marked –).  
  After BEDGE we see E(-) in positions 3, 4, 5, so we now know the second E cannot be in 3, 4, or 5.  
  Therefore the second E **must** be in position 1.

Hence the hidden word pattern is locked:  
E E _ _ _

Allowed letters for the remaining three blanks (positions 3-5):  
B, D, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z

Also, those three letters must all be distinct (the word has exactly five letters total, only two of which are E).

We need a common 5-letter English word matching E E _ _ _ with no forbidden letters and no duplicates among the last three letters.

Possible candidates and quick checks:
- EEKED – but we already ruled E at 4.  
- EERIE – R and I: R is forbidden.  
- EEJIT – J and I allowed. Valid slang/dictionary word.  
- EEKER – R forbidden.  
- EEWOK – not a word.  
- EELIX – not a word.  
- EEWED – W allowed, D allowed, but E at 4 again.  

The only remaining plausible, dictionary-valid word is:
