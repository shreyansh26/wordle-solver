- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses a variety of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good options are:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that should give us good information regardless of the secret word.

All five letters in CRANE—C, R, A, N, E—have been marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That removes a large chunk of the alphabet.  
Looking at the remaining common consonants and vowels, good letters still in play include:  
S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F  
A strong second guess should test several completely fresh, high-frequency letters.  
Top candidates:  
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) – hits S, L, U, M, P  
- SPLIT (S, P, L, I, T) – hits S, P, L, I, T  
- FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) – hits F, O, I, S, T  

Among these, SPLIT uses five fresh high-frequency letters and avoids any known exclusions.

Current status:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (from earlier feedback):
C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T, G, U, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
L and I (each has been marked “-” twice, so we know they appear, but we have not yet placed them correctly).

So the secret word contains both L and I, and every other letter must come only from the remaining alphabet that has never been tested: B, F, H, K, M, O, W, Y (plus L and I).

We also learned placements:

• In GUILD, the I was in position 3 (marked “-”), so I is NOT in position 3.
• In GUILD, the L was in position 4 (marked “-”), so L is NOT in position 4.
• In SPLIT, the L was in position 3 (marked “-”), so L is NOT in position 3.
• In SPLIT, the I was in position 4 (marked “-”), so I is NOT in position 4.

Therefore:
I cannot be in position 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5.
L cannot be in position 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

Next guess should use both I and L, place them in one of the still-possible positions, and fill the remaining three slots with untested letters (from B, F, H, K, M, O, W, Y).

A simple, high-frequency combination is:

BLOWY → uses B, L, O, W, Y (all untested except L) and places L in position 2 and I is not used, so this is not ideal.

BLIMP → uses B, L, I, M, P (but P is already excluded).

FILMY → misses L.

FLIMY → uses F, L, I, M, Y.
Positions:
F(1) L(2) I(3) M(4) Y(5)
Check constraints:
I must not be in position 3 (from GUILD) → conflict.

FLIMY is invalid because I would be in position 3.

WIMBY → L is missing.

Let’s try a word that places I in position 1 and L in position 2, and uses three fresh letters:

I L _ _ _

We need three more letters from {B, F, H, K, M, O, W, Y}.  
A simple choice is I L B O W → but that’s five letters: I L B O W forms the word BLOWI (not a word).  

Reordering: use B, I, L, O, W to make B I L O W → BILOW (not valid).

F, I, L, M, Y → FILMY (L and I present but L is in position 3? No, L is in position 3 in FILMY – forbidden.

Another approach: choose a valid dictionary word that contains both I and L, uses only untested letters, and respects the positional bans.

Valid candidates:
- FLIMY (invalid – I in pos 3)
- LIMBO → letters L, I, M, B, O.  Positions: L(1), I(2), M(3), B(4), O(5)
  - I is in position 2 – allowed (only banned from 3 and 4)
  - L is in position 1 – allowed (only banned from 3 and 4)
  - All other letters (M, B, O) have never been tried → meets every constraint.

Let’s choose LIMBO.
