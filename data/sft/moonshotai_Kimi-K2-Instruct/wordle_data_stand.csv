- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For a first guess in Wordle, it's generally optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good variety of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain regardless of the secret word. Some popular starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

We’ve already learned:

- A is in position 3 (✓).
- N is in position 4 (✓).
- C, R, E are NOT in the word at all (x).

We still need to find letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

Good next letters to test are common consonants and remaining vowels that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common vowels are I, O, U (A and E already ruled out). Common consonants we haven’t tried yet include S, T, L, M, P, D, etc.

I’ll build a word that:
- keeps A in position 3 and N in position 4.
- avoids C, R, E.
- uses fresh common letters.

A solid candidate is “STAND”:
- S, T are new common consonants.
- A, N are confirmed in correct positions.
- D is another common consonant.

This tests S, T, D while preserving A and N.
