For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather good initial information. The best strategy is to pick a word with a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some good options include ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), or ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E).

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This should give me good coverage to start identifying letters in the secret word.

Feedback tells me:
- A is in the word (but not in position 3).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain A but none of S, L, T, E, and A is not in the third position.

Good next step is to try a word that:
1. Keeps A (and positions it differently).
2. Uses new common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E.

A solid choice is “CRANK” but that uses C, R, N, K. Since E is out and A must appear, another option is “RANCH” (R, A, N, C, H). This covers R, N, C, H plus the known A.

From the two rounds so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - C is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, N, H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A (in slot 2), C (somewhere else)
- Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, N, H

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but A is already in slot 2, so others might appear)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has C somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not already ruled out.

Possible patterns: C A _ _ _, _ A C _ _, _ A _ C _, _ A _ _ C

Let’s pick a word that places C in position 1 to test that possibility, using other common letters: CABIN (C, A, B, I, N). But N is already eliminated from round 2. Next choice: CAVID? Not valid. CADMI? Not valid. CAGED? G is okay, D is okay, E is eliminated. CABOT? O is okay. CAVIL? L is eliminated.

Good candidate: CAVIL – but L is eliminated. Next: CAVUM? U is okay, M is okay. CAVUM is valid.

But a more common word: CABIN has N (eliminated). CAGED has E (eliminated). CAMPO has P and O, both okay, and fits _ A C _ _ pattern.

Wait, let’s try C in position 3: _ A C _ _. Example: BACON – B, A, C, O, N. N is eliminated. LACON? L is eliminated. MACON? Same issue. PACER? R is eliminated.

Another approach: place C in position 5: _ A _ _ C. Example: BASIC – S, I, C. S is eliminated. MAGIC – M, A, G, I, C. All letters okay: M, A, G, I, C. None are in eliminated set.

Let’s check: MAGIC
- A in position 2: ✓
- C in position 5: new position, and we know C must be somewhere else than position 4: ✓
- M, G, I have not been tested yet and are not eliminated.

So MAGIC is a good next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather good initial information. The best strategy is to pick a word with a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some good options include ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), or ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E).

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This should give me good coverage to start identifying letters in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback tells me:
- A is in the word (but not in position 3).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain A but none of S, L, T, E, and A is not in the third position.

Good next step is to try a word that:
1. Keeps A (and positions it differently).
2. Uses new common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E.

A solid choice is “CRANK” but that uses C, R, N, K. Since E is out and A must appear, another option is “RANCH” (R, A, N, C, H). This covers R, N, C, H plus the known A.

I’ll go with “RANCH”.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - C is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, N, H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A (in slot 2), C (somewhere else)
- Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, N, H

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but A is already in slot 2, so others might appear)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has C somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not already ruled out.

Possible patterns: C A _ _ _, _ A C _ _, _ A _ C _, _ A _ _ C

Let’s pick a word that places C in position 1 to test that possibility, using other common letters: CABIN (C, A, B, I, N). But N is already eliminated from round 2. Next choice: CAVID? Not valid. CADMI? Not valid. CAGED? G is okay, D is okay, E is eliminated. CABOT? O is okay. CAVIL? L is eliminated.

Good candidate: CAVIL – but L is eliminated. Next: CAVUM? U is okay, M is okay. CAVUM is valid.

But a more common word: CABIN has N (eliminated). CAGED has E (eliminated). CAMPO has P and O, both okay, and fits _ A C _ _ pattern.

Wait, let’s try C in position 3: _ A C _ _. Example: BACON – B, A, C, O, N. N is eliminated. LACON? L is eliminated. MACON? Same issue. PACER? R is eliminated.

Another approach: place C in position 5: _ A _ _ C. Example: BASIC – S, I, C. S is eliminated. MAGIC – M, A, G, I, C. All letters okay: M, A, G, I, C. None are in eliminated set.

Let’s check: MAGIC
- A in position 2: ✓
- C in position 5: new position, and we know C must be somewhere else than position 4: ✓
- M, G, I have not been tested yet and are not eliminated.

So MAGIC is a good next guess.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,macaw,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather good initial information. The best strategy is to pick a word with a mix of vowels and common consonants. Some good options include ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), or ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E).

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This should give me good coverage to start identifying letters in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Feedback tells me:
- A is in the word (but not in position 3).
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word must contain A but none of S, L, T, E, and A is not in the third position.

Good next step is to try a word that:
1. Keeps A (and positions it differently).
2. Uses new common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.).
3. Avoids any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E.

A solid choice is “CRANK” but that uses C, R, N, K. Since E is out and A must appear, another option is “RANCH” (R, A, N, C, H). This covers R, N, C, H plus the known A.

I’ll go with “RANCH”.

<guess>RANCH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the two rounds so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - C is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, N, H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A (in slot 2), C (somewhere else)
- Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, N, H

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but A is already in slot 2, so others might appear)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has C somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not already ruled out.

Possible patterns: C A _ _ _, _ A C _ _, _ A _ C _, _ A _ _ C

Let’s pick a word that places C in position 1 to test that possibility, using other common letters: CABIN (C, A, B, I, N). But N is already eliminated from round 2. Next choice: CAVID? Not valid. CADMI? Not valid. CAGED? G is okay, D is okay, E is eliminated. CABOT? O is okay. CAVIL? L is eliminated.

Good candidate: CAVIL – but L is eliminated. Next: CAVUM? U is okay, M is okay. CAVUM is valid.

But a more common word: CABIN has N (eliminated). CAGED has E (eliminated). CAMPO has P and O, both okay, and fits _ A C _ _ pattern.

Wait, let’s try C in position 3: _ A C _ _. Example: BACON – B, A, C, O, N. N is eliminated. LACON? L is eliminated. MACON? Same issue. PACER? R is eliminated.

Another approach: place C in position 5: _ A _ _ C. Example: BASIC – S, I, C. S is eliminated. MAGIC – M, A, G, I, C. All letters okay: M, A, G, I, C. None are in eliminated set.

Let’s check: MAGIC
- A in position 2: ✓
- C in position 5: new position, and we know C must be somewhere else than position 4: ✓
- M, G, I have not been tested yet and are not eliminated.

So MAGIC is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RANCH -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
Guess 3: MAGIC -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) G(x) I(x) C(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Collecting all feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – A is present but not in position 3.
   – S, L, T, E are absent.

2. RANCH → R(x) A(✓) N(x) C(-) H(x)
   – A is now locked in position 2.
   – C is present but not in position 4.
   – R, N, H are absent.

3. MAGIC → M(✓) A(✓) G(x) I(x) C(-)
   – M is now locked in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – C is still somewhere but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it was “-” in both RANCH and MAGIC).
   – G, I are absent.

Current certain letters & positions:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- C must be in position 3 (the only remaining slot for it).

So the pattern is M A C _ _ and we still need two more letters.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (from the English alphabet minus eliminated letters S,L,T,E,R,N,H,G,I).

Common consonants left: B, D, F, K, P.

We need two consonants in positions 4 and 5. A common word fitting M A C _ _ is M A C K S, but S is eliminated. Next is M A C K O – but that’s not a standard English word. M A C E D – E is eliminated. M A C A U – A already used twice? Not allowed since letters can repeat in Wordle, but we have no info suggesting double A.

Another valid word: M A C K S – S is out. M A C H O – H is out. M A C A O – A twice, but no evidence for it.

Next simple option: M A C K Y – Y is allowed. It’s a recognized word (informal for “mechanical” or a person’s name).

Let’s choose M A C K Y.
