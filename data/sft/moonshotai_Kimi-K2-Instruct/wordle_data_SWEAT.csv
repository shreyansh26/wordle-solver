For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on arose:
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R, O are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So the secret word contains: A, S, E (each somewhere other than their original spots), and two letters not yet revealed. R and O are excluded.

Positions so far:
1: not A, not R, not O
2: not R, not O (but could hold A, S, E)
3: not R, not O (but could hold A, S, E)
4: not S, not R, not O (but could hold A, E)
5: not E, not R, not O (but could hold A, S)

I need a word that:
- includes A, S, E (but each in new spots)
- excludes R and O
- uses three unknown (but common) letters

High-frequency remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, G, B, M, P, H.

I’ll place A in a central position, move S earlier, and E earlier as well. A candidate that fits is ""STEAL"":
- S moves to position 1 (allowed, since S was only forbidden at 4)
- T is a common new consonant
- E moves to position 3 (allowed, since E was only forbidden at 5)
- A moves to position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden at 1)
- L is a common new consonant

STEAL uses A, S, E in new positions, avoids R and O, and adds two likely consonants T and L.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, S, E are all in the word but not in the positions guessed.
   - Letters not in the word: R, O.

2. steal → S(✓) T(-) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   - S is now known to be the first letter (position 1).
   - E is now known to be the third letter (position 3).
   - A is now known to be the fourth letter (position 4).
   - L is NOT in the word.
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.

So far we have:
- Word pattern: S _ E A _
- Letters known to be used: S, E, A, and T (in some position other than 2)
- Letters NOT used: R, O, L

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, has E in position 3 and A in position 4, contains T somewhere (but not in position 2), and does not use R, O, L.

Let's think of possible letters for positions 2 and 5:
- Position 2: cannot be T, R, O, L. Possible: N, D, G, B, C, M, F, etc.
- Position 5: cannot be E, R, O, L. Possible: N, D, G, B, C, M, F, S, T (but T might be here), etc.

Given that T must appear somewhere, let's try placing T in position 5:
S _ E A T

Common letters for position 2: N, D, G, B, etc.
Possible words:
- SN EAT → SNEAT (not a valid word)
- SD EAT → SDEAT (not valid)
- SG EAT → SGEAT (not valid)
- SB EAT → SBEAT (not valid)
- SM EAT → SMEAT (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let's try placing T in position 2 (but feedback says T is not in position 2), so that's invalid.

Since T must appear and position 2 is excluded, and position 5 seems problematic with T, maybe T is elsewhere. But positions 1,3,4 are taken by S,E,A respectively, so T must be in position 2 or 5, but 2 is excluded. This suggests T must be in position 5, but as we saw, that doesn't make valid words.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine: the feedback says T is in the word but not in position 2. That means T could be in position 5. Are there valid 5-letter words starting with S, having E in 3, A in 4, and T in 5?

Yes! ""SKEAT"" - but that's not a common word. ""SPEAT"" - no. ""SWEAT"" - yes, that's valid.

Let's check:
S W E A T
- Starts with S (correct position 1)
- E in position 3 (correct)
- A in position 4 (correct)
- T in position 5 (allowed, since T is not excluded from position 5)
- W is a new letter not yet tested
- Doesn't use R, O, L

This seems to fit all constraints.
