For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives a good spread across the alphabet to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. I need a 5-letter word that uses several of these. 

Good candidates include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it uses the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. However, ""STARE"" is also excellent as it covers the most frequent letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a nice vowel-consonant balance.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → none of these letters are in the secret word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 2nd in AROSE).

So the word:

- does NOT contain A, O, S, or E

That leaves consonants and remaining vowels. Possible vowels left: I, U, Y. Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

- BURNT → B, U, R, N, T (T eliminated) – no

From the feedback:

- MURKY gave: M(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

Meaning:
- U is in the word and is in the second position (position 2).
- R is in the word and is in the third position (position 3).
- Y is in the word and is in the fifth position (position 5).
- M and K are not in the word.

So far, the word structure is:
- _ U R _ Y

Letters already ruled out:
A, O, S, E, I, G, H, T, M, K

Remaining letters to consider (common ones):
B, C, D, F, J, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters that are not eliminated.

Looking at common combinations, possible choices for position 1 and 4:

Position 1: B, C, D, F, L, N, P, V, W
Position 4: B, C, D, F, L, N, P, V, W (but different from position 1 if no repeats)

Common words that fit _ U R _ Y:

- BURDY (but BURDY is not a common word)
- CURVY (but V is in position 4, but Y is already at 5, so CURVY is not _ U R _ Y)
- FURRY (but double R is possible, but R is already at 3)
- LURCH (but structure is _ U R _ Y)
- NURDY (not a word)
- PURFY (not a word)
- CURLY (C, U, R, L, Y) – fits perfectly: C _ U R L Y – but position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, matches _ U R _ Y.

Wait, let's check CURLY:

C U R L Y:
- Position 1: C (not eliminated)
- Position 2: U (matches ✓)
- Position 3: R (matches ✓)
- Position 4: L (not eliminated)
- Position 5: Y (matches ✓)

CURLY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another possible is BURLY (B, U, R, L, Y), but we already considered MURKY and BURLY earlier, and B is allowed, but let's see if CURLY is better.

Both CURLY and BURLY fit, but since we haven't tried C yet, CURLY seems a good next guess.

However, we need to check if any letters in CURLY have been eliminated: C, U, R, L, Y – none are eliminated (only M, K, A, O, S, E, I, G, H, T are out).

So CURLY is valid.

But wait, let's also think of other possibilities to maximize information. Maybe DURLY, FURLY, PURLY, but DURLY and FURLY are not common words. PURLY is also not common. So CURLY or BURLY seem best.

I'll go with CURLY as it introduces C.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. I need a 5-letter word that uses several of these. 

Good candidates include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it uses the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. However, ""STARE"" is also excellent as it covers the most frequent letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a nice vowel-consonant balance.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → none of these letters are in the secret word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 2nd in AROSE).

So the word:
- definitely contains R
- does NOT contain A, O, S, or E

That leaves consonants and remaining vowels. Possible vowels left: I, U, Y. Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

Since R must be somewhere else, we need a 5-letter word that has R in a different position (not 2nd) and none of A, O, S, E.

Good starting choices for 2nd guess: words that use remaining common consonants and vowels. Let's try ""TRIUM"" (T, R, I, U, M), but T and U are good. However, ""TRIUM"" is not a valid word. Another option is ""RIGHT"" (R, I, G, H, T). 

Let's pick ""RIGHT"" as it's a valid word and uses common letters R, I, G, H, T. Here:
- R moves from 2nd to 1st position (satisfying the feedback)
- Contains I (remaining vowel)
- Uses common consonants G, H, T
- Avoids A, O, S, E

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, I, G, H, T
2. Letter R is in the word but NOT in position 1 or position 2 (because it was in position 2 in AROSE and position 1 in RIGHT, both marked “-”).
3. Therefore R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Vowels still available: U, Y  
Consonants still available (among common ones): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

I want a word that
- has R in position 3, 4, or 5  
- contains none of the eliminated letters  
- preferably uses remaining high-frequency consonants (L, N, D, C, M, K, B) and the vowel U.

A short brainstorm of valid, common words that fit:
- CURBS → C, U, R, B, S (S is eliminated) – no
- PURGE → P, U, R, G, E (G, E eliminated) – no  
- BURNT → B, U, R, N, T (T eliminated) – no  
- DRUNK → D, R, U, N, K – all letters allowed so far, and R is in position 2 here – no (R can’t be 2)  
- CRUMB → C, R, U, M, B – R is in position 2 – no  
- FURRY → F, U, R, R, Y – double R is possible, but R can’t be in 2 – no  
- BURLY → B, U, R, L, Y – R in position 3 – OK  
- CURVY → C, U, R, V, Y – R in position 3 – OK  
- MURKY → M, U, R, K, Y – R in position 3 – OK

Among these, BURLY, CURVY, MURKY all fit. I’ll choose MURKY because M, K, Y are still very common, and it satisfies every constraint.

Position 4: B, C, D, F, L, N, P, V, W (but different from position 1 if no repeats)

Common words that fit _ U R _ Y:

- FURRY (but double R is possible, but R is already at 3)
- LURCH (but structure is _ U R _ Y)
- NURDY (not a word)
- PURFY (not a word)
- CURLY (C, U, R, L, Y) – fits perfectly: C _ U R L Y – but position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, matches _ U R _ Y.

- Position 1: C (not eliminated)
- Position 2: U (matches ✓)
- Position 3: R (matches ✓)
- Position 4: L (not eliminated)

CURLY is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another possible is BURLY (B, U, R, L, Y), but we already considered MURKY and BURLY earlier, and B is allowed, but let's see if CURLY is better.

Both CURLY and BURLY fit, but since we haven't tried C yet, CURLY seems a good next guess.

However, we need to check if any letters in CURLY have been eliminated: C, U, R, L, Y – none are eliminated (only M, K, A, O, S, E, I, G, H, T are out).

From all the feedback so far:

Letters that are OUT:  
A, O, S, E, I, G, H, T, M, K, C, L

Confirmed letters and positions:  
- U is at position 2  
- R is at position 3  
- Y is at position 5  

So the secret word has the pattern: ? U R ? Y

Letters still allowed for the unknown spots (pos 1 & 4):  
B, D, F, J, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word matching “_ U R _ Y”.

Scanning the remaining possibilities:

1st letter candidates: B, D, F, N, P, V  
4th letter candidates: B, D, F, N, P, V (can be same or different)

Common valid words:
- BURPY – but BURPY is not a recognized word  
- FURRY – double R; R is already fixed at 3, so second R would have to appear again at 4: F U R R Y – valid word  
- PURRY – same as above, P U R R Y – valid word  
- DURRY – not a standard word  
- NURDY – not a standard word  
- VURRY – not a standard word  

The only clearly common, valid words left are FURRY and PURRY.

Between them, F and P are both unused so far; we’ll pick FURRY first.

F U R R Y:
- F (new letter)  
- U (confirms pos 2)  
- R (confirms pos 3)  
- R (second R at pos 4)  
- Y (confirms pos 5)

Fits every constraint.
