For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
2. Uses a variety of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to test more letters)

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- OATER (O, A, T, E, R)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
- No repeated letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

So far we know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves us with the letters we haven’t tested yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word does NOT contain any of the letters C, A, N, E.

Since R is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 2nd position, we should include R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Includes R in a new position (let’s try position 1 or 3)
2. Uses new common consonants we haven’t tested (like S, T, L)
3. Uses new vowels (only vowels left are I, O, U, Y)

Let’s try ""SPORT"":
- S: new

We have three solid facts now:

1. Positions already fixed:  
   - 2nd letter = U (✓)  
   - 4th letter = R (✓)  
   - 5th letter = Y (✓)

2. Letters completely ruled out so far:  
   C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, D

3. Remaining positions to fill: 1st and 3rd.

Available (untested) letters include: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the vowels I and (possibly) others in unexpected spots.

Because the word already has U and Y, it’s very likely that positions 1 and 3 will be consonants.

We still need to test common consonants that haven’t appeared: F, G, H, L, M, etc.

Let’s try “FLURY”:
- F – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- R – already ✓ in position 4
- Y – already ✓ in position 5

But we really only need to fill positions 1 and 3, so the best word is one that keeps U (2), R (4), Y (5) and inserts two new, untested consonants in 1 and 3.

A good candidate is “HUMPY”:
- H – new
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- M – new
- P – already ruled out (x in SPORT)
  
Oops, P is out. Let’s pick “LUMPY” instead:
- L – new
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- M – new
- P – ruled out again.

Try “FURZY” – but Z is rare and we already have URY fixed.

A more straightforward word is “FURRY”, but RR is a double letter and we already know R is only in position 4.

Let’s use “GUMMY” – again P was out; no good.

The simplest way is to slot two fresh consonants into 1 and 3 while keeping the fixed URY.

So the best test word is “HUMPY” – wait P is out – how about “FUNKY”?  K is new, N is ruled out.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ U _ R Y with only the untested letters in spots 1 & 3.

Possible letters for 1 & 3: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and no repeats).

A valid English word fitting the mask is “FURRY” but repeats R (disallowed).  
Another is “HURRY” – same problem.  
“LURGY” – G is new, L is new, fits the mask.

Therefore:

- 1st = L  
- 2nd = U (already ✓)  
- 3rd = G  
- 4th = R (already ✓)  
- 5th = Y (already ✓)

Word: L U G R Y → “LUGRY” – but that’s not a recognized English word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
2. Uses a variety of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to test more letters)

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- OATER (O, A, T, E, R)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
- No repeated letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves us with the letters we haven’t tested yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word does NOT contain any of the letters C, A, N, E.

Since R is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 2nd position, we should include R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Includes R in a new position (let’s try position 1 or 3)
2. Uses new common consonants we haven’t tested (like S, T, L)
3. Uses new vowels (only vowels left are I, O, U, Y)

Let’s try ""SPORT"":
- S: new
- P: new
- O: new vowel
- R: known to be in the word, now in position 4 (new position)
- T: new

This tests 5 new letters while repositioning R.

2. Letters completely ruled out so far: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

4. Letters not yet tested that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
5. We still need at least one vowel. The only vowels not yet ruled out are I, U, Y.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the 4th position.
- Uses only untested letters elsewhere.
- Includes a vowel (I, U, Y) to test vowel positions.

A good candidate is ""BURDY"":
- B: untested
- U: untested vowel (position 2)
- R: fixed in position 4 (✓)
- D: untested
- Y: untested vowel (position 5)

This tests U and Y as vowels while covering new consonants.

Oops, P is out. Let’s pick “LUMPY” instead:

Try “FURZY” – but Z is rare and we already have URY fixed.

A more straightforward word is “FURRY”, but RR is a double letter and we already know R is only in position 4.

Let’s use “GUMMY” – again P was out; no good.

A valid English word fitting the mask is “FURRY” but repeats R (disallowed).  
Another is “HURRY” – same problem.  
“LURGY” – G is new, L is new, fits the mask.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,furry,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Contains common letters to maximize information gain
2. Uses a variety of vowels and consonants
3. Doesn't repeat any letters (to test more letters)

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - very vowel-heavy
- OATER (O, A, T, E, R)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- Common vowels: A, E
- No repeated letters
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far we know:
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are NOT in the word at all.

That leaves us with the letters we haven’t tested yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know the word does NOT contain any of the letters C, A, N, E.

Since R is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 2nd position, we should include R in a new position (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

A good strategy is to use a word that:
1. Includes R in a new position (let’s try position 1 or 3)
2. Uses new common consonants we haven’t tested (like S, T, L)
3. Uses new vowels (only vowels left are I, O, U, Y)

Let’s try ""SPORT"":
- S: new
- P: new
- O: new vowel
- R: known to be in the word, now in position 4 (new position)
- T: new

This tests 5 new letters while repositioning R.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>What we now know from the two guesses:

1. R is in the word and is in the correct 4th position (R✓).
2. Letters completely ruled out so far: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.
3. Remaining positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 5 (with position 4 fixed as R).
4. Letters not yet tested that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
5. We still need at least one vowel. The only vowels not yet ruled out are I, U, Y.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the 4th position.
- Uses only untested letters elsewhere.
- Includes a vowel (I, U, Y) to test vowel positions.

A good candidate is ""BURDY"":
- B: untested
- U: untested vowel (position 2)
- R: fixed in position 4 (✓)
- D: untested
- Y: untested vowel (position 5)

This tests U and Y as vowels while covering new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: BURDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We have three solid facts now:

1. Positions already fixed:  
   - 2nd letter = U (✓)  
   - 4th letter = R (✓)  
   - 5th letter = Y (✓)

2. Letters completely ruled out so far:  
   C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, D

3. Remaining positions to fill: 1st and 3rd.

Available (untested) letters include: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the vowels I and (possibly) others in unexpected spots.

Because the word already has U and Y, it’s very likely that positions 1 and 3 will be consonants.

We still need to test common consonants that haven’t appeared: F, G, H, L, M, etc.

Let’s try “FLURY”:
- F – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- R – already ✓ in position 4
- Y – already ✓ in position 5

But we really only need to fill positions 1 and 3, so the best word is one that keeps U (2), R (4), Y (5) and inserts two new, untested consonants in 1 and 3.

A good candidate is “HUMPY”:
- H – new
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- M – new
- P – already ruled out (x in SPORT)
  
Oops, P is out. Let’s pick “LUMPY” instead:
- L – new
- U – already ✓ in position 2
- M – new
- P – ruled out again.

Try “FURZY” – but Z is rare and we already have URY fixed.

A more straightforward word is “FURRY”, but RR is a double letter and we already know R is only in position 4.

Let’s use “GUMMY” – again P was out; no good.

The simplest way is to slot two fresh consonants into 1 and 3 while keeping the fixed URY.

So the best test word is “HUMPY” – wait P is out – how about “FUNKY”?  K is new, N is ruled out.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ U _ R Y with only the untested letters in spots 1 & 3.

Possible letters for 1 & 3: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (and no repeats).

A valid English word fitting the mask is “FURRY” but repeats R (disallowed).  
Another is “HURRY” – same problem.  
“LURGY” – G is new, L is new, fits the mask.

Therefore:

- 1st = L  
- 2nd = U (already ✓)  
- 3rd = G  
- 4th = R (already ✓)  
- 5th = Y (already ✓)

Word: L U G R Y → “LUGRY” – but that’s not a recognized English word.  
Next: “LURGY” (British slang for sickness) is valid.

Let’s use that.

Guess 3: BURDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: LURGY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>We now know the exact pattern:

- Position 2 = U ✓  
- Position 4 = R ✓  
- Position 5 = Y ✓  

and the letters still available for positions 1 & 3 (all untested and not yet ruled out) are:
F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits the template:  
_  U  _  R  Y

Looking for real words fitting that structure, the most common candidate is “FURRY”, but it repeats R, which we already know is only in position 4.  
Other candidates: “MURKY”.

Check MURKY:
- M – untested  
- U – already ✓  
- R – ✓  
- K – untested  
- Y – ✓  

It’s a valid English word, uses only fresh letters for positions 1 & 3, and doesn’t repeat any ruled-out letters.

Excluded vowels: A, E, O  
Only vowels still possible: none left (I has never been used, but we already have U in position 2 and Y at 5, and a 5-letter word rarely needs three vowels).

Valid English words that fit the pattern _ U _ R Y with those remaining consonants:

– FURRY (invalid: double R)  
– V, J, Q, Z, W rarely combine with URY.  

The only remaining plausible real word is:
H U F R Y → “HUFRY” (invalid)  
F U J R Y → “FUJRY” (invalid)  

Wait, let’s list actual dictionary words again:
- JUROR (but doesn’t fit)  
- V, W, etc. do not give valid words.

Actually the correct word that fits and uses only remaining letters is “HURRY”. Even though it repeats R, we already know position 4 is R, and the first R in “HURRY” would be in position 1, which is allowed because we only know R is not excluded elsewhere, and the feedback never told us R only appears once. Repeating R is possible.

So next guess: H U R R Y.
