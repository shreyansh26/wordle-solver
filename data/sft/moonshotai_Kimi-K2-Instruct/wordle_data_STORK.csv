Since this is the first guess, I have no prior feedback to go off of. The optimal strategy for the first guess is to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to test their presence
- Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) to maximize elimination potential
- No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Popular high-information starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.  
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.  
- A(x) – A is not in the word.  
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 4.

1. The word starts with S.  
2. It does NOT contain L, A, or E.  
3. It contains T somewhere other than position 4.

To narrow down the remaining letters, I’ll pick a word that:
- Keeps S in position 1.  
- Moves T to a different spot (position 2, 3, or 5).  
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels not yet eliminated (I, O, U, N, R, M, etc.).

A good candidate is “STONY”:
- Keeps S in position 1.

And we know:
- L, A, E, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- T is in position 2 (confirmed).
- O is in position 3 (confirmed).

The pattern now is: S T O _ _

The remaining letters must be from the unused common letters. We have not yet tested I, U, R, C, H, P, M, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Z, Q, J, X.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The most common remaining letters are R, I, C, H, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that start with STO. Some possibilities:
- STORM
- STOIC
- STOKE
- STOLE
- STONE (but N is out)
- STOCK
- STOVE

STOIC is a good candidate: S T O I C. It uses I and C which are common and haven't been tested yet. Also, C is a common ending letter and we haven't tested I as a vowel in position 4.

Another good one is STORM, but M hasn't been tested and R is common. However, since we have S T O _ _, STORM would be S T O R M. 

STOIC seems slightly better because C is a strong consonant to test and I is a new vowel.

But let's consider STICK: S T I C K - but this would move O out of position 3, which we know is correct, so that's invalid.

STOCK: S T O C K - uses C and K, both common.

STOKE: S T O K E - but E is out.

STOCK is good, but STOIC is also good. 

Between STOIC and STORM, STOIC uses I and C which are fresh letters, while STORM uses R and M. Both are valid, but I'll go with STORM since M is less likely to be in the word based on frequency, but R is very common.

Wait, actually, looking at our remaining letters after eliminating A, E, L, N, Y, and having S, T, O confirmed, the remaining slots are 4 and 5.

STOIC: positions 4 and 5 are I and C.  
STORM: positions 4 and 5 are R and M.  

STOIC seems better as it tests I (new vowel) and C (common consonant). 

But let me think of other possibilities:
STUFF: but F is less common and we've seen no F yet.
STOMP: M is out (N is out, but M wasn't out - but we have no info on M)
STOCK: C and K - but K is less common than R.

Actually, STORM seems very likely since R is extremely common after STO. And M is a possible ending letter.

I think STORM is a strong next guess. 

But to maximize information, maybe STICK is wrong because it moves O. 

After careful consideration, STORM seems the most probable.

But the pattern is S T O _ _, and we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated. The remaining letters available are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common combinations after STO: 
- STORM (S T O R M)
- STOIC (S T O I C)
- STOKE (but E is out)
- STOCK (S T O C K)

Between STORM and STOIC, STORM uses R and M, both common. STOIC uses I and C. 

I think STORM is more likely because R is very common in position 4 after STO.

Therefore, my guess is STORM.

- O is in position 3 (confirmed).

The pattern now is: S T O _ _

The remaining letters must be from the unused common letters. We have not yet tested I, U, R, C, H, P, M, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Z, Q, J, X.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. The most common remaining letters are R, I, C, H, P, M, D, etc.

Let's think of 5-letter words that start with STO. Some possibilities:
- STORM
- STOIC
- STOKE
- STOLE
- STONE (but N is out)
- STOCK
- STOVE

STOIC is a good candidate: S T O I C. It uses I and C which are common and haven't been tested yet. Also, C is a common ending letter and we haven't tested I as a vowel in position 4.

Another good one is STORM, but M hasn't been tested and R is common. However, since we have S T O _ _, STORM would be S T O R M. 

STOIC seems slightly better because C is a strong consonant to test and I is a new vowel.

But let's consider STICK: S T I C K - but this would move O out of position 3, which we know is correct, so that's invalid.

STOCK: S T O C K - uses C and K, both common.

STOKE: S T O K E - but E is out.

STOCK is good, but STOIC is also good. 

Between STOIC and STORM, STOIC uses I and C which are fresh letters, while STORM uses R and M. Both are valid, but I'll go with STORM since M is less likely to be in the word based on frequency, but R is very common.

Wait, actually, looking at our remaining letters after eliminating A, E, L, N, Y, and having S, T, O confirmed, the remaining slots are 4 and 5.

STOIC: positions 4 and 5 are I and C.  
STORM: positions 4 and 5 are R and M.  

STOIC seems better as it tests I (new vowel) and C (common consonant). 

But let me think of other possibilities:
STUFF: but F is less common and we've seen no F yet.
STOMP: M is out (N is out, but M wasn't out - but we have no info on M)
STOCK: C and K - but K is less common than R.

Actually, STORM seems very likely since R is extremely common after STO. And M is a possible ending letter.

I think STORM is a strong next guess. 

But to maximize information, maybe STICK is wrong because it moves O. 

After careful consideration, STORM seems the most probable.

But the pattern is S T O _ _, and we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters not yet eliminated. The remaining letters available are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common combinations after STO: 
- STORM (S T O R M)
- STOIC (S T O I C)
- STOKE (but E is out)
- STOCK (S T O C K)

Between STORM and STOIC, STORM uses R and M, both common. STOIC uses I and C. 

I think STORM is more likely because R is very common in position 4 after STO.

Therefore, my guess is STORM.

From the latest feedback:

- S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)

So the pattern is now:

S T O R _

And we know the last letter is NOT M and also not any of: L, A, E, N, Y.

Letters still allowed (and not yet ruled out) for the 5th position:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding the already-eliminated ones).

Among these, the most common ending letters in 5-letter words are:  
C, D, K, H, P, B.

Looking at ""STOR"" + ?, the most common completions are:

- STORK (K is common)
- STORED (but that's 6 letters)
- STORY (Y is out)
- STORC (not a word)
- STORP (not a word)
- STORB (not a word)
- STORH (not a word)

The only valid common word is STORK.

STORK uses K, which hasn't been tested yet and is a common ending letter.

Therefore, my guess is STORK.
