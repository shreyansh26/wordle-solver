- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (common consonants C, R, N and vowels A, E)
- SLATE (S, L, T with vowels A, E)
- ADIEU (all vowels except O)
- ROATE (R, O, A, T, E - very common letters)

After considering these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, N, A, E) and is generally considered a strong opener that should help identify several letters quickly.

We need a word that:
1. Starts with DE.
2. Contains both I and T somewhere in the last three slots, respecting their position constraints.
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible positions for I: 3 or 5 (but not 4).
Possible positions for T: 3 or 4 (but not 2 or 5).

Let’s consider the combinations:

Case 1: I in position 3, T in position 4 → DE I T _ → needs a 5th letter. But we only have three slots left and need to place both I and T. Wait, positions are 3 and 4.

But DE I T _ would be 5 letters: D, E, I, T, and one more. But we need to fit both I and T into positions 3-5.

Let’s list possible arrangements:

- DE I T _ → but this is DEIT_ which needs a 5th letter, but I and T are already placed in 3 and 4. However, we need to ensure the word is valid. DEITY is the only common word here.

Check DEITY:
- D(✓), E(✓), I(-), T(-), Y (new).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since it can't be in 4).  
- T is in position 4 (allowed, since it can't be in 2 or 5).  
- Y is a new letter not yet tested.

DEITY seems valid and fits all constraints.

<guess>DEITY</guess>",DEITY,"From the latest feedback we now know:

- D is in the correct first position (✓).
- E is in the correct second position (✓).
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but is in the wrong position (-).
- T is in the word but is in the wrong position (-).

So far we have:

Word pattern: D E _ _ _

Letters still in play: I, T  
Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, B

Known positions:
- I cannot be in position 4.
- T cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Remaining letters to choose from (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the two known letters I and T.
