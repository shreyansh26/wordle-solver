For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that contains frequently used letters in English to maximize information gain. Good first guesses often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'm choosing ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for testing letters in the secret word.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the secret word must be made solely from the remaining 15 letters:

B C D F G H I J K L M N P Q T U V W X Y Z

To maximize information on the second guess, I should pick a word that uses five new, common letters not yet tried.  
The letters C, L, I, N, T, U, D, H, M, K, etc., are still available.

A strong second-guess choice is “CLINT” because it contains five high-frequency unused consonants and no vowels. That will quickly test which consonants are present. Another balanced option is “UNTIL” or “CHUNK”; I’ll go with “UNTIL” to mix three consonants with two new vowels (U, I) and gain more vowel coverage.

So the next guess will be: UNTIL

From the two guesses:
- AROSE (all letters marked x) ⇒ A, R, O, S, E are absent.
- UNTIL ⇒ U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) ⇒ U and N are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2; T, I, L are absent.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U and N which must appear somewhere.

Because U and N are both confirmed present but not in positions 1 or 2, we need placements where:
- U is in position 3, 4, or 5  
- N is in position 3, 4, or 5  

We also want to test new letters to narrow the pool quickly.  
A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “JUMPY”:  
- J, M, P, Y are fresh letters  
- U sits in position 2 (allowed because we only know it’s not in position 1)  
- N isn’t used, so we’ll still need to place N later, but this guess brings in four brand-new consonants to test.

This should give maximal information gain in the next step.

Summary so far:

Letters known to be absent:  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, J, M, Y

Letters known to be present:  
U and N, but neither can be in their previously-guessed positions.

From Guess 3 (JUMPY):
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be position 4).

Allowed letters (besides U and N):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere other than position 2 (and also not in position 1 from UNTIL).
3. Contains P somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Let’s list candidate patterns:

_ U _ _ _  (U fixed at position 2)

We need to insert N and P in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, avoiding their excluded spots, and pick the remaining letters from the allowed set.

Possible placements:
- N in 3, P in 1, 4, or 5
- N in 4, P in 1, 3, or 5
- N in 5, P in 1, 3, or 4

We also want high-frequency remaining letters for the remaining slots.

A convenient word that satisfies all these constraints is “BUMPY”, but M and Y are already out.  
Next candidate: “CUPID” – but I and D are allowed?  
Wait: I is out (from UNTIL: I(x)), so CUPID fails.

Another candidate: “DUMPY” – again, M and Y are out.

“PUNKY” – N is allowed, but Y is out.

“PUNCH” – H is still allowed.  
Check:  
- Positions: P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)  
- Does it meet all constraints?
  – U is in position 2: ✓  
  – N is in position 3 (allowed; it only couldn’t be 1 or 2): ✓  
  – P is in position 1 (allowed; it only couldn’t be 4): ✓  
  – All letters are from the still-allowed set: P, U, N, C, H – none have been ruled out.

This fits perfectly. So the next logical guess is PUNCH.

<guess>PUNCH</guess>",PUNCH,"Summary so far:

Letters known to be absent:  
A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, J, M, Y

Letters known to be present:  
U and N, but neither can be in their previously-guessed positions.

From Guess 3 (JUMPY):
- U is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be position 4).

Allowed letters (besides U and N):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains N somewhere other than position 2 (and also not in position 1 from UNTIL).
3. Contains P somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Let’s list candidate patterns:

_ U _ _ _  (U fixed at position 2)

We need to insert N and P in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, avoiding their excluded spots, and pick the remaining letters from the allowed set.

Possible placements:
- N in 3, P in 1, 4, or 5
- N in 4, P in 1, 3, or 5
- N in 5, P in 1, 3, or 4

We also want high-frequency remaining letters for the remaining slots.
