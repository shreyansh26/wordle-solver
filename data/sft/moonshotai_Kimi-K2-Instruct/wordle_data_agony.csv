For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Some good starting words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

After considering these, I'll go with STARE as it contains S, T, A, R, E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Letters S, T, R, E are not in the word at all.

One such word is ""CANAL"".

- C and L are not in the word at all.
- The two A’s in positions 2 and 4 both received “-”, confirming A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3 or 4.  
  Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.

2. Use other common remaining letters to maximize info (N is already known “-” from CANAL, so avoid it).
3. Avoid all forbidden letters.

Letters S, T, R, E are not in the word at all.  
Therefore the secret word:
- contains A (but not in position 3)  
- does NOT contain S, T, R, E  
- could contain any of the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  

We know A is somewhere other than position 3.  
We want a new guess that:
1. includes A but in a different position  
2. avoids S, T, R, E  
3. uses other common letters to gain maximum information

A good choice is a word with A plus other high-frequency unused letters (L, N, O, I, C, U, D, M, P, G, H, B, K).  
One such word is ""CANAL"".
- C, N, L are common unused letters.

- No S, T, R, E.

- C and L are not in the word at all.
- The two A’s in positions 2 and 4 both received “-”, confirming A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3 or 4.  
  Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.

So far we know:
- Word contains A (only possible in spot 1 or 5).

- No info yet on B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next guess should:
1. Put A in position 1 (since we have no feedback on that spot yet).
2. Use other common remaining letters to maximize info (N is already known “-” from CANAL, so avoid it).
3. Avoid all forbidden letters.

- Allowed unused letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y

We have the pattern: A _ _ _ _

Next step: pick a word that starts with A and uses four brand-new letters from the remaining pool.  
We should still favor common letters, so among the remaining consonants the next most frequent are F, G, K, M; among vowels, only O is still completely unused.

A word that fits nicely: AFOGM – but that isn’t valid.  
Another candidate: AFOUL – but U is already ruled out.  
Yet another: AFLOW – but W hasn’t been tested yet.  

Actually, let’s use a real dictionary word that starts with A and uses four still-allowed letters.  
The combination A, F, J, O, M is unlikely to yield a valid word, but A, F, J, O, K is unlikely too.  

A viable real word is “AJUGA” – but G was never eliminated, and J and G haven’t been tested.  
However, that repeats A.  

The simplest valid word that starts with A and uses four fresh letters is “AMOK”.  
But that’s only four letters.  

We need a five-letter word.  
Looking again: “AMONG” – but N and G haven’t been eliminated; N was ruled out in CANAL, so no.  

Another valid word: “AMOUR” – but U is out.  

Next candidate: “AMIDO” – uses D and I, already out.  

Try “AGLOW” – uses G, L, O, W. L is out.  

We’re running low on real five-letter English words starting with A that only use still-allowed letters.  
Let’s pick “AGONY” – a real word. Letters used: A, G, O, N, Y.  
Check: N was ruled out in position 3 of CANAL, so N is invalid.  

Next: “AGLOW” – again L is out.  

Next: “AFIRE” – I, R, E out.  

Next: “AKIMB” – B out.  

Next: “AKING” – G and N are permitted? Wait, N was marked “-” in CANAL (second position), so N is in the word somewhere but not there. That’s actually allowed. Let’s re-verify:

From CANAL: N in position 3 was “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 3. So N is still in play.  
Therefore a word like “AKING” is valid, with letters A, K, I, N, G.  
But I was ruled out in APHID, so I is out.  

Next: “AMONG” – N is allowed (just not in position 3), M and G are allowed, O is allowed.  
However, AMONG has O and G which were never tested.  

Let’s check: A, M, O, N, G.  
All letters except A are still possible:  
- M: never tested  
- O: never tested  
- N: must be in the word but not in position 3 (CANAL gave N(-) at position 3)  
- G: never tested  

AMONG is a valid five-letter English word, uses only still-possible letters, and re-uses none of the banned letters.

We want a new guess that:
1. includes A but in a different position  
2. avoids S, T, R, E  
3. uses other common letters to gain maximum information

A good choice is a word with A plus other high-frequency unused letters (L, N, O, I, C, U, D, M, P, G, H, B, K).  
One such word is ""CANAL"".
- C, N, L are common unused letters.  
- A appears in positions 1 and 4 (different from position 3).  
- No S, T, R, E.

<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From Guess 1 (STARE → S T A R E = x x - x x) we know:
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

From Guess 2 (CANAL → C A N A L = x - - - x) we learn:
- C and L are not in the word at all.
- The two A’s in positions 2 and 4 both received “-”, confirming A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3 or 4.  
  Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.

So far we know:
- Word contains A (only possible in spot 1 or 5).
- Word does NOT contain S, T, R, E, C, L.
- No info yet on B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Next guess should:
1. Put A in position 1 (since we have no feedback on that spot yet).
2. Use other common remaining letters to maximize info (N is already known “-” from CANAL, so avoid it).
3. Avoid all forbidden letters.

A strong candidate that satisfies these constraints is “APHID”.

Check:
- A is in position 1 (possible).
- Letters P, H, I, D have not been tested yet.
- All letters are allowed so far.

- A is confirmed in position 1.  
- Word does NOT contain: S, T, R, E, C, L, P, H, I, D, N.  

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have the pattern: A _ _ _ _

We need to test new letters while keeping A fixed at the front.  
Using three new consonants and one vowel (to cover high-frequency letters) is ideal.

Among the unused consonants, the next most common are B, F, G, K, M; and among vowels, O and U are still available.

Let’s choose ABUZZ:  
- A is already locked in position 1.  
- B, U, Z are all fresh letters.  
- It uses Z (a less common letter, but we’ve already ruled out many high-frequency ones).  

Another quick check: all letters (A, B, U, Z) are currently allowed.

- Allowed unused letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y

We have the pattern: A _ _ _ _

Next step: pick a word that starts with A and uses four brand-new letters from the remaining pool.  
We should still favor common letters, so among the remaining consonants the next most frequent are F, G, K, M; among vowels, only O is still completely unused.

A word that fits nicely: AFOGM – but that isn’t valid.  
Another candidate: AFOUL – but U is already ruled out.  
Yet another: AFLOW – but W hasn’t been tested yet.  

Actually, let’s use a real dictionary word that starts with A and uses four still-allowed letters.  
The combination A, F, J, O, M is unlikely to yield a valid word, but A, F, J, O, K is unlikely too.  

A viable real word is “AJUGA” – but G was never eliminated, and J and G haven’t been tested.  
However, that repeats A.  

The simplest valid word that starts with A and uses four fresh letters is “AMOK”.  
But that’s only four letters.  

We need a five-letter word.  
Looking again: “AMONG” – but N and G haven’t been eliminated; N was ruled out in CANAL, so no.  

Another valid word: “AMOUR” – but U is out.  

Next candidate: “AMIDO” – uses D and I, already out.  

Try “AGLOW” – uses G, L, O, W. L is out.  

We’re running low on real five-letter English words starting with A that only use still-allowed letters.  
Let’s pick “AGONY” – a real word. Letters used: A, G, O, N, Y.  
Check: N was ruled out in position 3 of CANAL, so N is invalid.  

Next: “AGLOW” – again L is out.  

Next: “AFIRE” – I, R, E out.  

Next: “AKIMB” – B out.  

Next: “AKING” – G and N are permitted? Wait, N was marked “-” in CANAL (second position), so N is in the word somewhere but not there. That’s actually allowed. Let’s re-verify:

From CANAL: N in position 3 was “-”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 3. So N is still in play.  
Therefore a word like “AKING” is valid, with letters A, K, I, N, G.  
But I was ruled out in APHID, so I is out.  

Next: “AMONG” – N is allowed (just not in position 3), M and G are allowed, O is allowed.  
However, AMONG has O and G which were never tested.  

Let’s check: A, M, O, N, G.  
All letters except A are still possible:  
- M: never tested  
- O: never tested  
- N: must be in the word but not in position 3 (CANAL gave N(-) at position 3)  
- G: never tested  

AMONG is a valid five-letter English word, uses only still-possible letters, and re-uses none of the banned letters.  
It also places N in a new position (4), satisfying the “-” feedback from CANAL.  

So: AMONG.
