Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any.

Looking at common 5-letter words that use these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in strategic positions. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their approximate positions.

Other good alternatives would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""AROSE"" gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word and in the correct second position.
- A, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
- We must avoid the letters A, O, S, E.

We want a new word that keeps R in position 2 and uses fresh common letters. Common remaining consonants include T, N, L, D, C, M, P, B, etc. For vowels we still have I and U available.

Possible good candidates:
- BRICK (but B isn’t super common and C/K might be redundant)
- DRILL (double L, but L is common)
- GRIND (uses I, N, D)
- TRUMP (uses U, M, P)
- FRUIT (uses F, U, I, T – F isn’t as common)

""TRUCK"" is decent but uses C & K which are similar. ""PRINT"" is nice but N is in position 4. ""DRINK"" looks good because:
- D, I, N, K are all common.
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Doesn't reuse any eliminated letters.

- The fourth letter must be N.
- The fifth letter must be K.

We also know that none of the letters A, O, S, E, D, F are in the word at all (from previous “x” marks).
