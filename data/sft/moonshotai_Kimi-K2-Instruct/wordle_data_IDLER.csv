### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Since this is the first guess, I have no information about the secret word. The optimal first guess should maximize information gain by:
1. Using common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to quickly identify which vowels are present
2. Including common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) that appear frequently in English words
3. Avoiding less common letters (like Q, X, Z) early on

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This will give us maximum information about vowel/consonant presence and positions.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

2. Including common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L) that appear frequently in English words
3. Avoiding less common letters (like Q, X, Z) early on

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit these criteria, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English 5-letter words

This will give us maximum information about vowel/consonant presence and positions.

- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it is NOT in position 5).

Letters we know are in the word: R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S  

Hence, the remaining unknown positions (1, 3, 4) must be filled from letters that have not been eliminated. Also, R and E must appear somewhere other than positions 2 and 5 respectively.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep R and E in new positions.
2. Use common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (like T, N, I, L, etc.).
3. Avoid the already-eliminated letters A, O, S.

Looking for a word that re-uses R and E while introducing new common letters. “INERT” satisfies:
- It has R and E, but places them in different positions (R in 5, E in 4).
- Introduces three new letters (I, N, T) which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- No A, O, or S appear.

This should efficiently narrow down the possibilities.

- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.

- Letters definitely out: A, O, S, N, T

Letters still available (not yet tested or not eliminated):

R cannot be in positions 2 or 5, and E cannot be in positions 3 or 5. We have to place R and E somewhere in the remaining open positions 2, 3, 4.

A good third guess should:
1. Keep the fixed I in position 1.
2. Re-locate R and E into new possible slots.
3. Introduce one or two new common consonants that haven’t been used yet to maximize information.

Candidate word: IRKED
- I stays correct in first position.
- R and E are used again but placed in new possible spots (R in 2, E in 4). 
- Introduces K and D (both common and untested).
- Uses no eliminated letters.

This should help lock down exact positions for R and E while testing two new letters.

From Guess 4 (idrel):

- D(✓) – now correct in position 2
- R(-) – R is in the word, but NOT in position 3
- E(✓) – still correct in position 4
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far we have the fixed pattern: I D _ E _
Letters known to be in the word: I, D, R, E, L
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, N, T, K

R must be placed:
- cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5
- positions 1 and 4 are already taken by I and E
- therefore R has nowhere left to go without violating the constraints.  

This contradiction implies there is an error in earlier deductions.  
Re-checking:

Positions fixed: I(1), D(2), E(4)  
Letters we still need to place: R and L  
Available slots: 3 and 5  

From previous feedback:
- R cannot be in position 2 or 5 (inert and arose feedback).
- R can therefore only be in position 3.
- L cannot be in position 5 (idrel feedback), so L must be in position 3.

But L cannot be in position 3 if R must be there.  
Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- R in position 3
- L must then be in position 5, even though feedback on idrel said L(-).  
However, idrel placed L in position 5, and the feedback “L(-)” means L is NOT in position 5, so L cannot be used at all.

This contradiction means the only valid word fitting all constraints is:
I D R E _ with the last letter being none of the eliminated ones.  
The only common letter left that hasn't been eliminated is ""L"", but L is excluded from position 5.  

Realizing the oversight: the feedback on idrel (L(-)) means L is in the word but not in position 5, yet position 5 is the only remaining slot.  
Hence, L must be in position 3, and R must be in position 5.

Therefore, the correct arrangement is:
I D L E R

Let's verify against all constraints:
- I(✓) position 1 – correct
- D(✓) position 2 – correct
- L in position 3 – satisfies the feedback (L is in the word, not in position 5)
- E(✓) position 4 – correct
- R in position 5 – satisfies the feedback (R is in the word, and earlier feedback only ruled out positions 2 and 5 for R, but position 5 was only excluded when R appeared in position 2 incorrectly. Since R hasn't been tested in position 5 yet, it is allowed)

So the only possible word left is: I D L E R

Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, N, T, K

R must be placed:

But L cannot be in position 3 if R must be there.  
Thus, the only consistent placement is:
