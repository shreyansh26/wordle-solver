Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""STARE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of frequently occurring letters in different positions, which will provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). A good first guess should use a mix of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""STARE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- S (very common consonant)\n- T (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us a good spread of frequently occurring letters in different positions, which will provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.\n\n<guess>STARE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) A(-) R(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the first guess’s feedback:\n\n- S (position 1) — x → **S is NOT in the word.**\n- T (position 2) — - → **T is in the word but NOT in position 2.**\n- A (position 3) — - → **A is in the word but NOT in position 3.**\n- R (position 4) — x → **R is NOT in the word.**\n- E (position 5) — x → **E is NOT in the word.**\n\nSo the secret word contains T and A, but not S, R, or E.  \nAlso:\n- T cannot be in position 2.\n- A cannot be in position 3.\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

Let’s collate what we now know:

Letters known to be in the word  
- A (must be in position 3)  
- T (must be in position 5, because we just got ✓ there)

Letters known NOT to be in the word  
S, R, E, O, N, C, P

Letters still possibly in the word, but whose placement is unsettled  
L (used in positions 2 and 4 so far, each marked “-”, so L must appear elsewhere – only positions 1 or 4 remain)

So current template: _ _ A _ T

We still need two new letters (must not be any of S,R,E,O,N,C,P).  
Remaining common choices: D, I, U, M, G, B, F, H, K, Y, etc.

A quick scan of English 5-letter words that match “_ _ A _ T” and contain L somewhere, while using only allowed letters:

- BLAST – invalid (S excluded)  
- CLART – invalid (C and R excluded)  
- PLAIT – invalid (P excluded)  
- FLATT – invalid (double T)  
- GLANT – not a real word  
- PLANT – invalid (N excluded)  
- SLANT – invalid (S,N excluded)  

But we also know L must appear once.  Template: ? _ A ? T with L in either position 1 or 4.

Try L in 4: _ _ A L T  
Need a first letter ≠ any ruled-out letter.

Good choices: D, F, G, H, M, K, B, I.

Real 5-letter words:
- DIALT – not a word  
- FIALT – no  
- GIALT – no  
- MIALT – no  
- BIALT – no  
- HALT?  Needs 5 letters → HAL__ – no  
- DAL__ – DALOT? No  
- GALOT?  No  

Actually, “DAULT” isn’t a word; “fault” is but F is okay and L is 4th, but R is in “fault” and excluded.

Wait, simpler: If L is in position 1: L _ A _ T

Possible words:  
- LIAFT – no  
- LYART – no  
- LYMACT – too long  
- LYATT – no  

Try L in position 1, and pick two new letters for positions 2 and 4 from allowed set: D, I, M, U, G, B, H, K, Y, F.

Scanning valid 5-letter words that fit:  
- LYAMT – no  
- LITAT – no  
- LUNAT – no  
- LIGAT – no  

Real dictionary word: “LIMIT” – but T isn’t at end.  
“LIMA T” – no.  

Hold on: “LAMUT” – no.  
“LYAM T” – no.  

Correct approach: pick any valid word that fits the template while obeying the constraints.  Let’s list:

Template: _ _ A _ T  
Must contain L somewhere.  
Allowed letters for remaining slots: D, I, U, M, G, B, F, H, K, Y.

We just need a real word.  One that works:

“BAYAT” – not a common word.  
“GAMUT” – contains U, G, M; but U and M are allowed, and T already fixed at 5.  “G” “A” “M” “U” “T” – G A M U T.  That’s a real word, and all letters are allowed (G, A, M, U, T).  A is at position 3, T at 5, and L is missing – but we know L must be in the word.  So this won’t do.

Wait, we must have L in the word.  So positions:

If L is in 1: L _ A _ T  
Choose 2nd and 4th from allowed set.

Real word: “LYART” – no, R excluded.  
“LIANT” – N excluded.  
“LIGAT” – no.  
“LYAMT” – no.  

Another: “LUAUT” – no.

Real word: “LUAUT” – no.

Next possibility: L in 4th position: _ _ A L T  
Choose 1st and 2nd letters from allowed set.

Real 5-letter words:  
- DIALT – no  
- FIALT – no  
- GIALT – no  
- MIALT – no  

Actually, “FAULT” is a real 5-letter word, but F A U L T.  Check letters: F, A, U, L, T.  All rules satisfied:  
- A is 3rd (✓)  
- T is 5th (✓)  
- L is 4th (new position, so okay)  
- F and U not used before.  
- No banned letters.

So “FAULT” is a valid, legal guess at this stage.
