I'm starting the word guessing game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, my goal is to make an efficient first guess that will provide the maximum amount of information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some guidelines for a strong first guess:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (like T, N, S, R, L)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common letter distributions in English, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S are all very frequent. A classic ""optimal"" starting word is ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters including 3 vowels and 2 consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers common letters too.

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it tests five of the most common letters in English words.

All five letters in AROSE were marked “x”, which means none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That drastically narrows the remaining candidate set: we must avoid those six letters entirely.

Common 5-letter words that do not contain A, R, O, S, or E include:
- M U L C H
- D U M P Y
- B U M P Y
- H U M P S
- L U M P Y
- N I T H Y
- G U N C H

I want a word that still covers frequently occurring consonants and vowels among the *remaining* alphabet (consonants like T, N, L, M, P, H, D, C, K, G and vowels I, U, Y).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, my goal is to make an efficient first guess that will provide the maximum amount of information. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Some guidelines for a strong first guess:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (like T, N, S, R, L)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common letter distributions in English, the letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S are all very frequent. A classic ""optimal"" starting word is ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters including 3 vowels and 2 consonants. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers common letters too.

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it tests five of the most common letters in English words.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>All five letters in AROSE were marked “x”, which means none of A, R, O, S, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That drastically narrows the remaining candidate set: we must avoid those six letters entirely.

Common 5-letter words that do not contain A, R, O, S, or E include:
- M U L C H
- D U M P Y
- B U M P Y
- H U M P S
- L U M P Y
- N I T H Y
- G U N C H
– etc.

I want a word that still covers frequently occurring consonants and vowels among the *remaining* alphabet (consonants like T, N, L, M, P, H, D, C, K, G and vowels I, U, Y).  
One convenient choice is “M U L C H”: it uses the common consonants M, L, C, H and the vowel U, none of which were ruled out.

<guess>MULCH</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MULCH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(x) L(x) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>So far, every letter guessed has been completely absent from the secret word:

- A, R, O, S, E (from AROSE) → all x  
- M, U, L, C, H (from MULCH) → all x  

That removes 10 distinct letters from contention.

Remaining letters we haven’t tried include:

Vowels: I, Y  
Consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

A good next guess should cover new, common letters from that set so we get maximum information.  
Looking for 5-letter words that use only the *still-possible* letters, I want to include:
- the high-frequency consonants N, T, D, P, G  
- the vowels I, Y  

One such word is “TYPID” (though it’s uncommon) or “TYING” (common and valid).  
Another is “DINGY”. “DINGY” uses D, I, N, G, Y — all still allowable and fairly common.

I’ll go with DINGY.
