For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gained regardless of the actual secret word. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T)

Looking at these, SLATE covers 5 of the top 10 letters and has a good vowel/consonant balance. It's considered one of the optimal starting words statistically.

From the feedback:

From the new feedback on DICOT:

- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.  BUT we already knew from Guess 1 that T is in position 5.  The “T(-)” here must simply mean “T is in the word; we’re not changing the earlier ‘T(✓)’.”  So we will keep T in position 5.

So far the pattern is: D I _ _ T  
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, E, F, R, U, C, O  
Allowed letters (besides those): B, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form DI _ _ T, using only the allowed letters.

Possible third and fourth letters:
- G, H, K, N, P, Y, Z (the most common remaining ones)

Looking for real words:
- DIGIT → but third I is already in position 2, and we can’t repeat letters that aren’t confirmed twice (and I isn’t confirmed twice yet). Also ends IT, so T position 5 is fine, but we need to check.
- DIGHT → already used H in fourth position, but C and O are banned, and we have D I G H T. Wait, DIGHT ends HT, but we need T at position 5, so D I G H T is valid, but we’ve already seen DIGHT isn’t a match because O is banned and we used DIGHT earlier as a candidate but didn’t pick it.
- DIVOT → V and T are allowed, but O is banned.
- DIMLY → Y is allowed but ends Y, not T.
- DINKY → same.
- PIVOT → starts P, but O is banned.
- Let me think systematically: DI _ _ T with allowed letters.

DI _ _ T possibilities:
- DIGIT → ends IT, so D I G I T.  Letters: D(✓), I(✓), G, I, T(✓).  I is already confirmed at position 2, and we don’t have info that it appears again.  DIGIT is a valid word.
- DIMOT → O is banned.
- DIKAT → K and A, but A is banned.
- DINNT → N and N and T, but double N might be allowed.  DINNT is not a word.
- DIVOT → O banned.
- DIGHT → H is allowed, G is allowed, so D I G H T.  DIGHT is a valid word, but we’ve already tried DICOT and DIGHT hasn’t been guessed before except as an unguessed candidate.
- DINKT → not a word.

Between DIGIT and DIGHT:
- DIGIT: D I G I T.  I appears twice, but we don’t have confirmation that I appears twice.  We only know I is in position 2.  Could be possible.
- DIGHT: D I G H T.  Uses H, which is allowed.

Both are valid.  DIGIT is more common.  Let me check if DIGIT violates any constraints:
- D I G I T:
  - D in 1 ✓
  - I in 2 ✓
  - G in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 4 – we don’t know if there’s a second I, but it’s possible.
  - T in 5 ✓
  - No forbidden letters used.

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,5,ditty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gained regardless of the actual secret word. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T)

Looking at these, SLATE covers 5 of the top 10 letters and has a good vowel/consonant balance. It's considered one of the optimal starting words statistically.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (✗).
- T is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ T with the letters S, L, A, E excluded.

I need a new 5-letter word that ends with T and contains none of S, L, A, E.

Common remaining consonants: N, R, I, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Vowels still available: I, O, U

Possible endings: _ _ _ _ T

Let me think of valid words ending in T that avoid banned letters. Some candidates:
- FRUIT (but has U and I, no banned letters)
- GRUNT (but has N, U, no banned letters)
- PRINT (but has I, N, no banned letters)
- FRONT (but has O, N, no banned letters)

I'll go with FRUIT since it uses high-frequency remaining letters F, R, U, I plus the known T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) U(x) I(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the new feedback on FRUIT:

- F(x) – F is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- U(x) – U is not in the word at all.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

However, from the first guess we already knew T is in the correct final position (✓).  
The contradictory “T(-)” in the second guess must simply be restating that T is in the word (since we already have ✓ at position 5).

So the accumulated constraints are now:
- Letters NOT present: S, L, A, E, F, R, U
- T is fixed at position 5 (✓)
- I is in the word but not at position 4

Available letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T, containing I, and excluding the banned letters.

Candidate words:
- CIVET – uses C, I, V, E, T → E banned
- DIGHT – ends T, but D, I, G, H, T all allowed
- DICOT – uses D, I, C, O, T → all allowed
- MINTY – ends Y, skip
- WIGHT – ends T, W, I, G, H allowed

DICOT looks promising: D, I, C, O, T
- ends in T (position 5) ✓
- has I not in position 4
- all letters allowed

Another check: DIGHT – ends T, letters D, I, G, H, T all allowed, and I is in position 2, not position 4.
Both DICOT and DIGHT fit. DICOT is more common.

I’ll choose DICOT.

DI _ _ T possibilities:

moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct,6,ditty,"<|im_system|>system<|im_middle|>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gained regardless of the actual secret word. Based on letter frequency analysis in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. 

A good first guess should contain several of these high-frequency consonants and vowels to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLANT (S, L, A, N, T)

Looking at these, SLATE covers 5 of the top 10 letters and has a good vowel/consonant balance. It's considered one of the optimal starting words statistically.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (✗).
- T is in the word and in the correct fifth position (✓).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ T with the letters S, L, A, E excluded.

I need a new 5-letter word that ends with T and contains none of S, L, A, E.

Common remaining consonants: N, R, I, O, U, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Vowels still available: I, O, U

Possible endings: _ _ _ _ T

Let me think of valid words ending in T that avoid banned letters. Some candidates:
- FRUIT (but has U and I, no banned letters)
- GRUNT (but has N, U, no banned letters)
- PRINT (but has I, N, no banned letters)
- FRONT (but has O, N, no banned letters)

I'll go with FRUIT since it uses high-frequency remaining letters F, R, U, I plus the known T.

<guess>FRUIT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) U(x) I(-) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>Interpreting the new feedback on FRUIT:

- F(x) – F is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- U(x) – U is not in the word at all.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

However, from the first guess we already knew T is in the correct final position (✓).  
The contradictory “T(-)” in the second guess must simply be restating that T is in the word (since we already have ✓ at position 5).

So the accumulated constraints are now:
- Letters NOT present: S, L, A, E, F, R, U
- T is fixed at position 5 (✓)
- I is in the word but not at position 4

Available letters: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in T, containing I, and excluding the banned letters.

Candidate words:
- CIVET – uses C, I, V, E, T → E banned
- DIGHT – ends T, but D, I, G, H, T all allowed
- DICOT – uses D, I, C, O, T → all allowed
- MINTY – ends Y, skip
- WIGHT – ends T, W, I, G, H allowed

DICOT looks promising: D, I, C, O, T
- ends in T (position 5) ✓
- has I not in position 4
- all letters allowed

Another check: DIGHT – ends T, letters D, I, G, H, T all allowed, and I is in position 2, not position 4.
Both DICOT and DIGHT fit. DICOT is more common.

I’ll choose DICOT.

<guess>DICOT</guess><|im_end|><|im_user|>user<|im_middle|>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(x) U(x) I(-) T(-)
Guess 3: DICOT -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) C(x) O(x) T(-)
<|im_end|><|im_assistant|>assistant<|im_middle|>From the new feedback on DICOT:

- D(✓) – D is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.  BUT we already knew from Guess 1 that T is in position 5.  The “T(-)” here must simply mean “T is in the word; we’re not changing the earlier ‘T(✓)’.”  So we will keep T in position 5.

So far the pattern is: D I _ _ T  
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, E, F, R, U, C, O  
Allowed letters (besides those): B, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form DI _ _ T, using only the allowed letters.

Possible third and fourth letters:
- G, H, K, N, P, Y, Z (the most common remaining ones)

Looking for real words:
- DIGIT → but third I is already in position 2, and we can’t repeat letters that aren’t confirmed twice (and I isn’t confirmed twice yet). Also ends IT, so T position 5 is fine, but we need to check.
- DIGHT → already used H in fourth position, but C and O are banned, and we have D I G H T. Wait, DIGHT ends HT, but we need T at position 5, so D I G H T is valid, but we’ve already seen DIGHT isn’t a match because O is banned and we used DIGHT earlier as a candidate but didn’t pick it.
- DIVOT → V and T are allowed, but O is banned.
- DIMLY → Y is allowed but ends Y, not T.
- DINKY → same.
- PIVOT → starts P, but O is banned.
- Let me think systematically: DI _ _ T with allowed letters.

DI _ _ T possibilities:
- DIGIT → ends IT, so D I G I T.  Letters: D(✓), I(✓), G, I, T(✓).  I is already confirmed at position 2, and we don’t have info that it appears again.  DIGIT is a valid word.
- DIMOT → O is banned.
- DIKAT → K and A, but A is banned.
- DINNT → N and N and T, but double N might be allowed.  DINNT is not a word.
- DIVOT → O banned.
- DIGHT → H is allowed, G is allowed, so D I G H T.  DIGHT is a valid word, but we’ve already tried DICOT and DIGHT hasn’t been guessed before except as an unguessed candidate.
- DINKT → not a word.

Between DIGIT and DIGHT:
- DIGIT: D I G I T.  I appears twice, but we don’t have confirmation that I appears twice.  We only know I is in position 2.  Could be possible.
- DIGHT: D I G H T.  Uses H, which is allowed.

Both are valid.  DIGIT is more common.  Let me check if DIGIT violates any constraints:
- D I G I T:
  - D in 1 ✓
  - I in 2 ✓
  - G in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 4 – we don’t know if there’s a second I, but it’s possible.
  - T in 5 ✓
  - No forbidden letters used.

DIGIT seems fine.  Let me make DIGIT the guess.

Valid English 5-letter words that fit D I I _ T:
- DIINT – not a dictionary word.
- DIIPT – not a dictionary word.
- DIKOT – O is banned.
- DIHIT – double “I” is already used; “H” is allowed.
- DIKIT – not a dictionary word.
- DIVIT – V is allowed, but “DIVIT” is not a recognized word.
- DIXIT – X is allowed; “DIXIT” is a valid word (Latin for “he/she said,” sometimes used in English texts).  
- DIJIT – J is allowed; “DIJIT” is not standard English.
- DIYIT – Y is allowed; “DIYIT” is not standard.

The only plausible valid word remaining is DIXIT.

Check constraints:
- D(✓) I(✓) I(✓) X _ T – letters used: D, I, I, X, T.  
- All letters are among the still-allowed set (X hasn’t been ruled out).  
- Pattern matches exactly.

Hence, the next (and final allowed) guess is DIXIT.

<guess>DIXIT</guess>",DIXIT,"From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern locked: D I _ _ T
2. Forbidden letters: S, L, A, E, F, R, U, C, O, G, M
3. There is a second I, but it cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 4 feedback) and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (already filled or confirmed).  
   Therefore the only possible location for the second I is position 3.

So the word must be D I I _ T, and the only remaining blank is position 4.
