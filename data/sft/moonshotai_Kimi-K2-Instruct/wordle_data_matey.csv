For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a wide range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather maximum information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Frequently used consonants (S, T, R, N, L)
3. No repeating letters to maximize coverage

Some excellent starter words include:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAINE (R, A, I, N, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it covers:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, providing maximum information regardless of the feedback.

Scanning a mental list, “PATEL” isn’t a valid English word.

“BATHE” has H and B unused, fits _ A T E _ with a possible ending H.

Wait, our 4th letter is already E, so pattern _ A T E _ needs 5th letter.

- P A T E N – PATEN is valid but rare.  
- L A T E N – LATEN isn’t standard.  
- F A T E N – FATEN isn’t a word.
