This is the first guess, so I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words.

Looking at the most common letters in English (E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C), I'll choose a word that uses several of these. The word ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give me good coverage to see which of these common letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.  
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(x) → E is not in the word.  

So far we know:
- Pattern so far: _ R O _ _  
- Letters eliminated: A, S, E  
- Letters still allowed: any others, but we especially want to test new common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, C, etc.)

I’ll pick a word that fits _ R O _ _, uses none of the eliminated letters, and tests several new common letters.  
Possible candidates: “troop” (but repeats O), “droit” (I and T), “groin” (G, I, N), “front” (F, N, T).

“front” uses F, R, O, N, T.  
- R and O are already confirmed.  
- F, N, T are new and common.  
- No A, S, E.  
This seems a strong second probe.

What we now know after two guesses:
1. The word has pattern _ R O _ _ (R in slot 2, O in slot 3).  
2. Letters NOT in the word (eliminated): A, S, E, N, T.  
3. Letters confirmed present but not yet placed: F (it got “-”, so it is in the word but not in slot 1).  
4. Remaining slots to fill: 1 and 4-5.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ R O _ _ that:
- Uses F somewhere other than slot 1.  
- Uses none of the banned letters (A, S, E, N, T).  
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate letters left (common ones): D, G, I, L, R (already used), U, C, M, etc.

Possible patterns: R O _ _ _ is fixed, but slot 1 must be before R, and F must appear in slots 4 or 5.

Let’s try to place F in slot 4: _ R O F _  
What letter works for slot 1 and 5? Common consonants not used yet: D, G, L, I, C, M, etc.  
Try D R O F _ … only one letter left.  
A 5-letter word must fit: D R O F _ → DROFY isn’t valid.  
Try F in slot 5: _ R O _ F  
Slot 4 must be a consonant or vowel.  
Possible word: C R O W F – no, not valid.  
Alternative: B R O K F – not valid.  
Try G R O F _ – GROFY not valid.  
Another candidate: I R O F _ – IROFY not valid.  
Try L R O F _ – LROFY not valid.  

Let’s look for actual dictionary words fitting _ R O _ _ with F in slot 1 or 4/5.  
Example: F R O C K – but R and O are fixed in slots 2-3, so F would have to be slot 1, but F got “-”; it’s in the word but not in slot 1. So F can’t be in slot 1.  

Check word list:  
Valid word: “FROCK” – but F is slot 1, which we know is wrong.  
Valid word: “PROOF” – uses O twice and P, F. Let’s check:  
PROOF pattern: P R O O F.  
This fits _ R O _ _ (R slot 2, O slot 3), and F is in slot 5 (allowed).  
Uses none of the banned letters (A, S, E, N, T).  
P is new; O repeats but that’s ok.  
This seems like a good third probe.
