This is the first guess, so there's no feedback to work from yet. A good starting strategy is to choose a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early on. Words like ""ARISE"", ""ADIEU"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are often recommended. 

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels: A, I, E (covering common vowels)
- Two common consonants: R, S (both frequently appear in English words)

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

We know:
- A is in the correct first position.  
- I is in the word but not in the 3rd slot.  
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: A _ _ _ _ with an I somewhere after the first letter (but not in position 3).

To probe for I’s location and bring in fresh common letters, we’ll leave A fixed and try new consonants. A good second guess is often one that swaps out the eliminated letters (R, S, E) and introduces fresh high-frequency letters while relocating the I.

A simple choice is “ADMIT”:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Puts I in position 2.
- Introduces D, M, T, which are still possible.

Confirmed facts after three guesses:
1. Pattern so far: A _ _ I _
2. Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, D, M, T, C, O, N
3. Therefore positions 2, 3, 5 must be chosen from the remaining alphabet:  
   B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still have no hit on position 2 or 3, so we want new letters that are common in English words.  
Looking at the unused pool, good candidates are:
- Position 2: L, B, G, H, P
- Position 3: L, B, G, H, K, U, Y
- Position 5: L, K, Y (common 5-letter endings)

To maximize information per guess, we’ll pick a word that re-uses only confirmed letters (A, I) and adds three new, high-frequency consonants or vowels that haven’t been tested.  

One strong candidate is “ALIBY”:
- A (1) and I (4) are locked.
- L, B, Y are all fresh and common.

If any of L, B, or Y is in the word, we’ll find out immediately which slot it belongs in. If none appear, we’ve eliminated three more letters at once.

Alternative would be “AGILE” but E is already out; “ALBUM” but M is out; “APLIY” looks less natural. “ALIBY” is both legal and informative.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good starting strategy is to choose a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early on. Words like ""ARISE"", ""ADIEU"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are often recommended. 

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels: A, I, E (covering common vowels)
- Two common consonants: R, S (both frequently appear in English words)

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Updated facts after four guesses:

- Position 2 and 3 still unknown; position 5 still unknown.
- We have tried I in positions 3 and 4; feedback consistently shows I is in position 4 only.

We have only two more guesses remaining. We need to test three new letters in positions 2, 3, 5. Among the remaining letters, the most common/consonant-friendly are F, G, H, K, P, U.

A good next probe is a word that places three of these letters in one shot. The natural candidate is “APHID” (but D is already out). Next natural: “AFKPU” isn’t a word. Looking for a real 5-letter word with A _ _ I _ and unused letters.

“APING” – but N and G are not yet ruled out. Actually:

Looking at valid English 5-letter words beginning with A, ending with I in position 4, using remaining letters:
- AFGIH -> no, not a word.
- AFKIH -> no.
- AGHIL -> no, L out.
- AGHIN -> N out.
- AGHIF -> no.
- AGHIP -> not a word.
- AGHIK -> no.

Wait, let me list valid A _ _ I _ words with remaining letters:
- AFKIH -> invalid.
- AFHIG -> invalid.
- APHIG -> invalid.
- AGHIL -> invalid.
- AFHIK -> not a word.

Actually, check: “APHID” - D is out. “AGILE” - E, L, G out. “AFIRE” - R, E out. “AHIGH” - H, G, H - H is still in, G still in, but double H. “AHIGH” is a valid word; however G and H are still possible.

Let’s test “AHIGH”:
- A (1) locked, I (4) locked.
- H, G, H are new letters (H and G not yet tested).
- If any of H or G are in the word, we’ll see it.

But feedback for “AHIGH” would be:
- A(✓) H(- or x) I(✓) G(- or x) H(- or x)

That’s good: 3 new letters tested, and we keep A and I locked.

But we have only 2 guesses left; we need to maximize info.

Actually, among the remaining pool, the letters F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W are possible. A better word might be:

“AFKIH” – invalid. “APHIS” – S out. “APISH” – S out.

Wait, a valid word is “AGHIS” – but S out. “AFIRE” – R, E out.

Another valid word: “AFKIH” – no.

Wait, let me think systematically. We need A _ _ I _ with letters from F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

- “APHID” – D out.

- Letters now known NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, M, T, C, O, N, L, B, Y
- That leaves usable letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Position 2 and 3 still unknown; position 5 still unknown.
- We have tried I in positions 3 and 4; feedback consistently shows I is in position 4 only.

We have only two more guesses remaining. We need to test three new letters in positions 2, 3, 5. Among the remaining letters, the most common/consonant-friendly are F, G, H, K, P, U.

A good next probe is a word that places three of these letters in one shot. The natural candidate is “APHID” (but D is already out). Next natural: “AFKPU” isn’t a word. Looking for a real 5-letter word with A _ _ I _ and unused letters.

“APING” – but N and G are not yet ruled out. Actually:

Looking at valid English 5-letter words beginning with A, ending with I in position 4, using remaining letters:
- AFGIH -> no, not a word.
- AFKIH -> no.
- AGHIL -> no, L out.
- AGHIN -> N out.
- AGHIF -> no.
- AGHIP -> not a word.
- AGHIK -> no.
- AGHIK -> no.

Wait, let me list valid A _ _ I _ words with remaining letters:
- AFKIH -> invalid.
- AFHIG -> invalid.
- APHIG -> invalid.
- AGHIL -> invalid.
- AFHIK -> not a word.

Actually, check: “APHID” - D is out. “AGILE” - E, L, G out. “AFIRE” - R, E out. “AHIGH” - H, G, H - H is still in, G still in, but double H. “AHIGH” is a valid word; however G and H are still possible.

Let’s test “AHIGH”:
- A (1) locked, I (4) locked.
- H, G, H are new letters (H and G not yet tested).
- If any of H or G are in the word, we’ll see it.

But feedback for “AHIGH” would be:
- A(✓) H(- or x) I(✓) G(- or x) H(- or x)

That’s good: 3 new letters tested, and we keep A and I locked.

But we have only 2 guesses left; we need to maximize info.

Actually, among the remaining pool, the letters F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W are possible. A better word might be:

“AFKIH” – invalid. “APHIS” – S out. “APISH” – S out.

Wait, a valid word is “AGHIS” – but S out. “AFIRE” – R, E out.

Another valid word: “AFKIH” – no.

Wait, let me think systematically. We need A _ _ I _ with letters from F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting A _ _ I _:
- “APHID” – D out.
- “AHIGH” – valid.
- “APHIS” – S out.
- “AGILE” – G, L, E out.
- “AFIRE” – F, R, E – R, E out.

“AHIGH” seems the only valid word left that fits constraints.

So we’ll test “AHIGH”.

But we have to avoid repeating ruled-out letters: H and G are still possible. “AHIGH” uses A, H, I, G, H – all not yet ruled out.

Let’s go with “AHIGH”.

From the five guesses we now know:

- The word is A _ _ I _
- All tested letters except A and I are NOT in the word:
  R, S, E, D, M, T, C, O, N, L, B, Y, H, G are eliminated.

Remaining unused letters (from the alphabet) are:
F, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, the only common English letters that can realistically sit in positions 2, 3, and 5 are F, J, K, P, U.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form A _ _ I _ using only these letters.

Quick scan of valid words:
- AFIRE – R is out, so invalid.
- AFPID – not a word.
- AJPIC – not a word.
- AQUID – not standard.
- APUKI – not a word.
- APUCK – not a word.

The only real candidate that fits is “APUJI” – but this is not a recognized English word.

Re-checking, the only actual valid English word left in the remaining pool is “AQUIF” (as in aquifer), but that puts F in position 5 and Q in position 2 or 3.

Actually, “AQUIF” is 5 letters, starts with A, and has I in position 4 – a valid word.

Letters used: A, Q, U, I, F – none have been ruled out.

Hence our final attempt is “AQUIF”.
