For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N, M, etc.)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses very common letters and has a good mix of consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has A and N somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
2. The word has neither C, R, nor E.
3. The remaining letters to test should avoid C, R, E.

Good letters to try next are T, S, L, I, O, U, M, D, etc. We need a word that:
- Has A and N (but not in positions 3 and 4)
- Avoids C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5

A good second guess would be a word that places A and N in new positions and introduces new common letters. Let's try ""STAND"":
- S: new letter
- T: new letter
- A: in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3) → this won't work as A must move from position 3.
