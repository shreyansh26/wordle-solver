- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word that contains common letters in English, especially vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular starting choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

""RAISE"" is a particularly good first guess because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, I, E
- Two very common consonants: R, S
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving us maximum information regardless of the secret word.

This should help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: exists in the word but is NOT in the 1st position  
- A, I, S, E: do NOT appear in the secret word at all

So we now know:
1. The word contains R but not in slot 1.
2. The remaining letters (A, I, S, E) are excluded, so the word must use other vowels/consonants.

We still need to test the common vowels O and U, plus the consonants T, N, L, C, etc.  
A good second guess that introduces four fresh common letters while keeping R in a new position is “ROUND”.

“ROUND” gives us:
- R moved to position 2  
- O and U test the remaining common vowels  
- N and D are common consonants we haven’t tried yet  

This should quickly narrow down the remaining candidates.

From the new feedback:

1. R is still in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from RAISE and ROUND).
2. O is in the word and is correctly placed in position 2.
3. U, N, D do not appear anywhere in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain R and it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- Must avoid A, I, S, E, U, N, D.

We need fresh consonants and vowels. The remaining common consonants we haven’t tried include T, L, C, M, H, G, B, F, etc., and the only remaining common vowel is Y (since A, I, E, U are out).

Let’s look for a word:
- _ O _ _ _
- R somewhere in 3-5
- uses new letters

A strong candidate is “FORTH”:
- F, T, H are new letters.
- R is in position 4 (which is allowed).
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- No excluded letters (A, I, S, E, U, N, D) are used.

This should give us good coverage.
