For my first guess, I want to choose a word that incorporates common letters and vowels to help eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and at least two vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should provide useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.

Another excellent candidate is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage for initial elimination purposes.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives me the best chance to identify vowels and common consonants early.

All five letters A, R, O, S, E are not in the secret word (each got “x”), so we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Looking at the alphabet, the remaining untouched common consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
The remaining untouched vowels are: I and U (since A, O, E are out)

I want a word that uses fresh, high-frequency letters from the remaining set so I can narrow things down quickly.  
Good fresh letters: L, N, T, I, U, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, C

A balanced first choice that covers several of these is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
Another candidate is “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D).  
I’ll pick “UNTIL” because it mixes vowel/consonant coverage evenly and uses five completely new letters.

(If the feedback shows any hits, the next guess can be refined accordingly.)
