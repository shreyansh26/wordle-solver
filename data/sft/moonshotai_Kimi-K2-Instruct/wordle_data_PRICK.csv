For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The best strategy is often to use a word with frequently occurring letters in 5-letter English words. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N) are good choices. 

A classic strong opening word is ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters that might be in the secret word, helping us eliminate many possibilities in one go.

None of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word at all.

3. Only the first letter is unknown.  
4. The unknown letter must not appear in the forbidden list and must not be any of R, I, C, K (they are already placed).  

Remaining candidate letters for position 1 (alphabetical order of those not yet ruled out): D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, the only common English starting letters that make a valid word when combined with R I C K are:

- F → FRICK (valid, though rare)
- D → DRICK (obsolete spelling, not common)
- G → GRICK (Scottish term, uncommon)
- H → HRICK (not a valid English word)
- J → JRICK (invalid)
- M → MRICK (invalid)
- P → PRICK (valid and common)

Hence, the only reasonable candidate left is PRICK.
